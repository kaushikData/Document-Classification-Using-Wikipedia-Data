'''Tauheed Epps''' (born September 12, 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/09/13/video-2-chainz-gets-his-big-booty-birthday-wish/ |title=2 Chainz Gets His Big Booty Birthday Wish |website=Rap-Up.com|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsagents.net/index.php/content/content17/176-2-chainz |title=2 Chainz |website=Sportsagents.net |date= |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''2 Chainz''' (formerly '''Tity Boi'''), is an American rapper, songwriter, television personality, activist, and actor. Born and raised in [[College Park, Georgia]], he initially gained recognition for being one-half of the [[Southern hip hop]] duo [[Playaz Circle]], alongside his longtime friend and fellow rapper Earl "Dolla Boy" Conyers. The duo was signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper [[Ludacris]]' [[Disturbing tha Peace]] label, and are best known for their debut single "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]".

In February 2012, Epps signed a solo [[record deal]] with [[Def Jam Recordings]], an imprint of [[Universal Music Group]]. The following August, he released his debut studio album ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]]'', to mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/based-on-a-tru-story/2-chainz/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Based on a T.R.U. Story |website=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album spawned three successful singles: "[[No Lie (2 Chainz song)|No Lie]]," "[[Birthday Song]]," and "[[I'm Different (2 Chainz song)|I'm Different]]", all of which charted in the top 50 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and were certified Gold or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], along with the album being certified Gold. His second studio album ''[[B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time]]'' was released on September 11, 2013. It was supported by the singles "[[Feds Watching]]" and "[[Used 2]]". Mr. Chainz began working with the TV Network [[Viceland]] on a show called [[Most Expensivest]], which debuted its first episode on November 15, 2017, and is currently in its second season.

==Early life and education==
2 Chainz was born '''Tauheed Epps''' in [[College Park, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/2-chainz-might-run-for-mayor-of-college-park-georgia-2015281|title=2 Chainz Might Run for Mayor of College Park, Georgia: Rapper Gets Political|website=Us Weekly|first=Madeline|last=Boardman|date=January 28, 2015|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[North Clayton High School]], where he played basketball and graduated second in his class.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/2-chainz-is-no-donald-trump-fan.html|title=2 Chainz Is No Donald Trump Fan|website=The Daily Beast|first=Marlow|last=Stern|date=March 27, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in high school, he dealt [[marijuana]] and was arrested for felony [[cocaine]] possession when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; He later attended [[Alabama State University]] on a scholarship, and played on its basketball team from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tauheed-epps-1.html|title=Tauheed Epps|accessdate=July 4, 2017|work=S-R CBB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbooksounds/post/_/id/3120/how-good-was-2-chainz-at-basketball |website=espn.go.com |publisher=ESPN |title=How good was 2 Chainz at basketball? |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about longstanding rumors that he had graduated from Alabama State with a 4.0 GPA, which had been widely reported on many sources including [[Wikipedia]], 2 Chainz said: "Don't believe anything on Wack-ipedia. There's a lot of false stuff on there, to the point that every time I try to fix one thing, something else comes out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-suddenly-2-chainz-is-everywhere-20120813 | title=Five Reasons Why 2 Chainz Should Make A Presidential Bid | work=The Observer | date=September 25, 2012 | accessdate=January 10, 2016 | author=Vanessa Quilantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he transferred to [[Virginia State University]] due to circumstances he was reluctant to speak about.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; "I got into some trouble, went somewhere else, and came back. But I graduated, and that’s that. That was then," he said.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==Career==

===1997–2010: Playaz Circle and Disturbing tha Peace===
Epps formed the hip hop duo [[Playaz Circle]] (the word "Playaz" being a [[bacronym]] for "Preparing Legal Assets for Years from A to Z")&lt;ref name=dubmagazine&gt;{{cite web|title=Playaz Circle|url=http://dubmagazine.com/stars/musicians/410-playaz-circle|work=Dub Magazine|publisher=Dub Publishing |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[College Park, Georgia]] in 1997, with his high school friend Earl Conyers (known as Dolla Boy), while Epps adopted "Tity Boi" as his [[moniker]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio&gt;{{cite web |last=Cordor|first=Cyril|title=Playaz Circle – Biography|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/playaz-circle-p733429/biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of an [[Independent music|independent album]] titled ''United We Stand, United We Fall'' (2002),&lt;ref name=dubmagazine/&gt; the duo were introduced to fellow Atlanta rapper [[Ludacris]], when he moved into their College Park apartment complex, whilst he was acting as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt; After taking interest in Playaz Circle, Ludacris began to record several songs with the group, playing some of them on his [[radio station]].&lt;ref name=dubmagazine/&gt;

Ludacris soon became one of the highest-selling rappers in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt; After hearing of their situation, Ludacris requested of Epps that the duo join his newly formed record label [[Disturbing Tha Peace]], a subsidiary of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Epps agreed to sign, although Conyers did not officially join the label until his mother regained her health, a year after the initial signing.&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt;

Their debut album ''[[Supply &amp; Demand (Playaz Circle album)|Supply &amp; Demand]]'', was released on October 30, 2007. The [[lead single]] and their debut single, "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]", became an urban [[hit single]]. The song features [[Lil Wayne]], and was performed by the duo at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. The duo released their second studio album ''[[Flight 360: The Takeoff]]'', on September 29, 2009. In January 2010, Playaz Circle filmed a music video for their single "Big Dawg" [[featuring]] Lil Wayne and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] at Studio Space Atlanta. Shortly afterwards, Epps left Disturbing tha Peace, a move he claimed was taken in order to advance his career. Although Ludacris was initially reluctant to allow Epps to leave the label (as he felt Epps could still prove financially successful), he eventually accepted the decision.&lt;ref name=albumtitle&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Andres|title=2 Chainz Reveals Album Title, Speaks On Leaving Ludacris' Label|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19019/title.2-chainz-reveals-album-title-speaks-on-leaving-ludacris-label|work=HipHopDX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=May 20, 2012|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–12: Name change and ''Based on a T.R.U. Story''===
[[File:2 Chainz 2014 May.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Epps in 2013]]
Throughout Epps's career, critics and fans alike have speculated the [[pseudonym]] "Tity Boi" was meant to be derogatory towards women, although he repeatedly denied such accusations.&lt;ref name=vibenamechange&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Chainz Opens Up About Why He Was Named 'Tity Boi,' T.R.U.

REALigion,'' which became his first mixtape to appear on the music charts, peaking at number 58 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Chainz – Charts &amp; Awards – ''Billboard'' Albums|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/2-chainz-p2450987/charts-awards|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the success of the mixtape, Epps has made numerous [[guest appearance]]s on tracks by prominent recording artists such as&lt;ref name=vibenamechange/&gt; Kanye West ("[[Mercy (GOOD Music song)|Mercy]]") and Nicki Minaj ("[[Beez in the Trap]]").

On March 24, 2012, Epps announced his debut [[studio album]], whose title he had changed to ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]]'' from its original title of ''T.R.U. to My REALigion,''&lt;ref name=albumtitle/&gt; was set for an August 14, 2012, release date.&lt;ref name=boombox&gt;{{cite web|last=Bark|first=Theo|title=2 Chainz, 'Based on a T.R.U.

But we was talking and I think I was jeopardizing my brand sometimes by doing the homeboy special. So I think he felt like we should just put that out there that we ain't doing no more of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |title=2 Chainz Responds To G.O.O.D.

Epps began 2016 with the March release of a 12 record collaborative album with rapper [[Lil Wayne]] titled ''[[ColleGrove]]''.

He was due back in court on June 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/2-chainz-arrested-in-lax-for-possession-of-marijuana-and-promethazine/ |title=2 Chainz Arrested In LAX For Possession Of Marijuana And Promethazine – XXL |work=Xxlmag.com |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before midnight on August 21, 2013, Epps' tour bus was pulled over in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], because the passenger side taillights were out.  The arresting officer reported that he smelled marijuana and saw smoke through the open door of the bus after he had stopped and pulled over the bus. The driver of the bus shut the door and told officers he was not authorized to allow them on the bus. The officer said the [[marijuana]] smell gave him probable cause to search, but the driver refused to open the door. After many attempts to enter, the bus was towed with the men still aboard to the police training center in Oklahoma City. Officers obtained a search warrant and the 10 men, including Epps, got off the bus. Police discovered two semi-automatic pistols and a 12-gauge pump shotgun, along with some prescription painkillers and marijuana residue, on the tour bus according to papers filed [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] district Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MICHAEL MCNUTT mmcnutt@opubco.com • |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-police-found-weapons-painkillers-on-rappers-tour-bus-court-papers-show/article/3878935 |title=Oklahoma City police found weapons, painkillers on rapper's tour bus, court papers show |website=News OK |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adam of Barking''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1217?), was a [[Benedictine]] monk and religious poet who left a number of writings including ''De Serie Sex Ætatum'' which runs to 15,000 lines of [[hexameter]]. He belonged to the [[Sherborne Abbey|abbey of Sherborne]] in [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Rigg | first =A, G, | title =Barking, Adam of (fl. c.1176–c.1200), Benedictine monk and religious poet | work = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | publisher =Oxford University Press | date =2004 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89?docPos=217 | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adam of Barking is praised by the 16th-century antiquary [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] for his great erudition, and his promise as a writer both in prose and verse. According to [[John Bale]] and [[John Pitts (Catholic scholar)|John Pitts]], Adam was educated at Oxford, and was a model of all the Christian virtues. As old age came on he devoted himself more and more to the study of Scripture and the work of public preaching. For the latter task he seems to have been peculiarly fitted, and his biographers make special mention of his eloquence and zeal in lashing the vices of the people. Bale and Pitts say that he flourished about the year 1217, and this date may be fairly correct, as one of his works was dedicated to John, canon of Salisbury, who is doubtless to be identified with the far-famed [[John of Salisbury]] who died in 1180. 

Of Adam's writings, which embraced treatises on the Old Testament as well as the New, there were existing at Sherborne in Leland's time: ''De Naturâ divinâ et humanâ'' (verse), ''De Serie Sex Ætatum'' (verse), ''Super Quatuor Evangelia'' (prose). According to [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Tanner]] a manuscript of this author is to be found in the library of [[Clare College, Cambridge]]. The names of other works of his are enumerated by Pitts.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Archer | first =T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7090">'''''Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism''''' is a 2017 book about [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]] co-authored by Mark Hamm, a criminologist at [[Indiana State University]] and Ramon Spaaij, a sociologist at [[Victoria University, Australia]].

According to a  review in [[Times Higher Education]] that described ''Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism'' as an "genuinely indispensable study of today’s steadily increasing terrorist threat," the book's "pivotal contention" that the radicalization of lone wolf terrorists exhibits discernible patterns that include   
“the integration of personal and political grievances; an affinity with online sympathizers and/or extremist groups," and "triggering events that, oftentimes, cause a dramatic change in behavior”.&lt;ref name="FeldmanReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feldman|first1=Matthew|title=The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism (book review)|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-the-age-of-lone-wolf-terrorism-mark-s-hamm-and-ramon-spaaij-columbia-university-press#survey-answer|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hamm and Spaaij  constructed a database funded by the United States Department of Justice in which they identified 124 instances of [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorist]] attacks in the United States between 1940 and 2016; the list includes "about" 30 planned attacks that are known not to have been carrier out, or that have been identified as FBI [[sting operation]]s, or as hoaxes.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worth|first1=Katie|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common — And More Deadly|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=PBS Frontline|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hamm and Spaaij defined lone wolf terrorism narrowly; they required an attacker to be politically motivated, this excluded, for example, mass shooters such as Adam Lanza, whose motive appeared to be entirely personal.  And they had to have acted entirely alone, excluding cases like the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]] carried out by a married couple, and the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], carried out by a pair of brothers.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bojani|first1=Fatima|title=America’s lone-wolf terrorists are unpredictable in almost every regard—except one|url=https://qz.com/807997/lone-wolf-terrorists-gun-control-us/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Quartz|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MillettReview&gt; Kris Millett (2017): Hamm &amp; Spaaij
’s The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism and the prospect of a heterodox terrorism studies (book review), Critical Studies on Terrorism, DOI:10.1080/17539153.2017.1384154&lt;/ref&gt; Kris Millett (2017): Hamm &amp; Spaaij’s The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism and the prospect of a heterodox terrorism studies (book review), Critical Studies on Terrorism, DOI:10.1080/17539153.2017.1384154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MisReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=SinaiReview/&gt;. The tightness of this definition was widely criticized.&lt;ref name=MisReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=SinaiReview/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"/&gt; 

==Findings==
Hamm and Spaaij use data they compiled, and examinations of the lone wolf phenomenon by other researches to reach a series of conclusions.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"/&gt;

They conclude that lone wolf terrorist attacks are becoming more common in the United States, and that casualty tolls, both of injuries and of deaths, has risen steadily over the decades since 1940, and risen sharply in the 2010s.  They note that the lone wolf terrorist who killed the highest number of victims was [[Joseph Paul Franklin]] who carried out a series of attacks in which he targeted [[Black people|black]] and [[Jewish]] Americans.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt; They also show that in recent years lone wolves have more frequently targeted uniformed police and military personnel.&lt;ref name=MillettReview/&gt;

They conclude that although as of 2018, [[white supremacist]] ideologies continue to account for the largest share of attacks, but that [[jihadist]] motivation has risen rapidly.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;

They conclude that lone wolf terrorists are usually  unemployed, single, white males with a criminal record who tend to be older, to have less education, and more likely to have a record of mental illness than other violent criminals.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;  In particularly, they demonstrate that in recent years such recent attacks have followed incidents in which the lone wolf uses physical  violence against women.

Their data demonstrates that although explosives and guns were the most common weapons used by lone wolves from the 1940s through the 1980s, the use of guns has skyrocketed and they are now the weapon most commonly employed by lone wolf terrorists.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BojaniOne"/&gt;

They show that most lone wolves tell someone that they intend to carry out an attack.  From the 1940s through the end of the century 84% of lone wolves did so, since 76% have done so.&lt;ref name="DeadlyWorth"/&gt;

==Criticism of law enforcement==
Hamm and Spaaij single out FBI sting operations for special criticism.  Book reviewer Kris Millett praises their "devastatingly effective" use of data to "argue that those captured in the sting operations did not display the personal characteristics common to the radicalisation of lone wolf terrorists."&lt;ref name=MillettReview/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewer James Mills criticizes Hamm and Spaaij for using narrow criteria that eliminate lone wolf pairs such as [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik]] and the [[Tsarnaev brothers]] from inclusion on their list, even those they meet the definition in all other ways.  Mills also criticized their argument that lone wolf terrorism is  preventable since “violent radicalization is a social process involving behavior that can be observed, comprehended and modeled,” arguing that the influences on human action are complex and not easily modeled and predicted, while praising the author's date gathering.&lt;ref name=MisReview&gt; Mis, James, Mark. S. Hamm, and Ramón Spaaij. PRISM 7, no. 3 (2018): 134-35. https://www.jstor.org/stable/26470541&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Joshua Sinai points out that lone wolves may regard themselves as members of terrorist organizations on the grounds that they are carrying out orders broadcast on the internet by the leaders of such organizations, and argues that, pace Hamm and Spaaij, FBI "sting" operations have been effective in preventing terrorism, but praises the author's six-part model (p. 159 in book,) of personal and political grievance, affinity with online sympathizers 
or an extremist group, enabler, broadcasting intent, triggering event, and engaging in terrorism (p. 159).&lt;ref name=SinaiReview&gt; Sinai, Joshua, Mark S. Hamm, and Ramon Spaaij. Perspectives on Terrorism 11, no. 3 (2017): 81. http://www.jstor.org/stable/26297850.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alianore Holland, Countess of March''' (also spelt '''Eleanor'''; 13 October 1370 – October 1405) was the eldest daughter of [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]], and the wife of [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March]], [[heir presumptive]] to her uncle, King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. Through her daughter, [[Anne de Mortimer|Anne Mortimer]], she was the great-grandmother of the [[Yorkist]] kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. She was Governess to Queen consort [[Isabella of Valois]].

==Family==
Alianore Holland was born 13 October 1370&lt;ref name="Richardson III 2011 195"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Upholland]], Lancashire, the eldest child of [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]], and [[Alice Holland, Countess of Kent|Lady Alice FitzAlan]], the daughter of [[Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel|Richard de Arundel, 10th Earl of Arundel]], and his second wife, [[Eleanor of Lancaster]], daughter of [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], grandson of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|pp=496–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her paternal grandparents were [[Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent]], and [[Joan of Kent]], mother of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] by her third marriage to [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. As such, Alianore's father was a maternal half-brother to King Richard II.

Alianore had four brothers and six sisters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|pp=497–500}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey]], who married Joan Stafford, daughter of [[Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford]]
*John Holland (born 2 November 1374)
*Richard Holland (3 April 1376 – 21 May 1396)
*[[Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent]], who was reportedly betrothed to [[Constance of York]], widow of [[Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], and who married Lucy Visconti, youngest daughter of [[Bernabò Visconti]]
*Joan Holland, who married firstly, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York]]; secondly, William Willoughby, 5th Lord Willoughby; thirdly, [[Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham]]; and fourthly, Henry Bromflete, Baron Vescy.
*Eleanor Holland (the second of that name), who married [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury|Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury]]
*Margaret Holland, who married firstly, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], and secondly, [[Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence]]
*Elizabeth Holland, who married Sir John Neville of Sutton (in Gualtres), [[Yorkshire]]
*Anne Holland (b. 4 December 1389)
*Bridget (a nun)

==Marriages and issue==
[[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]], had died in 1381, leaving a 6-year-old son, Roger Mortimer, as heir to the vast Mortimer estates. According to Davies, the wardship of such an important heir was an 'issue of political moment in the years 1382–4', and eventually Mortimer's lands were granted to a consortium for £4000 per annum, and the guardianship of his person was initially granted to [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel]]. However at the behest of King Richard's mother, [[Joan of Kent]], in August 1384 Mortimer's wardship and marriage were granted, for 6000 marks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to Joan's son, [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]], and on or about 7 October 1388&lt;ref name="Richardson III 2011 195"/&gt; Kent married Mortimer to his daughter, Alianore.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

Roger Mortimer had a claim to the crown through his mother, [[Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster|Philippa Plantagenet]], daughter of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and granddaughter of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]. Since Richard II had no issue, Roger Mortimer, as his nephew and a lineal descendant of Edward III, was next in line to the throne. Cokayne states that in October 1385 Mortimer was proclaimed by the King as [[heir presumptive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was disputed by Davies who declared that the story that Richard publicly proclaimed Mortimer as heir presumptive in Parliament in October 1385 is baseless, although even Davies admitted the claim was openly discussed at the time.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was cleared up in 2006 when it was observed that the declaration took place in the parliament of 1386, not that of 1385, and had been dislodged by an interpolation in the Eulogium chronicle, and is supported by a reference in the Westminster Chronicle (see Ian Mortimer, 'Richard II and the Succession to the Crown', ''History'', vol. 91 (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;320–36).

Alianore and Roger Mortimer had two sons and two daughters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=450}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]]
*Roger (23 April 1393 – c. 1413)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=61}}; Although some sources state that Roger died c.1409, Pugh states that he was made a Knight of the Bath by Henry V on the eve of his coronation on 9 April 1413.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Anne de Mortimer|Anne]], who married [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]] (executed 1415)
*Eleanor, who married [[Sir Edward de Courtenay]] (d.1418), and had no issue

On 20 July 1398, at the age of 24, Roger Mortimer was slain in a skirmish with 'O'Brien's men' at [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies gives the place name as Kellinstown.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigmore chronicler says that he was riding in front of his army, unattended and wearing Irish garb, and that those who slew him did not know who he was. He was interred at [[Wigmore Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King went to Ireland in the following year to avenge Mortimer's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wigmore chronicler, while criticising Mortimer for lust and remissness in his duty to God, extols him as 'of approved honesty, active in knightly exercises, glorious in pleasantry, affable and merry in conversation, excelling his contemporaries in beauty of appearance, sumptuous in his feasting, and liberal in his gifts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|pp=449–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alianore and Roger Mortimer's young son, [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], succeeded his father in the title and claim to the throne, and he and his brother, Roger, were kept in custody by King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] until the end of his reign. However Alianore and Roger Mortimer's two daughters, Anne and Eleanor, were in their mother's care until her death in 1405.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|pp=77–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Griffiths, they were not well treated by the King, and were described as 'destitute' after her death in 1405.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 19 June 1399 Alianore married, as her second husband, the 'Welsh marcher lord', [[Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton]] (1371–1421), by whom she had two daughters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|pp=77–8}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=427–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Joan, who married [[John Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville]], brother of [[Thomas Grey (1384-1415)|Sir Thomas Grey]], executed for his part in the [[Southampton Plot]] which aimed to replace King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] with Alianore's son, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. Joan and her sister, Joyce, were co-heiresses in 1425 to their stepbrother, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March.
*Joyce, whom married [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft]].

==Death==
Eleanor died in childbirth in October 1405.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}; {{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=79}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|p=427}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}; Richardson gives two conflicting dates; on p. 427 he states that Alianore died on 23 October 1405, while on p. 195 he states that she died on 6 or 18 October.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was buried in [[Bisham Abbey|Bisham Priory]], Bisham.

Her descendants through her daughter, Anne, include the [[Yorkist]] Kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and [[Anne Bourchier, 7th Baroness Bourchier]].

[[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth (last) [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliph]] and first [[Imamah (Shia)|Shia Imam]] was assassinated by a ''[[Kharijite]]'' called [[Ibn Muljam]] on 26 January 661 at the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]], in present-day [[Iraq]]. Ali, who was then 62 or 63 years of age, died  due to his injuries two days after Ibn Muljam struck him on his head by a poison-coated sword, on the 21 (or 19) [[Ramadan]] 40 [[Islamic calendar#Numbering the year|AH]] (28 January 661 [[common era|CE]]).&lt;ref name="Brill-ali"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=ʿAlī b.

Ali became the caliph after the assassination of [[Uthman]] in 656. However he faced opposition from some factions including the [[Levant]] governor, [[Muawiyah I]]. A civil war, called the [[First Fitna]], took place within the early Islamic state which resulted in the overthrow of the [[Rashidun]] [[caliph]]s and the establishment of the [[Umayyad dynasty]]. It began when the caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] [[Siege of Uthman|was assassinated]] in 656 and continued through the four-year reign of Ali.&lt;ref name="Brill-Muawiya"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Muʿāwiya I | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] | publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] | accessdate=21 September 2014 | author=[[Martin Hinds]] | edition=2nd | URL=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/mu-a-wiya-i-SIM_5279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After [[Ali]] agreed to arbitration with Muawiyah I following the [[Battle of Siffin]] (657), a revolt happened against him by some members of his army, later known as [[Khawarij|Kharijites]] ("those who leave").&lt;ref name=higgins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higgins|first1=Annie C.|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Richard C.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World v.1|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan|chapter=Kharijites, Khawarij}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|390}} They killed some of Ali's supporters, but they were crushed by Ali's forces at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]] in July 658.&lt;ref name="Madelung"&gt;{{cite book|last = Madelung|first = Wilferd|authorlink = Wilferd Madelung|title = The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.cambridge.org/au/academic/subjects/history/middle-east-history/succession-muhammad-study-early-caliphate|year = 1997|isbn = 978-0-521-64696-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|260–261}}

Ibn Muljam met up with two other Kharijites namely al-Burak ibn Abd Allah and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi at [[Mecca]], and concluded that the situation of the Muslims at the time was due to the errors of Ali, Muawiah and [[Amr ibn As]], governor of [[Egypt]]. They decided to kill the three in order to resolve the "deplorable situation" of their time and also avenge their companions killed at Nahrawan. Aiming to kill Ali, Ibn Muljam headed toward Kufa where he fell in love with a woman whose brother and father had died at Nahrawan. She agreed to marry him if only he could kill Ali. Consequently, Ali was stabbed by Ibn Muljam at the Great Mosque of Kufa. After Ali's death, Ibn Muljam was executed in retaliation by [[Hasan ibn Ali]].&lt;ref name="Brill-ibn Muljam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Veccia Vaglieri |first=Laura|authorlink=Laura Veccia Vaglieri|title=Ibn Muld̲j̲am.|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=3 June 2016 |publisher=Brill Online |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-muldjam-COM_0339| archiveurl=|archivedate=| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Events leading to Ali's assassination trace back to the death of [[Muhammad]], [[prophet of Islam]], where the community of Muslims disputed over [[succession of Muhammad|his succession]] as the leader of [[Ummah]]. The assembly at the [[Saqifah#Significance of Saqifah|Saqifat Bani Saida]] [[Bay'ah|gave allegiance]] to [[Abu Bakr]] as the caliph.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|30–32}} While [[Sunni muslims]] believed that Muhammad had not selected a successor, Shia Muslims believed that Ali was appointed as Muhmmad's successor by God referring to [[the event of Ghadir Khumm]].&lt;ref name="Dakake"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dakake|first1=Maria Massi|title=The charismatic community : Shiʻite identity in early Islam|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-7034-3|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-4408-the-charismatic-community.aspx|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43–48}}&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first = Chase F.|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/new-cambridge-history-islam|title=The New Cambridge History of Islam|publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193–194}} Abu Bakr was succeeded by [[Umar]], who was murdered in 644. After Umar's death, Ali, the [[cousin]] and son-in-law of Muhammad, and Uthman were contenders for the post. Uthman was [[Election of Uthman|elected]] as caliph by an [[Shura|election council]]. Ali became the caliph after the [[Siege of Uthman|assassination of Uthman]] in 656.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|203–204}}

Ali's caliphate was coincident with [[First Fitna]].&lt;ref name="Brill-Muawiya"/&gt; Though Ali was elected as the fourth ''[[Rashidun]]'' (the "rightly guided") caliph five days after Uthman's death, he faced opposition during his rule. On one hand, [[A'isha]], [[Talhah]] and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Al-Zubayr]] revolted against him in [[Mecca]] and on the other hand Muawiyah I, the [[Umayyad]] governor of [[Levant]], refused to pledge allegiance to him as the new caliph. Therefore, a civil war about succession to the office of the caliphate took place. Ali's opponents asked the killers of Uthman should be punished. Ali, first emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Camel]] in 656, against an army primarily led by Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] and other [[sahaba]]. Then, Ali also fought the Battle of Siffin in 657 against Muawiyah. The battle ended in a stalemate with Ali entering into arbitration with Muawiyah.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|203–204}}

A group of Ali's army, later known as [[Kharijites]] or Khawarij ("those who leave"), opposed against arbitration after the battle of Siffin, when he accepted arbitration with Mu'awiya. They opposed to human judgement in the matter of religion and used "Judgment belongs to God alone," as their slogan.&lt;ref name="higgins"/&gt;{{rp|390}} In 658 they violated their oath of allegiance, revolted and openly threatened to kill any Muslim who would not join them. Ali defeated them at the Battle of Nahrawan. The killing of the Kharijites  was "the most problematic event" during Ali's caliphate, because they had been among his most vigorous allies in the war against Muawiah.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|261}}

Ibn Muljam along with two other men, namely al-Burak ibn Abd Allah and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi, all considered as belonging to Kinda, met at Mecca and had a long discussion after the pilgrimage ceremony. They concluded that the situation of Muslims at the time was due to Ali, Muʿawiya and [[Amr ibn al-As]], "whom they regarded as being in error", and swore to kill them to also "avenge their companion's massacred at al-Nahrawan." They arranged the date of assassination and each of them chose his victim.&lt;ref name="Islamica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Faramarz Haj|first1=Manouchehri|last2=Matthew|first2=Melvin-Koushki|last3=Shah-Kazemi|first3=Reza|last4=Bahramian|first4=Ali|last5=Pakatchi|first5=Ahmad|last6=Muhammad Isa|first6=Waley|last7=Daryoush|first7=Mohammad|last8=Tareh|first8=Masoud|last9=Brown|first9=Keven|last10=Jozi|first10=Mohammad Reza|last11=Sajjadi|first11=Sadeq|last12=Gholami|first12=Rahim|last13=Bulookbashi|first13=Ali A.|last14=Negahban|first14=Farzin|last15=Alizadeh|first15=Mahbanoo|last16=Gholami|first16=Yadollah|title=ʿAlī b.

== Death ==
[[File:Kufa Mosque.jpg|thumb|Ali was praying at the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] when he was assassinated.]]

===Assassination===
Ali was assassinated by Ibn Muljam, a [[Kharijite]] from [[Egypt]], at the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]], located in Kufa, Iraq, on 26 January 661. Ibn Muljam was of [[Himyar]] paternally but was counted among the Murad due to his maternal kinship, and allied with the Banii Jabala of [[Kindah]]. He had entered Kufa with the aim of killing Ali to avenge the Kharijite leaders at [[al-Nahrawan]].&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|308}}

In Kufa, he encountered a group of people from ''Taym al-Ribab'' tribe who were mourning ten of their tribemates killed at Nahrawan by Ali's army. Among them was a woman named Quttaam.&lt;ref name="Brill-ibn Muljam"/&gt; According to cleric [[Ali al-Sallabi]], on seeing Quttaam, he "lost his senses" and "forgot the assignment" for which he was roaming, and proposed to her. Quttaam said that she would marry him if he could "heal" her by giving her three thousand [[dinars]], a chanteuse, a male slave and the death of Ali. Quttaam wanted revenge too as her father and brother had been killed by Ali's forces at Al-Nahrawan. Ibn Muljam persuaded a man called Shubayb to assist him in killing Ali.&lt;ref name="Sallabi"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Ali al-Sallabi]]|title=Biography of Ali ibn Abi Talib|publisher=Darussalam Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} Besides Shablb ibn Bujra, Wardan ibn al-Mujalid also were Ibn Muljam's accomplice.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|308}} The conspirators stationed themselves opposite the door from which Ali would enter the Mosque.&lt;ref name="Brill-ibn Muljam"/&gt;

On Friday, 19 (or 17&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|308}}) Ramadan, Ali entered Kufa mosque to perform the morning prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein | title=Ali | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year=2007|accessdate=11 March 2015|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005712/Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Poonawala |first=I.

He fled and was caught near the gates of Kinda by 'Uwaymir', but could finally escape through the crowd. Wardan ran away to his home and was killed there by a relative, "'Abd Allah b. Najaba b. Ubayd, after confessing his involvement." Ibn Muljam was caught by the [[Hashimite]] al-Mughlra ibn Nawfal ibn al-Harith.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|309}}

===The role of Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays===
[[al-Ash'ath ibn Qays]] was the chief of [[Kindah|Kindah tribe]] in Kufa.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|83}} According to [[Wilferd Madelung]], in the final years of Ali's reign he had tendency towards Muawiah and received letter including offers of money from him to show reluctance about Ali's campaign against Muawiah.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|276}} Some sources have accused al-Ash'ath of being informed of the plot of the assassination of Ali.&lt;ref name="Brill-ibn Muljam"/&gt; According to [[al-Yaqubi]], Ibn Muljam was hosted by al-Ash'ath for a month when Ibn Muljam had been preparing his sword. Another report by [[Ibn Sa'd]] says that al-Ash'ath stayed the night of the killing at mosque counseling Ibn Muljam and that al-Ash'ath signaled the time of attempting the assassination by saying "the morning has smiled." &lt;ref name="Sallabi"/&gt; The majority of the sources narrates an ambiguous phrase from Al-Ash'ath:"the dawn has risen for thee" and those who has Shia tendency give it as a clear encouragement to Ibn Muljam: "Deliverance, deliverance! The dawn has risen for thee." After assassination, [[Hujr ibn 'Adi]] accused him for Ali's murder. There is even a report which says he warned Ali about Ibn Muljam. According to [[Laura Veccia Vaglieri]], the sources narrate different reports which vary from outright accusation to a suspicion of complicity and even to an act of loyalty.&lt;ref name="Brill-ibn Muljam"/&gt;

However al-Sallabi believes that these accusations against al-Ash'ath seem baseless as he was a loyalist and was against Kharijites from the time they first appeared and fought them at Nahrawan. He was also the first one to fight against the people of Syria in the [[Battle of Siffin|battle for the water]]. Moreover, he believes there exists no narration from the family of Ali ibn Abi Talib supporting these accusations against al-Ash'ath, neither his family did not discuss it with any member of al-Ash'ath's family.&lt;ref name="Sallabi"/&gt; After Ali was injured by Ibn Muljam, al-Ashʿath sent his son to determine  Ali's condition, his words suggesting that he knew Ali would not survive.&lt;ref name="Islamica"/&gt;

===Death and burial===
Ali ordered that if he died from the wound, Ibn Muljam had to be executed in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kelsay|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali died two days later on 21 Ramadan 40/30 January 661 (or 19 Ramadan 40/28 January 661) at the age of 62 or 63,&lt;ref name="Brill-ali" /&gt; and Ibn Muljam was killed in retaliation ([[Qisas]]) by Hasan ibn Ali, in accordance with Ali's instruction.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|309}}&lt;ref name="Al-Islam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/articles/life-commander-faithful-ali-ibn-abu-talib|last=Abbas|first=Ali|title=The Life of the Commander of the Faithful Ali Ibn Abu Talib (as)|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali's body was washed by his sons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] and one of his nephew, [[Abdullah ibn Ja'far]]. Then secretly buried by those men and [['Ubaydullah ibn al-Abbas]],  since it was feared that his body would be "exhumed and profaned".&lt;ref name="Brill-ali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|309}} Some sources claim Ali was buried at the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] at [[Najaf]] in present-day Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reza Shah-Kazemi|title=Ali ibn Abu Talib| encyclopedia= Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-96691-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} while others, usually Afghans, say he was buried at the [[Rawze-e-Sharif]] in the Afghan city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BALKH AND MAZAR-e-SHARIF|last=Harold|first=Frank |url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/balkh.html|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's death is commemorated by Shia Muslims every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=J. Gordon Melton, editor, with James A. Beverley, Christopher Buck, Constance A.|title=Religious celebrations : an encyclopedia of holidays, festivals, solemn observances, and spiritual commemorations|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lD_2J7W_2hQC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=commemoration+of+ali%27s+death&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=orFoq3pCro&amp;sig=1jtt2WQBL2ItBt57NNYoy1csHjI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOy82jh_DMAhWKWywKHZVRBVQQ6AEISjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=commemoration%20of%20ali's%20death&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-59884-205-0|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ali's prediction of his fate===
Two types of traditions exist regarding Ali's awareness of his fate long before the assassination. This foreknowledge was through his own "premonition of it" or by Muhammad. Based on numerous traditions, Ali's beard staining with "blood flowing from his head" had been revealed by Muhammad or Ali. Another set of traditions by Muhammad says that "the most evil man among the ancients was he who had killed the camel of [[Saleh|the prophet Salih]] and among his contemporaries, he who would kill Ali." The night of the assassination, Ali said that his fate was about to come true, and when he left home in the morning, "[[geese]] followed him, cackling" weeping for his funeral, as he said later.&lt;ref name="Brill-ibn Muljam"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
According to Wilferd Madelung, a small minority of people were convinced that "he was the best of Muslims after the Prophet and the only one entitled to rule them," and after Ali's death people were divided regarding their view toward him. "Distrust of, and opposition to, Mu'awiya and his Syrian cohorts" was what united the majority. Ali's admirers then turned into majority due to "highhandedness, misrule and repression" of Umayyad.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;{{rp|309}}

After Ali's death, the Shias of Iraq declared Ali's eldest son Hasan the successor to Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan was not interested in becoming caliph, and to prevent further bloodshed, he signed the [[Hasan–Muawiya treaty]] and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the [[Umayyad caliphate]]. Muawiyah died in [[Medina]] at the age of forty-five in 669, and was succeeded by [[Yazid I]] in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother [[Husayn ibn Ali]] refused to accept Yazid's leadership. After being invited by the Shiites of Iraq in the same year, Husayn started his march to Iraq. However, during their stay at [[Karbala]], his family was massacred by Yazid at the [[Battle of Karbala]] on 10 [[Muharram]] (10 October)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1987|title=Extremist Shiites: The Ghulat Sects|first=Matti|last= Moosa|isbn=978-0-8156-2411-0|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his death is [[Mourning of Muharram|commemorated]] by Shia, while remembered by nearly all Muslims every year during Muharram paying tribute to the grandson of Muhammad's grandson and family's brutal assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan E.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=commemoration+of+husayn+ibn+ali%27s+death|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martyrdom of Imam Ali - By Yousef Abdinejad.jp.jpg|thumb|340px|''Martyrdom of Imam Ali'' by Yousef Abdinejad]]
The incident had been subjects of paintings by Yousef Abdinejad,&lt;ref name="KhabarOnline"/&gt; Farhad Sadeghi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Assault on Ali' painting gets featured in Sa'd Abad artifacts museum on the night of Qadr|url=http://sadmu.ir/detail/992|website=[[Sa'dabad Complex|Sa'd Abad]] Cultural-historical complex|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Masnsoureh Hossein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A painting on 'The Assault on Ali' is unveiled|url=http://www.iqna.ir/fa/news/1891121|accessdate=24 December 2017|agency=International Quran News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a stageplay by [[Bahram Beyzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicartz.com/story/0yfbXkSE6M6MVqdXNMwJgWQDpkkrD4b6hLaI6r9k6sI|title=The 'Assault on Ali' stageplay by Bahram Beizayi is on|website=www.islamicartz.com|language=fa-IR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdinejad's work is described as showing a "duality" by using colors. Colors of blue spectra, which is "proportional" to turquoise color used for painting Ali, light beams arising from Imam Ali's body and the angles are among the elements used by the painter to inspire a sort of spirituality. On the other hand, Ibn Muljam, the assassin, is painted in brown surrounded by the blue colors and some evil creatures are seen on his feet. There's a flame arising from the body of Ibn Muljam which the painter has used to demonstrate the destiny of the assassin. i.e hell fire. The imprint of ''[[Turbah|Mohr]]'' is seen on the forehead of the assassin.&lt;ref name="KhabarOnline"&gt;{{cite news|title=An analysis on 'The Assault on Ali'  painting|url=http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/365874/weblog/zaferanlo|accessdate=23 December 2017|work=khabaronline|language=fa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224080533/http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/365874/weblog/zaferanlo|archive-date=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20308">In [[embryology]], '''cleavage''' is the division of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the early [[embryo]]. The process follows fertilization, with the transfer being triggered by the activation of a [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2000|title=An Introduction to Early Developmental Processes|journal=Developmental Biology |edition=6th|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9992/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[zygote]]s of many species undergo rapid [[cell cycle]]s with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called [[blastomere]]s and form a compact mass called the [[morula]]. Cleavage ends with the formation of the [[blastula]].

Depending mostly on the amount of [[yolk]] in the egg, the cleavage can be '''holoblastic''' (total or entire cleavage) or '''meroblastic''' (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the [[vegetal pole]] while the opposite is referred to as the [[animal pole]].

Cleavage differs from other forms of [[cell division]] in that it increases the number of cells  and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|journal=Biological Physics of the Developing Embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&amp;pg=PA27|author1=Forgács, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.|bibcode=2005bpde.book.....F|doi=10.2277/0521783372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the [[cyclin]]s and their associated [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (cdk). The complex [[Cyclin B]]/[[CDK1]] a.k.a. MPF ([[maturation promoting factor]]) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of [[karyokinesis]] (mitosis) and [[cytokinesis]] work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a [[central spindle]] and polar [[Aster (cell biology)|aster]]s made up of polymers of [[tubulin]] protein called [[microtubules]]. The asters are nucleated by [[centrosomes]] and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the [[contractile ring]] made up of polymers of [[actin]] protein called [[microfilaments]]. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the [[Midblastula|midblastula transition]] and appears to be controlled by the [[NC ratio|nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio]] (about 1/6).

== Types of cleavage ==

=== Determinate ===

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most [[protostome]]s.  It results in the developmental fate of the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] being set early in the [[embryo]] [[morphogenesis|development]]. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete [[embryo]].

=== Indeterminate ===

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of [[deuterostome]]s – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

=== Holoblastic ===

In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in [[isolecithal]] cells (cells with a small even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate amount of yolk in a gradient) – '''bilateral''' holoblastic, '''radial''' holoblastic, '''rotational''' holoblastic, and '''spiral''' holoblastic, cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.1767 |title=Early Development of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=Developmental Biology|edition=6th |accessdate=2007-09-17 |format= |year=2000 |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

* Bilateral
: The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

* Radial
: Radial cleavage is characteristic of the [[deuterostomes]], which include some [[vertebrate]]s and [[echinoderm]]s, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the [[oocyte]].

* Rotational
: Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

: [[Mammal]]s display rotational cleavage, and an [[isolecithal]] distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small amount of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

: The [[nematode]] [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']], a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Developmental biology| edition=11th| author=Gilbert SF| year=2016| pages=268| publisher=Sinauer| isbn=9781605354705}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spiral
: Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the [[lophotrochozoa]]n taxa, referred to as [[Spiralia]].&lt;ref name=Shankland&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10781038 |pmc=34316 |jstor=122407 |bibcode=2000PNAS...97.4434S |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.9.4434|title = Evolution of the bilaterian body plan: What have we learned from annelids?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=4434–7 |year = 2000|last1 = Shankland|first1 = M.|last2=Seaver |first2=E.

Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo.

It will be specified after the formation of the third quartet of micromeres. Unequal cleavage occurs in two ways: asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle, or through the formation of a polar lobe (PL).]]

: Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during [[oogenesis]], the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant.&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt; The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian.&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt; Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

: In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere.&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt; After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo.&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt; This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt;

: In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere.&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt; Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle.&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt; This occurs when the [[aster (cell biology)|aster]] at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole.&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt; This results in an unequal [[cytokinesis]], in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region.&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt; The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe.&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt; This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere.&lt;ref name= Boyer/&gt;&lt;ref name= Freeman/&gt; The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.&lt;ref name= Lambert/&gt;

=== Meroblastic ===

In the presence of a large amount of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are '''discoidal''' and '''superficial'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/eduweb/virtualembryo/currentnotes.html |title=Current Notes |accessdate=2007-09-17 |website=}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Discoidal
: In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in [[monotremes]], [[birds]], [[reptiles]], and [[fish]] that have [[telolecithal]] egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

* Superficial
: In superficial cleavage, [[mitosis]] occurs but not [[cytokinesis]], resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in [[arthropods]] that have [[centrolecithal]] egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology 11th edition.

== Placentals ==

[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|300px|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]].]]

Differences exist between the cleavage in [[placentalia|placental mammals]] and the cleavage in other animals. Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly [[cell adhesion|adhere]] in a process known as compaction.&lt;ref name="Nikas"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nikas |first1=G |last2=Ao |first2=A |last3=Winston |first3=RM |last4=Handyside |first4=AH |title=Compaction and surface polarity in the human embryo in vitro. |journal=Biology of Reproduction |date=July 1996 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=32–7 |pmid=8793055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikas G, Ao A, Winston RM, Handyside AH |title=Compaction and surface polarity in the human embryo in vitro |journal=Biol. Reprod. |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=32–7 |date=July 1996 |pmid=8793055 |doi= 10.1095/biolreprod55.1.32|url=http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/55/1/32.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for [[genetic testing]].&lt;ref name="Wilton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilton |first1=L |title=Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and chromosome analysis of blastomeres using comparative genomic hybridization. |journal=Human Reproduction Update |date=NaN |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–41 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh050 |pmid=15569702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the [[trophoblast]] cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called compaction. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the [[chorion]]. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the [[inner cell mass]] (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some [[extraembryonic membrane]]s. At this stage, the embryo is called a [[blastocyst]].

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''coronach''' (also written '''coranich''', '''corrinoch''', '''coranach''', '''cronach''', etc.) is the Scottish Gaelic equivalent of the Goll,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purser|first=John|title=Scotland's Music|year=1981|publisher=Mainstream|pages=296–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the third part of a round of [[keening]], the traditional improvised singing at a death, wake or funeral in the [[Highlands of Scotland]] and in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ó Madagáin|first=Breandán|title=Caointe agus Seancheolta Eile / Keening and other old Irish music|year=2005|publisher=Cló Iar-Chonnachta|pages=14 &amp; 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though observers have reported hearing such songs in Ireland or in the Scottish Highlands, and melodies have been noted down and printed since the 18th century, audio recordings are rare; not only was the practice dying out or being suppressed through the 19th century, but it was also considered by its practitioners to have been a very personal and spiritual practice, not suitable for performance or recording.

The Scottish border ballad ''[[The Bonny Earl of Murray]]'' is supposedly composed in the tradition of the coronach.

[[Schubert]]'s Opus 52 No 4 (D 836) set words from [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Lady of the Lake]]'' under the title ''Coronach'', for female choir with piano accompaniment. 

==In popular culture==
*[[Progressive rock]] group [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] released, with [[Dee_Palmer|David Palmer]], a single called "Coronach" in 1986. The single was used as the theme tune to the [[Channel 4]] programme "The Blood Of The British".
*[[Melodic death metal]] band [[Eternal Tears of Sorrow]] have a song entitled "Coronach" on their 1998 album, ''[[Vilda Mánnu]]''.
*[[Death metal]] band [[Hate Eternal]] have an instrumental song entitled "Coronach" as the last song on their 2008 album, ''Fury and Flames''.

'''Count Noble''' (August 1, 1879 - January 20, 1891) was a male [[Llewellin Setter]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;'Llewellin Setter' is a name sometimes used to describe a specific strain of working English Setter.[http://www.englishsetterassociation.co.uk/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was so well known that when he died in 1891, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an obituary.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{Cite news | title = Death of Count Noble - A Famous Setter Dog Expires Near Pittsburg.| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = January 22, 1891| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/01/22/106046346.pdf| archiveurl=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/pdf/201101/20110123obit_sewickley_dog_1891.pdf|archivedate = 2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was popularly known as the "$10,000 hunting dog."&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  He was described as a "national symbol of what was great in bird dogs."&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Frederick Wilson.jpg|thumb|right|Benjamin Frederick Wilson, Count Noble's owner]]
His owner, Captain Benjamin Frederick Wilson, was a banker and coal barge operator.&lt;ref name=pg&gt;{{Cite news| last = Pitz| first =Marylynne| title = Honoring Count Noble, the 'Man O'War of English setters'| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date = January 23, 2011| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11023/1119853-51.stm| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was well known for his hunting prowess and show skills, it was his prepotency, the ability to pass on his best traits to his progeny, that made him the most famous.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  In 1880, he won the national amateur Derby dog show.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;  He was so famous that owners of other setters refused to compete in shows with him.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;  Other shows offered special inducements in order to encourage his owner to compete.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

Writing in 1904, Joseph A. Graham gives this description of Count Noble: "A large white-black-tan dog, long in the body and not considered a well proportioned setter. He weighed sixty pounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Joseph A.|title=The Sporting Dog ... With Many Illustrations|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan Company|location=New York|page=61|url=https://archive.org/stream/sportingdog00grah#page/60/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portrait of Count Noble by Edmund Osthaus hangs in the first-floor reading room of the [[Duquesne Club]].&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;

Following his death, his [[Taxidermy|preserved]] body was displayed in the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in a scene showing him hunting [[quail]].&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  The display was moved to [[The National Bird Dog Museum]] in Tennessee.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;

In 2011, [[American Kennel Club]] judge Richard LeBeau began an effort to raise $2,000 to establish a [[historical marker]] honoring Count Noble outside [[Osborne Elementary School]], which stands on the site of Wilson's former home.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;

'''DNV GL''' is an international [[accredited registrar]] and [[classification society]] headquartered in [[Høvik]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30492838|title=The Norwegian firm that tests the world's ships|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|last1=Smale|first1=Will|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211232249/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30492838|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company currently has about 14,500 employees and 350 offices operating in more than 100 countries, and provides services for several industries including maritime, renewable energy, oil &amp; gas, electrification, food &amp; beverage and healthcare. It was created in 2013 as a result of a merger between two leading organizations in the field - '''[[Det Norske Veritas]]''' ([[Norway]]) and '''[[Germanischer Lloyd]]''' ([[Germany]]).

DNV GL is the world's largest classification society, providing services for 13,175 vessels and mobile offshore units (MOUs) amounting to 265.4 mill gt, which represents a global market share of 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DNV GL to unveil rules this year|url=http://www.tankeroperator.com/news/dnv-gl-to-unveil-rules-this-year/6356.aspx|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Tanker Operator|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217015133/http://www.tankeroperator.com/news/dnv-gl-to-unveil-rules-this-year/6356.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the largest technical consultancy and supervisory to the global renewable energy (particularly wind, wave, tidal and solar) and oil &amp; gas industry - 65% of the world’s offshore pipelines are designed and installed to DNV GL’s technical standards.

Prior to the merger, both DNV and GL have independently acquired several companies in different sectors, such as ''Hélimax Energy'' (Canada), ''Garrad Hassan'' (UK), ''Windtest'' (Germany) and ''[[KEMA]]'' (Netherlands), which now contribute to DNV GL's expertise across several industries. In addition to providing services such as technical assessment, certification, risk management and software development, DNV GL also invests heavily in research.

[[Remi Eriksen]] took over as Group President and CEO of DNV GL on August 1, 2015, succeeding [[Henrik O. Madsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/remi-eriksen-proud-and-confident|title=Remi Eriksen: Proud and Confident|author=|date=|website=maritime-executive.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043832/http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/remi-eriksen-proud-and-confident|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Coat of arms of the Norwegian Veritas.png|thumb|120px|Veritas's coat of arms]]
DNV GL's history dates back to 1864, when Det Norske Veritas was established in Norway to head technical inspection and evaluation of Norwegian merchant vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edumaritime.com/marine-classification-risk-career/det-norske-veritas-dnv|title=Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL) - Careers in Marine Classification Industry|author=|date=|website=www.edumaritime.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227011057/http://www.edumaritime.com/marine-classification-risk-career/det-norske-veritas-dnv|archivedate=27 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Germanischer Lloyd was founded in Hamburg around the same period in 1867 by a group of 600 ship owners, ship builders and insurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spotlight on Germanischer Lloyd |url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/2007-09-13spotlight-on-germanischer-lloyd |accessdate=22 February 2015 |publisher=Maritime Executive |date=2 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222175134/http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/2007-09-13spotlight-on-germanischer-lloyd |archivedate=22 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNV GL celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30492838 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810102825/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30492838 |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }} BBC News - The Norwegian firm that tests the world's ships&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent Det Norske Veritas Foundation owned 63.5% of DNV GL shares and [[Mayfair Vermögensverwaltung]] 36.5%.until December 2017, when Mayfair sold its shares to the Det Norske Veritas Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnvgl.com/news/the-foundation-det-norske-veritas-assumes-full-ownership-of-dnv-gl-and-remains-committed-to-maritime-headquarters-in-hamburg-105746|title=The Foundation Det Norske Veritas assumes full ownership of DNV GL|last=|first=|date=2017-12-14|website=DNV GL|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216023145/https://www.dnvgl.com/news/the-foundation-det-norske-veritas-assumes-full-ownership-of-dnv-gl-and-remains-committed-to-maritime-headquarters-in-hamburg-105746|archive-date=2017-12-16|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-12-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Bureau Veritas]] and [[American Bureau of Shipping]], DNV GL is one of the three major companies in the classification business with 300 offices in 100 different countries. But the company is also a key player in strategic innovation and risk management for several other industries including renewable energy (particularly in wind and solar), oil and gas, electric power generation and distribution, petrochemicals, aviation, automotives, finance, food and beverage, healthcare, software and information technology.

==Research==
Every year, DNV GL invests heavily in R&amp;D which amounts to 5% of its total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheam|first1=Jessica|title=Longevity of a business lies in sustainability|url=http://www.eco-business.com/news/longevity-business-lies-sustainability-interview-dnv-gl-ceo-henrik-madsen/|accessdate=18 February 2015|publisher=Eco-business.com|date=5 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218220157/http://www.eco-business.com/news/longevity-business-lies-sustainability-interview-dnv-gl-ceo-henrik-madsen/|archivedate=18 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1864, DNV GL has always maintained a department dedicated to research that enhances and develops services, rules and standards for various industries. Many of the innovations and findings by DNV have often been used as a basis for international standards.

At present, the main research programs include arctic operations, biological hazards, future energy solutions, technology and information processes, maritime technology and transport systems, as well as multifunctional materials.

'''''Dark Souls II'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|ダークソウルII|Dāku Sōru Tsū}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Bandai Namco Games]]. The third game in the [[Souls (series)|''Souls'' series]], it was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].

Although both are set in the same universe, there is no direct story connection between the first ''[[Dark Souls]]'' and the sequel.&lt;ref name="polygon - 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/12/19/3783452/dark-souls-2-staff-discuss-the-vga-trailer-and-what-having-real|title=Dark Souls 2 developer: If Dark Souls was set in the North Pole, this one would be in the South Pole|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|first=Kevin|last=Gifford|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses dedicated multiplayer servers.&lt;ref name="polygon - 1"/&gt; Taking place in the kingdom of Drangleic, the game features both [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) gameplay, in addition to having some [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] components. As in the earlier games in the series, it again features challenging gameplay, but with a more powerful graphics engine and more advanced [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] system.

After some initial delays, the game was released worldwide in March 2014, with the Microsoft Windows version being released on April 24, 2014.&lt;ref name="ign.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/02/25/titanfall-and-dark-souls-ii-both-launch-march-11th/ | title='Titanfall' And 'Dark Souls II' Both Launch March 11th | publisher=Forbes | accessdate=May 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524033959/http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/02/25/titanfall-and-dark-souls-ii-both-launch-march-11th/ | archivedate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated version of the game, subtitled '''''Scholar of the First Sin''''', was released for [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]] and Microsoft Windows in April 2015. The title is a compilation of the original game and all of its [[downloadable content]] with upgraded graphics, expanded online multiplayer capacity, and various other changes. A sequel, ''[[Dark Souls III]]'', was released in 2016.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Dark Souls II - Crown of the Ivory King Trailer.webm|thumb|Gameplay from Crown of the Ivory King (trailer)]]

''Dark Souls II'' retains similar mechanics from its predecessors in the ''Souls'' series. Being known for its difficulty, both [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] and standard enemies have the potential to kill the player in only a few hits.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM2dDF4B9a4 |title=Extra Credits - The True Genius of Dark Souls II - How to Approach Game Difficulty |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad play is punished severely by most enemies, opportunities for recovering [[health (gaming)|health]] are limited, and as in ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', each time upon death, the player's maximum health is reduced (to a certain lower limit) until the player expends a rare item to reverse it. The game uses a form of joint currency called "souls", which are used as both experience points for leveling up and also as currency for purchasing items from shops. Upon death, the player's entire collection of souls are dropped; the player can recover their dropped souls by returning to the spot where they died, but if they die before picking them up, the souls are permanently lost.

The [[multiplayer]] in ''Dark Souls II'' uses the same format as its predecessors; players have the choice between co-operative play in the form of being "summoned" into another player's game world, or [[player-versus-player]] through "invading" other worlds. Both forms of multiplayer occur pseudo-randomly, although matchmaking formulas are used to pair characters at similar levels together.

The game allows its difficulty to be adjusted by mechanics built into the game.  The game designers placed certain [[Item (gaming)|items]] early in the game allowing newer players higher basic damage and defense than they would normally have at that point.  For more experienced players, the designers placed higher skill cap items early that do more damage if executed correctly.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;  Other penalties, such as the health reduction on death, can be significantly reduced with certain items.  This allows the player to set the game's difficulty based on their experiences with the game, rather than through a menu option.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

Similar to other games in the [[Souls (series)|series]], ''Dark Souls II'' features a [[New Game Plus]] mode. The initial replay is named "NG+", with subsequent replays named "NG++" and continuing until "NG+7" is reached. With each replay, the player retains their levels, souls, and most items.&lt;ref name="Bedford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bedford|first1=John|title=Dark Souls 2 - New Game Plus, preparation, differences, boss drops|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-08-dark-souls-2-walkthrough-and-guide?page=62|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=25 February 2016|date=7 April 2014|quote=When you restart the game, you'll keep hold of all the levels you acquired in the first playthrough - as well as all of your items and souls - but you'll lose your keys and your Fragrant Branches of Yore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story of ''Dark Souls II'' begins with a human who has become Undead, cursed to never die and doomed to eventually become a Hollow, a zombie-like being with no memories or purpose. To break the curse, the undead travels to the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and is tasked by the Emerald Herald with obtaining four Great Souls from powerful Old Ones whose names are long forgotten and forbidden. Once obtained, the Emerald Herald directs the undead to "Seek the King" in the capital.  After fighting through the remains of the royal guards, the player encounters the Queen Nashandra, who reveals that the king failed in his duty and fled his kingdom long ago. She asks the protagonist to slay the king.

Near the end of the Queen's quest, the player learns that the ruin of the kingdom was in fact caused by Nashandra.  She came to the king and deceived him into launching an ill-fated invasion across the sea into the lands of the Giants.  She coveted their souls and sought to steal their power.  Though the raid succeeded in stealing the Giant's unspecified power, the Giants retaliated.  Invading Drangleic, the Giants eventually destroyed the kingdom.  With his kingdom in ruins, the king discovered Nashandra's true purpose and locked himself inside the Undead Crypt.

In order to confront Nashandra, the player character travels to the keep of Aldia, the King's brother, to obtain the Ashen Mist Heart, an artifact that allows a form of time travel, by accessing the "memories" of corpses. The player must enter the memories of a deceased Giant to defeat the Giant Lord during the invasion and claim his power for their own. Confronting the Emerald Herald one final time, she states that Nashandra is a fragment of Manus, the final boss in the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' expansion in ''Dark Souls''. She then asks the protagonist to put Nashandra to rest and to link the fire, temporarily lifting the curse of the Undead at the cost of the player's life.

In ''Scholar of the First Sin'' version of the game, the base story changes slightly, notably with the addition of Aldia after the defeat of Nashandra. If the player has completed the three DLC areas and defeated King Vendrick, Aldia attempts to help the protagonist understand that there might be a way out of the endless cycle of death and rebirth. The player is given a choice: they can either link the fire, restarting the Age of Fire, and repeating the cycle; or the player can abscond the throne, resisting the effects of Hollowing and following their own unknown path beyond light or dark.

{{Main|Dark Souls II: The Lost Crowns}}

[[Bandai Namco Games]] producer Takeshi Miyazoe originally stated in December 2013 that he did not expect there to be downloadable content (DLC) for ''Dark Souls II''. Despite that, in an interview in January 2014, he said that there is definitely potential for DLC for the game and that fan feedback is key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Houghton |first=David |url=http://www.totalxbox.com/70379/there-is-definitely-potential-for-dark-souls-2-dlc-says-namco/ |title=Xbox Games, News &amp; Reviews &amp;#124; GamesRadar |website=Totalxbox.com |date=2014-09-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2014, FromSoftware announced a trilogy of DLC collectively known as ''[[Dark Souls II: The Lost Crowns|The Lost Crowns]]''. The first of these, titled ''Crown of the Sunken King'', was released on July 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/02/01/dark-souls-2-could-have-dlc-after-all-depending-on-fan-feedback/ |title=Dark Souls 2 could have DLC after all, depending on fan feedback |website=Joystiq.com |date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''Crown of the Old Iron King'', was released on August 26, 2014. The final DLC, ''Crown of the Ivory King'', was slated to be released on September 24, 2014, but was delayed until September 30, 2014, due to unknown reasons. It was then released a day early (September 29) on PC, and a day later (October 1) on PS3.

=== ''Scholar of the First Sin'' ===
On November 25, 2014, Bandai Namco Games announced an updated version of the game, ''Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin'', which was released on April 1, 2015, for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, along with [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. On all platforms, the game is a compilation of ''Dark Souls II'' and its three DLC campaigns. On PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, ''Scholar of the First Sin'' also features remastered visuals with more advanced lighting effects, running at [[1080p]] resolution at [[Frame rate|60 frames per second]]. The re-release also makes changes to the game itself; enemy positions and behaviors have been revised, and the game also supports up to six players in multiplayer scenarios.&lt;ref name=usgamer-dsiinextgen&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin Brings "New Game Plus" to the Next Level|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/dark-souls-ii-scholar-of-the-first-sin-brings-new-game-plus-to-the-next-level|website=USGamer|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its release coincided with patch version 1.10, which was also released for existing versions of the game on February 5, 2015.

The existing PC version of ''Dark Souls II'' received the 1.10 patch at no charge; the remastered ''Scholar of the First Sin'' edition must be purchased separately, but is available at a discount to existing ''Dark Souls II'' owners.

''Dark Souls II'' received critical acclaim, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="Dark Souls II-MCX360" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dark Souls II-MCPS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dark Souls II-MCPC" /&gt; Critics praised the game's atmosphere, and visuals in the game, seeing it as a large improvement over the first two installments in the series, but were polarized over the game's increased difficulty. ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game with four reviewers giving their opinions, who gave it 9/10/9/9, bringing the total score to 37/40.&lt;ref name=Fam/&gt; [[IGN]]'s critic Marty Sliva gave the game a score of 9/10: "''Dark Souls II'' is a smart, massive, and incredibly rewarding sequel. It’s crammed with deep systems, tense encounters, and enough clever multiplayer and [[New Game Plus]] elements to make me want to restart the second I saw the end credits. Not all of the tweaks and additions worked out for the best, the penalty for dying made the game almost unplayable but with such great enemies and levels to fight and explore, ''Dark Souls II'' made 60 hours of pain and agony so much fun they flew by in a heartbeat."&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Daniel Tack of ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game a 9.75 out of 10, stating: "''Dark Souls II'' is an epic adventure from start to finish packed with wondrous environments, imaginative and terrifying foes, and the continual adrenaline-apprehension rush of passing through each fog gate make this title a must-play."&lt;ref name=GI/&gt; [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Phil Kollar also gave it a 9/10, and similarly praised the ambition displayed by the team in creating such a vast RPG universe for the player to explore, the notorious difficulty, and the sense of triumph that comes with eventually defeating the game; he notes that his character died 235 times before completing it.&lt;ref name=Poly/&gt;

Despite the almost universal praise, the game was criticized by some reviewers for aspects relating to its unyielding difficulty. In an "alternative take" review, as a newcomer to the series Justin Haywald of [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 5/10, claiming that it "too often sacrifices fun, replaces it with tedium, and tries to defend that choice by calling it a challenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haywald |first=Justin |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-2-review-a-newcomer-in-drangleic/1900-6415748/ |title=Dark Souls II Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Kain of ''[[Forbes]]'' described that the flaw of ''Dark Souls II'' is that it "fails in almost every way not only to live up to the games that came before it but to find and establish its own identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/04/26/dark-souls-ii-final-review-the-trouble-with-sequels/ |title='Dark Souls II' Final Review: The Trouble With Sequels |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Díaz''' (born June 7, 1976) is an American former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1996 to 2011, and held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[lightweight]] title from 2007 to 2008.

==Amateur highlights==
*Member of the 1996 US Olympic Team as a Light Welterweight. His results were:
**Defeated fan favorite [[Zab Judah]] (United States) twice within 8 days
**Defeated Jacobo Garcia (Virgin Islands) RSC 3 (0:33)
**Lost to [[Oktay Urkal]] (Germany) 6-14
*Won [[Chicago Golden Gloves]] four times and the [[National Golden Gloves]] three times (1993, 1994 and 1996 [[National Golden Gloves light welterweight champion]])

==Professional career==
Diaz accumulated an undefeated record of 26-0 before losing to [[Kendall Holt]] by TKO in the 8th round. He defeated [[José Armando Santa Cruz]] for the interim title on August 12, 2006. On February 20, 2007, Diaz was awarded the title when [[Joel Casamayor]], the champion at the time, was stripped of the title for signing to fight a rematch against WBO champion [[Acelino Freitas]] rather than defend against him – it should nevertheless be noted however, that the lightweight title bout between old foes Casamayor and Freitas never took place because Freitas fought and lost his WBO title to WBA champion [[Juan Díaz (boxer)|Juan Díaz]] instead. 

{{Main article|Manny Pacquiao vs. David Díaz}}
Diaz defeated Mexican legend [[Erik Morales]] on August 4, 2007, by a controversial unanimous decision to defend his title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=19885&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 2008, Diaz lost his title to [[Manny Pacquiao]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] via 9th-round TKO earning Pacquiao his [[List of boxing quintuple champions|fifth world championship]] in five different weight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080429-133323/Pacquiao-fight-biggest-of-my-life-says-Diaz  Inquirer.net, Pacquiao fight biggest of my life, says Diaz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=116519  Abs-Cbn Interactive, TV Patrol: Pacquiao at David Diaz magtutuos sa June 28 sa Las Vegas]{{tl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a lay-off that saw Diaz out of the ring for over a year, he returned to face [[Jesús Chávez]] on September 26, 2009. He won the fight by majority decision.

On March 13, 2010, Diaz challenged [[Humberto Soto]] for his old WBC lightweight title, which had recently been vacated by [[Edwin Valero]], on the undercard of Pacquiao's fight with [[Joshua Clottey]]. Soto defeated Diaz, dropping him in the opening and closing rounds, en route to a unanimous decision victory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/03/13/2038283/humberto-soto-wins-decision-over.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the ring==
Diaz is involved with mentoring various youth.  He is also active in the Mexican-American community of [[Chicago]]. In September 2013, he was the [[Grand Marshal]] of the 26th Street Mexican Independence Parade in the [[Pilsen, Chicago|Pilsen]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]]. Earlier in that very same year on February 28, 2013, Diaz endorsed friend and former boxer [[Bill Evans (politician)|Bill Evans]] as a candidate for [[Cook County Sheriff's Office|Cook County Sheriff]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaz Endorses Bill Evans|url=http://www.electbillevans.com/index.php/endorsements|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18997">The '''state funeral of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq''' was held on 19 August 1988 in the [[Shah Faisal Mosque]] located in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]]. General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], [[Army Chief of Staff (Pakistan)|Chief fo Army Staff]] (COAS) who was also serving as the [[President of Pakistan]], had died in a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] plane, [[call sign]]: Pak-1, crashed near the [[Sutlej river]] on 17 August 1988.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, Ali, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ali |first1=Naziha Syed |title=Dawn investigations: Mystery still surrounds Gen Zia’s death, 30 years on |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1427540/dawn-investigations-mystery-still-surrounds-gen-zias-death-30-years-on |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=DAWN.COM |agency=Dawn Newspaper |publisher=Dawn Newspaper |date=17 August 2018 |location=Islamabad |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several conspiracy theories exists regarding this incident, as other high-profile civilian and military personnel also died in the crash including the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman]] [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Joint chiefs]] General [[Akhtar Abdur Rehman]] and the [[US Ambassador to Pakistan|United States Ambassador]] to Pakistan, [[Arnold Lewis Raphel]], and the [[military attaché]], [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Herbert M. Wassom]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, Ali, 2018"/&gt;

The official announcement of Zia's death was announced by [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]], then-[[Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan|Chairman Senate]] acting as the [[Acting President of Pakistan|Acting President]], simultaneously via [[Radio Pakistan|radio]] and [[Pakistan Television Network|television]] transmission on 17 August 1988. The [[Government of Pakistan]] announced to hold the [[state funeral]] given the Zia-ul-Haq who was buried with military honors in a specially crafted white marble tomb, adjacent to [[Shah Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]].

The funeral was attended by 30 heads of state, including the presidents of [[President of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[President of the People's Republic of China|China]], [[President of Egypt|Egypt]], [[President of Iran|Iran]], [[President of India|India]], [[President of Turkey|Turkey]], and the [[President of UAE|United Arab Emirates]] as well as the [[Aga Khan IV]] and representatives of the crowned heads of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]]. Key American politicians, U.S. Embassy staff in Islamabad, key personnel of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]], and chiefs of staff of the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army]], [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Navy]], [[Chief of Air Staff (Pakistan)|Air Force]] also attended the funeral.

==Events and Crash==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

On 17 August 1988, [[President of Pakistan|President]] Zia-ul-Haq, with his senior delegation, arrived in [[Bahawalpur District|Bahawalpur]] where he was joined by the two [[Americans|American]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian mission|missionaries]] to visit the [[Christianity in Pakistan|local convent]] to condole the death of an American nun murdered in Bahawalpur a few days before making a brief stop at the [[Tamewali railway station|Tamewali Test Range]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, Ali, 2018" /&gt;

After witnessing and viewing the live [[Demonstration (military)|fire demonstration]] of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[M1 Abrams]] at the [[Thamewali|Thamewali Test Range]], with the [[M1 Abrams|American M1 Abrams]] missing its very target that it was supposed to hit, President Zia and his delegation departed from the army's test range via army helicopter.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, Ali, 2018" /&gt; The [[Demonstration (military)|demonstration]] was organized by [[Major-General]] [[Mahmud Ali Durrani]], then-[[General officer commanding|GOC]] of the 1st Armoured Division of the [[Pakistan Army Armoured Corps|Armoured Corps]] as the American [[M1 Abrams]], the standard U.S. Army's weapon system was expected to join the services with the [[Pakistan Army]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, Ali, 2018" /&gt;

At 3:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Pakistan Standard Time) on 17 August 1988 the VIP flight took off from [[Bahawalpur Airport]]. On board the [[C-130]] plane were a total of 31 people, including the President of Pakistan General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], the [[United States Ambassador to Pakistan]], [[Arnold Lewis Raphel|Arnold Raphel]],  General Herbert M. Wassom, the chief of the U.S. military mission in Pakistan, and a group of senior officers from Pakistan army. The plane had been fitted with an air-conditioned VIP capsule where Zia and his American guests were seated. It was walled off from the flight crew and a passenger and baggage section in the rear.

The aircraft departed [[Bahawalpur]] early, ahead of a storm. For 2 minutes and 30 seconds, it rose into a clear sky. Takeoff was smooth and without problems. At 3:51pm (PST) Bahawalpur control tower lost contact, and the plane plunged from the sky and hit the ground with such force that it was blown to pieces and wreckage scattered over a wide area. Witnesses cited in Pakistan's official investigation said that the C-130 began to pitch "in an up-and-down motion" while flying low shortly after takeoff before going into a "near-vertical dive", exploding on impact, killing all on board. There were many investigations into this crash but no satisfactory cause was ever found.

==Investigation==
Washington sent a team of [[United States Air Force]] officers to assist the Pakistanis in the investigation, but the two sides reached sharply different conclusions.

===U.S. conclusions===
Mrs. Ely-Raphel and Brigadier-General Wassom's widow were both told by U.S. investigators that the crash had been caused by a mechanical problem common with the C-130, and that a similar incident had occurred to a C-130 in [[Colorado]] which had narrowly avoided crashing.

[[Robert B. Oakley|Robert Oakley]], who replaced Arnold Raphel as U.S. ambassador following the crash and helped to handle the investigation, has also expressed this view. He has pointed out that 20 or 30 C-130s have suffered similar incidents. He has identified the mechanical fault as a problem with the hydraulics in the tail assembly. Although USAF pilots had handled similar emergencies, the Pakistani pilots were less well equipped to do so, lacking C-130 experience and also flying low.&lt;ref name=times20080816&gt;{{Citation | last = Bone | first = James | author-link = | last2 = Hussain | first2 = Zahid | author2-link = | title = As Pakistan comes full circle, a light is shone on Zia ul-Haq's death | newspaper = [[The Times]] | pages = | year = | date = August 16, 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4543628.ece | location=London |page=40 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronan Farrow]] indicates that the FBI had a statutory authority to investigate the event but was ordered by [[George Shultz]] "to stay away"&lt;ref name=farrow&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ronan Farrow]] |title=[[War on Peace]] |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co, 2018| page=26 |isbn=978-0-393-65210-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the CIA did not investigate.&lt;ref name=farrow/&gt; Air Force investigators who had been at the crash site ruled out mechanical failure but their report was not made public.&lt;ref name=farrow/&gt;

===Pakistani conclusions===
Some weeks after the crash, a 27-page summary of a secret 365-page report was released by Pakistani investigators in which they said that they had found evidence of possible problems with the aircraft's elevator booster package, as well as frayed or snapped control cables. Analysis by a U.S. lab found "extensive contamination" by [[brass]] and [[aluminium]] particles in the elevator booster package, but the report said "failure of the elevator control system due to a mechanical failure...is ruled out". It cited the aircraft-maker [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] as saying that "even with the level of contamination found in the system, they have not normally experienced any problems other than wear".&lt;ref name=times20080816/&gt;

The report concluded that the contamination of the elevator booster package might at worst have caused sluggish controls leading to overcontrol but not to an accident. In the absence of a mechanical cause, the Pakistani inquiry concluded that the crash was due to an act of sabotage. They found no conclusive evidence of an explosion on the aircraft, but said that chemicals that could be used in small explosives were detected in [[mango]] seeds and a piece of rope found on the aircraft. They also added that "the use of a [[chemical agent]] to incapacitate the pilots and thus perpetuate the accident therefore remains a distinct possibility".&lt;ref name=times20080816/&gt;

===Journalistic investigation===
Journalist and author [[Mohammed Hanif]], who became head of Urdu-language service at [[BBC]], told American journalist [[Dexter Finkins]] that, while working in London after 1996, he "became consumed" with determining how Zia was killed. Hanif "made phone calls and researched the lives of those around Zia", attempting to assess possible perpetrators—"the C.I.A., the Israelis, the Indians, the Soviets, rivals inside the Army". He stated he was "met with silence". "No one would talk—not Zia’s wife, not the Ambassador’s wife, no one in the Army.... I realized, there’s no way in hell I’ll ever find out."&lt;ref name="FILKINS-9-5-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=FILKINS|first1=DEXTER|title=Letter from Karachi. Dangerous Fictions |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/a-pakistani-novelist-tests-the-limits |accessdate=6 May 2016|work=New Yorker |issue=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanif later wrote the novel [[A Case of Exploding Mangoes]] which humorously describes four assassinations all occurring simultaneously. The assassins are a senior Pakistani Army officer, a union on behalf of an imprisoned official, a crow on behalf of a blind woman imprisoned for fornication after a rape and the son of an army officer killed by Zia.

==Theories==
According to [[Barbara Crossette]], ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}  South Asia bureau chief from 1988 to 1991: {{cquote|Of all the violent political deaths in the twentieth century, none with such great interest to the U.S. has been more clouded than the mysterious air crash that killed president (and Army Chief General) Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan in (August) 1988, a tragedy that also claimed the life of the serving American ambassador and most of Zia’s top commanders".&lt;ref name=wpc&gt;{{Citation | last = Crossette | first = Barbara | title = Who Killed Zia? | journal = [[World Policy Journal]] | volume = XXII | issue = 3 | pages = | date = Fall 2005 | year =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

No evidence has come to light to prove a conspiracy, but there have been several theories variously implicating the [[United States]] and [[India]] as well as [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Zia also had high-level enemies within the Pakistani government.

===Soviet or US assassination===
General [[Hameed Gul]], the head of Pakistan's [[Inter Services Intelligence]] agency at the time, suggested{{clarify|date=September 2017}}{{weasel inline|date=September 2017}} that the United States might be responsible, even though the U.S. Ambassador and [[military attaché]] were also killed. He told ''[[The Times]]'' that the Pakistani President was killed in a conspiracy involving a "foreign power".&lt;ref name=times20080816/&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017}}

Early reports suggested that Raphel had only been summoned to join the flight at the last minute, which fueled [[conspiracy theories]] blaming the United States. However, Raphel's widow has stated that her husband always planned to join Zia on the aircraft, and that it was General Wassom who was added at the last minute.&lt;ref name=times20080816/&gt;

Stoking the suspicion that the Soviets were involved in the plane crash, one of the fatalities was General Akhtar Abdur Rehman, the Chairman of the Pakistan's Joint Chiefs of Staff and former head of the nation's spy agency, Inter Service Intelligence (ISI); Rehman was a leader of the Afghan [[mujahedin]]’s war against the Soviets.&lt;ref name=times20080816/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Palash|title=Politics Who Killed General Zia Of Pakistan?

===Pakistan government-supported assassination===
Some have suspected the anti-Zia group [[al-Zulfiqar]], led by [[Murtaza Bhutto]], brother of [[Benazir Bhutto]], the Pakistani politician who would ultimately gain most from Zia's departure. Zia's son [[Ijaz-ul-Haq]] told [[Barbara Crossette]] a year after the crash that he was "101 percent sure" that Murtaza was involved. Benazir Bhutto suggested that the fatal crash might well have been an "act of God".&lt;ref name=wpc/&gt;

===Revenge assassination by pilot===
It was mentioned in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on August 24, 2008, that the pilot of the C-130, Wing Commander Mash'hood Hassan, had previously confided to an associate of [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] that he hated President Zia, and held him responsible for the August 1988 murder of Allama [[Arif Hussain Hussaini]], who was the chief of the [[Tehrik Nifaz Fiqh-i-Jafaria]], the largest [[Shia Islam]] organization in Pakistan. According to reports, Hussaini emerged as a go-between for Tehran and Pakistan, first for arms, and ultimately in the transfer of nuclear technology. Tehrik Nifaz Fiqh-i-Jafaria blamed then corps commander and [[Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Lieutenant-General Fazal-i-Haq, who was Zia's right-hand man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Shahzad, Syed Saleem |authorlink= Syed Saleem Shahzad |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/FA29Df03.html |title=US draws a line on Pakistan's nuclear program |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2004-01-29 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the murder of Hussaini, Hassan threatened that "The day Zia flies with me, that will be his last flight".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Simon | first = Henderson | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Pakistan's Dr Nuke bids for the presidency | newspaper = [[Sunday Times]] | pages = | year = | date = August 24, 2008 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4595628.ece |location=London |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mossad assassination===
Writing in the Fall 2005 issue of ''[[World Policy Journal]]'', former U.S. ambassador to India [[John Gunther Dean]], blamed [[Mossad]], the [[Israel]]i [[intelligence agency]], for orchestrating Zia's assassination in retaliation for Pakistan developing a nuclear weapon to counteract India, and to prevent Zia, an effective Muslim leader, from continuing to influence U.S. foreign policy.&lt;ref name=wpc/&gt;

===Pakistan Army-supported assassination===
People have also pointed to some senior dissatisfied generals of the [[Pakistan Army]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Edward Jay. [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/zia.htm "Who Killed Zia?"], ''Vanity Fair'', September 1989; published online at edwardjayepstein.com&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Mirza Aslam Beg]], who became Chief of Army Staff following Zia's death, witnessed the crash from his aircraft, which had just taken off. Instead of returning to Bahawalpur, he headed for Islamabad, an action which later caused controversy and led some to allege that he was involved in the incident since he had reportedly been scheduled to fly with Zia in the flight, but had changed his plans at the last minute. He was later accused of being behind the attack by Zia's son [[Ijaz-ul-Haq]].

It has also been postulated by some sources{{Who|date=July 2009}} that Gen. Zia's death benefited the top members of the [[Pakistani military]], especially the person who became the head of the Pakistani military after the death of Zia. It has been questioned why he was using another plane instead of boarding Pakistan-1. It "entails the mist of conspiracy theory".&lt;ref name=wpc /&gt; The role of chief of first armored division, Maj. Gen. [[Mahmud Ali Durrani]], remains suspicious about who persuaded Zia to watch the tank exercise at Bahawalpur.

In 2015, A.K. Verma, who headed India's spy agency [[Research and Analysis Wing|R&amp;AW]] during Gen. Zia's death, postulated that Zia was assassinated by a faction of generals within the Pakistan Army. He speculated Zia was assassinated to prevent the signing of a secret agreement between India and Pakistan which Zia had proposed some months before his death to resolve the [[Siachen border conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Hamid Gul offered India peace |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-on-indiapakistan-bilateral-ties-when-hamid-gul-offered-india-peace/article7587371.ece|date=28 August 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dedovshchina''''' ({{lang-rus|дедовщи́на|p=dʲɪdɐˈfɕːinə}}; lit. ''reign of grandfathers'') is the informal practice of initiation ([[hazing]]) and constant [[bullying]] of junior [[Military recruitment|conscripts]] during their service, formerly to the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and today to the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian armed forces]], [[Internal Troops]], and (to a much lesser extent) [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Border Guards]], as well as the military forces of certain [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]]. It consists of brutalization by more senior conscripts serving their last year of compulsory military service as well as [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

''Dedovshchina'' encompasses a variety of subordinating or humiliating activities undertaken by the junior ranks: from doing the chores of the senior ranks to violent and sometimes lethal [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]], not unlike an extremely vicious form of [[bullying]] or even [[torture]], including sexual torture and rape (cases of forcingly stucking bottles of glass or metal objects inside of one's anus are common). When not leaving army seriously injured, conscripts can suffer serious psychopathology for their life time. It is often cited as a major source of poor [[morale]] in the ranks.

Often with the justification of maintaining authority, physical violence or psychological abuse can be used to make the “youth” do certain fatiguing duties. In many situations, hazing is in fact not the goal. Conscripts with seniority exploit their juniors to provide themselves with a more comfortable existence, and the violent aspects arise when juniors refuse to "follow traditions".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  There have been occasions where soldiers have been seriously injured, or, in extraordinary situations, killed.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from "''ded''" ({{lang-ru|дед}}, meaning grandfather), which is the [[Russian Army]] army slang equivalent of ''gramps'', meaning soldiers after their third (or fourth, which is also known as "dembel" ({{lang-ru|дембель}} or "DMB" ({{lang-ru|ДМБ}}) half-year of compulsory service, stemming from a vulgarization of the word "[[demobilization]]" ({{lang-ru|демобилизация}} ''demobilizatsiya'') - this word is erroneously used by soldiers to describe the act of resigning from the army); soldiers also refer to "dembel"  half-year of [[conscription]], with the suffix ''-shchina'' which denotes a type of order, rule, or regime (compare [[Yezhovshchina]], [[Zhdanovshchina]]). Thus it can literally be translated as "rule of the grandfathers." This is essentially a folk system of seniority based on stage of service, mostly not backed by code or law, which only grants seniority to conscripts promoted to various [[Sergeant]] and [[Gefreiter|Efreitor]] ranks.

==History==
The origin of this problem is often attributed to the change in conscription term brought about by the law of October 12, 1967, causing two different groups of [[Conscription|conscript]]s to be simultaneously present in the army: those who were drafted for 3-year service and those only for 2-year service.&lt;ref&gt;Those who date the present dedovschina system to 1967 include {{cite book |author= [[William Eldridge Odom|Odom, William E.]] |title= The Collapse of the Soviet Military |publisher= Yale University Press |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-300-07469-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, a decision was reached to draft conscripts with a criminal history into the ranks, due to a demographic crisis following [[World War II]].  While oppression by older conscripts has probably always taken place in the army, after that date, with the introduction of the four-class system (created by the [[Conscription_in_Russia#Late Soviet Union|bi-annual call-ups]]){{Clarify|date=May 2011}} it became systematic and developed its own rules and ranks.

==Current situation==
Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of ''dedovshchina''.&lt;ref name="dedov"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/russia1004/6.htm The Consequences of Dedovshchina], [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ismailov"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/51n/n51n-s11.shtml|title=Terrible dedovshchina in General Staff|first=Vjacheslav|last=Ismailov|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|language=Russian|date=2006-07-10|accessdate=2009-01-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that in 2006 at least 292 Russian soldiers were killed by ''dedovshchina'' (although the Russian military only admits that 16 soldiers were directly murdered by acts of ''dedovshchina'' and claims that the rest committed suicide).&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E7DF173EF930A2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=Hazing Trial Bares a Dark Side of Russia's Military | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' states: "On Aug. 4, it was announced by the chief military prosecutor that there had been 3,500 reports of abuse already this year (2006), compared with 2,798 in 2005". The BBC meanwhile reports that in 2007, 341 soldiers committed suicide, a 15% reduction on the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7425694.stm|title=Russia army suicides cause alarm|publisher=BBC News Online|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a draftee from [[Chelyabinsk]] region, Ruslan Aiderkhanov, was raped and tortured to death by his seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=21 Sep 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8779624/Russian-family-alleges-suicide-conscript-tortured-to-death.html |title=Russian family alleges 'suicide' conscript tortured to death |publisher=Telegraph |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one witness who was willing to testify against the alleged perpetrators, Danil Chalkin, was later found shot dead in his military base.

==Government actions==
Overall, the state has done little to curtail ''dedovshchina''. In 2003, on the specific issues of denial of food and poor nutrition, Deputy Minister of Defense V. Isakov flatly denied the existence of such problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/russia1103/4.htm#_Toc55717189 |title=To Serve without Health? |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]] has published monthly statistics of incidents and crimes including cases of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.mil.ru/849/1048/1312/index.shtml Информация о происшествиях и преступлениях в Вооруженных Силах РФ], mil.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2007/08 the conscript service time was reduced from two years to one; dedovshchina primarily occurs when second year conscripts abuse first year conscripts, this measure is partially intended to curtail the practice.

==Dedovshchina in popular culture==
Several Soviet and Russian films portrayed the ''dedovshchina'' despite the military's abstention from helping the production. Following is the selected filmography:
*''[[Delay – raz! ("Delay – raz!: Do It - one!")|Do It - one!]] - Делай — раз!'' - 1990 
*''[[The Guard (1990 film)|The Guard]] - Караул'' - 1990
*''[[Afghan Breakdown]] - Афганский излом'' - 1990
*''[[100 Days Before the Command]] - Сто дней до приказа'' - 1990
*''[[:ru:Кислородный голод|Air Hunger]] - Кислородный голод'' - 1992
*''[[The Green Elephant]] - Зеленый слоник'' - 1999
*''[[Demobbed (2000 film)|Demobbed]] - ДМБ'' - 2000
*''[[The 9th Company]] - 9-я рота'' - 2005
*''[[The Search (2014 film)|The Search]] - 2014
Also, in the novel ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'', [[Tom Clancy]] writes that veteran Soviet naval captain [[Marko Ramius]] refused to allow ''dedovshchina'' to be practiced anywhere on his ship, dismissing it as "low-level terrorism".

[[File:Eliza Ashurst, loose sketch.png|thumb|300px|Eliza Ashurst, loose sketch]]
'''Elizabeth "Eliza" Ann Ashurst Bardonneau''' (8 July 1813 – 25 November 1850) was a member of an important family of radical activists in mid-nineteenth-century England and the first translator of [[George Sand]]'s work into English.  The family supported causes ranging from women's suffrage to [[Italian unification]].

==Early life==
On 8 July 1813, Elizabeth Ashurst was born to Elizabeth Ann Brown and [[William Henry Ashurst (solicitor)|William Ashurst]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="URBAN1851"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sylvanus Urban|title=The Gentleman's Magazine|location=London|publisher=John Bowyer Nichols &amp; Son |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MEUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA334|year=1851|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the oldest child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWoiAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=1892|publisher=Scribner &amp; Company; The Century Company|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her siblings were William Henry Ashurst Jr., [[Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld|Caroline Ashurst (Stansfeld)]], Emilie Ashurst (Venturi) and [[Matilda Ashurst Biggs|Matilda Ashurst (Biggs)]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=56461&amp;back=&amp;version=2006-10 | title=Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld | publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (online version of 2004 biography)| author=Kathryn Gleadle | year=2004 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in the Ashurst home in [[Muswell Hill]], London.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

==George Sand translations==
Ashurst and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] exchanged correspondence starting in 1844. In one transmission she sent him a translation of ''Spiridion'' by [[George Sand]]. Mazzini responded that he liked it and suggested that she also translate a work of Sand's he admired, ''Letter of a Traveller.''&lt;ref name="Mazzini p. 30"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giuseppe Mazzini|author2=Emilie (Ashurst) Venturi|title=Mazzini's Letters to an English Family ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyosAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA30|year=1920|publisher=John Lane|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a period in time when [[George Sand]]'s free-love and independent lifestyle was quite unusual for a 19th-century woman, Elizabeth Ashurst and [[Matilda Hays]] were "broad-minded" and intrigued by the political and social messages addressed in Sand's books. Hays had received support and encouragement from [[William Charles Macready]] and [[George Henry Lewes]] to translate Sand's novels into English. Both wrote to Sand encouraging the arrangement and a friend of Hays, chaplain [[Edmund Larken]] provided funding for the enterprise.&lt;ref name="Merrill2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Merrill|title=When Romeo Was a Woman: Charlotte Cushman and Her Circle of Female Spectators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXL7iOeM77QC&amp;pg=PA157|date=1 November 2000|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08749-5|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial translations of Sand's works were done by Hays, Ashurst, and Larken. ''La Derniere Aldini,'' the first volume, was translated by Hays. Ashurst translated ''Les Maitres mosaistes'' and it was published in 1844. Mazzini wrote a preface for Ashurt's translation of ''Lettres d'un voyageur''. Sand, at Mazzini's urging, invited Ashurt to her home in Nohant. Olive Class reported that "Sand was unsettled by the superficial display of feminist rebellion exhibited by her as yet still unmarried disciple and characterized her as 'a prude without modesty.'"&lt;ref name="Classe2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Olive Classe|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1uXah12nHgC&amp;pg=PA1226|year=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|isbn=978-1-884964-36-7|page=1226|chapter=George Sand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Henry Lewes suggested to Hays that the translation to the English language toned down some of the rhetoric with an English cultural sensibility.&lt;ref name="Merrill2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Classe2000" /&gt; Mazzini, aware of Lewes suggestion to Hays, wrote to Sand, referring to Hays: "My friends and I consider it unthinkable that you would be willing to give such license to someone whose ideas are unknown to you."&lt;ref name="Classe2000" /&gt;

Four volumes of Sand's work were translated by Hays and Amhert and published, but they floundered. In attempting to tone down Sand's ideas, the translated books were "stripped it of its power," according to [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], an Italian revolutionary and friend of George Sand. The translations were "a smuggler's attempt to conceal the real nature of his infamous cargo," reported the ''[[Quarterly Review]]".&lt;ref name="Merrill2000" /&gt;

Both Hays and Ashurst also has poor financial rewards, due to the arrangement that they had made with a "bad business publisher."&lt;ref name="Merrill2000" /&gt; They worked to find publishers for their translated and edited versions of Sands' work.&lt;ref&gt;See her letters from 1841 to Elizabeth Neall Gay in the James Gay manuscript collection held at Columbia University, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Larken's work with Hays and Ashurst came to an end in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://people.hofstra.edu/david_a_powell/gsa/GSS_biblio_translate_1845-1961.htm | publisher=George Sand Association | title=Bibliography of Works in Translation | accessdate=10 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208102449/http://people.hofstra.edu/david_a_powell/gsa/GSS_biblio_translate_1845-1961.htm | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite book | author=Rosemary Ashton | title=G.

'''Franz Babinger''' (January 15, 1891 – June 23, 1967) was a well-known German orientalist and historian of the [[Ottoman Empire]], best known for his [[biography]] of the great Ottoman emperor [[Mehmed II]] known as the Conqueror, originally published as ''Mehmed der Eroberer und seine Zeit''. An English translation by [[Ralph Manheim]] is available from [[Princeton University Press]] under the title ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time''.

==Life==
Babinger was born in [[Weiden in der Oberpfalz]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and was already an accomplished academic and linguist by the time he had completed his secondary school studies. Prior to starting [[University]], he had already learned both [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

Babinger completed his doctoral studies at the [[University of Munich]] on the eve of [[World War I]]; after the war started, he joined the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]. Because of his language skills and abilities, Babinger served in the [[Middle East]], thus avoiding the deadly trench warfare that cut short the lives of many promising scholars of his generation.

After the war, Babinger continued his studies at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität]] in [[Berlin]] where he completed his [[Habilitation]]sschrift in 1921 and became a [[Professorship|Professor]] at the same institution. During this period, he published ''Geschichtsschreiber der Osmanen und ihre Werke'' ("Historians of the Ottoman Empire"), which became the standard bibliographical review of Ottoman historiography and confirmed the reputation of Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität as a leading center for Near East studies. The rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]] to power in 1933 forced him to resign his position. However, the [[Romania]]n statesman, academic and polymath [[Nicolae Iorga]], himself a widely respected historian of the Ottoman Empire, invited Babinger to take up a position in [[Bucharest]], which he held until he was ordered out of the country in 1943.

Babinger resumed his teaching career after the [[World War II|Second World War]] at the [[University of Munich]] in 1948 until his retirement in 1958. In 1957, he testified about German atrocities against Romanian [[Jews]]. He continued to work and publish actively until his accidental death by drowning in [[Albania]] on June 23, 1967.

==Work==
In addition to his bibliographical work, Babinger published numerous articles and books on a wide variety of subjects. Babinger knew [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as well as the principal European languages, giving his work a scope and authority that had hitherto rarely been displayed in Near Eastern studies.

As a result of his reputation, his magnum opus ''Mehmed the Conqueror'' was published without any accompanying [[Citation|notes]] on [[Primary source|source material]] at all, since the companion volume outlining his extensive and voluminous sources was unfinished at the time of his death. As a result, ''Mehmed the Conqueror'' is one of the few academic works available with no cited sources and whose authority rests solely on the reputation of the author's research abilities. Critics like Prof. [[Halil İnalcık|Halil Inalcik]] from the University of Ankara have said they were waiting for the author's promised second edition as stated in the preface of the book that would include the source material and bibliography; since such edition never saw the light, the students of the subject could easily recognize the source material, evidencing the use of biased bibliography exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr. Prof. Halil Inalcik'' Review of MEHMED THE CONQUEROR (1432-1481) AND HIS TIME (http://www.inalcik.com/images/pdfs/54847543MEHMEDTHECONQUEROR.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gef Mongoose ventriloquism.jpg|thumb|A 1932 article that suggested trickery and [[ventriloquism]] from Voirrey Irving was the cause of the Gef phenomena.]]
'''Gef''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|f}} {{respell|JEF|'}}), also referred to as the '''Talking Mongoose''' or the '''Dalby Spook''', was the name given to a talking  [[mongoose]] which was claimed to inhabit a [[farmhouse]] owned by the Irving family. The Irvings' farm was located at Cashen's Gap near the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Dalby, Isle of Man|Dalby]] on the [[Isle of Man]]. The story was given extensive coverage by the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid press]] in Britain in the early 1930s. The Irvings' claims gained the attention of [[parapsychology|parapsychologists]] and [[ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], such as [[Harry Price]], [[Hereward Carrington]], and [[Nandor Fodor]]. Some investigators of the era as well as contemporary critics have concluded that Voirrey Irving used ventriloquism and family collusion to perpetuate the hoax.

==Story==

In September 1931, the Irving family, consisting of James, Margaret and a 13-year-old daughter named Voirrey, claimed they heard persistent scratching, rustling, and vocal noises behind their farmhouse's wooden wall panels that variously resembled a [[ferret]], a [[dog]] or a baby. According to the Irvings, a creature named Gef introduced itself and told them it was a mongoose born in [[New Delhi]], India, in 1852. According to Voirrey, Gef was the size of a small rat with yellowish fur and a large bushy tail.

The Irvings say that Gef communicated to them that he was "an extra extra clever mongoose", an "Earthbound spirit" and "a ghost in the form of a mongoose" and once said, "I am a freak. I have hands and I have feet, and if you saw me you'd faint, you'd be petrified, mummified, turned into stone or a pillar of salt!"&lt;ref name=josiffe1 /&gt; The Irvings made various claims about Gef: he supposedly guarded their house and informed them of the approach of guests or any unfamiliar dog. They said that if someone had forgotten to put out the fire at night, Gef would go down and stop the stove. The Irvings claimed Gef would also wake people up when they overslept. And whenever [[mice]] got into the house, Gef supposedly assumed the role of the cat, although he preferred to scare them rather than kill them. The Irvings say they gave Gef biscuits, chocolates and bananas, and food was left for him in a saucer suspended from the ceiling which he took when he thought no one was watching. The Irvings claimed the mongoose regularly accompanied them on trips to the market, but always stayed on the other side of the hedges, chatting incessantly.

The story of Gef became popular in the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press, and many journalists flocked to the Isle to try to catch a glimpse of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;''Out of this World, Mysteries of Mind, Space and Time'', 1989, page 419–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other people, both locals and visitors, claimed to have heard Gef's voice, and two claimed to have seen it,&lt;ref name=josiffe1&gt;{{cite web | last = Josiffe | first = Christopher | authorlink = | title = Gef the Talking Mongoose | work = Fortean Times | publisher = Dennis Publishing | date = December 2010 | url = https://www.academia.edu/1476809/Gef_the_Talking_Mongoose | doi = | accessdate = 2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; however physical evidence was lacking. Footprints, stains on the wall, and hair samples claimed to be evidence of Gef were identified as belonging to the Irvings' sheepdog, as were several photos which were claimed by the Irvings to depict Gef.&lt;ref name=willett2/&gt;

Margaret and Voirrey Irving left the home in 1945 after the death of James Irving. They reportedly had to sell the farm at a loss because it had the reputation of being haunted. In 1946, Leslie Graham, the actor who had bought their farm, claimed in the press that he had shot and killed Gef. The body displayed by Graham was, however, black and white and much larger than the famous mongoose and Voirrey Irving was certain that it was not Gef. She died in 2005. In an interview published late in life, she maintained that Gef was not her creation.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, Walter. (1970).

[[Fate (magazine)]]. pp. 74-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychic investigators==

In July 1935 the editor of ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', [[Richard S. Lambert]] (known as "Rex"), and his friend, [[paranormal investigator]] [[Harry Price]], went to the Isle of Man to investigate the case and produced the book ''The Haunting of Cashen's Gap'' (1936). They avoided saying that they believed the story but were careful to report it objectively. The book reports how a hair from the alleged mongoose was sent to [[Julian Huxley]], who then sent it to [[naturalist]] [[Charles Urban Trading Company|F. Martin Duncan]], who identified it as a dog hair.&lt;ref name=low&gt;{{cite book | last = Rachael | first = Low | authorlink = | title = History of British Film | publisher = Routledge | year = 1996 | location = | pages = 193–194 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-15650-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price suspected the hair belonged to the Irvings' sheepdog, Mona.&lt;ref name="Wiseman2011"&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why we see what isn't there''. London, UK: Pan Macmillan. p. 185. {{ISBN|978-0956875655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price asked Reginald Pocock of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] to evaluate [[pawprint]]s allegedly made by Gef in [[plasticene]] together with an impression of his supposed tooth marks. Pocock could not match them to any known animal, though he conceded that one of them might have been "conceivably made by a dog". He did state that none of the markings had been made by a mongoose.&lt;ref name=willett2&gt;{{cite web | last = Willett | first = Cliff | authorlink = | title = The Evidence for Gef: Pt 2 Gef's Pawprints | work = Gef: The Eighth Wonder of the World | publisher = | url = http://dalbyspook.110mb.com/gefpawprints.html| doi = | accessdate = 2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diaries of James Irving, along with reports about the case, are in Harry Price's archives in the [[Senate House Library]], [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland]]. (2009). ''The Weiser Field Guide to Ghosts''. Weiser Books . p. 26. {{ISBN|978-1578634514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price visited the Irvings and observed double walls of wooden panelling covering the interior rooms of the old stone farmhouse which featured considerable interior air space between stone and wood walls that "makes the whole house one great speaking-tube, with walls like soundingboards. By speaking into one of the many apertures in the panels, it should be possible to convey the voice to various parts of the house."&lt;ref name="Price1936"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Price|title=Confessions of a ghost-hunter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpoFAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 August 2013|year=1936|publisher=Putnam}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Wiseman]] "Price and Lambert were less than enthusiastic about the case, concluding that only the most credulous of individuals would be impressed with the evidence for Gef."&lt;ref name="Wiseman2011"/&gt;

[[Nandor Fodor]], Research Officer for the [[International Institute for Psychical Research]] stayed at the Irvings' house for a week without seeing or hearing Gef. Fodor did not believe deliberate deception had occurred and moulded a complex psychological theory to explain Gef based on "[[Split-personality|a split-off part]]" of Jim Irving's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Carrington| first = Hereward | authorlink = |author2=Nandor Fodor | title = Haunted People: The Story of the Poltergeist Down the Centuries | publisher = Lightning Source Inc. | year = 2006 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4254-8106-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Although some psychic investigators thought that Gef was a [[poltergeist]] or a [[ghost]], sceptics, including residents of the Isle of Man, believed the Irving family had colluded to perpetuate a hoax that was originated by daughter Voirrey. An ''Isle of Man Examiner'' reporter wrote that when he caught the girl making noises, her father tried to convince him the sound came from somewhere else.&lt;ref name="Nickell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Joe Nickell]]|title=The Mystery Chronicles: More Real-Life X-Files|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21IIoCQC0VAC&amp;pg=PT144|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=29 September 2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3707-0|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Joe Nickell]] researchers have suspected Voirrey used [[ventriloquism]] and other tricks "the effects of which were hyped by family members, reporters in search of a story, and credulous paranormalists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/psychic_pets_and_pet_psychics/ Psychic Pets and Pet Psychics] Nickell, Joe. Vol. 26.6, November / December 2002. Skeptical Inquirer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary media scholar [[Jeffrey Sconce]] writes that the most likely explanation is that "this extra extra clever mongoose was an imaginary companion created by the Irvings' extra extra clever daughter."&lt;ref name="BerryKim2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Berry|author2=So-yŏng Kim|author3=Lynn Spigel|title=Electronic Elsewheres: Media, Technology, and the Experience of Social Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsZ3C011_dgC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=January 2010|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4736-1|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lambert slander case==

In 1937 Lambert brought an action for slander against Sir [[Cecil Levita]], after Levita suggested to a friend that Lambert was unfit to be on the board of the [[British Film Institute]]. Levita said that Lambert was "off his head" because he had believed in the talking mongoose and the [[evil eye]]. Lambert was pressured to abandon his action by [[Stephen Tallents|Sir Stephen Tallents]] but persisted with it and won, receiving £7,600 in damages, then an exceptional figure for a slander case, awarded because Lambert's counsel managed to introduce a [[BBC]] memo which showed Lambert's career had been threatened if he persisted with the case. The case became known as "the Mongoose Case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = The Mongoose Case 1936 | work = The BBC under Pressure | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/in_depth/pressure/mongoose.shtml | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lambert | first = Richard Stanton | authorlink = | title = Ariel and All His Quality: An Impression of the BBC from Within | publisher = Victor Gollancz | year = 1940 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-946976-11-2| page = 216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ICES logo.png|thumb|ICES logo|100px]]
The '''International Conference on Environmental Systems''', or '''ICES''' (known prior to 1990 as the '''Intersociety Conference on Environmental Systems'''), is an annual technical conference focusing on [[human spaceflight]] technology and space [[human factors]]. Session topics include: [[life support system|Environmental Control and Life Support Systems]] (ECLSS), [[Spacecraft thermal control|thermal control]], [[life sciences]], [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) systems (including [[space suit]] design and [[human-robot interaction]]), [[space architecture]], and mission planning for [[Space exploration|exploration]].

The conference has taken place annually since 1971.

==History==
The first ICES conference was held in San Francisco in 1971, after three years of work by members of Environmental Control and Life Support System specialist committees representing four different societies: the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME), the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE), the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA), and the [[Aerospace Medical Association]] (AsMA). It replaced three other meetings held each year as part of various society conference programs and since then it has been held every year.  In 1972, the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) became the fifth and final co-sponsoring society for ICES.&lt;ref name=asme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.asme.org/Divisions/Aerospace/20951.doc|title=AEROSPACE DIVISION : AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS (ASME INTERNATIONAL) : BY-LAWS and OPERATION GUIDE|publisher=Files.asme.org|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1990, ICES organization was US-only. In 1990 it became international, by merging the American conference with a similar conference held in [[Europe]], and ICES started to be held abroad (for the first time in Germany in 1994). Since 2000, the ICES conference takes place four times out of five in the US and once in five years outside US (so far in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016).

For its first 39 years, the main ICES organizer was the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]; from 2010 through 2013, the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] filled the role of main organizer, supported by American Institute of Chemical Engineers, American Society of Mechanical Engineers and ICES International Committee.  Starting in 2014, the conference became an independent entity that was organized by [[Texas Tech University]].&lt;ref name="depts.ttu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ceweb/ices/|title=45th International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES 2015) :: Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering :: TTU|work=ttu.edu|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 and 2015.  In 2016, the conference became independent with its own website at http://www.ices.space whilst AIAA, AIChE, ASME, and the ICES International Committee continue organizing the conference sessions.

Papers presented at ICES are published every year in the conference proceedings, from 1971 to 2009 by SAE, then from 2010 to 2013 by AIAA. These papers are available and searchable online at the SAE and AIAA websites. They are now published by the ICES organization. Proceedings from the 2014-2017 conferences, hosted by [[Texas Tech University]], are accessible from the ICES conference website.

The '''International Fellowship of Reconciliation''' ('''IFOR''') is a non-governmental organization founded in 1914 in response to the horrors of war in Europe. Today IFOR counts 72 branches, groups and affiliates in 48 countries on all continents. IFOR members promote [[nonviolence]], [[human rights]] and [[reconciliation (ethnic relations)|reconciliation]] through public education efforts, training programs and campaigns. The IFOR International Secretariat in [[Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]] facilitates communication among IFOR members, links branches to capacity building resources, provides training in gender-sensitive [[nonviolence]] through the  Women Peacemakers Program, and helps coordinate international campaigns, delegations and urgent actions. IFOR has [[ECOSOC]] status at the [[United nations|United Nations]].

==History==

===Origins in wartime===
The first body to use the name "[[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]" was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]] by two [[Christian]]s, [[Henry Hodgkin]] (an English [[Quaker]]) and [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] (a German [[Lutheran]]), who were participating in a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] conference in [[Konstanz]], southern Germany (near Switzerland).  On the platform of the railway station at [[Cologne]], they pledged to each other that, "We are one in Christ and can never be at war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,

(p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt;

To take that pledge forward, Hodgkin organised a conference in [[Cambridge]] in 1915 and founded the "Fellowship of Reconciliation" (FOR England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.for.org.uk|title=Home - Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German branch, Versöhnungsbund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versoehnungsbund.de/en|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation - German Branch - Internationaler Versöhnungsbund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded later. It held its first conference in 1932, but in 1933, when Hitler came to power, it dissolved. Schultze was arrested twenty-seven times during World War I and was forced to live in exile during the Nazi period. FOR Germany was officially reestablished just in 1956 with Dr Siegmund Schultze as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|title=The Rebel Passion: Eighty-Five Years of the Fellowship of Reconciliation - Fellowship of Reconciliation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shortly after the Cambridge conference, in the autumn of 1915, Henry Hodgkin went over to America and, the 11th and 12 November, the  American Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forusa.org|title=Fellowship of Reconciliation - Working for peace, justice and nonviolence since 1915|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded during a Conference at Garden City, Long Island. More than a thousand members enrolled in the American Fellowship before and during the war, which, for the U.S.A., begun on April 6, 1917.
Because of the war, it was not possible to travel to other countries and the Fellowship of Reconciliation focused its activities on trying to influence public opinion, to help victims of war and war prisoners. 600 people in England went to prison for helping more than 16.000 imprisoned during the war.  When conscription began in Britain in 1916 and in the United States many FOR members refused military service.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Brittain, "The Rebel Passion: a History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers", George Allen and Unwin ltd, London, 1964, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War one: strengthening the international movement===
[[File:1919-IFOR-c.png|thumb|First international gathering of International Fellowship of Reconciliation at [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands, in 1919.]]

After the end of the war, in 1919, the different Fellowships of Reconciliation raised in those years all around Europe and in the USA agreed to found the International Fellowship of Reconciliation as an umbrella organisation to which they affiliated as members.  In October 1919 Christian pacifists from 10 different countries met in the Netherlands, in the town of Bilthoven, to establish the "Movement Towards a Christian International" later called "International Fellowship of Reconciliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Ferguson | title = The Fellowship of Reconciliation |series=History| publisher = IFOR | journal = The Cambridge Review |date=December 1984 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004074828/http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  IFOR first secretary was the Swiss pacifist [[Pierre Cérésole]] jailed several times for his peace witness. He established the [[International Voluntary Service for Peace#From reconciliation to emergency aid .281920.29|Service Civil]] (International Voluntary Service for Peace), initially organizing work camps in areas torn apart by war, with volunteers from former enemy countries. Relief for the victims of war was carried out, and international conferences and meetings spread the work of peace to many other parts of the globe.  Immediately after Bilthoven IFOR appointed travelling secretaries such as [[John Nevin Sayre]], [[André and Magda Trocmé|André Trocmé]], [[Muriel Lester]], Henri Rose and Percy Bartlett.  They travelled carrying the Fellowship's messages around Europe, in Scandinavia, Central Europe, Poland, the Baltic States and the Balkans, giving life to several international conferences that took place between the two world wars.  The first one gathered 200 delegates from 20 nations (also India, Burma and Ukraine) in Sonntagberg in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen &amp; Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others followed and, in such a tense historical moment, IFOR members discussed about the necessity of disarmament and of a new role of Churches, asking clergymen to make a strong stand against the idea of "righteous wars".  In 1932, the IFOR led a Youth Crusade across Europe in support of the Geneva World Disarmament Conference.  Protestants and Catholics from all over converged on Geneva by various routes, reaching over 50,000 people and presenting to the Conference a petition calling for total disarmament among the nations.

===Ambassadors of Reconciliation===
At the end of the 1930s, given the unstable international situation, IFOR established Embassies of Reconciliation that initiated peace efforts not only in Europe but in Japan and China as well.  "Ambassadors of Reconciliation", such as George Lansbury, [[Muriel Lester]] and Anne Seesholtz, visited many world leaders, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Leon Blum]] and [[Franklin D Roosevelt]].  Muriel Lester, English social worker, served as IFOR travelling secretary throughout the world, helping to establish its work in many countries. She met [[Mahatma Gandhi]], first in London when, in 1931, he spent some time at [[Kingsley Hall]], a community center with educational, social and recreational purposes, run by her and her sister Doris, and then in India when she went with him in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.  When [[World War II]] broke out, travels and communications became almost impossible. In many countries IFOR members suffered persecution for publicly preaching pacifism. IFOR's members, especially in America tried by inter-church mediation to find ways of ending the war, to help coscientious objectors, and struggled against internment of Japanese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen &amp; Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, IFOR members [[André and Magda Trocmé]], with the help of the villagers of le [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon|Chambon sur Lignon]], saved the lives of thousands of Jews escaping the Holocaust. In Belgium, feminist Magda Yoors Peeters defends Jewish refugees and conscientious objectors.

===Supporting nonviolent movements around the world===
After the war, travelling secretaries continued their work. IFOR branches and affiliates in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East grew consistently also thanks to the work of [[Jean Goss]] and [[Hildegard Goss-Mayr]] from Paris and Vienna, three times nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="pb"&gt;{{citation |authorlink1=Peter Brock (historian) |first1=Peter |last1=Brock |first2=Nigel |last2=Young |title=Pacifism in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-8156-8125-9 |pages=376–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand pacifist [[Ormond Burton]] represented the IFOR in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John |last=Button |title=The Radicalism Handbook: Radical Activists, Groups and Movements of the Twentieth Century |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=0-87436-838-3 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From such labors arose Servicio Paz y Justicia (SERPAJ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serpajamericalatina.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout Latin America. SERPAJ's founder [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel|Adolfo Perez Esquivel]] from Argentina was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980.&lt;ref name="pb" /&gt; SERPAJ participated in the nonviolent resistance to Chile's 16-year-long military dictatorship, which culminates in free elections that restored democracy. Hildegard Goss-Mayrs' training in active nonviolence contributed significantly to the people power overthrow of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship in the [[Philippines]] in 1986, as well as the growth of nonviolent movements in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Deats | title = Marked for Life: The Story of Hildegard Goss-Mayr | publisher = New City Press | place = Hyde park, NY | year = 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Goss-Mayrs, IFOR Honorary Presidents, were central to the global spread of active nonviolence movement.

==IFOR members==
IFOR has 72 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?msid=214698436680848045660.0004c04fff384994c2417&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=13.55691,8.778076&amp;spn=139.474293,226.054688|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 48 countries in all continents.

==How IFOR works==

===Decade for a Culture of Nonviolence===
Since the initiation of the United Nations Decade for a Culture of Peace and Nonviolence for the Children of the World, in 2001, IFOR members have been active in working for peace education and in working to establish national coalitions to support the Decade.

===Nonviolence education and training===
IFOR assists groups and individuals to find ways in which they can transform conflicts into positive and growth oriented interactions that involve dialogue and lead to reconciliation. The  Nonviolent Education Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nv-e.org/|title=*NVE - Non Violent Education*|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims at supporting sustainable implementation of nonviolence/nonviolent education, peace education and violence prevention in compulsory kindergarten and school education and thus consequent implementation of Children’s Rights expressed in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].  This is done through various presentations and training programs, as well as through the creation of resource materials and contact with trainers and resource people.

===Youth empowerment===
Thanks to the Youth Working Group, IFOR provides young people with the skills and opportunities to become active peacemakers. This is done through nonviolence and leadership training, campaigning, and through internships with IFOR branches and groups, or with the International Secretariat.

===Interfaith cooperation===
Religion has on occasion played a central role in fomenting conflict but can also be a source of inspiration and leadership for peace. IFOR sponsors interfaith delegations to areas of conflict and publishes material on nonviolence from different religious traditions.

===Disarmament===
Since our founding, IFOR has opposed war and preparations for war. IFOR members support conscientious objectors, campaign for a ban on land mines, and oppose nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. During their annual meeting, European members from different branches of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation issued the Declaration of Prali,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|title=Read the Declaration of Prali on Military Spending|format=PDF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in occasion of the Global day of Action on Military Spending,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demilitarize.org/|title=Global Campaign on Military Spending - Cut Military Spending - Fund Human Needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17 April 2012.  The Peace and Constitution Committee Working Group promotes actions to raise awareness on the [[article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] which denounces war and war-preparation activities.

===Gender justice===
In 2006 IFOR adopted a Gender Policy in which IFOR recognizes that there is a continuum of violence against women that must be confronted, from family violence in the private sphere to armed conflict in the public sphere. Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation.  This gender policy recognizes that gender equality is an integral part of IFOR’s fundamental values and is a core spiritual value. A transformation of the power relations between women and men is a prerequisite for a culture of peace and non-violence, and must be promoted throughout IFOR.  The Women Peacemaker Program (WPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor.org/WPP/|title=About IFOR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an IFOR program that works to ensure the possibility for women's access to peace negotiations and promotes the application of IFOR’s Gender Policy. 

The successful program has been institutionalized by the end of 2012.

==International representation==
IFOR maintains permanent representatives at the United Nations (UN) in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Paris (UNESCO) who regularly participate in conferences and meetings of UN bodies, providing testimony and expertise from different regional perspectives, promoting non-violent alternatives in the fields of human rights, development, and disarmament. 
IFOR has observer and consultative status to the United Nations, United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and UNESCO organizations.

'''Jadwiga''' ({{IPA-pl|jadˈvʲiɡa|}}), also known as '''Hedwig''' ({{lang-hu|Hedvig}}; 1373/4 – 17 July 1399), was the first female monarch of the [[Kingdom of Poland]], reigning from 16 October 1384 until her death. She was the youngest daughter of [[Louis the Great]], [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Poland|Poland]], and his wife [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]]. Jadwiga was a member of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], but she had more close forebears among the Polish [[Piasts]].  In 1997 she was [[canonized]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

In 1375 it was planned that she would eventually marry [[William of Austria]], and she lived in Vienna from 1378 to 1380. Jadwiga's father is thought to have regarded her and William as his favoured successors in Hungary after the 1379 death of her eldest sister, [[Catherine of Hungary (1370–1378)|Catherine]], since the Polish nobility had that same year pledged their homage to Louis' second daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], and Mary's fiancé, [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]]. However, Louis died, and in 1382, at her mother's insistence, Mary was crowned "King of Hungary". Sigismund of Luxemburg tried to take control of Poland, but the Polish nobility countered that they would be obedient to a daughter of King Louis only if she settled in Poland. Queen Elizabeth then chose Jadwiga to reign there, but did not send her to [[Kraków]] to be crowned. During the interregnum, [[Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia]], became a candidate for the Polish throne. The nobility of [[Greater Poland]] favored him and proposed that he marry Jadwiga. However, [[Lesser Poland]]'s nobility opposed him and persuaded Queen Elizabeth to send Jadwiga to Poland.

Jadwiga was crowned "king" in Poland's capital, Kraków, on 16 October 1384. Her [[coronation]] either reflected the Polish nobility's opposition to her intended husband, William, becoming king without further negotiation, or simply emphasized her status as [[queen regnant]]. With her mother's consent, Jadwiga's advisors opened negotiations with [[Jogaila]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], who was still a [[Lithuanian paganism|pagan]], concerning his potential marriage to Jadwiga. Jogaila signed the [[Union of Krewo]], pledging to convert to Roman Catholicism and to promote his pagan subjects' conversion. Meanwhile William hastened to Kraków, hoping to marry his childhood fiancée Jadwiga, but in late August 1385 the Polish nobles expelled him. Jogaila, who took the baptismal name Władysław, married Jadwiga on 15 February 1386. Legend says that she had agreed to marrying him only after lengthy prayer, seeking [[divine inspiration]].

Jogaila, now in Polish styled Władysław Jagiełło, was crowned King of Poland on 4 March 1386. As Jadwiga's co-ruler, Jagiełło worked closely with his wife. After rebellious nobles of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]-[[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]] had imprisoned her mother and sister, she marched into the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], which had been under Hungarian rule, and persuaded most of the inhabitants to become subjects of the [[Polish Crown]]. She mediated between her husband's quarreling kin, and between Poland and the [[Teutonic Knights]]. After her sister Mary died in 1395, Jadwiga and Jagiełło laid claim to Hungary against the widowed Sigismund of Luxemburg, but the Hungarian lords failed to support them.

Jadwiga was born in [[Buda]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=56}} She was the third and youngest daughter of [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]], [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Poland|Poland]], and his second wife, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]].{{sfn|Wolf|1993|p=xliii}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=169}} Both her grandmothers were Polish princesses, connecting her to the native [[Piast dynasty]] of [[Poland]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=78}}&lt;ref name="Duczmal305"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duczmal|first1=Małgorzata|title=Jagiellonowie|date=1996|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Kraków|isbn=83-08-02577-3|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Oscar Halecki]] concluded that Jadwiga's "genealogical tree clearly shows that [she] had more Polish blood than any other".{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=78}} She was probably born between 3 October 1373 and 18 February 1374.{{sfn|Sroka|1999|pp=54–55}}{{refn|Jadwiga's name was first recorded in instructions to Hungarian envoys to France on 17 April 1384.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=56}} If by then, Jadwiga had reached twelve years, the minimum age prescribed by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] for girls to marry,{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=93}} she must have been born before 18 February 1374.{{sfn|Sroka|1999|pp=54–55}}|group=nb}} She was named after her distant ancestor, Saint [[Hedwig of Silesia]], who was especially venerated in the Hungarian royal court at the time of her birth.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=434}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=89}}

King Louis, who had not fathered any sons, wanted to ensure his daughters' right to inherit his realms.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=90}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=169}} Therefore, European royals regarded his three daughters as especially attractive brides.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=169}} [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria]], proposed his eldest son, [[William, Duke of Austria|William]], to Jadwiga already on 18 August 1374.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=58}} The envoys of the [[Polish nobles]] acknowledged that one of Louis's daughters would succeed him in Poland after he confirmed and extended their liberties in the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] on 17 September 1374.&lt;ref name="Duczmal305"/&gt;{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=90}}{{sfn|Sedlar|1994|pp=39–40}} They took an oath of loyalty to Catherine on Louis's demand.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=8}}

Louis agreed to give Jadwiga in marriage to William of Austria on 4 March 1375.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=58}} The children's ''[[sponsalia de futuro]]'', or "provisional marriage", was celebrated at [[Hainburg an der Donau|Hainburg]] on 15 June 1378.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=8}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=65, 93}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=170}} The ceremony established the legal framework for the [[consummation]] of the marriage without any further ecclesiastical act as soon as they both reached the age of maturity.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=65}} Duke Leopold agreed that Jadwiga would only receive [[Treviso]], a town which was to be conquered from the [[Republic of Venice]], as dowry from her father.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=64–65}} After the ceremony, Jadwiga stayed in Austria for almost two years; she mainly lived in [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=93}}

Catherine died in late 1378.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=169}} Louis persuaded the most influential Polish lords to swear an oath of loyalty to her younger sister, Mary, in September 1379.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=8}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=71}} She was betrothed to [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]],{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=170}} a great-grandson of [[Casimir the Great]], who had been Louis's predecessor on the Polish throne.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=52}} The "promised marriage" of Jadwiga and William was confirmed at their fathers' meeting in [[Zólyom]] (now Zvolen in Slovakia) on 12 February 1380.{{sfn|Frost|2015|pp=8, 10}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=72–73}} Hungarian lords also approved the document, implying that Jadwiga and William were regarded as her father's successors in Hungary.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=73}}

A delegation of the Polish lords and clergy paid formal homage to Sigismund of Luxemburg as their future king on 25 July 1382.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=75}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=10}} The Poles believed that Louis planned also to persuade the Hungarian lords and prelates to accept Jadwiga and William of Austria as his heirs in Hungary.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=170}} However, he died on 11 September 1382.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=173}} Jadwiga was present at her father's death bed.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=75}}

Both Elizabeth's daughters had been engaged to foreign princes (Sigismund and William, respectively) unpopular in Poland.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=100}} Polish lords who were opposed to a foreign monarch regarded the members of the Piast dynasty as possible candidates to the Polish throne.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=100}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=10}} Queen Elizabeth's uncle [[Władysław the White]] had already attempted to seize Poland during Louis's reign.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=66, 100}} However, he had taken [[monastic vows]] and settled in a Benedictine abbey in [[Dijon]] in Burgundy.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=10}} [[Antipope Clement VII]], whom King Louis had refused to recognize against [[Pope Urban VI]],{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=69–70}} released Władysław from his vows, but he did not leave his monastery.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=11}} Meanwhile, [[Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia]], appeared as a more ambitious candidate.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=100}} He was especially popular among the nobility and townspeople of Greater Poland.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=8}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=100}}

Queen Elizabeth's representatives released the Poles from their oath of fidelity that their representatives had sworn to Mary at an assembly in [[Sieradz]] in February 1383.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=101}} The envoys also announced that she was willing to send Jadwiga to be crowned instead, on condition that she return to Buda after her coronation to live there until her twelfth birthday.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=101}} The Polish lords accepted the proposal, but they soon realized that thereby the interregnum would be extended by a further three years.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=101}} At a new meeting in Sieradz, most noblemen were ready to elect Siemowit of Masovia king on 28 March.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=101}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=15}} They proposed that Siemowit should marry Jadwiga.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=101}} A member of the influential [[Tęczyński family]], [[Jan Tęczyński (?-1405)|Jan]], convinced them to postpone Siemowit's election.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=104}} The noblemen agreed to wait for Jadwiga until 10 May, stipulating that she was to live in Poland after her coronation.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=104}} They also demanded that [[Dobrzyń Land|Dobrzyń]] and [[Gniewków]] (two fiefdoms which her father had granted to [[Vladislaus II of Opole]]), and "[[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Ruthenia]]" (that had passed to Hungary in accordance with a previous treaty){{sfn|Deletant|1986|p=202}} be restored to the [[Polish Crown]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=71, 104}}

Meanwhile, Jan Tęczyński and his allies, including [[Sędziwój Pałuka]], seem to have started negotiations with [[Jogaila]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=103–104}} Siemowit's supporters however, tried to enter Kraków in the retinue of [[Bodzanta]], [[Archbishop of Gniezno]], in May, but the townspeople closed the gates of the city before their arrival.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=106}} Jadwiga had not arrived in Poland by the stipulated date (10 May).{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=106}} Her mother's envoys stated that the spring floods had hindered Jadwiga's progress over the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=106}}

Siemowit of Mazovia took up arms and advanced as far as [[Kalisz]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=106}} His supporters assembled in Sieradz in August in order to elect him king, but Archbishop Bodzanta refused to perform his coronation.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=101, 106}} In a meeting in [[Košice|Kassa]], Queen Elizabeth promised the delegates of the Polish provinces to send Jadwiga to Poland before November.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=107}} The queen mother and the Poles also agreed that if either Jadwiga or Mary died childless, her kingdom would pass to her surviving sister.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=107}} Siemowit having laid siege to Kalisz, Queen Elizabeth sent Sigismund of Luxemburg at the head of an "improvised army"{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=107}} to Lesser Poland. Siemowit failed to take Kalisz, but news about the appalling behaviour of Sigismund's soldiers increased Sigismund's unpopularity in Poland.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=107}} Sędziwój Pałuka, who was the castellan of Kalisz and ''[[starosta]]'' of Kraków, led a delegation to [[Zadar]] in [[Dalmatia]] to negotiate with Queen Elizabeth, but she had him imprisoned instead.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=107–108}} She sent Hungarian soldiers to Poland to garrison them in [[Wawel Castle]] in Kraków, but Pałuka escaped and successfully obstructed her soldiers  entering the castle.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=108}}

At a [[General sejm|general assembly]] in [[Radomsko]] in early March, the delegates of all the Polish provinces and towns decided to elect Siemowit king, if Jadwiga did not come to Poland within two months.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=108}} They set up a provisional government,{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=108}} stipulating that only the "community of lords and citizens" had the authority to administer Poland during the interregnum.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=16}} Queen Elizabeth, who was only informed of the decision by an informal message, realized that she could not any longer postpone Jadwiga's coronation and so sent her to Poland.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=108}} The exact date of Jadwiga's arrival is unknown, because the main source for the history of Poland during this period{{spaced ndash}}[[Jan of Czarnków]]'s chronicle{{spaced ndash}} ended prior to this event.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=109}}

== Reign ==

=== Coronation (1384) ===
[[File:Jadwiga Andegaweńska.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Queen Jadwiga from the 16th century. Now held at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]]] 
The interregnum that followed Louis's death and caused such internal strife came to an end with Jadwiga's arrival in Poland.{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=113}} A large crowd of clerics, noblemen and burghers gathered at Kraków "to greet her with a display of affection",&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'' (A.D. 1384), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the 15th-century Polish historian, [[Jan Długosz]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=113}} Nobody protested when Archbishop [[Bodzanta]] crowned her on 16 October 1384.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=109}}{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=91}} According to traditional scholary consensus, Jadwiga was crowned "king".{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=17 (note 38)}} Thereby, as Robert W. Knoll proposes, the Polish lords prevented her eventual spouse from adopting the same title without their consent.{{sfn|Knoll|2011|p=37}} Stephen C. Rowell, who says that sources that contradict the traditional view outnumber those verifying it, suggests that sporadic contemporaneous references to Jadwiga as "king" only reflect that she was not a [[queen consort]], but a [[queen regnant]].{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=17 (note 38)}}

Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, [[Jan Radlica]], [[Bishop of Kraków]], [[Dobrogost of Nowy Dwór]], [[Bishop of Poznań]], and Duke Vladislaus II of Opole were Jadwiga's most trusted advisers during the first years of her reign.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=114–115}} According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, Jadwiga, who was still a minor, was "a mere tool" to her advisers.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=434}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=114}} However, Halecki refutes this view, contending that Jadwiga matured quickly and her personality, especially her charm and kindness, only served to strengthen her position.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=114}} Already in late 1384 she intervened on Duke Vladislaus's behalf to reconcile him with her mother's favourite, [[Nicholas I Garai]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=116}}

=== Refusal of William (1385) ===
The Polish lords did not want to accept Jadwiga's fourteen-year-old fiancé, William of Habsburg, as their sovereign.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=17}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=116–117}} They thought that the inexperienced William and his Austrian kinsmen could not safeguard Poland's interests against its powerful neighbours, especially the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxemburgs]] which controlled [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and had a strong claim on Hungary.{{sfn|Frost|2015|pp=17, 33}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=117}} According to Halecki, the lords of Lesser Poland were the first to suggest that Jadwiga should marry the pagan duke Jogaila of Lithuania.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=118}}

Jogaila sent his envoys{{spaced ndash}}including his brother, [[Skirgaila]], and a German burgher from Riga, Hanul{{spaced ndash}} to Kraków to request Jadwiga's hand in January 1385.{{sfn|Frost|2015|pp=17, 33}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=121–123}} Jadwiga refused to answer, stating only that her mother would decide.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=123}} Jogaila's two envoys left for Hungary and met Queen Elizabeth.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=123}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=3}} She informed them that "she would allow whatever was advantageous to Poland and insisted that her daughter and the prelates and nobles of the Kingdom had to do what they considered would benefit Christianity and their kingdom",&lt;ref name="Annals_y1385_p345"&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'' (A.D. 1385), p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Jan Długosz's chronicle.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=127}} The nobles from Kraków, [[Sandomierz]] and Greater Poland assembled in Kraków in June or July and the "majority of the more sensible"&lt;ref name="Annals_y1385_p345"/&gt; voted for the acceptance of Jogaila's marriage proposal.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=129}}

[[File:Dymitr z Goraja.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bearded man on his knees by a young woman who stands at a door holding an axe |''Dymitr of Goraj'' by [[Jan Matejko]] depicts Jadwiga trying to break the castle gate to join William]]
In the meantime, William's father, Leopold III hurried to Buda in late July 1385, demanding the consummation of the marriage between William and Jadwiga before 16 August.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=127, 129}} Queen Elizabeth confirmed the previous agreements about the marriage, ordering Vladislaus II of Opole to make preparations for the ceremony.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=34}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=130}} According to [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], Jadwiga's marriage sacrament could only be completed before her twelfth birthday if the competent prelate testified her precocious maturity.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=130}} [[Demetrius of Esztergom|Demetrius]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom]], issued the necessary document.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=131}} William went to Kraków in the first half of August, but his entry to Wawel Castle was barred.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=132}} Długosz states that Jadwiga and William would only be able to meet in the nearby [[Franciscan]] convent.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=132}}

Contemporary or nearly contemporaneous records of the completion of the marriage between William and Jadwiga are contradictory and unclear.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=132-135}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=34}} The official accounts of the municipal authorities of Kraków record that on 23 August 1385 an amnesty was granted to the prisoners in the city jail on the occasion of the celebration of the Queen's marriage.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=132–133}} On the other hand, a contemporary Austrian chronicle, the ''Continuatio Claustroneubuzgis'' states that the Poles had tried to murder William before he consummated the marriage.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=135}} In the next century, Długosz states that William was "removed in a shameful and offensive manner and driven from the castle" after he entered "the Queen's bedchamber"; but the same chronicler also mentions that Jadwiga was well aware that "many people knew {{nobr|that ...}} she had for a fortnight shared her bed with Duke William and that there had been physical consummation".&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'' (A.D. 1385 and 1386), pp. 346–347.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=134–135}}

On the night when William entered the queen's bedchamber, a group of Polish noblemen broke into the castle, forcing William to flee, according to Długosz.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=135}} After this humiliation, Długosz continues, Jadwiga decided to leave Wawel and join William, but the gate of the castle was locked.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=135}} She called for "an axe and [tried] to break it open",&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'' (A.D. 1385), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Dymitr of Goraj]] convinced her to return to the castle.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=138}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=34}} Oscar Halecki says that Długosz's narrative "cannot be dismissed as a romantic legend";{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=139}} [[Robert I. Frost]] writes that it is a "tale, almost certainly apocryphal".{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=34}} There is no doubt, however, that William of Austria was forced to leave Poland.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=95}}

=== Marriage to Jogaila (1385–92) ===
[[File:Psałterz florianski1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Florian|Saint Florian's]] [[Psalter]], commissioned by Jadwiga in around 1370, held in the [[National Library of Poland]] in [[Warsaw]]]]
Jogaila signed the [[Union of Krewo]] in August 1385, promising Queen Elizabeth's representatives and the Polish lords' envoys that he would convert to Catholicism, together with his pagan kinsmen and subjects, if Jadwiga married him.{{sfn|Frost|2015|pp=47, 50}}{{sfn|Gromada|1999|pp=434–435}} He also pledged to pay 200,000 florins to William of Habsburg in compensation. William never accepted it.{{sfn|Frost|2015|pp=34, 47}} Two days after the Union of Krewo, the [[Teutonic Knights]] invaded Lithuania.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=157}}

The ''Aeltere Hochmeisterchronik'' and other chronicles written in the Knights' territory accused the Polish prelates and lords of forcing Jadwiga to accept Jogaila's offer.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=139–140}} According to a Polish legend, Jadwiga agreed to marry Jogaila due to [[divine inspiration]] during her long prayers before a [[crucifix]] in Wawel Cathedral.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=139}} Siemowit IV of Mazovia resigned his claim to Poland in December.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=4}}

The Polish lords' envoys informed Jogaila that they would obey him if he married Jadwiga on 11 January 1386.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=49}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=147}} Jogaila went to [[Lublin]] where a general assembly unanimously declared him "king and lord of Poland" in early February.{{sfn|Monter|2012|p=74}}{{sfn|Frost|2015|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=150–151}} Jogaila went on to Kraków where he was baptized, receiving the Christian name, Władysław, in Wawel Cathedral on 15 February.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=95}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=152}} Three days later, 35-year-old Władysław-Jogaila married 12-year-old Jadwiga.{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=190}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=152}} Władysław-Jogaila styled himself as ''dominus et tutor regni Poloniae'' ("lord and guardian of the Kingdom of Poland") in his first charter issued after the marriage.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=155}}

Archbishop Bodzanta crowned Władysław-Jogaila king on 4 March 1386.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=4}} Poland was transformed into a [[diarchy]]{{spaced ndash}}a kingdom ruled over by two sovereigns.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=155}} Jadwiga and her husband did not speak a common language, but they cooperated closely in their marriage.{{sfn|Monter|2012|p=74}} She accompanied him to Greater Poland to appease the local lords who were still hostile to him.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=160}} The royal visit caused damage to the peasants who lived in the local prelates' domains, but Jadwiga persuaded her husband to compensate them, saying: "We have, indeed, returned the peasants' cattle, but who can repair their tears?",&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'' (A.D. 1386), p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Długosz's chronicle.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=160}} A court record of her order to the judges in favour of a peasant also shows that she protected the poor.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=160}}

[[Pope Urban VI]] sent his legate, [[Maffiolo Lampugnano]], to Kraków to enquire about the marriage of the royal couple.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=158}} Lampugnano did not voice any objections, but the Teutonic Knights started a propaganda campaign in favour of William of Habsburg.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=157–159}} Queen Elizabeth pledged to assist Władysław-Jogaila against his enemies on 9 June 1386,{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=158}} but Hungary had sunken into anarchy.{{sfn|Deletant|1986|p=202}} A group of [[Slavonia]]n lords captured and imprisoned Jadwiga's mother and sister on 25 July.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=198}} The rebels murdered Queen Elizabeth in January 1387.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=198–199}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=164}} A month later, Jadwiga marched at the head of Polish troops to Ruthenia where all but one of the governors submitted to her without opposition.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=165–166}}{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=435}}
[[File:Simmler Queen Jadwiga's oath.jpg|thumb|alt=A crowned young woman on her knees with her hand on the Bible which is held by an old bearded man |''Queen Jadwiga's Oath'', by [[Józef Simmler]], 1867]]

Duke Vladislaus of Opole who also had a claim on Ruthenia could not convince [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], [[King of the Romans]], to intervene on his behalf.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=166}} Jadwiga confirmed the privileges of the local inhabitants and promised that Ruthenia would never again be separated from the Polish Crown.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=166}} After the reinforcements that Władysław-Jogaila sent from Lithuania arrived in August, Halych, the only fortress to resist, also surrendered.{{sfn|Deletant|1986|p=203}} Władysław-Jogaila also came to Ruthenia in September.{{sfn|Deletant|1986|p=203}} [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru Muşat]], [[Voivode of Moldavia]], visited the royal couple and paid homage to them in [[Lviv]] on 26 September.{{sfn|Deletant|1986|p=203}} Władysław-Jogaila confirmed the privileges that Jadwiga had granted the Ruthenians in October.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=166}} She also instructed her subjects to show the same respect for her husband as for herself: in a letter addressed to the burghers of Kraków in late 1387, she stated that her husband was their "natural lord".{{sfn|Monter|2012|p=74}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=156}}

On William's demand, Pope Urban VI initiated a new investigation about the marriage of Jadwiga and Władysław-Jogaila.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=167–168}} They sent Bishop Dobrogost of Poznań to Rome to inform the pope of the [[Christianization of Lithuania]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=170}} In his letter to Bishop Dobrogost, Pope Urban jointly mentioned the royal couple in March 1388, which implied that he had already acknowledged the legality of their marriage.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=170}} However, [[Gniewosz of Dalewice]], who had been William of Habsburg's supporter, spread rumours about secret meetings between William and Jadwiga in the royal castle.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=170}} Jadwiga took a solemn oath before Jan Tęczyński, stating that she had only had marital relations with Władysław-Jogaila.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=137, 180}} After all witnesses confirmed her oath, Gniewosz of Dalewice confessed that he had lied.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=180}} She did not take vengeance on him.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=180}}

=== Strife with Sigismund (1392–95) ===

Jadwiga's brother-in-law, Sigismund, who had been crowned King of Hungary,{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=199}} started negotiations with the Teutonic Knights about partitioning Poland in early 1392.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=194}} Jadwiga met Mary in [[Stará Ľubovňa]] in May and returned to Kraków only in early July.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=195–197}} She most probably accompanied her husband to Lithuania, according to Oscar Halecki, because she was far from Kraków till the end of August.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=198}} On 4 August, Władysław-Jogaila's cousin, [[Vytautas]], who had earlier fled from Lithuania to the Teutonic Knights, paid homage to Władysław-Jogaila near [[Lida]] in Lithuania on 4 August.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=198}}

Negotiations between Sigismund and the [[Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights]], [[Konrad von Wallenrode]], continued with the mediation of Vladislaus of Opole.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=200–201}} However, Hungary's southern border was exposed to Ottoman incursions, preventing Sigismund from taking military measures against Poland.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=207}} Wallenrode died on 25 July 1393.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=211}} His successor, [[Konrad von Jungingen]], opened negotiations with the Poles.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=211}} During the discussions, [[Pope Boniface IX]]'s legate, John of Messina, supported the Poles.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=211}}
[[File:Stefan wojewoda moldawski slubuje wiernosc.png|thumb|Stephen I of Moldavia's promise of loyalty to Jadwiga and Jogaila against Sigismund]]
Jadwiga was a skilful mediator, famed for her impartiality and intelligence.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=435}} She went to Lithuania to reconcile her brother-in-law, Skirgaila, with Vytautas in October 1393.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=199}} Relations between Poland and Hungary remained tense.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=214}} Sigismund invaded Moldavia, forcing [[Stephen I of Moldavia]] to accept his [[suzerainty]] in 1394.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=214}} Soon after the Hungarian troops left Moldavia, Stephen sent his envoys to Jadwiga and Jogaila, promising to assist Poland against Hungary, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Teutonic Knights.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=214}}

On 17 May 1395, Mary died after a riding accident.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=201}} According to the 1383 agreement between their mother and the Polish lords, Jadwiga was her childless sister's heir in Hungary.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=220}} [[Vlad I of Wallachia]], a Hungarian vassal, issued an act of submission on 28 May, acknowledging Jadwiga and her husband as Mary's legitimate successors.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=221}} The widowed king's close supporter, [[Stibor of Stiboricz]], expelled Vlad from Wallachia.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=222}} Władysław-Jogaila gathered his troops on the Polish-Hungarian border, but [[Eustache Jolsvai]], [[Palatine of Hungary]], and [[John Kanizsai]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom]], stopped his invasion of Hungary.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=201}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=222}} In September, Konrad von Jungingen told the [[prince-electors]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that the union of Poland, Lithuania and Hungary under Władysław-Jogaila's rule would endanger Christendom.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=224}} However, most of Sigismund's opponents, who were especially numerous in Croatia, supported the claim of [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the last male member of the Capetian House of Anjou.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=223–224}} On 8 September, the most influential Hungarian lords declared that they would not support any change in government while Sigismund was far from Hungary fighting against the Ottoman Turks.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=224}} Before the end of the year, peace negotiations between the representatives of Hungary and Poland ended with an agreement.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=225}} Jadwiga adopted the title "heir to Hungary", but she and her husband took no further action against Sigismund.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=226–227}}

=== Conflict with the Teutonic Knights (1395–99) ===

The relationship between Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights remained tense.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=230–233}} Jadwiga and her Polish advisers invited the Grand Master, Konrad von Jungingen, to Poland to open new negotiations in June 1396.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=233}} Conflicts with Vladislaus of Opole and Siemowit of Masovia, who had not given up their claims to parts of Ruthenia and [[Cuyavia]], also intensified.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=234–235}} To demonstrate that the territories were under Jadwiga's direct control, Władysław-Jogaila granted the [[Duchy of Belz]] (in Ruthenia) and [[Cuyavia]] to her in early 1397.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=235}} However, Jadwiga and her Polish advisers wanted to avoid a war with the Teutonic Order.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=89}} In response, Władysław-Jogaila replaced most Polish "starostas" (aldermen) in Ruthenia with local Orthodox noblemen.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=89}} According to German sources, Władysław-Jogaila and Vytautas jointly asked [[Pope Boniface IX]] to sanction Vytautas' coronation as king of Lithuania and Ruthenia.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=89}}

Jadwiga and Jungingen met in [[Włocławek]] in the middle of June, but they did not reach a compromise.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=236–237}} The Teutonic Order entrusted Vladislaus of Opole with the task of representing their claims to Dobrzyń against Jadwiga.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=237}} Jadwiga and her husband met Sigismund of Hungary, who had returned there after his catastrophic defeat in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]], on 14 July.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=236, 238}} They seem to have reached a compromise, because Sigismund offered to mediate between Poland, Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=240}} On Jadwiga's request, Wenceslaus of Bohemia granted permission for the establishment of a college for Lithuanian students in Prague on 20 July 1397.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=247}} Jadwiga, who had spent "many sleepless nights" thinking of this project, according to herself, issued a charter of establishment for the college on 10 November.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=247}}

She opened new negotiations with the Teutonic Knights, but Konrad von Jungingen dispatched a simple knight to meet her in May 1398.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=241}} Władysław-Jogaila's cousin Vytautas also entered into negotiations with the Teutonic Knights because he wanted to unite Lithuania and Ruthenia under his rule and to receive a royal crown from the Holy See.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=242–243}} According to the chronicle of [[John of Posilge]], who was an official of the Teutonic Order, Jadwiga sent a letter to Vytautas, reminding him to pay the annual tribute that Władysław-Jogaila had granted her as [[dower]].{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=89}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=243–244}} Offended by Jadwiga's demand, Vytautas sought the opinion of the Lithuanian and Ruthenian lords who refused Jadwiga's claim to a tribute.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=89}} On 12 October 1398, he signed a peace treaty with the Teutonic Knights, without referring to Władysław-Jogaila's right to confirm it.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=242–243}} Oscar Halecki says that Posilge's "sensational story" is either an invention based on gossip or a guess by the chronicler.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=244}}

=== Pregnancy and death (1399) ===
Jadwiga was childless for over a decade, which, according to chronicles written in the Teutonic lands, caused conflicts between her and her husband.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=245}} She became pregnant in late 1398 or early 1399.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=252}} Sigismund, King of Hungary, came to Kraków in early March to negotiate for a campaign to defend [[Wallachia]] against the Ottoman Turks.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=252–253}} Vytautas, in order to bolster his authority over the Rus' principalities, decided to launch an expedition against [[Timur]], who had subdued the [[Golden Horde]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=256–257}} According to [[Jan Długosz]]'s chronicle, Jadwiga warned the Polish noblemen not to join Vytautas' campaign because it would end in failure.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=256–257}} Halecki says that the great number of Polish knights who joined Vytautas's expedition proves that Długosz's report is not reliable.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=257}}

On the occasion of the expected birth to the royal couple, Jogaila's cousin [[Vytautas]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], sent expensive gifts, including a silver cradle, to the royal court on behalf of himself and his wife, [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania|Anna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeumhistoriipolski.pl/kalendarium/8/zmarla-jadwiga-krolowa-polski-wywiad-1399-7-17.html|title=Interview about Queen Jadwiga of Poland|accessdate=23 December 2011|author=Prof. Jadwiga Krzyżaniakowa|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first horoscopes written for Jadwiga's and Jogaila's child predicted a son in mid-September 1398.&lt;ref&gt;Ozog, p. 135, 322&lt;/ref&gt; However, a girl was delivered on 22 June 1399 at [[Wawel Castle]]. Reports of the time stated that the child was born prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;Wdowiszewski, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; According to the horoscope, she was actually born slightly late. However, a due date of 18 June would rule out the suspicion of pregnancy as early as mid-September.&lt;ref&gt;The astrologer said the Queen would deliver on 18 June, but she delivered on 22 June; Śnieżyńska-Stolot, pp. 5–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The newborn princess was named Elizabeth Bonifacia ({{lang-pl|Elżbieta Bonifacja}}, {{lang-lt|Elżbieta Bonifacija}}), after Jadwiga's mother and Pope Boniface IX who, in a letter of 5 May 1399, had agreed to be godfather under the condition that the infant be called Boniface or Bonifacia. She was baptised by [[Piotr Wysz Radoliński]], [[Bishop of Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;Wdowiszewski, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; However, the infant died after only three weeks, on 13 July 1399.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}} Jadwiga, too, was on her deathbed. [[Stanisław of Skarbimierz]] expressed hope that she would survive, describing her as the spiritual mother of the poor, weak, and ill of Poland.{{sfn|Brzezińska|1999|pp=407–408}} She advised her husband to marry [[Anna of Cilli]], Casimir the Great's granddaughter,{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=264–265}} and died on 17 July 1399, four days after her newborn daughter.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=257}}

Jadwiga and her daughter were buried together in [[Wawel Cathedral]], on 24 August 1399,{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=257}} as stipulated in the Queen's last will. On 12 July 1949, 550 years later, their tomb was opened; nothing remained of the child's soft cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;Olbrycht and Kusiak, pp. 256–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achievements ===
Two leading historians, Oscar Halecki and S. Harrison Thomson, agree that Jadwiga was one of the greatest rulers of Poland, comparable to [[Bolesław the Brave]] and [[Casimir the Great]].{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=433}} Her marriage to Władysław-Jogaila enabled the [[union of Poland and Lithuania]], establishing a large state in East Central Europe.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=433}} Jadwiga's decision to marry the 'elderly' Władysław-Jogaila instead of her beloved fiancé, William of Habsburg, has often been described as a sacrifice for her country in Polish historiography.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=434}} Her biographers emphasize Jadwiga's efforts to preserve the peace with the Teutonic Order, which enabled Poland to make preparations for a decisive war against the Knights.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=436}} Jadwiga's childless death weakened Władysław-Jogaila's position, because his claim to Poland was based on their marriage.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=263}} Six days after her funeral, Władysław-Jogaila left Poland for Ruthenia, stating that he was to return to Lithuania after his wife's death.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}} The Polish lords sent their envoys to Lviv to open negotiations with him.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}} The delegates took new oaths of loyalty to him, confirming his position as king.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}} On the lords' demand, he agreed to marry Anna of Cilli.{{sfn|Frost|2015|p=91}} Their wedding was celebrated on 29 January 1402.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=265}}

Jadwiga's cultural and charitable activities were of exceptional value.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=436}} She established new hospitals, schools and churches, and restored older ones.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=436}} Jadwiga promoted the use of vernacular in church services, especially the singing of hymns in Polish.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=436}} The Scriptures were translated into Polish on her order.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=436}}

Casimir the Great had already in 1364 established the [[University of Kraków]], but it did not survive his death.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=80}} Władysław-Jogaila and Jadwiga jointly asked Pope Boniface IX to sanction the establishment of a faculty of theology in Kraków.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=262}} The pope granted their request on 11 January 1397.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=261–262}}{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=437}} Jadwiga bought houses along a central street of Kraków for the university.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=437}} However, the faculty was only set up a year after Jadwiga's death: Władysław-Jogaila issued the charter for the reestablished university on 26 July 1400.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=261–262}}{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=437}} In accordance with Jadwiga's last will, the restoration of the university was partially financed through the sale of her jewellery.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=262}}

Oscar Halecki writes that Jadwiga transmitted to the nations of East Central Europe the "universal heritage of the ''[[Christendom|respublica Christiana]]'', which in the West was then waning, but in East Central Europe started flourishing and blending with the pre-Renaissance world".{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=78}} She was closely related to the saintly 13th-century princesses, venerated in Hungary and Poland, including [[Elizabeth of Hungary]] and her nieces, [[Kinga of Poland|Kinga]] and [[Yolanda of Poland|Yolanda]], and [[Salomea of Poland]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=82, 90}} She was born to a family famed for its religious zeal.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=170–171}}{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=433}} She attended [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] every day.{{sfn|Gromada|1999|p=434}} In accordance with her family's tradition, Jadwiga was especially devoted to the Blessed [[Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=115}} An inscription engraved on her request on a precious chalice, which was placed in the [[Wawel Cathedral]], asked Our Lady to place Poland under her protection.{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=115}}

Jadwiga was venerated in Poland soon after her death.{{sfn|Brzezińska|1999|p=408}} [[Stanisław of Skarbimierz]] states that she had been "the most Christian queen" in his sermon composed for her funeral.{{sfn|Brzezińska|1999|p=408}} Paul of Zator referred to the wax figures placed by her grave.{{sfn|Brzezińska|1999|p=408}} Sermons written in the early 15th century emphasized that Jadwiga had been a representative of the traditional virtues of holy women, such as mercy and benevolence.{{sfn|Brzezińska|1999|p=408}} Jadwiga's contribution to the restoration of the University of Kraków was also mentioned by early 15th-century scholars.{{sfn|Brzezińska|1999|p=408}}

[[File:Nagrobek Jadwigi Andegaweńskiej.jpg|thumb|right|Jadwiga's sarcophagus, [[Wawel Cathedral]], [[Kraków]]]]
Numerous legends about miracles were recounted to justify her sainthood. The two best-known are those of "Jadwiga's cross" and "Jadwiga's foot":

Jadwiga often prayed before a large black [[crucifix]] hanging in the north aisle of Wawel Cathedral. During one of these prayers, the [[Christ]] on the cross is said to have spoken to her. The crucifix, "Saint Jadwiga's cross", is still there, with her relics beneath it. Because of this event, she is considered a medieval mystic.{{sfn|Jasienica|1988}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}} According to another legend, Jadwiga took a piece of jewellery from her foot and gave it to a poor stonemason who had begged for her help. When the king left, he noticed her footprint in the plaster floor of his workplace, even though the plaster had already hardened before her visit. The supposed footprint, known as "Jadwiga's foot", can still be seen in [[Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Krakow|one of Kraków's churches]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In yet another legend, Jadwiga was taking part in a Corpus Christi Day procession when a coppersmith's son drowned by falling into a river. Jadwiga threw her mantle over the boy's body, and he regained life.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic World Culture Chapter XXIII, pp. 146–151&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 1979 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed at her sarcophagus; and the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] officially affirmed her [[beatification]] on 8 August 1986. 
The Pope went on to canonize Jadwiga in Kraków on 8 June 1997.&lt;ref name="Saint"/&gt;

Detective Garda '''Adrian Donohoe''' (14 January 1972 – 25 January 2013) was an Irish police [[detective]] working for the [[Garda Síochána]], the national police service of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. He was attached to [[Dundalk]] Garda Station in [[County Louth]], and was fatally shot in Bellurgan, County Louth (near [[Jenkinstown, County Louth|Jenkinstown]]) on 25 January 2013 by an armed gang of five people during a robbery on a [[credit union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detective Garda killed in Co Louth shooting|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0125/364600-garda-louth-shot/|work=25 January 2013|publisher=RTÉ News|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first garda officer to be shot dead in the line of duty since 1996, and was afforded a full [[state funeral]].

On 4 March 2018, 27-year-old Aaron Brady from New Road, Crossmaglen, County Armagh, was charged with the capital murder of a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of their duty before Dundalk District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrian Donohoe: Crossmaglen man charged with murder|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43279863|accessdate=5 March 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Adrian Donohoe was born on 14 January 1972 in [[Kilnaleck|Kilnaleck, County Cavan]] to parents Peggy and Hugh Donohoe. He grew up on the family farm with his three brothers - Alan, Colm and Martin, and two sisters - Anne and Mary. He was a keen [[Gaelic football]]er, and at {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|2|abbr=on}} he played midfield for his local club before going on to represent [[Cavan GAA]] at Under-21 level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lally|first=Conor|title=State funeral of murdered Garda held in Co Louth|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0130/breaking2.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Irish Times|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended nearby primary and secondary schools, before joining the Garda Síochána in 1994. Two of his brothers also joined the force, and he met his future wife Caroline at the [[Garda Síochána College]] in [[Templemore]], [[County Tipperary]].

Caroline Donohoe, from [[County Clare]] and who also had family members serving with the Gardaí, was stationed with the [[Garda National Immigration Bureau]] (GNIB) in Dundalk Garda Station - the same building where her husband worked – and the couple had two young children, a boy and a girl aged 6 and 7 respectively, at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdered garda dedicated his life to GAA, the Guards and his family |url=http://www.sundayworld.com/columnists/index.php?aid=14341 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411223957/http://www.sundayworld.com/columnists/index.php?aid=14341 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=18 February 2013 |newspaper=Sunday World |date=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donohoe was described as a "father figure" in his community, and played and coached for his local GAA club, St Patrick’s GFC, on the [[Cooley Peninsula]]. He served his entire 19-year career in Dundalk, rising to the rank of detective. The Donohoes lived 4&amp;nbsp;km away from where the shooting occurred, and both their children attended Bellurgan National School, directly across the road from the incident.

==Shooting and robbery==
Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and his colleague Detective Garda Joe Ryan were on a routine two-person [[Cash-in-transit|cash escort]] on the evening of Friday, 25 January 2013. Ryan was driving an [[unmarked police car]] (a silver [[Ford Mondeo]]), both detectives were wearing civilian clothing and carrying concealed police issue sidearms (9mm [[SIG Sauer P226]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adrian Donohoe was diligent, popular officer: Commissioner Callinan|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/adrian-donohoe-was-diligent-popular-officer-commissioner-callinan-582621.html|work=26 January 2013|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garda Síochána are primarily an unarmed police force, however certain units of the service are armed (such as detective units) and up to 25% of members are licensed to carry firearms. The pair were en route to meet local credit union officials at [[Omeath]], Cooley and the Lordship Credit Union in Bellurgan, who would then travel in a three car convoy to a bank in Dundalk town to lodge takings in a nightsafe. This was regular practice, and the protocol had been recently upgraded from an unarmed, uniformed garda escort to an armed, plain-clothes detective escort following a robbery that happened at the credit union 18 months prior, when €62,000 in cash and cheques was taken. There were no casualties in the previous crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taoiseach condemns killing of garda as manhunt continues|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/taoiseach-condemns-killing-of-garda-as-manhunt-continues-29023106.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan entered the car park of the Lordship Credit Union premises and they parked, as did another car that was accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured [[Volkswagen Passat]] - that had been waiting stationary on the [[hard shoulder]] of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclavas]], while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his door and stepped out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range in the back of the head with a [[shotgun|long barrelled shotgun]] by a masked raider. A single shot was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Hubert|title=Second brutal slaying of a garda in Louth|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/droghedaindependent/news/second-brutal-slaying-of-a-garda-in-louth-29029766.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Drogheda Independent|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Det Garda Adrian Donohoe to be laid to rest on Wednesday|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/funeral-garda-adrian-donohoe-771793-Jan2013/|work=28 January 2013|publisher=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.

The emergency services pronounced Donohoe dead shortly after their arrival, despite the frantic efforts of his colleague Ryan to save his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gardaí probing death of Adrian Donohoe make new appeal|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/adrian-donohoe-was-diligent-popular-officer-commissioner-callinan-582621.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garda Headquarters scrambled all available units in an attempt to catch the fleeing suspects, and alerted the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI). However, it is understood they had escaped to [[Northern Ireland]] before the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|border]] was secured by police on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garda Press Office|title=Update on Fatal Shooting of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe|url=http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=10667|work=28 January 2013|publisher=Garda Síochána na hÉireann|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of Ireland-United Kingdom border can be crossed by car in around 10 minutes from the Lordship Credit Union, and neither force is allowed to enter neighbouring territory. A [[Garda Air Support Unit|Garda helicopter]] briefly entered UK airspace with permission during the search. A PSNI helicopter was also deployed during the search in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutton |first=Brian |title=Tributes to slain garda at state funeral |url=http://www.irishecho.com.au/tag/detective-garda-adrian-donohoe |accessdate=18 February 2013 |newspaper=Irish Echo |date=31 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104164945/http://www.irishecho.com.au/tag/detective-garda-adrian-donohoe |archivedate= 4 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
One hour after the fatal incident - at 10:30 pm on Friday, 25 January 2013 - a car matching the description of that used in the credit union hold-up was found burnt-out on Cumsons Road, Newtownhamilton, a remote forested laneway near the villages of [[Darkley]] and [[Keady]], in south [[County Armagh]] in Northern Ireland. The PSNI carried out an extensive technical examination of the car and the surrounding area the following day. This area became a focus of the investigation. The vehicle, a "graphite navy blue" in colour 2008 [[Dublin]] registered [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[Volkswagen Passat]], was linked by detectives to the murder and it was confirmed that it had been stolen from the [[Clogherhead]] area of County Louth earlier that week, between 11:30 pm on Tuesday, 22 January  and 4:30 am on Wednesday, 23 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fresh appeal over murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21395708|work=9 February 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardaí and the PSNI believe another getaway car was used to collected those involved in the crime after setting alight the original getaway car, and that there was more than five suspects involved in the overall perpetration of the crime.

A full [[forensic examination]] was carried out at the scene over three days by the [[Garda Technical Bureau]], assisted by the Divisional Scenes of Crime Unit. The Divisional Search Team was called in to search the vicinity of the scene. The hammer used by the raiders to break the window of one of the credit union cars was recovered at the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tributes paid to Garda detective |url=http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=93918 |work=26 January 2013 |publisher=TV3 News |accessdate=18 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201100429/http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=93918 |archivedate= 1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-mortem on the body of Donohoe took place at [[Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital (Drogheda)|Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital]] in Drogheda by the State Pathologist, Professor [[Marie Cassidy]] of the [[State Pathologist's Office]], who also visited the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdered Irish policeman's partner threatened as he ran to help dying detective after botched robbery|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2268932/Adrian-Donohue-Murdered-Irish-policemans-partner-threatened-ran-help-dying-detective.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=27 January 2013|author=Debbie McCann|author2=Alison O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is standard practice when a garda loses their life, the [[Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission]] (GSOC) was notified, and their officials visited the scene.

Then Garda [[Police commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Martin Callinan]] (who retired in March 2014) attended a case conference at Dundalk Garda Station on the weekend after Donohoe's death, where an incident room was established for the duration of the investigation. Commissioner Callinan announced the allocation of 150 senior detectives to the case. The investigation team would be led by Assistant Commissioner Kieran Kenny of the Northern Region, Chief Superintendent Pat McGee of the County Louth Division, Superintendent Gerry Curley and Detective Superintendent John O'Reilly of Dundalk Garda Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We know Adrian Donohoe's killers|url=http://www.thesun.ie/irishsol/homepage/news/4786284/We-know-Adrian-Donohoes-killers.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=The Irish Sun|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; National specialist units were assigned to the investigation, including the [[Special Detective Unit]] (SDU), [[National Bureau of Criminal Investigation]] (NBCI) and [[Organised Crime Unit]] (OCU). The force's armed intervention teams - [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|Emergency Response Unit]] (ERU) and [[Regional Support Unit]] (RSU) - were placed on alert in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possibility That Murdered Detective Knew His Killer |url=http://www.citizensfreepressireland.com/2013_02_01_archive.html |work=1 February 2013 |publisher=Citizen's Free Press Ireland |accessdate=18 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208105734/http://www.citizensfreepressireland.com/2013_02_01_archive.html |archivedate= 8 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of the investigation, there were over 1,000 Garda officers attached to the investigation, making it one of the largest criminal investigations ever undertaken in the history of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O’Doherty|first1=Caroline|title=Community ‘still hurting’ over Adrian’s death|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/community-still-hurting-over-adrians-death-308708.html|accessdate=24 January 2015|publisher=The Irish Examiner|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardaí established that five males were involved in the shooting and robbery itself, and belong to a larger criminal gang operating in the border region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gardaí probing death of Adrian Donohoe make new appeal |url=http://www.kildare-nationalist.ie/2013/02/08/gardai-probing-death-of-adrian-donohoe-make-new-appeal/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412225048/http://www.kildare-nationalist.ie/2013/02/08/gardai-probing-death-of-adrian-donohoe-make-new-appeal/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=23 February 2013 |newspaper=Kildare Nationalist |date=8 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those responsible were believed to have fled to Northern Ireland after the killing, and remained there for some weeks. The leader of the five-man gang and main suspect for the murder was identified as a young man from the [[Crossmaglen]] area of south Armagh. It is understood he was known to Detective Donohoe, providing a possible [[Motive (law)|motive]] for his murder. However, Donohoe was originally not scheduled to take part in the credit union cash escort, making a late shift change with the officer who was originally scheduled to take part in the escort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cusack|first=Jim|title=Detectives know gunman's identity but extradition may pose problem|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/garda-hunt-for-adrians-killers-being-wound-down-29090533.html|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=Independent|date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February, over a month after Donohoe died, Gardaí held a press briefing at the [[Dublin Metropolitan Area#Garda usage|Dublin Metropolitan Region]] (DMR) Headquarters in [[Harcourt Street]], Dublin City. There was a renewed appeal for information made, and two replica exhibits of evidence were shown to the media for the first time. A precision [[mallet|panel beating hammer]] with a black rubber handle, a red painted section and a soft rubber head was found at the scene, and police asked the public for help in tracing its origins. Similar mallets are used by [[panel beater]]s or mechanics repairing motorcycles. Also, a distinctive green "Cosatto" high-backed [[Child safety seat|children's car booster seat]] carrying a "Little Monster" motif as well as a graphic of a monster was in the car when it was stolen. The child car seat - suitable for babies and young children - cost €119 to buy, and may have been dumped, offered for sale or given as a gift as investigators believe was taken out of the stolen vehicle before it was used in the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewed Appeal For Information on Garda Killing |url=http://www.98fm.com/2013/category-news-sport/renewed-appeal-for-information-on-garda-killing/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130410041501/http://www.98fm.com/2013/category-news-sport/renewed-appeal-for-information-on-garda-killing/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 April 2013 |work=26 February 2013 |publisher=98 FM Radio |accessdate=26 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April, Gardaí and the PSNI informed the public that the investigation teams were looking for information in relation to a white coloured [[Heavy Goods Vehicle]] (HGV) that was parked on the Shean Road, [[Forkhill]], Armagh in Northern Ireland either side of 9.45 pm on 25 January 2013, the night Donohoe lost his life. The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle. The two police forces added that they wanted to speak to anyone who owned the truck, had recovered or serviced it, or anyone who saw any activity of this nature on the Shean Road on the night of 25 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child seat clue in murder inquiry|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/child-seat-clue-in-murder-inquiry-29096245.html|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year on from the murder of Detective Donohoe, the Garda Commissioner visited Dundalk Garda Station, and provided an update on the progress of the murder inquiry. Martin Callinan reiterated his commitment to bringing those responsible for the crime to justice, and revealed the international dimensions to the case, involving police forces and law enforcement agencies from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Netherlands]], [[United States]] and [[Australia]], as well as [[Europol]] and [[Interpol]]. The Commissioner also praised the PSNI for their involvement in the investigation. By the 25 January 2014, the anniversary of Donohoe's death, over 4,000 investigative tasks had been undertaken, 4,000 "structured" lines of enquiry lines were pursued, 2,100 statements taken, in excess of 800 people interviewed, 400,000 hours of CCTV reviewed (the equivalent to 45 [[man year|man-years]]), 1,200 exhibits of evidence gathered and more than 30 searches carried out under warrants during the 12 months of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garda statement on anniversary of murder of Detective Garda  Adrian Donohoe|url=http://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/garda-statement-on-anniversary-of-murder-of-detective-garda-adrian-donohoe.pdf|work=24 January 2014|publisher=An Garda Síochána|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The death of Adrian Donohoe was strongly condemned by the [[President of Ireland]], [[Michael D. Higgins]] and the [[Taoiseach]], [[Enda Kenny]]. Cabinet ministers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland also spoke out against the crime. [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]] [[Alan Shatter]] said that those responsible for the murder had planned it, knew that there would be police attending the credit union for an escort, and that the officers were [[ambush]]ed. He warned that the perpetrators would each face the mandatory 40 years in prison for killing a garda, regardless of who fired the shot if they did not turn themselves in. Commissioner Martin Callinan vowed to hunt down and apprehend the killers. The PSNI, under Chief Constable [[Matt Baggott]], pledged their full cooperation and support to bring to justice the murderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adrian Donohoe Killing Condemned By Irish PM|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1043114/adrian-donohoe-killing-condemned-by-irish-pm|work=26 January 2013|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was widespread shock and outrage among the public on the island of Ireland following the shooting dead of Donohoe, and it was considered a "national tragedy". The [[Death of Jerry McCabe|last garda to be shot dead serving the state]] was Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in June 1996, by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in [[County Limerick]]. Jerry McCabe's widow Anne McCabe spoke of her sympathy for the Donohoe family, and retired Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan - who was shot but survived the same incident as Jerry McCabe - signed a book of condolence for the family, friends and colleagues of the fallen officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry McCabe's widow calls for tough sentences for garda killers|url=http://www.newstalk.ie/Jerry-McCabes-widow-calls-for-tough-sentences-for-garda-killers|work=28 January 2013|publisher=Newstalk Radio|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish television programme ''[[Crimecall]]'' aired on [[RTÉ Television|RTÉ]] in February, featuring Superintendent David Taylor from the Garda Press Office appealing to the public for their help in solving the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fresh calls for information over Garda murder |url=http://insideireland.ie/2013/02/18/fresh-calls-for-information-over-garda-murder-86714/ |work=18 February 2013 |publisher=Inside Ireland Website |accessdate=18 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308055033/http://insideireland.ie/2013/02/18/fresh-calls-for-information-over-garda-murder-86714/ |archivedate= 8 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Facebook]] tribute to Donohoe amassed over 40,000 signatures within days of the killing. The [[Irish League of Credit Unions]] offered a reward of €50,000 for information leading to arrests and prosecutions in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Unions offer €50,000 reward for information on Garda murder|url=http://www.joe.ie/news-politics/current-affairs/credit-unions-offer-e50000-reward-for-information-on-garda-murder-0033456-1|work=30 January 2013|publisher=Joe.ie|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reward was added to by [[Crimestoppers]], who put forward a "substantial, five-figure sum" a month after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We’re still hunting garda killers |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/were-still-hunting-garda-killers-29092157.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420081213/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/were-still-hunting-garda-killers-29092157.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=25 February 2013 |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph |date=25 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2013, the family of Adrian Donohoe were presented with a special Garda remembrance medal in his honour. The medal was awarded to his widow, Caroline, during the annual Garda Memorial Day commemoration service held at [[Dublin Castle]]. The ceremony remembers all 87 members of the Gardaí who were killed in the line of duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe's family receive medal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22580068|work=19 May 2013|publisher=BBC News NI|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donohoe was posthumously awarded a [[People of the Year Award]] for his bravery and fearlessness in September 2013, eight months after his unlawful death. The award was presented in [[Citywest]], Dublin by [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] personality [[Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh]], and was accepted by Caroline Donohoe. She spoke of Adrian as "the love of my life" and "the best father that any child could have", adding "I will miss him every minute of every day as long as I live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘I will miss him every minute of every day’|url=http://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/local-news/i-will-miss-him-every-minute-of-every-day-1-5498563|work=17 September 2013|publisher=The Dundalk Democrat Newspaper|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
Detective Garda Donohoe was given a full [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] on 30 January 2013. The funeral mass took place at St Joseph's Redemptorist Church in Dundalk, and he was buried at Lordship Cemetery. There was an estimated 5,000 people present at the funeral, which included 3,500 Gardaí (2,500 uniformed and 1,000 plain-clothes) and 1,500 members of the locality and further afield. More lined the route as the procession made its way to the graveyard. It was the largest funeral in Ireland for a number of years. Among those in attendance were President Michael D. Higgins, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, [[Tánaiste]] [[Eamon Gilmore]], Minister for Justice Alan Shatter and several senior government ministers, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, [[Irish Defence Forces]] [[Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces (Ireland)|Chief of Staff]] Lieutenant General [[Sean McCann (soldier)|Sean McCann]], Cardinal [[Seán Brady]], [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Secretary of State]] [[Theresa Villiers]], Northern Ireland Justice Minister [[David Ford]] and PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott. Fr Michael Cusack presided over the mass. Donohoe's colleague Joe Ryan, who was present when he was shot dead, was a [[pall-bearer]] at the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Toole|first=Michael|title=Thousands turn out for funeral of slain garda Adrian Donohoe|url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/thousands-turn-out-for-funeral-of-slain-garda-adrian-donohoe/|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Irish Daily Star|date=31 January 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412231229/http://www.thestar.ie/star/thousands-turn-out-for-funeral-of-slain-garda-adrian-donohoe/#|archive-date=12 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police inquiries==
In late February 2013, six pre-planned searches were carried out in the Dundalk area by Gardaí investigating the murder. Two men - a father and son in their 70s and 30s - were detained under terrorism legislation ([[Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998]]) and held at [[Drogheda]] Garda Station, where they could be detained for a period of 7 days without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foy|first=Ken|title=Hammer is found at scene where Garda Donohoe murdered|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/hammer-is-found-at-scene-where-garda-donohoe-murdered-29095713.html|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=Herald|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Garda spokesperson said that the arrests targeted criminal and subversive activity in the area, and were not directly related to the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two arrests in Co Louth over criminality |url=http://www.u.tv/News/Two-arrests-in-Co-Louth-over-criminality/9c776e9f-c286-44a1-bceb-21a4a04665e2 |work=21 February 2013 |publisher=UTV News |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103234748/http://www.u.tv/News/Two-arrests-in-Co-Louth-over-criminality/9c776e9f-c286-44a1-bceb-21a4a04665e2 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were released two days later, and a file was sent forward to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions#Ireland|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) pending possible charges. Both men were suspected of running a vehicle theft ring, supplying stolen cars to other criminals, and that the car used in Garda Donohoe's murder may have originated from this illegal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Men Released Over Garda Adrian Donohoe Murder|url=http://www.belfastdaily.co.uk/2013/02/23/two-men-released-over-garda-adrian-donohoe-murder/|work=23 February 2013|publisher=Belfast Daily|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first week of April 2013, a number of planned raids were carried out by Gardaí in County Louth. Detectives seized mobile phones and laptop computers in a raid at a property in Hackballscross, Dundalk and seized firearms, explosives and illegal drugs during another raid at a premises in Kilsaran, [[Castlebellingham]]. No arrests were made, but the teams involved in the searches were investigating criminal elements operating in the border regions between County Louth and County Armagh, including the gang said to be responsible for Donohoe's murder. Significant forensic examinations took place following the searches in both locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cops hunting killers of Garda Adrian Donohoe crack down with local raids |url=http://www.sundayworld.com/columnists/sw-irish-crime.php?preview=15146 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |newspaper=Sunday World |date=9 April 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in April, heavily armed members from the PSNI Special Operations Branch (C4) raided four houses in south County Armagh and seized mobile phones and documentation, as well as taking away other material for forensic examination. Senior officers informed journalists that the searches had been intelligence led, and were focused on suspected criminals or associates of members of the gang believed to have been responsible for the murder of Donohoe. No-one was detained during the four searches, but officers said that the operation's primary objective was to gather evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brady |first=Tom |title=Net closes on garda killers after PSNI raids |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/net-closes-on-garda-killers-after-psni-raids-29182580.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130504222155/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/net-closes-on-garda-killers-after-psni-raids-29182580.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph |date=9 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-up operations to the PSNI seizures were carried out a number of weeks later south of the border by Gardaí. Several search warrants were executed by investigators in the [[Carlingford, County Louth|Carlingford]] area of Louth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Searches in Carlingford where officer was murdered|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/searches-in-carlingford-where-officer-was-murdered-1-5044153|work=29 April 2013|publisher=Belfast Newsletter|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May 2013, numerous searches were undertaken by Gardaí in the town of [[Faughart]], near Dundalk. Investigating detectives were backed-up by the Emergency Response Unit, Regional Support Unit, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Garda Stolen Motor Vehicle Investigation Unit, Divisional Search Team and the Divisional Scenes of Crime Unit. The Garda Press Office did not disclose any results of the searches, citing "operational reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe murder: Searches in Faughart, County Louth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22412153|work=4 May 2013|publisher=BBC News Europe|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
        
The investigation is ongoing.

==Suspects==
Five main suspects were identified by Gardaí and the PSNI in the course of the investigation into the murder of Donohoe, all of whom suspected of being present during the fatal shooting of the 41-year-old father-of-two, and the subsequent theft of cash and cheques from the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspects in garda death case identified|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/suspects-in-garda-death-case-identified-1.1253979|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=4 February 2013|author=Conor Lally|author2=Fiona Gartland}}&lt;/ref&gt; All five suspects were classified as young males, from either side of the Louth-Armagh border, part of a larger criminal gang of around 15 to 20 people, with connections through their family and acquaintances to [[Dissident Republican|dissident republican paramilitary and terror organisations]]. A number of the suspects had previous criminal convictions, as well as being implicated in other criminal investigations. Police officers from the Republic and Northern Ireland established the identity of the suspect who fired the fatal shot, understood to be the leader of the five-man gang, as a male in his early 20s, and who grew up in Crossmaglen, County Armagh, with strong links to the [[Crossmaglen Rangers GAC|Crossmaglen Rangers]] Gaelic Athletic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Toole |first=Michael |title=Adrian Donohoe suspect’s father is well-known club GAA man |url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/adrian-donohoe-suspects-father-is-well-known-club-gaa-man/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702092727/http://www.thestar.ie/star/adrian-donohoe-suspects-father-is-well-known-club-gaa-man/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2013 |newspaper=The Star |date=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gang also included a pair of brothers. None of the five main suspects have been arrested, and it is believed that Gardaí are preparing a "watertight" case to present to the Director of Public Prosecutions before any moves are made to apprehend those responsible. Such is the nature of the crime, that any suspect charged with murder or conspiracy to commit murder of a serving member of the Garda Síochána would be tried in the non-jury [[Special Criminal Court]] in Dublin, facing a sentence of 40 years imprisonment in the maximum security [[Portlaoise Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tallant |first=Nicola |title=Net closing on gang of cop killers |url=http://www.sundayworld.com/top-stories/news/net-closing-on-gang-of-cop-killers |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131230225858/http://www.sundayworld.com/top-stories/news/net-closing-on-gang-of-cop-killers |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 December 2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |newspaper=Sunday World |date=10 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged that a number of the suspects made prepared statements to police on both sides of the border, with their legal representatives present, in the weeks after the murder. They were then questioned under caution by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Toole|first=Michael|title=Gang thugs: We didn't kill Adrian Donohoe|url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/gang-thugs-we-didnt-kill-adrian-donohoe/|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=Irish Star|date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the suspects live and travel between the Republic and Northern Ireland, extraditions may have to be sought to bring those responsible to justice in the Republic of Ireland. An Extradition Agreement in place between the Irish and British governments means that extradition orders can only be made when the police force requesting the extradition has sufficient evidence to charge the suspect, and can only question them after they are charged in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Toole|first=Michael|title=Joe Ryan back on frontline to hunt his pal Adrian Donohoe’s killers|url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/joe-ryan-back-on-frontline-to-hunt-his-pal-adrian-donohoes-killers/|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=The Irish Star|date=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the prime suspect in the unlawful killing of Donohoe fled to the United States, according to senior Garda sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime suspect flees to US|url=http://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/local/prime-suspect-flees-to-us-1-5045171|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=Dundalk Democrat|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man - in his 20s and from south Armagh - travelled from Northern Ireland to mainland Britain, before boarding a flight to [[New York City]] using a British passport. Police in Ireland, Britain and the United States were powerless to prevent the suspect travelling because there was no warrant for his arrest. However, it is known that the suspect therefore failed to show for a court sitting in Ireland for separate offences that took place before the incident in Bellurgan, County Louth. Once the suspect landed in the US, security services were made aware of his presence by the Gardaí. The [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) were furnished with the details of the suspect's identity, and the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) was tasked with tracking the whereabouts of the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Marshals given details of suspect in Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe case|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/US-Marshals-given-details-of-suspect-in-Detective-Garda-Adrian-Donohoe-case-206242581.html|work=6 May 2013|publisher=Irish Central Magazine|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garda detectives also flew to the US, to help authorities trace the suspect's movements. The man was given a holiday visa by US officials upon entering the country.

Another accomplice is understood to have fled to [[Boston]] in April, before reuniting with the prime suspect in New York. In September, the girlfriend of the prime suspect - who is also herself under investigation after she provided an alibi for her boyfriend when questioned as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder to the PSNI - travelled to New York. US authorities are monitoring their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detectives fly to US over Donohoe murder|url=http://www.anglocelt.ie/news/breakingnews/articles/2013/07/23/4016831-detectives-fly-to-us-over-donohoe-murder/|work=26 July 2013|publisher=The Anglo-Celt|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, two suspects in the murder investigation were questioned and forced to provide statements in New York to investigating Gardaí and American authorities. Senior detectives from the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation travelled to the United States in late 2013, and in December they - accompanied by US law enforcement - brought two suspects in for questioning from a property in New York. Both suspects refused to answer questions, however under US law they were compelled to provide written witness statements about the incident before being released without charge. The suspects were Irish males in their early 20s, and had fled to the US following the murder of Donohoe. The authorities are said to be liaising about extraditing the suspects back to Ireland, but must wait until the Director of Public Prosecutions rules that charges will be brought. If the suspects fail to leave the US before their visas expire, they will be deported from the country back to Ireland or the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bracken|first=Ali|title=Gardaí question two men in New York over murder of Detective Adrian Donohoe as investigation intensifies|url=http://www.pressdisplay.com/pressdisplay/showarticle.aspx?article=a22afac5-5394-456a-a16e-c7ed2d7dd5c1&amp;key=st85%2fBLydMdCpzYfYK6gGw%3d%3d&amp;issue=89492013122600000000001001|accessdate=27 December 2013|newspaper=Irish Daily Mail|date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the suspects in the US are on [[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]] visas.&lt;ref name="adrian donohoe 1"/&gt;

Two other male suspects in the murder case travelled to Australia, one in April 2013 (who then later fled to the US) and one in June 2013, in an attempt to avoid prosecution. The pair were suspected of involvement in the shooting and burglary, but they were not arrested and no warrant has been issued. A team of detectives from the Gardaí travelled to [[Sydney]] in January 2014, and one of the suspects was forced to provide a witness statement to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foy|first=Ken|title=Gardaí quiz Adrian Donohoe suspect in Australia|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gardai-quiz-adrian-donohoe-suspect-in-australia-29943457.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that when his visa expired, he would be deported if he failed to leave the country of his own accord.

One of the suspects, a man in his early 20s, remained in [[County Down]] in Northern Ireland. He has been questioned by the PSNI about his involvement in the crime. He has since been prosecuted in connection with rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahon|first=Cathal|title=Thug suspected of murdering Adrian Donohoe becomes a dad|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/thug-suspected-murdering-adrian-donohoe-3055672|accessdate=25 January 2014|newspaper=Irish Mirror|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the fiancee of one of the suspected killers was arrested by police in the US on immigration offences after Gardai sought an extradition request to have her brought back to Ireland to be charged before a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Shea|first1=Cormac|title=American police arrest girlfriend of one of the suspected killers of Garda Adrian Donohoe|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/american-police-arrest-girlfriend-one-9137043|accessdate=18 November 2016|publisher=Irish Mirror|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=David|title=Fiancee of Garda Adrian Donohoe murder suspect arrested in US|url=http://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/home/221627/fiancee-of-garda-adrian-donohoe-murder-suspect-arrested-in-us.html|accessdate=18 November 2016|publisher=Dundalk Democrat|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was deported to Ireland in January.

===2017 US Arrest===
On Thursday, 18 May 2017, a prime murder suspect was detained in New York by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agents for violating immigration rules and was deported back to Ireland. Unlike extradition proceedings, deportations are implemented relatively quickly. The arrest was made as a result of a targeted investigation involving Irish and US law enforcement. US police were tracking the movements of the suspect on behalf of Gardai. The [[Embassy of the United States, Dublin|US Embassy in Dublin]] confirmed that there had been close cooperation involving Gardai and US authorities on the matter for "some time". Senior Garda officers described the development as highly significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunne|first1=Seán|title=US to shortly deport Adrian Donohoe murder suspect|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/us-to-shortly-deport-adrian-donohoe-murder-suspect-1.3089314|accessdate=19 May 2017|publisher=The Irish Times|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual was arrested and brought before a judge in Ireland after he failed to turn up in court after he was convicted of charges in relation to a separate matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect in Garda Donohoe investigation arrested in US|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0519/876516-adrian-donohoe-arrest/|accessdate=19 May 2017|publisher=RTE News|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 25 February 2018, the "chief suspect" in the murder case - a 27-year-old man - was arrested by the investigation team at 7.15pm outside [[Wheatfield Prison]] after completing a sentence for road traffic offences, and brought to Dundalk Garda Station, where he was questioned for a period of 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest made in investigation into murder of Adrian Donohoe|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/0225/943493-adrian-donohoe/|accessdate=25 February 2018|publisher=RTE News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lally|first1=Conor|title=Man arrested over murder of Garda Adrian Donohoe|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/man-arrested-over-murder-of-garda-adrian-donohoe-1.3405366|accessdate=25 February 2018|publisher=The Irish Times|date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suspects' period of detention was extended after gardai made an application to the District court.

==Aaron Brady charged with murder==
On Sunday, 4 March 2018 at a special sitting of Dundalk District Court, 27-year-old '''Aaron Brady''', a dual citizen of Ireland and the United Kingdom, from New Road, Crossmaglen, Co. Armagh was charged with the capital murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe in the course of his duty.&lt;ref name="charge 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lally|first1=Conor|title=Man (27) charged with murdering Det Garda Adrian Donohoe in 2013|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/man-27-charged-with-murdering-det-garda-adrian-donohoe-in-2013-1.3414809|accessdate=5 March 2018|publisher=The Irish Times|date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Inspector Pat Marry said that when the charge was put to Mr Brady he said: ''"I strongly deny any involvement in the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe."''&lt;ref name="charge 1"/&gt;

He was remanded in custody to appear before Cloverhill District Court on 9 March.&lt;ref name="charge 1"/&gt;

There was a heavy Garda presence at the court where a large number of members of the public gathered and members of the US Department of Homeland Security were in attendance.&lt;ref name="charge 1"/&gt;

==Involvement of US Homeland Security &amp; ICE==
Following the charging of Aaron Brady with murder, Acting Garda Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin and senior investigating Gardai met with Alysa D. Erichs, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and her team of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agents at Dundalk Garda Station.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York, HSI Attaché London and HSI Boston worked jointly with the Garda Síochána in relation to the international investigation. The investigation revealed that Brady was living in New York, entered the country under the Visa Waiver Program but failed to leave upon expiration of the waiver, making him amenable for arrest and removal from the United States for immigration violations. In May 2017 HSI New York, with assistance from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in New York, were able to arrest Brady by citing an expired visa. He remained in ERO custody until he was removed from the United States, escorted to Dublin and arrested by Garda Detectives upon arrival.

Alysa D. Erichs, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director of Homeland Security Investigations said in a statement: ''"The United States will not be a safe haven for cop killers. When it comes to cop killers, there are no boundaries between us. The Garda is remaining true to their promise to the Donohoe family and to the Irish people. It is an honor for HSI to have worked alongside our Garda partners to investigate, locate, arrest and deport Aaron Brady to Ireland."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ICE assists Irish Garda investigation to arrest chief suspect in Irish Detective’s murder|url=https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-assists-irish-garda-investigation-arrest-chief-suspect-irish-detectives-murder|accessdate=5 March 2018|agency=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to media reports, the rest of the suspected gang members are currently in the US, Australia and Northern Ireland and thousands of lines of inquiry are being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Paul|title=Gardaí meet US official in Donohoe investigation|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2018/0305/945158-adrian-donohoe/|accessdate=5 March 2018|publisher=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardai have vowed to pursue those involved "to the ends of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keogh|first1=Elaine|title=Gardaí will pursue Adrian Donohoe’s killers ‘to ends of the earth’|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/garda%C3%AD-will-pursue-adrian-donohoe-s-killers-to-ends-of-the-earth-1.3368778|accessdate=5 March 2018|publisher=The Irish Times|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Fechter''' (14 January 1944 – 17 August 1962) was a [[Germany|German]] [[bricklayer]] who became the [[List of deaths at the Berlin Wall|twenty-seventh known person to die]] at the [[Berlin Wall]]. Fechter was 18 years-old when he was shot and killed by [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|East German border guards]] while trying to cross over to [[West Berlin]].

==Biography==
{{Main|Berlin Wall}}

Peter Fechter was born on 14 January 1944, in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], during the final years of [[World War II]]. Fechter was the third of four children, and raised in the [[Weissensee (Berlin)|Weißensee]] district of Berlin. His father was a [[mechanical engineer]] and his mother was a [[saleswoman]]. Fechter finished school at the age of 14, and graduated as a [[bricklayer]]. After World War II had ended, Weißensee was located in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation zone of Berlin]] when the city was divided during the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied Occupation]], with the Soviet zone later becoming [[East Berlin]] in [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Germany,  Postwar Occupation and Division|url=http://motherearthtravel.com/history/germany/history-15.htm|website=motherearthtravel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fechter's eldest sister had married and now lived in [[West Berlin]], where she was regularly visited by her parents and siblings. On 13 August 1961, the East German authorities abruptly closed the border and began construction of the [[Berlin Wall]], effectively separating Fechter and his family from his sister in West Berlin. Fechter's colleague, Helmut Kulbeik, later stated that he and Fechter had been contemplating [[Republikflucht|defecting to West Berlin]] for a while, and that they had also explored the border installations, but no concrete planning was ever made at the time. Shortly after, Fechter was denied a legally sanctioned trip to [[West Germany]] by his company, despite receiving good judgement.

==Death==
[[File:Body of Peter Fechter lying next to Berlin Wall.jpg|thumb|Fechter's body lying next to the [[Berlin Wall]] after being shot in 1962 while trying to escape to the West]]

On 17 August 1962, around one year after the construction of the Berlin Wall, Fechter and Helmut Kulbeik attempted to flee from East Germany. The plan was to hide in a [[carpenter]]'s workshop near the wall on Zimmerstrasse and, after observing the border guards from there, to jump out of a window into the "death-strip" (a strip running between the main wall and a parallel fence which they had recently started to construct), run across it, and climb over the two metre (6.5&amp;nbsp;ft) wall topped with [[barbed wire]] into the [[Kreuzberg]] district of West Berlin near [[Checkpoint Charlie]].&lt;ref name="aldy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wirth|first1=Jennifer|title=This East Berliner Tried To Make A Run For Freedom, But Was Shot And Left To Slowly Die|url=http://www.allday.com/this-east-berliner-tried-to-make-a-run-for-freedom-but-was-shot-and-le-2180840860.html|website=All Day|language=en|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their plan was initially successful as both Fechter and Kulbeik reached the final wall, but as they began to climb the [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|East German border guards]] fired at them. Although Kulbeik succeeded in crossing over the wall, Fechter was shot in the [[pelvis]] while still climbing, in plain view of hundreds of witnesses. He fell back into the death-strip on the East German side, where he remained in view of West German onlookers, including journalists. Despite his screams, Fechter received no medical assistance from the East German side, and could not be tended to by those on the West side. West Berlin police threw him [[bandages]], which he could not reach, and he [[Exsanguination|bled to death]] after approximately one hour. As a result of his death, hundreds in West Berlin formed a spontaneous demonstration, shouting "Murderers!" at the border guards.&lt;ref name="aldy" /&gt; The lack of medical assistance for Peter Fechter was attributed to mutual fear: Western bystanders were apparently prevented at gunpoint from assisting him, although according to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, a [[second lieutenant]] of the [[US Army]] on the scene received specific orders from the US Commandant in West Berlin to stand firm and do nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martyr at the Berlin Wall {{!}} HistoryNet|url=http://www.historynet.com/martyr-at-the-berlin-wall.htm|website=www.historynet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also emerged during the trial that any aid attempt from the West had indeed been made impossible, but according to a report from [[forensic pathologist]] Otto Prokop, "Fechter had no chance of survival. The shot in the right hip had caused severe internal injuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Otto Prokop: Wissenschaftler zwischen den Fronten|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/nachruf-otto-prokop-wissenschaftler-zwischen-den-fronten/1428160.html|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the head of the East German border platoon stated that he was afraid to intervene, because of an incident just three days earlier when an East German soldier [[Rudi Arnstadt]] had probably been shot by a Western federal policeman. Nonetheless, the East German border soldiers did retrieve Peter Fechter's body an hour after he had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Lawrence W.|title=Peter Fechter: Death at the Wall {{!}} Lawrence W. Reed|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-berlin-wall-those-who-refused-to-be-caged/|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
In March 1997, seven years after the [[reunification of Germany]], two former East German guards, Rolf Friedrich and Erich Schreiber, faced [[manslaughter]] charges for Fechter's death, and admitted to his shooting. They were both convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 21 months' imprisonment on [[probation]]. Due to a lack of conclusive evidence, the court was unable to determine which of three gunmen (one of whom had already died) had fired the fatal bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reports|first1=From Times Wire|title=2 Convicted in 1962 Berlin Wall Slaying|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-06/news/mn-35398_1_berlin-wall|work=Los Angeles Times|date=6 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; After pleading guilty to the crime, during sentencing, both guards apologized for killing Fechter, adding that they would forever live with the guilt of their crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former East Germans Apologize For Killing Boy|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-03-04/news/9703031160_1_fechter-bled-germans|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
[[Image:Peter Fechter Berlin Wall Memorial.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Peter Fechter memorial and wreath on the western side of the Berlin Wall, taken in 1984]] 
[[Image:Fechter Mauerkreuz.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Peter Fechter memorial cross at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]]]

A cross was placed on the western side near the spot where Fechter was shot and bled to death. At the invitation of [[Willy Brandt]], the then-mayor of West Berlin, the [[Yale Russian Chorus]] sang a German translation of [[Mozart]]'s [[Ave verum corpus (Mozart)|Ave Verum Corpus]] near the site in the week following the shooting. On the first anniversary, a wreath was placed there by [[Willy Brandt]] and US [[Major general|major general]] James Polk.  
The story of Peter Fechter was the headline of American news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in August 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938872,00.html time.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In this article was used the noun "Wall of Shame" (Mauer der Schande), and this became a synonym for the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959086,00.html time.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Image:Fechter Mahnmal Nah-Vorderansicht.jpg|200px|thumb|Memorial to Peter Fechter on Zimmerstraße, in German reads ''"...he just wanted freedom."'']] After German reunification in 1990, the Peter-Fechter-Stelle [[memorial]] was constructed on Zimmerstrasse, at the precise spot where he had died on the Eastern side, and this has been a focal point for some of the commemorations regarding the wall.&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahonen|first1=Pertti|title=Victims of the Berlin Wall|url=https://www.soc.unitn.it/sus/attivita_del_dipartimento/convegni/maggio2006/gcabstracts/ahonen.htm|publisher=University of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting has also been the subject of documentaries on German television. [[Cornelius Ryan]] dedicated his book ''The Last Battle'' to the memory of Fechter. Composer [[Aulis Sallinen]] wrote an orchestral work ''Mauermusik'' to commemorate Fechter. In 2007, artist Mark Gubb was commissioned by the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] to create a performance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.org.uk/The%20Death%20of%20Peter%20Fechter%20film%20and%20discussion+15042.twl The Death of Peter Fechter film and discussion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722202522/http://www.ica.org.uk/The%20Death%20of%20Peter%20Fechter%20film%20and%20discussion+15042.twl |date=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the death of Peter Fechter. The performance was a one-hour live piece that was later recorded and screened at the ICA with a discussion panel at the end consisting of the artist, and actor Dominik Danielewicz who played the part of Peter Fechter. The 1972 ballad ''[[Libre (song)|Libre]]'' ("Free") – a recording famous in all [[Ibero-America]] – by [[Spain|Spanish]] singer [[Nino Bravo]], remembers this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.martinoticias.com/a/muro-de-berlin-la-triste-historia-detras-de-una-cancion/79382.html|title=Libre: la triste historia detrás de una exitosa canción|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Spanish|access-date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Canadian playwright [[Jordan Tannahill]]'s play ''Peter Fechter: 59 Minutes'', a poetic re-imagining of the final hour of Fechter's life, was produced in Canada and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Playwrights Canada Press, 2013, {{ISBN|9781770911949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''swamp monster''' (also variously called a '''swamp creature''', '''swamp man''', or '''muck monster''')&lt;ref&gt;Jon B. Cooke and George Khoury, ''Swampmen: Muck-Monsters and their Makers'' (2015), p. 6, {{ISBN|1605490571}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional creature found imagined to lurk in a [[swamp]].

==Examples in comics==
[[File:AirboyJune1952.jpg|thumb|The [[Heap (comics)|Heap]] in mortal combat with the "Man of the Moonlight" on the cover of ''[[Airboy|Airboy Comics]],'' vol. 9 #5 (June 1952). Artwork by Ernest Schroeder.]]From the 1940s to the present many swamp monsters have been used in comics, an early example being Hillman Publications' the [[Heap (comics)|Heap]].

Afterwards, both [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] created similar characters:
* DC had the [[Swamp Thing]], created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Berni Wrightson]].
* Marvel had the [[Man-Thing]], created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Gray Morrow]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]].

The debuts of the two characters were so close that it is impossible to say which came first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cotter| first = Robert Michael "Bobb"| title = The Great Monster Magazines: A Critical Study of the Black and White Publications of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland| location = Jefferson, North Carolina| isbn = 978-0-7864-3389-6| page = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Moore]], who worked on ''Swamp Thing'' for a period, later described the character's original incarnation as "a regurgitation of Hillman Comics' The Heap", adding that "When I took over that character at Len Wein's suggestion, I did my best to make it an original character that didn't owe a huge debt to previously existing swamp monsters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seraphemera.org/seraphemera_books/AlanMoore_Page5.html|title=Interview with Alan Moore Page 5 of 8 |publisher=Seraphemera|date=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other swamp monsters in comics include:
* [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], created by [[Alfred Bester]] and [[Paul Reinman]] for DC Comics
* The [[Glob (comics)|Glob]], created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Herb Trimpe]] for Marvel Comics
* Swamp Beast, from ''[[Monster in My Pocket]]'' by [[Dwayne McDuffie]] and [[Gil Kane]] for [[Harvey Comics]].
* [[Bog Swamp Demon]], a fictional character appearing in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comic books.
* [[Danny Dunn and the Swamp Monster]] by [[Raymond Abrashkin]] and [[Jay Williams (author)|Jay Williams]].
* In the anime and manga ''[[Princess Resurrection]]'', the characters are attacked by a tribe of monsters resembling the creature while vacationing by a lagoon, who desire Hime's blood to make them immortal and keep their kind from dying out. In a possible reference to the novel version of the movie, one of the creatures is roughly 30 feet tall. {{issue|date=February 2018}}
* In the anime and manga ''[[One Piece]]'', the crew is attacked by Caribou who has eaten the Swamp Swamp Fruit (a Logia-type Devil Fruit that lets it's consumer turn into a "swamp").{{issue|date=February 2018}}

==Examples in other media==

** A creature, credited as the Gill-man, also appears in the non-Universal release ''[[The Monster Squad]]'' (1987) along with [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]], the [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]], and the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]]. He was portrayed by [[Tom Woodruff, Jr.]]
* An episode of ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' entitled "The Spanish Moss Murders" (December 6, 1974) features a young man, subject of a study in sleep research, whose nightmares of a [[Spanish moss]]-covered swamp-dwelling monster called ''Pèremalfait'' from stories heard in his youth in the Louisiana Bayou come to life. (The creature in this case was played by [[Richard Kiel]].)
* The DC comics character "Swamp Thing" mentioned above was the subject of  [[Swamp Thing (film)|a 1982 film]] and [[Swamp Thing (TV series)|a 1990 live-action television series]].
* In the 1986 novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' by [[Stephen King]], It takes the form of a swamp monster to kill Eddie Corcoran.
* The 1996 ''[[Goosebumps]]'' book "How to Kill a Monster" featured a Swamp Monster. It was depicted as a green-furred monster with the head of an alligator and a gorilla-like body.
** The Swamp Monster makes an appearance in the 2015 ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'' movie performed by Nate Andrade (who was credited as "Monster #1"). He is one of Slappy the Dummy's monster and villain henchmen and is referred to as the "Bog Monster" during the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic Con]] appearance. Its appearance is different where it looks like a giant creature made of moss.
* The TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'' featured some swamp monsters. In the episode "[[I Never Met the Dead Man]]" (April 11, 1999), the Griffin family catches a creature strongly resembling a "Swamp Monster" while fishing. In the episode "[[Business Guy]]" (December 13, 2009), [[Carter Pewterschmidt]] and [[Lois Griffin]] trick [[Peter Griffin]] into surrendering Pewterschmidt Industries by scaring him into believing a local swamp monster will eat him if he does not. A seemingly real swamp monster scares Peter out of the office and then chases Lois and a disguised Carter before being trapped and unmasked to be [[Gregory House]].
* Victor Crowley is a deformed killer and main character in [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]]'s 2006 film, ''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]''.
* [[David Winning]]'s 2008 film ''[[Swamp Devil]]'' stars [[Bruce Dern]] as a retired sheriff trying to prove the existence of a swamp monster.
* In [[Animal Planet]]'s ''[[Lost Tapes]],'' the episode "Swamp Creature" (January 26, 2009) is about the [[Honey Island Swamp monster|Louisiana Swamp Monster]], which is said to be an abandoned Native American child who was raised by alligators. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* While criticizing a movie featuring a swamp monster, one of the hosts of the 2010 series ''[[This Movie Sucks!]]'' ([[Ron Sparks (comedian)|Ron Sparks]]) tells the legend of ''[[Lake Erie]] Pete'' about a man who becomes a crime-fighting swamp monster after his parents are killed by one.
* In the video game ''[[Infamous 2]]'', the Swamp Monsters are the least mutated type of the Corrupted that have scythes instead of forearms and are the more common of the Corrupted.
* In [[Scream Queens (season 2)|Season Two]] of ''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'', the Green Meanie is described to be a swamp monster that lives in a toxic swamp near the C.U.R.E.

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J. M. Gurney, P. Jutsum|title=The gomez classification.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

[[Avitaminosis|Vitamin-deficiency-related diseases]] (such as [[scurvy]] and [[rickets]]).

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children. The medical community recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months, with nutritional whole food supplementation and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years or older for overall optimal health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Linda C.|last2=Milligan|first2=Renee A.|last3=Frick|first3=Kevin D.|last4=Spatz|first4=Diane|last5=Bronner|first5=Yvonne|date=2002-06-01|title=Breastfeeding Duration, Costs, and Benefits of a Support Program for Low-Income Breastfeeding Women|journal=Birth|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00169.x|pmid=12000411|issn=1523-536X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaodong|last2=Wardlaw|first2=Tessa|last3=Brown|first3=David W.|date=2012-09-28|title=Global trends in exclusive breastfeeding|journal=International Breastfeeding Journal|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-7-12|pmid=23020813|pmc=3512504|issn=1746-4358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as only giving an infant breast milk for six months as a source of food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; This means no other liquids, including water or semi-solid foods.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===
[[File:ORT saches.JPG|thumb|Examples of commercially available oral rehydration salts (Nepal on left, Peru on right).]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously{{when|date=September 2016}} seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions. Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.1.23|jstor=3986477|title=The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education|author=Jere R.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity.

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

In an April 2013 summit held in [[Dublin]] concerning Hunger, Nutrition, [[Climate Justice]], and the post 2015 MDG framwework for global justice, Ireland's [[Michael D. Higgins|President Higgins]] said that only 10% of deaths from hunger are due to armed conflict and natural disasters, with ongoing hunger being both the "greatest ethical failure of the current global system" and the "greatest ethical challenge facing the global community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health, accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global [[disease burden]] according to 2008 studies.&lt;ref name="Black2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = R.

The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide,&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; about 1 million children.&lt;ref name="ENJM013113"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manary|first1=Mark J. |author2=Indi Trehan |author3=Hayley S.

(2008). [http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/saferwater/en/ Safer water, better health - Costs, benefits and sustainability of interventions to protect and promote health]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Women===

{{main article|Food security#Gender and food security}}
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z. A. | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = T. | last3 = Black | first3 = R. E. | last4 = Cousens | first4 = S. | last5 = Dewey | first5 = K. | last6 = Giugliani | first6 = E. | last7 = Haider | first7 = B.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

Rates of malnutrition tend to increase with age with less than 10 percent of the "young" elderly (up to age 75) malnourished, while 30 to 65 percent of the elderly in home care, long-term care facilities, or acute hospitals are malnourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volkert | first1 = D. | title = Malnutrition in the elderly — prevalence, causes and corrective strategies | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 21 | pages = 110–112 | year = 2002 |doi=10.1016/S0261-5614(02)80014-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elderly people require assistance in eating, which may contribute to malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Volkert 2002" /&gt; However, the mortality rate due to undernourishment may be reduced.&lt;ref name="ener.2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milne|first1=AC|last2=Potter|first2=J|last3=Vivanti|first3=A|last4=Avenell|first4=A|title=Protein and energy supplementation in elderly people at risk from malnutrition.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=15 April 2009|issue=2|pages=CD003288|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003288.pub3|pmid=19370584}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, one of the main requirements of [[elderly care]] is to provide an adequate diet and all [[essential nutrients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mamhidir |first1=Anna-Greta |author2=Kihlgren, Mona |author3=Soerlie, Venke|title=Malnutrition in elder care: qualitative analysis of ethical perceptions of politicians and civil servants|journal=BMC Medical Ethics|year=2010|volume=11|pages=11|doi=10.1186/1472-6939-11-11|pmid=20553607|pmc=2927875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing the different nutrients such as protein and energy keeps even small but consistent weight gain.&lt;ref name="ener.2009" /&gt;

'''Monoplacophora''', meaning "bearing one plate", is a [[polyphyletic]] [[Class (biology)|superclass]] of [[mollusc]]s with a cap-like shell now living at the bottom of the [[deep sea]]. [[Extant taxon|Extant]] representatives were not recognized as such until 1952; previously they were known only from the [[fossil record]].

Although the shell of many monoplacophorans is [[limpet]]-like in shape, they are not [[gastropods]], nor do they have any close relation to gastropods.

== Definition ==
Discussion about monoplacophorans is made difficult by the slippery definition of the taxon; some authors take it to refer to all non-gastropod molluscs with a single shell, or all single-shelled molluscs with serially repeated units; whereas other workers restrict the definition to cap-shaped forms, excluding spiral and other shapes of shell.&lt;ref name="Lindberg2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lindberg | first1 = D. R. | doi = 10.1007/s12052-009-0125-4 | title = Monoplacophorans and the Origin and Relationships of Mollusks | journal = Evolution: Education and Outreach | volume = 2 | pages = 191–203 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inclusion of the gastropod-like [[Bellerophontoidea]] within the group is also contentious.&lt;ref name="Gubanov2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gubanov | first1 = A. P. | last2 = Peel | first2 = J. S. | doi = 10.1111/1475-4983.00198 | title = Latest Helcionelloid Molluscs from the Lower Ordovician of Kazakhstan | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 44 | pages = 681 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One attempt to resolve this confusion was to separate out the predominantly coiled [[helcionelloids]] from the traditional, cap-like [[tergomya]]ns, this latter group containing extant Tryblidiids.&lt;ref name="Gubanov2001" /&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==
[[File:Monoplacophora.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.8|Internal anatomy of ''[[Micropilina]]''. The head region is on the left by the mouth.]]
Monoplacophorans are [[Valve (mollusc)|univalved]] (though not gastropodal), [[limpet]]-shaped, and are [[Torsion (gastropod)|untorted]].  They have a [[Metamerism (biology)|pseudometamerism]] of [[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetrical]] repeated organs and muscles.  The extant members of the class live only in the deep ocean (the [[abyssal zone]], the [[continental shelf]], and the [[continental slope]]) at depths below {{convert|180|m|ft}}.  Cambrian forms predominately lived in shallow seas, whereas later Paleozoic forms are more commonly found in deeper waters with soft, muddy sea floors.&lt;ref name="Lindberg2009" /&gt;

The repeated organs include from three to six pair of "gills" (actually [[Ctenidium (mollusc)|ctenidia]]) located in a curved line along each side of the foot (though the number is not always considered definitive of a given species), and as many as six "kidneys" (actually [[Nephridium|nephridia]]).  The tip or point of their low shells points forward rather than towards the back.  The shell ranges from 3mm to 37mm in diameter depending on species.  The mouth is located within the animal's undeveloped head in front of its single large foot and contains a [[radula]], a defining characteristic of the mollusca.  They also have a cone-shaped stomach with a single [[Style (zoology)|crystalline style]] though no [[gastric shield]].  The intestines are long and make between four and six loops before reaching the posteriorly-positioned anus.

The sexes are separate with any given animal having two pair of either ovaries or testes connected to either the third or fourth pair of kidneys.  One genus, ''Micropilina'', has apparently been recorded as brooding young in the distal oviduct and pallial groove, releasing the young when approximately 300 micrometers in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Phylogenetic position ==
In 2006 a molecular study on ''[[Laevipilina antarctica]]'' suggested that extant Monoplacophora and [[Polyplacophora]] form a well-supported [[clade]] with the researched Neopilina closest to the [[chiton]]s.&lt;ref name="Giribet2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last3=Lindgren, A.R.| last=Giribet | first3=A.

This study contradicts the fossil evidence, which suggests that the Monoplacophora are the sister group to the remainder of the [[conchifera]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

Psychological trauma is a shattering of the fundamental assumptions that a person has about themselves and the world.&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|title=Shattered Assumptions: Towards a New Psychology of Trauma|date=1992|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0029160152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7OVCUpFiLgC&amp;dq|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An adverse experience that is unexpected, painful, extraordinary, and shocking results in interruptions in ongoing processes or relationships and may also create [[Maladaptation|maladaptive responses]].&lt;ref name="Neal2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neal|first1=Arthur G.|title=National Trauma and Collective Memory: Extraordinary Events in the American Experience|date=2005|publisher=Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=978-0765615817|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irs2272ORb4C&amp;dq|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such experiences can affect not only an individual but can also be collectively experienced by an entire group of people.&lt;ref name="Neal2005" /&gt; Tragic experiences can collectively wound or threaten the [[national identity]],&lt;ref name="Elovitz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elovitz|first1=Paul H.|title=Presidential Responses to National Trauma: Case Studies of G.W.

In individual psychological trauma, fundamental assumptions about how the individual relates to the world, such as that the world is benevolent and meaningful and that the individual has worth in the world, are overturned by overwhelming life experiences.&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman" /&gt;  Similarly, national trauma overturns fundamental assumptions of social identity – something terrible has happened and social life has lost its predictability.&lt;ref name="Neal2005" /&gt; The causes of such shatterings of assumptions are diverse and defy neat categorization.  For example, wars are not always national traumas; while the Vietnam War is experienced by Americans as a national trauma&lt;ref name="Kiernan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiernan|first1=David|title=Why Americans still can’t move past Vietnam|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/10/10/why-americans-still-cant-move-past-vietnam/|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=Washington Post|date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] famously titled the closing volume of his history of the [[The Second World War (book series)|Second World War]] ''Triumph and Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston|last2=Keegan|first2=John|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War, Volume 6|date=1954|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0304929733|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar types of natural disasters can also provoke different responses. The [[2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire]] in Alberta was a collective trauma for not only that local community but also the large Canadian Province of Alberta despite causing no direct deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koziol|first1=Carol A.|title=Individual and Collective Trauma: The Fort McMurray Fire|url=https://www.academia.edu/30682848|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Academia|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the much larger [[Peshtigo Fire]] responsible for thousands of deaths is largely forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hipke|first1=Deana C.|title=The Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871|url=http://www.peshtigofire.info/|website=The Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to national trauma also vary.  A nation that experiences clear defeat in war which had mobilized the nation to a high degree will almost inevitably also experience national trauma but the way in which that defeat is felt can change the response.&lt;ref name="Schivelbusch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schivelbusch|first1=Wolfgang|title=The culture of defeat : on national trauma, mourning, and recovery|date=2004|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0312423193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcUTAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former peoples of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]] in the [[American Civil War]] and the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]] both created post-war mythologies (the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] in the former and the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|Stab-in-the-back Myth]] in the latter) of "glorious" defeat in unfair fights.&lt;ref name="Schivelbusch" /&gt;  The post-war experience of Germany after World War Two, however, is much more complex and provoked reactions from a sense of [[German collective guilt|German national guilt]]&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Mark|title=How World War II shaped modern Germany|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/05/how-world-war-ii-shaped-modern-germany|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=euronews|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collective ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowie|first1=Laura|title=The Impact of World War Two on the Individual and Collective Memory of Germany and its Citizens|url=https://www.societies.ncl.ac.uk/pgfnewcastle/files/2015/05/Bowie-The-Impact-of-World-War-Two.pdf|publisher=Newcastle University|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common national response to these traumas is repeated calls for national unity and moral purification, as in the post-9/11 United States&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman&amp;Sheikh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|last2=Sana|first2=Sheikh|title=From national trauma to moralizing nation."

==History==
[[File:Negro of Banyoles (catalogue entry).jpg|right|thumb]]

In [[1830]], the [[Jules Verreaux|Verreaux]] brothers [[grave robbery|dug up the fresh grave]] of a [[Batlhaping tribe|BaTlhaping]] man,&lt;ref name=Fforde-Hubert-Turnbull&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_e95hmUhnBUC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=batlhaping+banyoles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mWH0e3FCeH&amp;sig=UUIb7fvMR4Sv81pII58daelRV-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwij1KKN9bPeAhXMuVMKHUOdAAEQ6AEwDnoECB8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=batlhaping%20banyoles&amp;f=false The Dead and Their Possessions: Repatriation in Principle, Policy and Practice], edited by Cressida Fforde, Jane Hubert, and Paul Turnbull; chapter 20: ''Missing persons and stolen bodies: the repatriation of 'El Negro' to Botswana''; by Neil Parsons and Alinah Kelo Segobye; published 2004, by [[Psychology Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; and stuffed the corpse, approximately 27 years old, belonging to the negroid race with features typical of the [[San people|African bushman]].&lt;ref name="Un libro revela que Cuvier conocía al Negro de Banyoles"/&gt; In 1916, it was acquired by the [[Darder Museum]] of [[Banyoles]].&lt;ref name="De Banyoles a Botswana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAT&amp;idnoticia_PK=355144&amp;idseccio_PK=1006&amp;h= |title=De Banyoles a Botswana |author=Moret, Xavier |work=[[El Periódico de Catalunya|elPeriódico.cat]] |language=ca |accessdate=2007-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028143327/http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46 |archivedate=October 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body remained in the museum without controversy until 29 October 1991. At this date Alphonse Arcelin, a doctor of [[Haiti]]an origin&lt;ref name="BOPA"&gt;''[http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20001006 Remains disappoint many]'', 6 October 2000, [[BOPA]] Daily News.&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in [[Cambrils]] where he was a [[Socialist Party of Catalonia|PSC]] councillor,&lt;ref name="El Mundo"&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/2000/10/04/catalunya/04N0129.html «Lo trataron como a un antílope»], ''El Mundo'', 4 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a letter to the mayor of Banyoles, asking him to stop displaying the San's remains. This request attracted the attention of the [[Mass media|press]], which widely published the story.&lt;ref name="Vitrina de la polémica"/&gt;

The first step towards the return of the "''negre''" to Botswana was made in 1991, when the then-secretary of [[UNESCO]], [[Federico Mayor|Federico Mayor Zaragoza]], held the meeting with the mayor of Banyoles. Later, when [[Kofi Annan]] became [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]], he expressed interest in the issue and spoke with the mayor of Banyoles.&lt;ref name="Vitrina de la polémica"/&gt;

By that time, the "''negre''" had become so notorious that it was quite usual to hear references made to the displayed San in diplomatic communications. Some [[Africa]]n governments showed their support for Arcelín, who had sent several letters to the press and various heads of government. The issue worried many international museum associations because it made them fear that human remains kept in museums might have to be returned to their place of origin.&lt;ref name="Vitrina de la polémica"/&gt;

In 1997, the issue was repeatedly discussed by both the UN and the [[Organisation of African Unity]].&lt;ref name="Vitrina de la polémica"/&gt; Later, in March of that year, the body was removed from the Darder Museum.&lt;ref name="El nuevo Museo Darder evita cualquier referencia a la polémica del 'Negro de Banyoles'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/nuevo/Museo/Darder/evita/cualquier/referencia/polemica/Negro/Banyoles/elpepuespcat/20070413elpcat_20/Tes |

accessdate=2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in Banyoles and the surrounding area were unhappy with the removal because the San was seen as "a member of the community".&lt;ref name="De Banyoles a Botswana"/&gt;

===Return to Africa===
[[Botswana]]'s government offered to aid the OAU bury the man, once all of his remains were returned to [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Vitrina de la polémica"/&gt; In 2000, after the loincloth, feathered head-dress and spear he had worn in Banyoles were removed, the body was sent to the National Museum of Anthropology in [[Madrid]] where artificial parts including a wooden spine, eyes, hair, and genitals were removed. The skull and remaining bones were then sent to Botswana in a coffin&lt;ref name="España sólo devuelve huesos del negro de Banyoles"&gt;{{cite web

He was buried on 5 October&lt;ref name="Vitrina de la polémica"/&gt; in Tsholofelo Park, in [[Gaborone]];&lt;ref name=Fforde-Hubert-Turnbull/&gt;; his  gravesite was declared a national monument.&lt;ref name=Fforde-Hubert-Turnbull/&gt;

==Legacy==
The Darder Museum currently avoids any references to the controversy of the "negre of Banyoles".

'''Nicolò Guarco''' (Parodi, c.1325 – Lerici, c.1385) was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] statesman who became the 7th [[Doge of Genoa|doge]] of the [[Republic of Genoa]] and led the Republic through the [[War of Chioggia]] against [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].

==Early life==
Son of a merchant, Nicolò appears first in the documents, in 1351, as a Genoese ambassador sent to the king of France, [[John II of France|John II]]. The same year, he is for the first time made a member of the council of the ancients, the closest advisors to the [[Doge of Genoa|doge]].  In 1365, he is given the office of vicar (governor) of the city of [[Chiavari]]. He is soon after put in charge of the harbour and re-integrates the council of the ancients. During the 1360s, he seems to have been one of the main opponents of the new doge, [[Gabriele Adorno]].&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"&gt;{{cite web|last=Musso|first=Riccardo|title=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/nicolo-guarco_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|accessdate=4 March 2012|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the dogeship of Adorno, Nicolò returned to the highest functions in the Genoese state. In 1371, he was sent as ambassador to [[kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. The following year, he took the castle of [[Roccatagliata]] from the rebel nobles of the [[Fieschi]] family. He then occupied numerous positions within the Genoese government, in particular, he was elected a third time to the council and sent as ambassador to the [[Pope Gregory IX|pope]] in [[Avignon]]. In 1375, he also became one of the shareholders of the ''[[Maona|maona di Cipro]]'', an association in charge of capturing the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

At the time, the power of the ''[[popolani]]'' over the city was under the threat of a three-way alliance between the [[Venetian Republic]], the [[House of Visconti (Milan)|Viscontis]] of [[Milan]] and the Genoese nobles who intended to regain the upper hand over the affairs of the city. The threat materialized in 1378, when the mercenaries of the company of the Star paid by the duke of Milan took control of the Genoese countryside. The city was in turmoil and, on June 17, the crowd stormed the dogal palace and elected [[Antoniotto Adorno]] as the new doge. But the leaders of the ''popolani'' party were wary of the ambitious young Adorno and, a few hours later, the elected Nicolò Guarco the new doge of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

==Dogeship==
To concentrate the forces of the city on the challenge posed by the Venetians, Nicolò farmed out the administration (and pacification) of the island of Corsica to yet another ''maona''. Even more importantly, on September 22, the doge signed with the representative of the noble exiles an agreement associating them to the government of the Republic, simply barring them from the position of doge. This treaty allowed to solve the problem of the scheming ''fuorusciti'' which had plagued the Republic since its creation in 1339.&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

[[Image:Nicolò Guarco moneta 1378-1383.jpg|thumb|''[[:it:Genovino]]'' minted under the dogeship of Nicolò Guarco (c.1378)]]

The doge came to an agreement with the employers of the company of the Star and tried to pay the mercenaries so that they would leave the Ligurian countryside. But Venetian gold quickly brought the mercenaries back under the walls of the city. On September 24, 1379, finally, the troops of the Republic backed by the noble militias crushed the mercenaries. Nicolò was now free to turn the re-invigorated forces of Genoa against Venice.&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

On August 6, 1379, the allied troops of Genoa, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Carrara]] and [[Aquileia]] managed to take the island of [[Chioggia]] in the Venetian laguna, forcing the city to demand terms. But the conditions asked by the Genoese admiral [[Pietro Doria]] were so severe that the Venetians decided to resume fighting. The Venetians managed to engineer a counter-attack and by June 26, 1380, the Genoese troops in the laguna had to surrender.&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

==Pushed out of office==
The defeat triggered a series of rebellions among the noble families of the countryside. The doge managed to squash them but the mounting cost of the war was starting to create unrest within the city itself. Meanwhile, changes imposed upon the judicial administration and the augmentation of the number of body guards were feeding fears that the doge was aiming at creating an autocratic power base for himself. Confronted with mounting criticism, the doge was forced to expel his noble allies from government, decrease taxes and call back his exiled political enemies, the [[Fregoso]] and the [[Adorno family|Adorno]].&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

Antoniotto Adorno quickly gained the heart of the people and on April 6, 1383, he forced Nicolò Guarco to abandon the dogeship (but not to be elected doge after him). Guarco fled the city and found refuge in [[Finale Ligure|Finale]]. Soon after, the new doge, [[Leonardo Montaldo]], allowed him to return to Genoa. A new plague ravaged the city in 1384, the doge succumbed to the disease and this time Antoniotto Adorno managed to get elected. Nicolò, once more, headed towards Finale, but the local lord, the marquis Del Carretto, had changed camp and he delivered him to the new doge. Nicolò was sent to the castle of Lirici as a prisoner and died there maybe as early as the summer of 1384.&lt;ref name="Musso 2003"/&gt;

'''Philippe Avril''' was a [[Jesuit]] explorer of the [[Far East]].  He was born at [[Angoulême]], [[France]] on 16 September 1654.
 
Avril was a professor of philosophy and mathematics at [[Paris]] when he was dispatched to the Jesuit missions of [[China]]. Following the instructions of [[Ferdinand Verbiest]], another Jesuit, then at [[Peking]], he attempted an overland journey, and traveled for six years through [[Kurdistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Persia]], and other countries of eastern Asia.
 
Arriving at [[Moscow]], Avril was refused permission to pass through [[Tatary]], and was sent by the Government to [[Poland]], whence he made his way to [[Istanbul]] and from there went back to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Passage to China:A French Jesuit's Perceptions of Siberia in the 1680s|author=Love, Ronald S.|journal=French Colonial History|volume=3|year=2003|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though exhausted by [[disease]], he set out again on a vessel, which was lost at sea. Avril presumably died in a 1698 [[shipwreck]].
 
Avril's journal and writings provide a significant amount of useful material for modern historians and demographers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5630">'''Prey detection''' is the process by which [[predator]]s are able to detect and locate their prey via [[sensory system|sensory]] signals. This article treats predation in its broadest sense, i.e. where one [[organism]] eats another.

==Evolutionary struggle and prey defenses==
[[File:Arctic Hare.jpg|thumb|300px|Prey have adaptations such as [[camouflage|cryptic coloration]] in this [[Arctic hare]] which help them [[antipredator adaptation|avoid predators]].]]

{{main|Antipredator adaptation}}

Predators are in an [[evolutionary arms race]] with their prey, for which advantageous mutations are constantly preserved by [[natural selection]]. In turn, predators too are subject to such [[selective pressure]], those most successful in locating prey passing on their genes in greater number to the next generation's [[gene pool]]. Adaptations of prey that allow them to avoid predators are widespread, those that make them hard to find being collectively known as [[crypsis]]. Crypsis may involve temporal evasion such as [[nocturnality]], behavioral methods such as hiding, and non-behavioral adaptations such as [[camouflage]]. [[Antipredator adaptation]]s include methods other than crypsis, such as [[aposematism]] and the ability to fight.

Often behavioral and passive characteristics are combined, for example a prey animal may look similar to and behave like its hunter's own predator (see [[mimicry]]).

==Prey detection using different senses==

There are a variety of methods used to detect prey. Sensory systems used include the [[visual system]], [[olfactory system]] (smell), [[auditory system]] (hearing) and the [[somatosensory system]] (such as touch). Some predators may use all of these senses in pinpointing their prey, while others may depend mainly or entirely on a single one. Detection methods may also be divided into direct detection of the prey organism itself, and indirect clues, such as the smell of its urine.

===Visual===

[[File:Blue Jay-27527.jpg|thumb|300px|Experiments on [[blue jay]]s suggest they form a search image for certain prey.]]

Visual predators may form what is termed a '''search image''' of certain prey.

Predators need not locate their host directly: [[Kestrel]]s for instance are able to detect the [[faeces]] and [[urine]] of their prey (which reflect [[ultraviolet]]), allowing them to identify areas where there are large numbers of voles, for example. This adaptation is essential in prey detection, as voles are quick to [[:wikt:hide|hide]] from such predators.&lt;ref&gt;Viitala, J., E. Korpimäki, Polakangas, P., Koivula, M. (1995) Attraction of kestrels to vole scent marks visible in ultraviolet light. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 373:423-425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===

For many animals the chemical senses are far more important than vision or hearing. Some specialist predatory [[beetle]](s) can locate their [[bark beetle]] prey using the [[pheromone]]s their targets secrete. Pheromones that are exploited by an enemy like this are called [[kairomone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pheromones and Animal Behaviour|last= Wyatt|first= Tristram D. |year= 2003|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-48526-6|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditory===

Some predators rely mainly on [[sound]] cues to detect prey. In [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] predators non-visual clues are especially important. The [[barn owl]] (''Tyto alba'') relies on noises made by prey, and can locate prey animals with great precision. [[Bat]]s have the added capability of [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] to locate prey like flying insects; they can therefore locate prey even if they make no sound.&lt;ref&gt;Moiseff, A. and Haresign, T. (2001) Prey Detection by Bats and Owls. ''[[Encyclopedia of Life Sciences]]''. [[Digital object identifier|DOI]]: 10.1038/npg.els.0000096&lt;/ref&gt;

==Following detection==

[[File:IMG 2085 Calvia decemguttata.JPG|thumb|300px|This [[ladybeetle]] (''Calvia decemguttata'') is easily spotted, but its conspicuous colors are a sign of its [[toxin|unpalatability]], of which experienced predators will probably be familiar.]]

Once a predator has found its prey it will not always attempt to chase or eat it. Prey have other ways of deterring predators from eating them besides avoiding detection. [[Aposematic]] plants and animals may have conspicuous [[animal coloration|coloration]] such that potential consumer such as a [[herbivore]] will avoid eating them based on unpleasant past experiences. Even if a predator may wish to eat its prey, locomotive animals may be extremely difficult to catch. 

Animals living in groups have increased vigilance, and even solitary animals are capable of rapid escape when needed. Even if it does make a capture, its prey may attract competing predators, giving it a chance to escape in the struggle. It may also strike a non-vital organ: some species have deceptive appearances such that one part of their body resembles another, such as insects with false heads. This makes consumption (or fatal wound)s less probable, giving the prey a second chance at escaping.

Predators may have extensive capabilities in finding prey, but even when they are successful in doing so they may not end up with a meal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7920">The '''Qatar Financial Information Unit''' (QFIU) is a [[Qatar]]i government regulatory agency responsible for financial intelligence efforts to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism. Like other national Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) around the world, it requires banks, investment companies, insurers and other financial institutions to report suspicious financial transactions. QFIU then analyzes the information and disseminates the relevant data to law enforcement authorities for further investigation and action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.qfiu.gov.qa/files/QFIU_Annual_ENG_2013.pdf|title = QFIU Annual Report 2013|date = |accessdate = |website = Qatar Financial Information Unit|publisher = Government of Qatar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2004, QFIU is led by [[Ahmad bin Eid al-Thani]]. Its mission is to “[protect] the integrity and economy of the State of Qatar through effective exchange of information, transparency enhancement and capacity building to help detect and deter money laundering and terrorism financing activities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The QFIU is a “semiautonomous component” of Qatar’s National Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Committee (NAMLC), and is housed in the Qatar Central Bank.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer/MER%20Qatar.pdf|title = Mutual Evaluation Report: Anti‐Money Laundering and   Combating the Financing of Terrorism|date = 2008-04-09|accessdate = 2015-08-03|website = Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national partners include the Qatar Financial Centre, State Security Bureau, Ministry of Interior, Criminal Investigation Department Section of Fighting Economic Crimes, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Business and Trade, Public Prosecution, General Directorate of Customs, Financial Institutions, and Ministry of Social Affairs.

== International cooperation ==
QFIU also partners with FIUs in the region and worldwide. It is an active member of the Egmont Group, an “informal network” of international FIUs organized “to foster international cooperation and information exchange” among its 139 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = List of Members {{!}} The Egmont Group|url = http://www.egmontgroup.org/about/list-of-members/by-region/asia|website = www.egmontgroup.org|accessdate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  QFIU serves as co-chair of the Asia Group within Egmont, along with FIU-India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to promote cooperation and information sharing with international and regional FIU’s and provide professional development to its staff, QFIU is a regular participant in Egmont and other FIU and Anti-Money Laundering conferences and forums.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.qfiu.gov.qa/files/QFIU_Annual_ENG_2014.pdf|title = QFIU Annual Report 2014|date = |accessdate = |website = Qatar Financial Information Unit|publisher = Government of Qatar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, QFIU signed a Statement of Cooperation with the Japan Financial Intelligence Center to expand financial intelligence sharing by “facilitating the exchange of information in assisting investigations concerning money laundering, terrorist financing and related crimes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Arab Network {{!}} Qatar, Japan Boosting Joint Economic cooperation {{!}} Economics {{!}} Economics|url = http://www.english.globalarabnetwork.com/201010017489/Economics/qatar-japan-boosting-joint-economic-cooperation.html|website = www.english.globalarabnetwork.com|accessdate = 2015-08-03|first = Adnan|last = Kassar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
A 2008 report produced by the Middle East and North African Financial Action Task Force and conducted by [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] officials raised several shortcomings in QFIU’s creation and operations. According to the report, “The main shortcoming is that the administrative order establishing the FIU and empowering it with a number of functions appears to be inconsistent with the provisions of the AML Law that gave such powers to the coordinator of NAMLC.” It also noted that “the quality of STR [Suspicious Transaction Reports] needs improving,” that information was not adequately protected, and that there was periodic review of its effectiveness in combatting terrorism finance and money laundering.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

QFIU addressed these issues directly in its 2009 Annual Report, declaring, “The FIU attached high importance to amending Law No. (28) of 2008 on Anti-Money Laundering and its amendments, following the mutual  evaluation report of the International Monetary Fund in 2007, which revealed many deficiencies and weaknesses in the legislative regulations related to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.qfiu.gov.qa/files/2009%20FIU%20annual%20report-eng%20high.pdf|title = QFIU Annual Report 2009|date = |accessdate = |website = Qatar Financial Information Unit|publisher = Government of Qatar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve its operations, QFIU developed an eight-point, five-year strategic plan, which commenced in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although Qatar has enacted several pieces of legislation to address gaps and inconsistencies in its anti-money laundering and terrorism finance laws in recent years, the country has been criticized for not fully implementing or enforcing these measures. Former US Treasury Department official Matthew Levitt has noted, “To date, implementation and enforcement have not been a component of Qatar’s approach to these issues. Instead, Qatar routinely stresses to investors and critics alike the passage of laws that, on paper, appear robust but are almost never implemented or enforced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/218706-qatars-not-so-charitable-record-on-terror-finance|title = Qatar's Not-So-Charitable Record on Terror Finance|last = Levitt|first = Matthew|date = 2014-09-24|work = The Hill|access-date = 2015-08-03|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2013 Annual Report, QFIU reported record numbers of Suspicious Transaction Reports (313) and suspects (352), though these numbers may reflect better adoption of anti-money laundering and terrorism finance measures as opposed to an increase in suspicious activities. Only 112 cases were disseminated to judicial or law enforcement authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to a 2014 [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, Qatar prosecuted only one money-laundering case in 2013, and had no convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Countries/Jurisdictions of Primary Concern - Qatar|url = https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2014/supplemental/227981.htm?goMobile=0|accessdate = 2015-08-03|website = Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|publisher = U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report lists Qatar as a “Major Money Laundering Country” and a “country of concern.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2014/vol2/222471.htm|title = 2014 INCSR: Major Money Laundering Countries|date = |accessdate = 2015-08-03|website = Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|publisher = U.S. Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

QFIU reported even larger numbers of Suspicious Transaction Reports (516) and suspects (787) in 2014, though the number of cases disseminated to national or foreign law enforcement agencies declined markedly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Roger Eugene Ailes''' (May 15, 1940&amp;nbsp;– May 18, 2017) was an American television executive and media consultant.  He was the Chairman and CEO of [[Fox News]] and [[Fox Television Stations]], from which he resigned in July 2016. Ailes was a [[media consultant]] for Republican presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H. W. Bush]], and for [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s [[New York City mayoral election, 1989|first mayoral campaign]]. In 2016, after he resigned from Fox News amid allegations of sexual misconduct, he became an adviser to the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump campaign]], where he assisted with debate preparation. 

Ailes suffered from [[hemophilia]], a [[medical condition]] in which the body is impaired in its ability to produce [[blood clots]], which are required to reduce bleeding. He died on May 18, 2017, at the age of 77, after suffering a [[subdural hematoma]], which was aggravated by his hemophilia.

== Early life ==
Ailes was born and grew up in the factory town of [[Warren, Ohio]], the son of Donna Marie (''née'' Cunningham) and Robert Eugene Ailes, a factory maintenance foreman.&lt;ref name=yhpy&gt;{{cite book|title=Current Biography|publisher=H.W. Wilson|year=1989|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ailes suffered from [[hemophilia]] and was often hospitalized as a youth. He attended the Warren city schools, and later was inducted into Warren G. Harding High School's Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warrenschools.k12.oh.us/alumni_hall_of_fame.html |title=Warren High Schools' Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame|publisher=Warren City Schools|accessdate=November 15, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923133541/http://www.warrenschools.k12.oh.us/alumni_hall_of_fame.html|archivedate=September 23, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was abusive, and his parents divorced in 1960.&lt;ref name=shermanbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Gabriel|date=2014|title=The Loudest Voice In The Room: How The Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News&amp;nbsp;— And Divided A Country.|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/214243/the-loudest-voice-in-the-room-by-gabriel-sherman|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-9285-4|authorlink=Gabriel Sherman|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|560}}

In 1962, Ailes graduated from [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]], where he majored in radio and television and served as the student station manager for [[WOUB (AM)|WOUB]] for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio University to Rename Newsroom for FOX News' Roger Ailes|date=April 22, 2008|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/04/22/ohio-university-to-rename-newsroom-for-fox-news-roger-ailes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ailesba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/ailesroger/ailesroger.htm|title=Roger Ailes's BA|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early television ===
Ailes' career in television began in [[Cleveland]] and [[Philadelphia]], where he started as Production Assistant (1961), Producer (1965), and Executive Producer (1967–68) for [[WKYC|KYW-TV]],&lt;ref name="varietyobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Paula|last2=Littleton|first2=Cynthia|last3=Lowry|first3=Brian|title=Roger Ailes, Fox News Founder Who Was Forced Out by Scandal, Dies at 77|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/roger-ailes-dead-77-fox-news-1202433523/|accessdate=May 20, 2017|work=Variety|date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a then-locally produced talk-variety show, ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. He continued as Executive Producer for the show when it was [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] nationally, and in 1967 and 1968 he won [[Emmy Award]]s for it.&lt;ref name="varietyobit"/&gt;

In 1967, Ailes had a spirited discussion about television in politics with one of the show's guests, [[Richard Nixon]], who took the view that television was a gimmick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flint|first1=Joe|title=Roger Ailes, Former Fox News Chief, Dies at 77|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-fox-news-chief-roger-ailes-dies-1495112318|website=Wall Street Journal|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nixon called on Ailes to serve as his Executive Producer for television. Nixon's successful presidential campaign was Ailes's first venture into the political spotlight.&lt;ref name="salonmasterdeceivers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McFarland|first1=Melanie|title=Master deceivers: When Roger Ailes met Richard Nixon|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/05/18/master-deceivers-when-roger-ailes-met-richard-nixon/|accessdate=May 20, 2017|work=Salon|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering work in framing national campaign issues, capitalizing on the race-based [[Southern Strategy]] and making the stiff Nixon more likable and accessible to voters was later chronicled in ''The Selling of the President 1968'' by [[Joe McGinniss]].&lt;ref name="salonmasterdeceivers"/&gt;

=== Political consulting ===

In 1984, Ailes worked on [[United States presidential election, 1984|the campaign to reelect Ronald Reagan]]. In 1987 and 1988, Ailes was credited (along with [[Lee Atwater]]) with guiding [[George H. W. Bush]] to victory in the Republican primaries and the later come-from-behind&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DE1031F933A05755C0A96E948260|title=New Polls Show Bush Shaves Dukakis Lead|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 15, 2007|date=June 30, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States presidential election, 1988|victory]] over [[Michael Dukakis]].

Ailes was credited with the "Orchestra Pit Theory" regarding sensationalist political coverage in the news media, which originated with his quip:{{Quote|If you have two guys on a stage and one guy says, "I have a solution to the Middle East problem," and the other guy falls in the orchestra pit, who do you think is going to be on the evening news?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1802&amp;context=ilj|title=The Death of an Honorable Profession|last=Bogus|first=Carl T.|publisher=Indiana University Law School|date=March 17, 1997|access-date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ailes's last campaign was the unsuccessful effort of [[Dick Thornburgh|Richard Thornburgh]] for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania in November 1991.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Michael|title=Roger Ailes obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/18/roger-ailes-obituary|access-date=May 18, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his withdrawal from political consulting in 1991.&lt;ref name="guardianobit" /&gt; 

Days after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], Ailes advised President [[George W. Bush]] that the American public would be patient as long as they were convinced that Bush was using the harshest measures possible.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Lloyd. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A7351-2002Nov18&amp;notFound=true Roger Ailes-Bob Woodward Smackdown?] ''[[The Washington Post]].'' November 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence was revealed in [[Bob Woodward]]'s book ''[[Bush at War]]''.{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} Ailes lashed out against Woodward, saying "Woodward got it all screwed up, as usual", and "The reason he's not as rich as [[Tom Clancy]] is that while he and Clancy both make stuff up, Clancy does his research first."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/19/cf.opinion.fox.debate/ Fox chief too cozy with White House?] ''[[CNN]].''

=== Book ===
In 1988, Ailes wrote a book with long-time aide Jon Kraushar, called ''You Are the Message: Secrets of the Master Communicators''.&lt;ref&gt;''You Are the Message: Secrets of the Master Communicators'', {{ISBN|978-0-87094-976-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== President of America Talking channel ===
Ailes eventually made his way back to television, this time focusing on cable news. In 1993, he became president of CNBC and later created the "America's Talking" channel, which would eventually become MSNBC. He hosted an interview program on ''America's Talking''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/how-embattled-fox-news-ceo-roger-ailes-transformed-cable-news.html|title=How embattled Fox News CEO Roger Ailes transformed cable news|last=Castillo|first=Michelle|date=July 20, 2016|website=CNBC|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fox ===
[[File:Roger Ailes, TV Titan 01.jpg|thumb|right| Ailes, left, is pictured in January 1996 with [[Rupert Murdoch]], right, announcing that the Republican adviser would head Fox News]]

Ailes was tapped by [[Rupert Murdoch]] in 1996 to become the CEO of [[Fox News]], effective on October 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/1996/10/07_mpp.html|title=Marketplace: News Archives|author=Brancaccio, David|date=October 7, 1996|publisher=Marketplace|access-date=March 17, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRTqDrOb?url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/1996/10/07_mpp.html|archivedate=November 23, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roger Ailes, June 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Ailes in 2013]]
After the departure of [[Lachlan Murdoch]] from News Corporation, Ailes was named [[Chairman]] of the [[Fox Television Stations]] Group on August 15, 2005. Following his newest assignment, one of his first acts was canceling ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' in September 2005 and replacing it with a new [[Geraldo Rivera]] show, ''[[Geraldo at Large]]'', which debuted on [[Halloween]], 2005. Rivera's show drew about the same ratings as ''A Current Affair''&lt;ref name="wsj1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115983508097280609?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=After Riding High With Fox News, Murdoch Aide Has Harder Slog|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=November 15, 2007|first=Julia|last=Angwin|date=October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2007.

Ailes hired former [[CBS]] executive Dennis Swanson in October 2005 to be president of the Fox Television Stations Group. Additionally, there were changes in affiliates' news programs with the standardization of Fox News Channel-like graphics, redesigned studios, news-format changes, and the announcement of a new [[Breakfast television|morning television show]] called ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' to be produced by Fox News Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=Coming in January, A Fox Morning Show|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|date=2006-07-19|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-16|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, his contract with the network was renewed for four years, through 2016. If completed, he would have served as head of Fox News Channel for 20 years. Salary terms were not made public, although his earnings for the 2012 fiscal year were a reported $21 million inclusive of bonuses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/10/19/roger-ailes-signs-deal-to-stay-at-fox-news-through-2016|title=Roger Ailes Signs Deal To Stay At Fox News Through 2016|publisher=[[Forbes]]|access-date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to heading Fox News and chairing [[Fox Television Stations]], Ailes also chaired [[20th Television]], [[MyNetworkTV]] and [[Fox Business Network]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In 2016, after he left Fox News, he became an adviser to the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump campaign]], where he assisted with debate preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/politics/donald-trump-roger-ailes.html?_r=0 |title=Roger Ailes is advising Donald Trump ahead of Presidential election |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 2016 |access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contentious comments===
In 1995, NBC hired a law firm to conduct an internal investigation after Roger Ailes allegedly called [[David Zaslav]] a "little fucking Jew prick."&lt;ref name=ShermanNYMag&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/how-fox-news-women-took-down-roger-ailes.html?mid=nymag_press|title=The Revenge of Roger's Angels|author=[[Gabriel Sherman]]|date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, 400 rabbis, including leaders from various branches of Judaism in the United States, published an open letter in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' on the UN-designated [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day|Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. They called on [[Rupert Murdoch]], the chairman of News Corp, to sanction Fox News commentator [[Glenn Beck]] for his use of [[the Holocaust]] to "discredit any individual or organization you disagree with".&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; An executive at Fox News rejected the letter, calling it the work of a "[[George Soros]]-backed left wing political organization".&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/27/rabbis-murdoch-fox-glenn-beck-holocaust|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Ed|last=Pilkington|title=Rabbis warn Rupert Murdoch: Fox News and Glenn Beck 'using' Holocaust|date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ailes is also said to have once referred to Jewish critics of his as "left-wing rabbis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinkas|first=Alon|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=205466&amp;R=R4|title=US rabbis pen letter criticizing Beck's Holocaust usage|publisher=Jpost.com|date=January 27, 2011|access-date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, Ailes was criticized for referring to executives of the public radio network [[NPR]] as "[[Nazism|Nazis]]" for firing a news analyst, [[Juan Williams]], after Williams had made remarks considered by NPR to be offensive. Ailes apologized to a Jewish group, but not to NPR, for using the expression, writing to the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL): "I was of course ad-libbing and should not have chosen that word, but I was angry at the time because of NPR's willingness to censor Juan Williams for not being liberal enough&amp;nbsp;... My now considered opinion 'nasty, inflexible bigot' would have worked better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/17/fox-news-chief-roger-ailes-blasts-national-public-radio-brass-as-nazis.html|title=Fox News Chief Blasts NPR 'Nazis'|first=Howard|last=Kurtz|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADL welcomed and accepted the apology through its National Director, [[Abraham Foxman]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/holocaust-nazis/adl-accepts-apology-from-fox.html|title=ADL Accepts Apology From Fox News CEO Roger Ailes For Inappropriate|publisher=adl.org|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a subsequent letter to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' Foxman said that both Ailes and Beck were "pro-Israel stalwarts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703956604576110392474830956|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|department=Letters to the Editor|title=The Good Rabbis Were Certainly Not Speaking for Us|date=February 1, 2011|first=Abraham H.|last=Foxman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual harassment allegations and resignation ===
In a book published in 2014, [[Gabriel Sherman]]&lt;ref name=shermanbook /&gt; alleged that, in the 1980s, Ailes offered a television producer a raise if she would sleep with him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/08/book-roger-ailes-_n_4558577.html|title=Shocking New Claims About Fox News Chief|first=Joanna|last=Zelman|date=January 7, 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News denied the allegation and rejected the authenticity of Sherman's book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On July 6, 2016, former Fox News anchor [[Gretchen Carlson]] filed a [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit against Ailes. Carlson alleged that she had been fired for rebuffing Ailes' advances.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/business/media/roger-ailes-arguing-gretchen-carlson-breached-contract-presses-for-arbitration.html|title=Roger Ailes, Arguing Gretchen Carlson Breached Contract, Presses for Arbitration|last=Koblin|first=John|date=July 8, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/07/gretchen-carlson-files-lawsuit-against-roger-ailes-alleging-sexual-harassment-225162|title=21st Century Fox launching 'internal review' at Fox News following Gretchen Carlson lawsuit|last=Gold|first=Hadas|authorlink=Hadas Gold|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=|newspaper=[[Politico]]|access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ailes, through his attorney, [[Susan Estrich]], denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Erik Wemple|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/11/14/roger-ailes-issues-grand-denial-of-sexual-harassment-charges-in-megyn-kellys-new-book|title=Roger Ailes issues grand denial of sexual harassment charges in Megyn Kelly's new book|newspaper=Washington Post|date=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Paul Farhi|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/feminist-hero-susan-estrich-fought-sexual-harassment-but-now-represents-roger-ailes-is-she-selling-out-or-standing-up/2016/08/04/904c22ce-5810-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html|title=What is feminist hero Susan Estrich doing representing Roger Ailes?|newspaper=Washington Post|date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Gabriel Sherman reported accounts from six women (two publicly and four anonymously) who alleged sexual harassment by Ailes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/six-more-women-allege-ailes-sexual-harassment.html|title=Six More Women Allege That Roger Ailes Sexually Harassed Them|last=Sherman|first=Gabriel|authorlink=Gabriel Sherman|date=July 9, 2016|work=New York|accessdate=July 9, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710005437/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/six-more-women-allege-ailes-sexual-harassment.html|archivedate=July 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Ailes' counsel released a statement: "It has become obvious that Ms. Carlson and her lawyer are desperately attempting to litigate this in the press because they have no legal case to argue. The latest allegations, all 30 to 50 years old, are false."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ten days later, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine reported that an internal review into Carlson's claims had expanded into a broader review of Ailes' stewardship. It also claimed [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his sons, [[Lachlan Murdoch|Lachlan]] and James, had seen enough information in the preliminary review to conclude that Ailes had to go. They disagreed on the timing, however; James wanted Ailes out immediately, while Rupert and Lachlan wanted to wait until after the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/murdochs-have-decided-to-remove-roger-ailes.html|title=Murdochs Have Decided to Remove Roger Ailes — the Only Question Now Is When|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|first=Gabriel|last=Sherman|authorlink=Gabriel Sherman|date=July 18, 2016|access-date=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 19, ''New York'' reported that [[Megyn Kelly]] told investigators Ailes made "unwanted sexual advances toward her" at the start of her career.  The magazine also reported that the Murdochs had given Ailes an ultimatum—resign by August 1 or be fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/sources-kelly-said-ailes-sexually-harassed-her.html|title=Sources: Megyn Kelly Told Murdoch Investigators That Roger Ailes Sexually Harassed Her|website=New York|first=Gabriel|last=Sherman|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2016, Ailes resigned from Fox News, receiving $40 million&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Settles /&gt; from Fox in an exit agreement. Rupert Murdoch succeeded him as chairman, and as interim CEO until the naming of a permanent replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4413767/roger-ailes-fox-news-resigns-rupert-murdoch/?xid=homepage|title=Roger Ailes Resigns From Fox News Amid Sexual Harassment Accusations|date=July 21, 2016|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims|title=Roger Ailes leaves Fox News in wake of sexual harassment claims|work=The Guardian|date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Murdoch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/fox-news-confirms-that-roger-ailes-is-leaving-company.html|title=Roger Ailes resigns as CEO of Fox News|website=CNBC=Cnbc.com|author=Anita Balakrishnan and Michelle Castillo|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=August 22, 2016}} Article with text of Ailes's resignation letter.&lt;/ref&gt; Ailes wrote: "I will not allow my presence to become a distraction from the work that must be done every day to ensure that Fox News and Fox Business continue to lead our industry." Ailes was thanked for his work, without mention of the allegations. He was to continue to advise Murdoch and [[21st Century Fox]] through 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-21/rupert-murdoch-to-succeed-ailes-as-head-of-fox-news-channel|title=Rupert Murdoch to Succeed Ailes as Head of Fox News Channel|publisher=Bloomberg|author=Lucas Shaw|access-date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further allegations after resignation===
Following Ailes' resignation, [[Andrea Tantaros]] claimed in August 2016 that she approached Fox News executives about Ailes' behavior towards her in 2015. She stated that her allegations resulted first in her being demoted, and then in her being taken off the air in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/andrea-tantaros-made-harassment-claims-against-roger-ailes.html|title=Fox News Host Andrea Tantaros Says She Was Taken Off the Air After Making Sexual-Harassment Claims Against Roger Ailes|first=Gabriel|last=Sherman|website=New York|date=August 8, 2016|access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantaros filed a lawsuit against Fox News in August 2016 for sexual harassment, also accusing [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/08/23/andrea-tantaros-fox-news-scott-brown-harassment-outnumbered/|title=Ex-Fox News Host Says Scott Brown Put His Hands On Her, Made Sexually Suggestive Comments|work=CBS News|date=August 23, 2016|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/08/fox-news-andrea-tantaros-sues-for-sexual-harassment-004733#ixzz4IAd9Ek4o|title=Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros sues for sexual harassment|work=Politico|first=Kelsey|last=Sutton|date=August 23, 2016|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2016, Shelly Ross, writing for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', described her encounter of sexual harassment with Ailes in 1981. She claimed that at a lunch meeting Ailes asked her, "When did you first discover you were sexy?" When Ross explained to Ailes that she found the conversation "very embarrassing," he responded that "the best expression of loyalty comes in the form of a sexual alliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Shelly|title=Roger Ailes Sexually Harassed Me.

In November 2016, Fox News anchor [[Megyn Kelly]] wrote in her book about the details of her sexual abuse allegations against Ailes. According to Kelly, when she first joined Fox News, Ailes would have meetings with her, during which he would make sexual remarks. He also tried to kiss her several times during a closed-door meeting, but she was able to get away and leave the office. After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/books/megyn-kelly-memoir-9-things-we-learned-about-roger-ailes-alleged-sexual-harassment|title=Megyn Kelly's Shocking Memoir: 9 Things We Learned About Roger Ailes’ Alleged Sexual Harassment|date=November 16, 2016|work=People Magazine|author=Brittany King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ohio University ===
In October 2007, Ailes gave a sizeable donation to [[Ohio University]] for a renovated student newsroom.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/outlook/07-08/October/173n.cfm |title=Ohio University Outlook|publisher=Ohio.edu|access-date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Putnam County senior center ===
Ailes and his wife Elizabeth, through their charity, ACI Senior Development Corp., promised $500,000 toward the completion of a senior center in [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]],  [[Putnam County, New York]].  Local opposition to Ailes' participation in the project arose after publication of the sexual harassment accusations against him and in response to a ''[[The Journal News|Journal News]]'' report about previously undisclosed conditions attached to the proposed gift. Under those conditions, ACI would act as general contractor for the project with no obligation to conduct competitive bidding before awarding construction management and other subcontracts.

Further, ACI was excused from any obligation to pay prevailing wages to workers on the project, workers and subcontractors would have no recourse against ACI in case of payment disputes and ACI would deliver its work without warranty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=David McKay|title=Roger Ailes withdraws $500K senior center donation after outcry|work=[[The Journal News]]|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/money/personal-finance/taxes/david-mckay-wilson/2016/08/03/roger-ailes-senior-center-deal-derailed-putnam/87995836/|date=August 3, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=David McKay|title=TAX WATCH: Ailes center shrouded in secrecy|work=[[The Journal News]]|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/money/personal-finance/taxes/david-mckay-wilson/2016/08/02/ailes-senior-center/87921146/|date=August 2, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After extensive public objection to Ailes' participation at an August 2, 2016, public hearing, the Putnam County Legislature suspended adoption of the proposed charitable donation agreement with ACI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Eric|title=Legislators Table Senior Center Lease, Angry Residents Reject Charitable Donation|work=The Putnam County News and Recorder|url=http://www.pcnr.com/news/2016-08-03/Front_Page/Legislators_Table_Senior_Center_Lease.html|date=August 3, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806112615/http://www.pcnr.com/news/2016-08-03/Front_Page/Legislators_Table_Senior_Center_Lease.html|archivedate=August 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Ailes withdrew the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKay Wilson|first1=David|title=Roger Ailes withdraws $500k Putnam gift after outcry|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/money/personal-finance/taxes/david-mckay-wilson/2016/08/03/roger-ailes-withdraws-500k-putnam-gift-after-outcry/88034124/|website=lohud|publisher=The Journal News|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shatter Dead''''' is a 1994 [[zombie film]] directed by [[Scooter McCrae]]. It is set in an unknown area following a woman named Susan's ([[Stark Raven]]) attempt to return to the apartment of her boyfriend ([[Daniel 'Smalls' Johnson]]) in the midst of the return of the dead to a semblance of life. On her way, she is harassed by a preacher ([[Robert Wells (songwriter)|Robert Wells]]) and a dead woman named Mary ([[Flora Fauna]]) intent on convincing her that being undead is preferable to life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/257624/Shatter-Dead/overview New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with a scene of a woman having sex with an apparently female angel. No explanation is given in the film. The back of the DVD cover says the Angel of Death impregnates a mortal woman, causing the dead to come alive. The next shot is of seventeen months later as Susan works her way through a mostly abandoned town on foot. She encounters some of the living dead, including one who gave up his arm to research. Though they seem somewhat bewildered and eager to please, she catches one zombie stealing gas from her car. She chases him and puts a bullet through his gas canister. It explodes dousing the zombie in flames. Susan returns to her car leaves town. Outside of town, her car runs out of gas. She then finds herself surrounded by zombies to force her from her car. A preacher claims her car for the service of the Lord and drives off after the zombies refill the gas tank.

After walking on foot for a while, another car pulls up. The driver offers her a ride. She holds him at gun point and holds a mirror under his nose. When he doesn't exhale warm moist air, she determines him to be a zombie. She takes the car from him (he doesn't put up a fight) and drives for a while, listening to an announcer discussing the current situation on the radio. He doesn't have much information.

Arriving in a new town, she encounters some living people who direct her to a safe house to stay the night (After giving her the mirror test). While staying there, she encounters Mary, a dead woman pretending to be alive, they shower together. Mary tells Susan that she poisoned herself so she can be beautiful forever. Susan, trusts Mary enough to share the bedroom together. Susan sleeps while Mary plays the harmonium. Susan has a dream where she walks in a graveyard and performs fellatio on her sidearm.

At this point the house is attacked by militant zombies (excited by the Preacher who stole Susan's car). This group of Zombies believes these are the end times and God will return once humanity is all dead. They are intent on converting living humans into their way of, uh, metabolism. Waking up surprised, Susan accidentally shoots Mary in the head, destroying Mary's hope of being beautiful forever. The owner of the house, who looks like the woman from the intro but isn't, is shot in the back at close range with a shotgun. She was pregnant but her wound aborts the baby out the front. Susan watches as the newly dead mother begins to nurse the newly dead fetus.

Susan escapes and encounters the preacher who stole her car. She threatens him while he tries to convince her that death is better than life. Susan gives him the mirror test and discovers that he is still alive. Another shot to the face from Susan and the preacher is now one of the undead.

Susan gets her car and her food back and arrives at the apartment of her boyfriend. He's also killed himself but is up and about. The bathtub is filled with his blood. Her boyfriend has lost his mind. He kept hearing the phone ringing and hearing the dead talking to him (including a cremated mother and a sister who never even knew how to use a phone.)

They can't have sex because he has no blood pressure (his blood is in the bathtub after all), so they have intercourse using her gun as a strap-on. He slips poison into her milk. He wants her to be dead and beautiful forever. She tries to induce vomiting, but he stops her. Before she dies, she manages to throw him out the window, breaking most of his bones (and destroying his hope of being young and beautiful forever). The last sequence of the film is a montage switching back and forth between the preacher making splints for her boyfriend and Susan putting tears in her eyes from the faucet so she can mourn her own death.

==Production==
Director McCrae and cinematographer Howe were inspired to make their own film after watching low-budget exploitation films and thinking that they could make a better one themselves.  After experiencing difficulty in explaining his scripts, McCrae decided to shoot an example of the tone and style that he was attempting to convey; that project became ''Shatter Dead''.  Shooting took a total ten days over a two-month period on weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cheap Scares!: Low Budget Horror Filmmakers Share Their Secrets|last=Lamberson|first=Gregory|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2008|isbn=9780786452026|pages=163–174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-aljaPvZYEC&amp;pg=PA163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Joe Bob Briggs]] gave the film a positive review and called it "a Night of the Living Dead for the '90s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-12-22/features/9512210067_1_zombie-shatter-dead-stark-raven|title=Plagues, Zombies - 'Shatter Dead' Has It All|last=Briggs|first=Joe Bob|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=1995-12-22|accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "In all fairness, this is hardcore, uncompromising filmmaking. At the same time, Mr. McCrae should perhaps flesh out his ideas a bit more before putting them to film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/108351/shatter-dead-2/|title=Shatter Dead|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2004-10-22|accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  G. Noel Gross of ''[[DVD Talk]]'' called the film "an esoteric zombie odyssey that plods along like a Euro-horror epic punctuated by violent ejaculations of carnage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3859/shatter-dead-se/ | title=Shatter Dead | last=Gross| first=G. Noel | work=[[DVD Talk]] |date=2002-04-16 | accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said, "Though the premise is fresh and there is a plentiful supply of good raw ideas, the movie is built around character interaction among amateur actors, leaving it scattered and directionless.  It lacks sustained tension and resolution, and directs too much energy away from its fascinating conceptual possibilities in favor of trite exploitation concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2001|pages=158–159|isbn=978-0-7864-9288-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It won the best independent film award at the 1995 [[Fantafestival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essential Monster Movie Guide: A Century of Creature Features on Film, TV, and Video|last=Jones|first=Stephen|publisher=[[Billboard Books]]|year=2000|isbn=9780823079360|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slither''' ('''Aaron Salomon''') is a [[fictional character]], a snake-like [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Captain America]] Annual'' #4 and was created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]]. Salomon is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose head and neck resembles a snake and has green reptile skin. 

Slither first appeared as part of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s latest version of the  [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] along with [[Burner (comics)|Burner]], [[Lifter (comics)|Lifter]], [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]], and [[Randall Darby|Shocker]]. The Brotherhood attacked Captain America, but were defeated. The five mutants later become known as [[Mutant Force]], facing off against the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and later on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Slither later worked for [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and was a member of the [[Serpent Society]] for a brief time.

==Fictional character biography==
Salomon was recruited, alongside four other mutant men ([[Burner (comics)|Burner]], [[Lifter (comics)|Lifter]], [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]], and [[Randall Darby|Shocker]]), to serve in [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].

Wanting to exploit a tiny spaceship he had found, Magneto sent the Brotherhood to apprehend the diminutive [[Mr. One &amp; Mr. Two|Mister One]], who controlled the large Mister Two. The villains attacked Mister One and Mister Two, and [[Captain America]], in a park. During the battle, Salomon wrapped himself around Captain America, stating, "Slither is my name!, and strangling is my game!". When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrived, the Brotherhood fled back to headquarters, and Magneto captured Mister One. The Brotherhood was shocked to learn the plot involved the tiny spaceship. When Captain America and Mister Two attacked, Salomon constricted around Mister Two until Mister Two threw Salomon against Lifter. As he prepared to crush Captain America, Mister Two threw Salomon around Lifter, incapacitating him.  When Mister One exploded the tiny spaceship, the villains were forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America Annual'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

The five mutants, abandoned by Magneto, became mercenaries and were hired by the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]] in his scheme to take over the U.S. and given the team name of the [[Mutant Force]], a name they kept in the following years. They attacked a Coloradan Air-Force base with an army of female warriors (under the control of the Mandrill). When the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] ([[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]) attacked, Salomon constricted around Valkyrie, until Yellowjacket zapped him. When things got out of hand, Burner, Lifter, and Peeper were able to escape with a pile of gold and an unconscious Yellowjacket, leaving Salomon and Shocker behind.

The three villains battled the Defenders alongside the women warriors again and rescued their teammates. During the battle, the Wasp hit Salomon with a blast, then Burner’s flames kept Salomon from attacking for a time. Salomon constricted around a fallen Hellcat. After capturing Valkyrie, Hellcat, and the Wasp, they returned to the base, where Mandrill put the women under his control and put Valkyrie in charge of the Mutant Force. The mutants caroused with the controlled women, and Salomon made out with one. After the Wasp escaped, the Mandrill ordered his forces to attack the Air Force again.

In their battle with the army, Salomon wrapped himself around individual soldiers.  All the surviving soldiers were rounded up in one building and held under an electrical field created by the Shocker. [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] attacked, and soon the field was shorted out and the Mutant Force was quickly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #78-80&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mutant Force, still in custody, was brought before a special United States Intelligence Services branch. They agreed to become special government operatives in exchange for full presidential pardons.

After the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] invaded a baseball stadium, the Mutant Force was sent in with the army to stop him, and the stadium was evacuated. During the battle, Salomon tried to suffocate the Hulk by constricting around his head, but was thrown aside into Shocker. Valkyrie and Hellcat attacked, and Valkyrie knocked a structure down on the mutants, the Hulk escaped.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mutant Force was called to testify against the Defenders in what they thought was a government inquisition (but was actually the alien Tribunal). Lifter testified about their recent battle with the Defenders.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #87&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer working for the government, the Mutant Force (minus Peeper) was recruited by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] alongside several other operatives. [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Mad-Dog]] was put in charge of the Mutant Force.

Mad-Dog and the Mutant Force were sent in to attack the Defenders at the wedding of Hellcat and the Son of Satan in Greentown, Ohio.  During the battle, Salomon restrained the Beast by constricting around him, but the Beast shortly knocked Slither unconscious. The villains were quickly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #125&lt;/ref&gt;

The villains were held in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] null-fields for questioning.  [[Professor Power]] arranged for their release while [[Gargantua (comics)|Leviathan]] created a distraction.

Equipped with special strength-sapping devices, Calley fought alongside the other Secret Empire operatives (Mad Dog, Mutant Force, Leviathan, Seraph, and Harridan) against the Defenders, who were quickly captured.

Mad Dog and the Mutant Force fought off the attacking Defenders while the Secret Empire launched a satellite that would start a world war.

The satellite exploded, and the Defenders quickly defeated the villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #126, 128-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon was taken captive aboard the heroes' ship. Nomad, D-Man, and Diamondback were joined by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Nomad interrogated Salomon brutally. The heroes landed the ship and ran out, leaving Salomon tied up aboard.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #342-344&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Viper's group, the Fangs (with Bludgeon, Heat-Ray, and Razorblade) Salomon assisted Viper in another nihilistic plot, to blind every American who owned a TV set. When Viper got captured, she was tortured by the Red Skull's agent, the Iron Monger, who broke Viper's leg. The Fangs, armed with guns and jet-packs, rescued Viper. Back at the base, Captain America (Steve Rogers), Battlestar, and [[Silver Sable]] attacked. Salomon constricted around Sable, who stabbed him with several weapons and left him moaning in pain. The heroes successfully stopped the plot.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #419&lt;/ref&gt;

Back together with the Mutant Force, Salomon attacked an armored truck for money. The [[New Warriors]] noticed and attacked. [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] bounced an unconscious Salomon into the open truck. All the villains were quickly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Slither was shown to have rejoined the Serpent Society under its Serpent Solutions name at the time when they are recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join the Army of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Slither is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose head greatly resembles that a large snake, and his long neck resembles part of a snake's body. Although the rest of his body is humanoid in shape, he has green scaled skin like a reptile's skin. He speaks with a pronounced hiss. He often crouches or crawls rather than standing or walking erect. Slither is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and can wrap his extraordinarily flexible body around an opponent's as a snake can, and constrict himself, exerting suffocating pressure upon his victim. He has superhuman strength and endurance. His main limitation is his emotional dependence on the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]].

==Other versions==
===Civil War: House of M===
Slither was seen as a member of Magneto's army during his rise to power. He was shot fighting [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]].&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: House of M'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Handedness|Left-handedness]] always occurs at a lower frequency than right-handedness. Generally, left-handedness is found within 10.8% of the overall population. However, left-handedness is more common in [[twin]]s than in single individuals, occurring in 21% of people who are twins.&lt;ref name = "Derom"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derom | first1 = C. | last2 = Thiery | first2 = E. | last3 = Vlietinck | first3 = R. | last4 = Loos | first4 = R. | last5 = Derom | first5 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Handedness in Twins According to Zygosity and Chorion Type : A Preliminary Report | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 407–408 | doi=10.1007/BF02359484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|Monozygotic]] (MZ; identical) twins==
The frequency of pairs of MZ twins in which only one twin is left-handed is about 21% and in which both twins are left-handed is less than 4%.&lt;ref name = "Rife"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rife | first1 = D.C. | year = 1939 | title = Handedness, with special reference to twins | journal = Genetics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 178–186 | pmc=1209084 | pmid=17246963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why is left handedness more prevalent in identical twins?==
The reasons for this have long been debated. Although there are many theories, such as cerebral symmetry, the reason has not been conclusively proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3900763 | pmid=24478742 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00010 | volume=5 | title=An overview of human handedness in twins | year=2014 | journal=Front Psychol | page=10 | last1 = Ooki | first1 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraternal twins==
The frequency of right-handed and left-handed pairs of DZ twins is about 21%, while twins with both individuals displaying left-handedness is less than 4%. There is no difference in the handedness frequency between MZ and DZ twins.&lt;ref name="Rife"/&gt;

==Chances of handedness==
If the parents are both right-handed in DZ and MZ twins, there is a 21% chance of one being left handed.
If one parent is left handed in DZ and MZ twins, there is a 57% chance of one being left handed.
If both parents are left handed, it is almost certain one will be left handed.

==Cross-dominance in twins==
19% of twins are cross dominant. This is the same for both DZ and MZ. Cross-dominance is when your dominant eye and dominant hand are different and if one twin is both right-handed and right-eyed, they have most likely been forced to use their non-dominant hand by a school teacher or parent.

==Monozygotic dichorionic twins==
An early twinning event which happens before 4 days post-fertilization causes monozygotic dichorionic (MZDC) twins. MZDC twins are born in two different [[chorion]] sacs.  The frequency of left-handedness in MZDC twins is 22%.&lt;ref name="Derom"/&gt;

==Monozygotic monochorionic twins==
A later twinning event which occurs after 4 days postfertilization causes monozygotic monochorionic (MZMC) twins. MZMC twins are born in the same chorionic membrane. The data of frequencies of left-handedness in MZMC was 23%. There was no big difference in MZDC and MZMC twins.&lt;ref name="Derom"/&gt;

==Mirror imaging==
It is believed that this correlation between handedness in twins mirror imaging is due to MZ twins sharing the same placental blood supply, and being surrounded by the same chorionic membrane. The zygosity and chorion type do not influence twins handedness.&lt;ref name="Derom"/&gt; 
It is hard to think that discordant handedness in MZ twins demonstrated mirror imaging.
