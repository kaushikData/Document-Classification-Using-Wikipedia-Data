'''''Absolver''''' is a [[martial arts]]-themed [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game developed by Sloclap and published by [[Devolver Digital]] for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. In the game, players control warrior characters who fight other players and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled characters]] across the fictional land of Adal to prove their worthiness of joining the Absolver peacekeepers. The game's story is focused on the human development of the characters as they fight to find their place in the collapsed empire.{{r|Fextralife: interview}} The character's fighting moves are customized in a "combat deck" of cards, with each card assigned to a move. Players earn cards, equipment, and weapons by progressing through the game.

Sloclap, a Parisian indie game developer composed of former [[Ubisoft Paris]] employees, began work on ''Absolver'' in May 2015. Their core game concept was to have fluid, dynamic movement, similar to dance. The game debuted a year later at the [[2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] and was released in August 2017.

''Absolver'' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] game based on martial arts fighting, featuring a seamless  [[open world]] with shortcuts and free-roaming, and merging single, cooperative and competitive play in the same campaign, which is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].{{r|Fextralife: interview}} Players build custom [[Combo (video gaming)|combinations]] of strikes, [[Parry (fencing)|parries]], and [[feints]] to fight other players and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled characters]].{{r|Polygon: Soulsinspired}} Players control warrior characters known as Prospects who travel the fictional land of Adal to fight other players and prove their worth to become one of the Absolver peacekeepers. Players progress through the game to [[unlockable (gaming)|unlock]] new armor and equipment, combat styles, and weapons,{{r|VideoGamer.com: announces}} usually as "loot" dropped by defeated enemies.{{r|Digital Trends: complexity}} The game has minor [[massively multiplayer online game]] elements, including the feature of fighting alongside other players on quests and of directly fighting other players in [[player versus player]] match-ups.{{r|PC Gamer: Enigmatic}} Players can also spar with others to teach their characters skills.{{r|Digital Trends: complexity}}

Players customize their characters' fighting moves{{emdash}}known as a move set{{emdash}}by adding and removing cards in a "combat deck", with each card assigned to a specific move. Additionally, players switch between four fighting stances during combat, which changes the moves available to the player.{{r|Gamasutra: Deckbuilding}} Each fighting stance has two attacks, each with its own controller button. Players earn additional cards by progressing through the game. Each card has a numerical rating for speed and damage dealt as well as secondary functions, such as the ability to break an opponent's guard. The moves in each stance can be set such that the player can switch between stances during a single combination of attacks to have the guard-breaking or absorption-interrupting moves that work best against the opponent's play style.{{r|GamesRadar: timing}} The character can also equip a weapon, but its benefits and drawbacks are balanced: weapons are powerful but slower than skillful hand-to-hand attacks. Players can also disarm other players to take their weapons.{{r|Gamasutra: Deckbuilding}}

== Development ==

Sloclap, a Parisian [[indie video game development|indie game studio]] composed of former [[Ubisoft Paris]] employees,{{r|Polygon: exUbisoft members}} began to develop its first game in May 2015.{{r|VideoGamer.com: announces}} The team had previously worked on games including ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' and the ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]]'' series.{{r|Polygon: exUbisoft members}} They began with the idea that combat should be "fluid" and "dynamic", like a personal choreography. Sloclap expressed this core concept through three internal taglines in their development: "combat is a dance", "movement is your weapon", and "make a move".{{r|Gamasutra: Deckbuilding}} Pierre Tarno, the game's creative director, liked how players could experiment with the combat deck to find a set that works best for them.{{r|Gamasutra: Deckbuilding}} Sloclap plans to closely monitor the [[game balance]] issues of creating overpowered move sets during online play, and plan to monitor this with [[playtesting]].{{r|Gamasutra: Deckbuilding}} ''Absolver'' is built in the [[Unreal Engine 4]] [[game engine]].{{r|VideoGamer.com: announces}} ''Absolver'' was first announced on May 26, 2016,{{r|IGN: announce}} and debuted at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016|June 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] with [[Devolver Digital]] as its publisher.{{r|IGN: announce}} The game was released on August 29, 2017, for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms.{{r|Polygon: preview}}

Critics who previewed the game compared its gameplay to that of ''[[Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter]]''.{{r|Polygon: Soulsinspired|PC Gamer: Enigmatic|GamesRadar: timing}} In particular, Sam Prell (''[[GamesRadar]]'') found the ''Souls'' games and ''Absolver'' to share difficult melee fights that emphasize stamina management, and seamless multiplayer that adds both allies and enemies.{{r|GamesRadar: timing}} Critics also noted how the game's simple controls quickly became complex,{{r|Digital Trends: complexity|GamesRadar: timing}} credited in particular to the game's combat deck concept.{{r|Digital Trends: complexity}} Kris Graft (''[[Gamasutra]]'') wrote that the fighting game was "a promising start" and one of the most interesting he has played.{{r|Gamasutra: Deckbuilding}} ''Absolver'' unexpectedly astonished Griffin McElroy (''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''){{emdash}}it was his "biggest surprise" of the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo.{{r|Polygon: Soulsinspired}} Sam Prell (''GamesRadar'') was also surprised by the depth of the combat system,{{r|GamesRadar: timing}} and Andrew Tarantola (''[[Engadget]]'') noted the game's deviance from the traditional massively multiplayer online game for its lack of guns,{{r|Engadget: Gunless}} and Brad Borque (''[[Digital Trends]]'') added that ''Absolver'' was quiet compared to other battle-focused games. Borque also complimented ''Absolver''{{'s}} palette and thought of its art style as a welcome break from the [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealism]] of recent games.{{r|Digital Trends: complexity}} Games journalists listed the game among the best in show at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo{{r|Digital Trends: best}} where its other accolades included ''[[GamesRadar]]''{{'s}} "Best Indie Game of E3"{{r|GamesRadar: awards}} and ''[[VentureBeat|GamesBeat]]''{{'s}} "Killer App Killer" for "compelling and/or intuitive gameplay" in an [[Unreal Engine]] game.{{r|GamesBeat: awards}}

''Absolver'' received "mixed or average" reviews for the PS4 version of the game, while the PC version received "generally favorable" reviews from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].{{r|Metacritic: reviews}}

{{Nihongo|'''''Another Century's Episode 2'''''|アナザーセンチュリーズエピソード 2|Anazā Senchurīzu Episōdo Tsu}}, abbreviated as '''''A.C.E. 2''''', is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[mecha]] [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] produced by [[Banpresto]] and developed by [[From Software]].  It is the [[sequel]] to the popular 2005 game ''[[Another Century's Episode]]''.  It was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on March 30, 2006.

On November 29, 2007, Banpresto released ''A.C.E. 2 Special Vocal Edition'' as a follow-up to the heels of ''A.C.E. 2'''s sequel, ''[[Another Century's Episode 3: The Final]]''. This version includes vocal theme songs for each of the featured animated series in the game.

==Plot==
A.C.E.2 is not a direct sequel to its [[Another Century's Episode|predecessor]], as it involves its own original plot, as well as covering events that already happened in ''A.C.E.'', albeit differently. This is not an unusual occurrence, as Banpresto has done this with most entries in the ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' franchise; most of the games in that series are not connected by an established continuity (exceptions include the ''[[Super Robot Wars Alpha]]'' games and the titles in the ''Super Robot Wars'' classic timeline), with remakes or updates abounding.

However, there are some links back to ''A.C.E.'' in the sequel. The ''Ark'' series, including the main character's Gunark, use as their power source the super-volatile substance E2, which was introduced in the first game.  Additionally, most of the ''A.C.E.'' original enemies return, this time with a backstory, while in A.C.E. they were simply there to add to the challenge.

*'''Faster Combat''': ''A.C.E. 2'' delivers and portrays high-speed mecha combat better than its predecessor.
*'''Pilot Cut-Ins''': The game will feature the pilots in both [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[cel-shading|cel-shaded]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] forms, while in ''A.C.E.'' their only presence was in sound bites played while launching and during certain battles.
*'''More Weapons''': Each unit can also have up to seven weapons, which can be set by the player; this allows the player to separate the units primary ranged weapon and melee weapon, unlike the previous game.
*'''Improved Support''': While ''A.C.E.'' allowed the player to have other units support him/her during a stage, their presence was limited to occasional voice clips. ''A.C.E. 2'' will have the other units actually appear during the stage as computer-controlled allies.
*'''Combination Attacks''': The player will be able to perform special combination attacks where their team members combine their skills with incredibly devastating (and cinematic) results.  Certain combinations of characters will result in team-ups from the anime involved, such as [[Brain Powerd|Brain Powerd's]] Chakra Extension and [[Martian Successor Nadesico|Nadesico's]] Double Gekigan Flare.  Some combinations of characters (such as the major characters from ''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz|Endless Waltz]]'') get new combinations.  If the player uses three unrelated characters for a combination attack, they simply perform a generic all-out attack.
*'''Favorites System''': Much like recent entries into the ''Super Robot Wars'' series (specifically ''MX'' and ''J''), ''A.C.E. 2'' features a system by which the player can designate one of the featured series as their favorite.  The units from the favored series may be upgraded more than they would normally, potentially making them the strongest units in that player's game.

==Control types==

Like the previous game in the series, ''A.C.E. 2'' features two different set-ups for the controller: shift and select type.  However, unlike ''A.C.E.'', neither of these set-ups will be a "simple mode" for first-time players. Instead, the two different set-ups will simply represent different ways of using the many weapons available to the player.

===Flight controls===

The player can also choose to modify the controls for plane-type units, such as the Re-GZ, the [[VF-1 Valkyrie|Valkyrie's]] Fighter Mode and the transformations of machines like Layzner MK II and L-Gaim MK II.  '''Flight Mode''' is the standard control system, where the player controls roll and pitch with the Left Analogue Stick, and can bank with the L1 and R1 buttons.  '''Easy Mode''' has the analogue stick control both roll and pitch.  '''Flight Reverse Mode''' reverses the natural set-up for altitude, so that tilting the analogue Stick down causes the machine to dive, while holding it up makes the machine climb.

==Featured series==
Six of the series from ''A.C.E.'' return in ''A.C.E. 2'', joined by five new ones (although one of the new series, ''Endless Waltz'', is the sequel to one of the series that did not return from ''[[Another Century's Episode|A.C.E.]]'' and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing|Gundam Wing]]''). Additionally, three EX Series are included, although their involvement in the game's story is not as significant as the other series (excluding ''Wings of Rean'', which is announced to join the series in later promotion video, and have its ONA released after the game). A grand total of 106 playable mecha from the fourteen [[anime]] represented, as well as the originals, are playable.

In addition to the fourteen series, ''A.C.E. 2'' includes new original characters and [[mecha]], designed by Takuya Saito and Junya Ishigaki, respectively. The heroes of the game are Tak Kepford (voiced by [[Daisuke Kishio]]) and Marina Carson (voiced by [[Naomi Shindou]]), and they pilot transforming mecha called ''Gun Arks''.

==Music==
The game's opening theme is "Glorious" by [[Rina Aiuchi]]; its ending theme, also performed by Aiuchi, is "Precious Place".

''A.C.E. 2'' follows the musical style of its predecessor, using remixes of themes from the featured anime along with several new songs composed for the game. However, ''A.C.E. 2'' uses much more faithful remixes of the songs borrowed from anime, while ''A.C.E.'' used more [[rock and roll]]-styled remixes.

The theme songs for each series are:
*''[[Aura Battler Dunbine]]'' - "Dunbine Tobu, Senka no Tsume Ato"
*''[[Blue Comet SPT Layzner]]'' - "Melos no Youni ~Lonely Way~"
*''[[Brain Powerd]]'' - "In My Dream"
*''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz]]'' - "White Reflection"
*''[[Heavy Metal L-Gaim]]'' - "Kaze no No Reply"
*''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' - "Do You Remember Love?"
**Note: Through Macross's "Do You Remember Love?" appears in the vocal version as a plot of story, it is not selectable by player.
*''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' - "You Get to Burning, Go! Aestivalis!"
*''[[Martian Successor Nadesico: The Motion Picture – Prince of Darkness]]'' - "Main Motif Nadesico"
*''[[Metal Armor Dragonar]]'' - "Yume Iro Chaser"
*''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory]]'' - "The Winner, Assault Waves, Rising Operation Stardust"
*''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack]]'' - "Sally"
*''[[Mobile Fighter G Gundam]]'' - "Flying in the Sky, Moeagare Toushi, Waga Kokoro Meikyo Shisui"
*''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' - "Dog Fighter, Destined Battle"
*''[[The Wings of Rean]]'' - "Wings of Rean BGM"

The August 2007 issue of [[Famitsu]] announced a special vocal version of ''A.C.E. 2'', which will be released on November 29, 2007. Like its sequel, ''A.C.E. 3'', the theme songs of each respective series will be replaced by their original vocal themes.

*''Aura Battler Dunbine'' - "Dunbine Tobu"
*''Blue Comet SPT Layzner'' - "Melos no Youni ~Lonely Way~"
*''Brain Powerd'' - "In My Dream"

'''''Anzacs in Overalls''''' is a 1941 Australian documentary film directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].

According to the National Film and Sound Archive it is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A propaganda and morale boosting production from WW2 that looks at the way the industrial and agricultural sectors of Australia helped the war effort. It emphasizes and encourages, through a narrator, the efforts put into production for the war effort by the Australian people through sacrifice, ingenuity, etc. It parallels production scenes with scenes of the items being used in war. There are scenes from: factories/foudaries; aircraft production; engine production; an Australian designed tank; gun and artillery production; production of the Owen gun; Universal carrier and other vehicle production; ship building; munitions production; and agricultural and food production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=%22anzacs%20in%20overalls%22;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 ''Anzacs in Overalls'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at [[National Film and Sound Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Barry and Stuart''' (Barry Jones and Stuart MacLeod) are two [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish BAFTA|BAFTA]] nominated&lt;ref name="baftascotland"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000124/2006|title=BAFTA Awards, Scotland|publisher= ''BAFTA Awards for 2006 on imdb''|date=12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; magicians and comedians whose work has been seen on television and on stage around the world. The double act are known for their comically dark performing style, for taking as inspiration the accounts of [[Bible|Biblical]] [[miracle]]s and faking paranormal phenomena to form the basis for some of their illusions.

== Biography ==

Jones was born on 16 April 1982 in Aberdeen and grew up in [[Portlethen]], [[Scotland]].  MacLeod was born on 4 July 1980 in Aberdeen and grew up in [[Peterhead]], [[Scotland]].  MacLeod attended [[Peterhead Academy]] before studying philosophy and psychology at [[Aberdeen University]], while Jones grew up in Old Portlethen, before moving to [[London]] to study multimedia computing.

They met in [[Aberdeen]] in 1994 and started making videos of themselves performing magic.&lt;ref name="theindependent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/06/how-we-met-magicians-barry-and-stuart/|title=How we met: Magicians Barry and Stuart|publisher= ''The Independent Blog''|date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where their double act style of acting out scenes in character while performing illusions developed.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alternativestovalium.blogspot.com/2006/05/barry-and-stuart-was-jesus-huckster.html |title=Barry and Stuart: Was Jesus A Huckster With Charisma, Or Were The Miracles Really Miraculous?|publisher= ''Transcribed from The Sunday Times''|date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmed results of these magic sketches eventually reached a television production company and led to the making of their first TV series ''Magick''.  The show was nominated as Best Comedy Series at the [[Rose d'Or]] international television awards in [[Montreux]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="rosedor1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000448/2004|title=Rose d'Or Light Entertainment Festival Winners 2004|publisher= ''Rose d'Or Winners for 2004 on imdb.com''|date=13 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 they hosted the television series ''Dirty Tricks'' and television special ''When Magic Tricks go Wrong'' and in 2006 the pair created two one-hour specials for [[Channel 4]], ''Tricks from the Bible'' and ''The Magic of Jesus'' where they took inspiration from and duplicated the miracles described in the Old and New Testament.

In 2009, Jones and MacLeod were awarded the 'Best Comedy Illusionist' Award at the World Magic Awards.&lt;ref name="itricks1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itricks.com/news/2009/10/barry-and-stuart-best-comedy-illusionist-2009/|title=Barry and Stuart – Best Comedy Illusionist 2009|publisher= ''itricks.com''|date=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have toured the UK extensively throughout from 2010 with their live shows as well as performing at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] with new shows between 2008 and 2011.

In 2011 and 2012 they were part of both seasons of BBC1's ''The Magicians'', a live magic show drawing in over 6 million viewers weekly.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/magicians |title=Popular hit magic show returns to BBC One|publisher= ''BBC''|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They most recently made ''The Happenings'' – four one-hour specials for [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]] in which the duo use their magic to fake paranormal events.&lt;ref name="timeout1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/tv-reviews/the-happenings |title=The Happenings Review |publisher= Time Out, London |date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==

=== Magick ===
Jones and MacLeod's first television series ''Magick'' (aka ''Sick Ticks'' also, ''Crack Magick'')  debuted on 5 October 2003 and was described as "comedy magic featuring surreal characters in bizarre and uncomfortable situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magick Full Episodes|url=http://www.hulu.com/magick |publisher=Hulu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began airing in Australia on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] on 1 February 2007 under the title ''Sick Tricks''.

This series featured reverse film magic, where the magic was performed backwards and the film later reversed to reveal the [[backmasking]].

In one of a series of ‘crimes’ caught on [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], footage captures two men being caught en flagrante in a public toilet by a police officer.  To get out of trouble, one of the men hides the other behind his coat and makes him disappear.  In another incident, a man breaks into a car by sticking his hand through a glass window without breaking it.

Secret filming in a supermarket captures MacLeod and Jones magically sabotaging the products by putting dead insects into sealed bottles of mineral water and penetrating razor blades through the foil lids of ready-meals.

In 2004 this four-part series was nominated for a [[Rose D'Or]] comedy award in [[Montreux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://objectiveproductions.com/awards/rose-dor/ |title=Rose D'OR Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dirty Tricks ===

''Dirty Tricks'' was a six-part series hosted by Jones and MacLeod.  It was described as "magic meets Natural Born Killers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv_and_radio/story/0,,1587597,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |title=The Man with the Maggots in his Eyes|date=2005-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also had regular spots from [[Pete Firman]], [[Ali Cook]] and [[Jonathan Goodwin (escapologist)|Jonathan Goodwin]] as well as guest appearances from international variety acts and celebrities including [[Penn &amp; Teller]] and [[Kevin James (magician)|Kevin James]].

At the end of every show, the presenters "killed" the radio and TV presenter [[Neil Fox (broadcaster)|Neil Fox]] in a horrific and painful manner.  These included him being cremated, stabbed and crushed.

=== The Magic of Jesus ===

This one-hour special aired over the Christmas holiday period in December 2005.  In this show Jones and MacLeod drew inspiration from the accounts of Jesus' miracles in the [[New Testament]] to present illusions which included apparently walking on the surface of water in a glass tank, turning water into wine, causing a blind person to temporarily 'see', appearing to raise a deceased person, causing a virgin to apparently become 'pregnant' and feeding 5000 people.

The show caused controversy among newspapers and other press, with John Beyer of [[MediaWatch-UK|Mediawatch]] describing it as "a calculated attempt to cause offence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/192897/Fury-at-C4-Jesus-show.html |publisher=The Sun |title=Fury at C4 Jesus Show|date=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tricks from the Bible ===

Following on from ''The Magic of Jesus'' this one-hour special aired in June 2006.  The duo drew inspiration from the miracle accounts in the Old Testament. Jones and MacLeod performed illusions such as turning staffs into snakes in Egypt, exactly where it was said to be performed in the [[Old Testament]], casting some of the [[plagues of Egypt]] on two fans in an enclosed part of a restaurant, a transformation into a pillar of salt, exorcism of a demon, robbing a man of his strength as [[Samson]] had, apparently raising someone from the dead and pulling a coin from the mouth of a fish, performed on a boat in the [[Red Sea]].

=== The Magicians ===

''[[The Magicians (UK TV series)|The Magicians]]'' is a BBC primetime show, that aired its first series during January 2011. It featured Barry and Stuart alongside host [[Lenny Henry]] and fellow magicians [[Luis de Matos]] and Chris Korn. The show returned for its second series on 7 January 2012, with Barry and Stuart being the only personalities retained from series one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry and Stuart interview|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/magicians/barry-stuart|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second series featured two new magicians alongside Barry and Stuart; American magician [[Jason Latimer]] and English magician [[Pete Firman]]. This second series was broadcast live and was the first magic series to do so in the UK in 30 years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magicians wins BBC1 recommission|url=http://www.televisual.com/news-detail/Magicians-wins-BBC1-recommission-and-sales_nid-839.html|publisher=Televisual|date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Happenings ===
In December 2013 Barry and Stuart's latest show, ''The Happenings'', a four x 60 min series debuted in the UK on the digital channel [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch HD]]. The duo went undercover as they set about making the unbelievable paranormal-like events believable to the unsuspecting residents of towns across the UK and America.

Each episode was a self-contained narrative and featured their magic and illusion under the guise of mysterious incidents that were played out over the course of a few weeks in four different towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UKTV's Watch commissions Four-Part Illusion Show|url=http://www.televisual.com/news-detail/UKTVs-Watch-commissions-four-part-illusion-show_nid-3457.html|publisher=Televisual|date=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes featured, ghosts, vampires, aliens and government cover-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UKTV Watch Happenings Website|url=http://watch.uktv.co.uk/shows/the-happenings}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of events filmed for the program made national headlines including their faked ghost sighting and alien landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Alien Revealed|url=http://watch.uktv.co.uk/shows/the-happenings|publisher=UKTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was first broadcast internationally in April 2014 on the [[National Geographic Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happenings at National Geographic|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/the-happenings/|publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatre ==
In 2008 the duo took their debut live show ''Part Time Warlocks'' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Following 5 star reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/11565-barry-and-stuart-part-time-warlocks|title=Barry &amp; Stuart: Part-time Warlocks (5 stars), Part-time warlocks, full-time fun |publisher=The List |date= |accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a total sell out run, extra dates of the show were staged in a larger venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0400-0449/0426.htm|title=News, Number 426 - 23rd August 2008 |publisher=MagicWeek.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they returned to the [[Edinburgh]] Fringe with a new show ''Powered by Demons'' which they later performed at the [[Soho Theatre]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/barry-stuart-powered-by-demons|title=Barry &amp; Stuart - Powered by Demons at Soho Theatre - Comedy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2010 they performed ''98% Séance'', a show where they used their magic to fake ghostly apparitions under the guise of a [[séance]]. In a five-star review, ''Time Out London'' described the show as "a triumph of astonishing illusions, inventive technology, and unexpected frights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/barry-and-stuart-review|title=Barry and Stuart Review – Comedy – Edinburgh Fringe 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show was the most positively tweeted about show at the Edinburgh Fringe 2010 according to the Realtime, crowd-sourced review website, EdTwinge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/the-bbc-goes-over-to-the-dark-side-with-magicians-who-mix-a-little-blood-with-their-new-tricks-1-1523500|title=The BBC goes over to the dark side with magicians who mix a little blood with their new tricks |publisher=The Scotsman |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They toured the UK in spring 2010 with ''Barry and Stuart: Live''. In 2011 they performed two shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, ''The Show'' and ''The Tell''. In ''The Show'' they performed an hour of magic, then a limited number of that audience had the chance to buy tickets for ''The Tell'' where they would witness the explanations to the all tricks they had just witnessed. In 2012 they toured the UK with ''Show and Tell'', a joint version of the two separate Edinburgh shows, and due to popular demand extended this tour into 2013.

They brought their live show for the first time to audiences in the United States with ''Barry and Stuart Live'' at [[Coronet Theatre (Los Angeles)|Coronet Theatre]] Los Angeles in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/publicspectacle/2013/04/08/barry-and-stuart-two-of-the-darkest-weirdest-magicians-in-the-uk-perform-tonight-at-largo|title=Barry and Stuart, Two of the Darkest, Weirdest Magicians in the U.K., Perform Tonight at Largo |publisher=LA Weekly |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

== Critical reception ==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
[[Allmovie]] called it a "derivative slasher entry" and "one of Deodato's least interesting films."&lt;ref name="allmovie" /&gt; Todd Martin from ''HorrorNews.net'' gave the film a mostly positive review, noting the film's flaws, most notably the lack of originality, and uninteresting sub-plot.&lt;ref name="martin12"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Todd |title=Film Review: Body Count (1987) |url=http://horrornews.net/52712/film-review-body-count-1987/ |website=HorrorNews.net |publisher=Todd Martin |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kit Lively from ''Hysteria Lives!'' awarded the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, " Although no film with David Hess, Mimsy Farmer AND Charles Napier could be a complete waste of time, BODY COUNT is still fairly routine. In addition to showdown!some fairly bad dialogue, it also features the most annoying variation on the chubby practical-joker character that I've ever seen, and it takes entirely too long for the killer to end the audience's discomfort. Still, it's rarely boring, with a few good moments, and many of the murders are pretty graphic".&lt;ref name="livelyrev"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lively |first1=Kit |title=BODY COUNT |url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/hysterialives/Hysteria/body_count.html |website=Hysteria Lives.co.uk |publisher=Kit Lively |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bourrée''' ({{lang-oc|borrèia}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondaqui.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=121&amp;lang=FR Son d'Aquí] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716103758/http://www.sondaqui.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=121&amp;lang=FR |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also in England, '''borry''' or '''bore''') is a [[dance]] of French origin and the words and music that accompany it.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, Percy, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP, 1970, article; ''Bourrée''&lt;/ref&gt; The bourrée resembles the [[gavotte]] in that it is in [[Duple and quadruple meter|double time]] and often has a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm. However, it is somewhat quicker, and its [[Musical phrase|phrase]] starts with a quarter-bar [[anacrusis]] or "pick-up", whereas a gavotte has a half-bar anacrusis.

&lt;/ref&gt; the French court adapted the bourrée, like many such dances, for the purposes of [[concert dance]]. In this way it gave its name to a [[ballet]] step&lt;ref&gt;Kirstein, Lincoln, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons 1969, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glossary of ballet|characteristic of the dance]], a rapid movement of the feet while [[en pointe]] or demi-pointe, and so to the sequence of steps called ''pas de bourrée''.

The bourrée became an optional movement in the [[Suite (music)|classical suite of dances]], and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] wrote bourrées, not necessarily intending them to be danced.

[[File:Bourrée dance pattern 2.png|thumb|250px|Another bourrée [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Blatter"/&gt;]]

== History ==
The bourrée originates in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] in France. It is sometimes called the "French [[clog dance]]" or a "[[branle]] of the [[sabot]]s". First mentioned as a popular dance in 1665 in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], it still survives in Auvergne in the [[Massif Central]] and in the department of [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]] and is danced during [[bal folk|bals folk]] in France and in other countries. The present-day dance in lower Auvergne, also called Montagnarde (''Montanhardas''), is in triple time while that of high Auvergne called Auvergnate (''Auvernhatas'') is in double time. Modern variants termed bourrées are danced as [[partner dance]]s, [[circle dance]]s, [[square dance]]s and [[line dance]]s.

However bourrées have been composed as abstract musical pieces since the mid-16th century. [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions it in his musical compendium ''Syntagma musicum''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/75917/bourree - ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; and introduces it as a dance in his ''Terpsichore''. However, there is no early [[dance notation]] and it is impossible to assess the early interaction of the folk dance and the courtly dance. Musically, the bourrée took on the common [[binary form]] of classical dance movements, sometimes extended by a second bourée, the two to be played in a grand [[ternary form]]; A–(A)–B–A.

[[Marguerite de Navarre]], who was sister to the King of Sweden, introduced the dance to the French court in 1565 and it was popular until the reign of Louis XIII (1601-1643) and opened many balls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improve.com/Top-10/2289 - Streetswing dance history]&lt;/ref&gt; but the bourrée took some time to appear in the early ballet [[dance notation]] of the [[Theatre of France#Baroque theatre|French baroque theatre]]. The step with two movements is not illustrated by [[Raoul Auger Feuillet|Feuillet]] but appears in [[Pierre Rameau|Rameau]] as the "true" pas de bourée, the simpler step, with one movement, is identified with the ''fleuret''.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Wendy, ''Dance and Music of Court and Theater'', Pendragon Press, 1981, page 188 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7uUAq_lZUX4C&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=bouree+rameau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uMUD43CAan&amp;sig=Zy2HicXqmH70qqMBzU7ZD0ewDfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i6URVbuKHcv2Uo2RgpAC&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bouree%20rameau&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The basic step, with one initial movement (i.e. a plié on the supporting leg) and three subsequent changes of weight in a measure, can be performed in a great many variations, and varieties of this step appear commonly throughout the notated dances that were published in the eighteenth century, starting with [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation|Feuillet]] in 1700.&lt;ref&gt;For example, four of the first eight measures of the 1700 Bourée d'Achille dance [[File:Page_1_of_the_dance_la_Bouree_d'Achille_published_in_1700_by_Feuillet.jpg|thumb|right|eight bars of a dance recorded and published by Feuillet in 1700]] are pas de bourée.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minuet step is a pas composé, a step composed of more basic steps. The pas de bourée of one movement is the second half of the most common minuet step, the minuet step of two movements, or "one and a fleuret", as the English master Tomlinson described it. The rare pas de bourée of two movements, mentioned above, occurs as a graceful variation in some recorded passapied, as part of a minuet step of three movements.

As later formalised in classical [[ballet]] the skipping step of the bourrée became a quick, gliding step, often ''[[en pointe]]'' or ''demi-pointe'', one of the most-used step sequences of ballet. A ''pas de bourrée'', more commonly known as the "behind side front" or "back side front", is a quick sequence of movements often taken in preparation for a larger step. In one account it begins with an extension of the first leg while ''demi plié'', closing it to the second as both transit to ''relevé'', extending the second leg to an open position and again closing first to second in ''demi plié '', or with legs straight if quick or as the final step of an ''enchainement''. There are several variants. A ''pas de bourrée piqué'' picks up the feet in between steps.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Ballet Theatre|ABT]] website ''Ballet Dictionary'' [http://www.abt.org/education/dictionary/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Der Vollkommene Capellmeister'' (Hamburg, 1739), [[Johann Mattheson]] wrote of the bourrée, "its distinguishing feature resides in contentment and a pleasant demeanor, at the same time it is somewhat carefree and relaxed, a little indolent and easygoing, though not disagreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Bach. ''The French Suites: Embellished version''. Barenreiter Urtext&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Os de Chagrin Bourree.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Yuri Khanon]] "''L'Os de chagrin''" ("[[The Shagreen Bone]]" opera-interlude) Final: Bourrée]]
Johann Sebastian Bach often used the bourrée in his suites as one of the optional dance movements that come after the [[sarabande]] but before the [[gigue]], and he also wrote two short bourrées in his [[Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach]]. That in his Lute Suite in E Minor (BWV 996) is especially popular.

Handel wrote several bourrées in his [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel#Solo sonatas|solo chamber sonatas]] (for example the fourth movement of his [[Oboe sonata in C minor (HWV 366)|Oboe sonata in C minor]]); however, perhaps his best-known is the seventh movement of the ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'' (Handel) suite.

In the 19th century Frédéric Chopin and [[Emmanuel Chabrier]] wrote bourrées for the piano (such as the latter's ''[[Bourrée fantasque]]'', composed 1891). The Victorian English composer, Sir [[Hubert Parry]] included a bourrée in his ''Lady Radnor Suite'' (1894).

==Popular music==
The bourrée has been used by a number of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]] bands, particularly [[Bourrée in E minor|Bach's E minor Bourrée for the lute]]. In 1969 both [[Bakerloo (Blues Line)|Bakerloo]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] released versions of this, the former as a single, "Drivin' Bachwards", on [[Harvest Records]] (HAR 5004) in July and on their self-titled debut album (Harvest SHVL 762) the following December, the latter on their August album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]''. [[Paul McCartney]] also stated that [[The Beatles (band)|The Beatles]] had known the tune for a long time and that it had inspired his song "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9zL_lfGGQw&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Page]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] often played the opening section of ''Bourrée in E minor'' as part of the solo of a live performance of ''Heartbreaker'' and [[Tenacious D]] play a short rendering in "[[Rock Your Socks]]" on their eponymous album and in "Classico" on their second album. Rock guitarist [[Blues Saraceno]] plays a jazz version in the beginning and end of the track "Bouree" on his third album, ''Hairpick''.

Other adapted bourées include:

*The instrumental "Evil Eye" from [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]'s album ''[[Rising Force]]'' begins with bourrée by [[Johann Krieger]].
*The intro to the song "Totentanz" on [[thrash metal]] band [[Coroner (band)|Coroner's]] album ''[[R.I.P. (Coroner album)|R.I.P.]]'' is a bourrée composed by [[Robert de Visée]].
*[[The Fifth Estate (band)|The Fifth Estate]]'s "Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead" has a central section consisting of the bourrée by [[Michael Praetorius]] from ''Dances Terpsichore''.
*[[The Family Stand]]'s 2010 album ''In 1000 Years'' has a jazz version of bourrée in E minor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9479">'''Catch and kill''' is a technique employed by some newspaper editors in order to prevent information damaging to someone else from becoming public, presumably to protect allies of the editor. The newspaper buys the exclusive rights to a story without the intention of publishing it, in effect silencing the seller.

Catch and kill is distinct from using [[hush money]]: it is practiced by the media and the target may not be aware his or her information will be kept secret. So far, the rare documented cases always involve a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid newspaper]], specifically the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' and its parent company.&lt;ref name=mcD2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/why-isnt-the-media-covering-this-story-or-are-they/|title=‘Why Isn’t The Media Covering This Story?’—Or Are They?|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Radford|date=November 9, 2018|website=Center for Inquiry|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113173930/https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/why-isnt-the-media-covering-this-story-or-are-they/|archive-date=November 13, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Instances where newspapers have been accused of using catch and kill include:

* In 2003, the ''National Enquirer'' allegedly signed a $20,000 contract with one Gigi Goyette to get exclusive rights about the story of her alleged [[Infidelity|extramarital relationship]] with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who at the time was a candidate as [[Governor of California]].&lt;ref name=Arn1/&gt;
[[File:Harvey Weinstein 2011 Shankbone.JPG|left|thumb|135x135px|Harvey Weinstein]]
* In 2015, the ''National Enquirer'' allegedly approached [[Ambra Battilana]] to purchase the rights to her story about the groping she suffered at the hands of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein]], after Weinsten asked for help from a newspaper's executive. When no agreement could be reached between the newspaper and the model, ''National Enquirer'' staff turned to collect damaging personal information on Battilana and other Weinstein accusers.&lt;ref name=wein1/&gt; The upcoming book of the reporter who broke the story about sexual abuse accusations against Harvey Weinstein is entitled "Catch and Kill".&lt;ref name=wein2/&gt;
* In 2015, the ''National Enquirer'''s parent company [[American Media, Inc.|American Media]] paid a former doorman at [[Trump Tower]] $ 30,000 for the exclusive rights to his allegations that he overheard a conversation about a child Donald Trump had with a woman who is not his wife, but never published an article on the topic. In 2018, man's lawyer indicated that AMI released him from his obligations to keep silent about what he said he heard&lt;ref name=doorman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=doorman2/&gt;&lt;ref name=doorman3/&gt;.
* [[File:Karen McDougal 2011.jpg|right|thumb|150x150px|Karen McDougal]]American Media has been accused of making a payment of $150,000 in 2016 to [[Karen McDougal]] for the story of her liaison with real estate mogul [[Donald Trump]], with no intention of publishing the story. The "life-story rights agreement" covers "exclusive ownership of her account of any romantic, personal, or physical relationship she has ever had with any 'then-married man". In response, the publisher stated the deal included other elements such as a regular column from McDougal, and simply decided not to use the story. The CEO of American Media, [[David J. Pecker|David Pecker]], is a friend of Trump's.&lt;ref name=mcD2/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcD1/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcD3/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcD4/&gt;

==Catch and kill in popular culture==

A short film produced by Geoffrey Gunn in 2017 is named ''Catch and Kill''. The main protagonist is a young reporter trying to build a career in the news media.&lt;ref name=movie/&gt;

In the novel ''Through His Eyes'' from Emma Dibdin, two characters discuss an instance of catch and kill by a tabloid.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

The '''cathode-ray tube''' ('''CRT''') is a [[vacuum tube]] that contains one or more [[electron gun]]s and a [[phosphorescent]] screen, and is used to display images.&lt;ref name=crthistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/CathodeRayTube.htm |title=History of the Cathode Ray Tube |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets, or other phenomena. CRTs have also been [[Williams tube|used as memory devices]], in which case the visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data).

In television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name=workings&gt;{{cite web |title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''[[Deflection yoke|magnetic deflection]]'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of [[electronic test instrument]].&lt;ref name=workings/&gt;

[[File:Egun.jpg|thumb|Electron gun]]

A CRT is constructed from a glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e., long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile.  The interior of a CRT is [[hard vacuum|evacuated]] to approximately {{Convert|0.01|Pa|atm}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://wps.aw.com/wps/media/objects/877/898586/topics/topic07.pdf Topic 7 |The Cathode-Ray Tube]. aw.com. 2003-08-01&lt;!--The interior of the tube is a very good vacuum, with a pressure of around 0.01 Pa (10^−7 atm) or less. At any greater pressure, collisions of electrons with air molecules would scatter the electron beam excessively.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to {{Convert|133|nPa|atm}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lasercva.htm repairfaq.org – Sam's Laser FAQ – Vacuum Technology for Home-Built Gas Lasers]. repairfaq.org. 2012-08-02&lt;!--The actual vacuum inside the CRT of a computer monitor or TV is probably at 10^-9 Torr or better.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; evacuation being necessary to facilitate the free flight of electrons from the gun(s) to the tube's face. The fact that it is evacuated makes handling an intact CRT potentially dangerous due to the risk of breaking the tube and causing a violent [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] that can hurl shards of glass at great velocity.  As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

Since the late 2000s, CRTs have been largely superseded by newer "[[flat panel]]" display technologies such as [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]], [[plasma display]], and especially [[OLED]] displays, which in the case of LCD and OLED displays have lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, as well as significantly less weight and bulk. Flat panel displays can also be made in very large sizes; whereas {{Convert|38 to 40|in|cm|abbr=on}} was about the largest size of a CRT television, flat panels are available in {{Convert|60|in|cm|abbr=on}} and larger sizes.

==History==
[[File:Braun cathode ray tube.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Braun's original cold-cathode CRT, 1897]]

Cathode rays were discovered by [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] in 1869 in primitive [[Crookes tube]]s. He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, [[Arthur Schuster]] demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by [[electric field]]s, and [[William Crookes]] showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] succeeded in measuring the mass of cathode rays, showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first "[[subatomic particle]]s", which were later named ''[[electron]]s''. The earliest version of the CRT was known as the "Braun tube", invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''': 552–559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]] with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

The first cathode-ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B. Johnson]] (who gave his name to the term [[Johnson–Nyquist noise|Johnson noise]]) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of [[Western Electric]], and became a commercial product in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cathode Ray Tube and its Applications|journal=International Journal of Innovative Research in Technology|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a CRT television that received images with a 40-line resolution.&lt;ref name="nhk.or.jp"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160101180643/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ ''Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television''], NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 2009-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, he improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wQhlFaxDwrsC&amp;pg=PA220|title=High Above: The untold story of Astra, Europe's leading satellite company|first=Chris|last=Forrester|date=28 August 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, he was the first to transmit human faces in half-tones on a CRT display.&lt;ref name="abramson"&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 231. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935, he had invented an early all-electronic CRT television.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Popular Photography]]'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DJsbJq2_djkC&amp;pg=PA5 November 1990, page 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was named in 1929 by inventor [[Vladimir K. Zworykin]],&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 84. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by Takayanagi's earlier work.&lt;ref name="abramson"/&gt; [[RCA]] was granted a trademark for the term (for its cathode-ray tube) in 1932; it voluntarily released the term to the public domain in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;"RCA Surrenders Rights to Four Trade-Marks," Radio Age, October 1950, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially made electronic television sets with cathode-ray tubes were manufactured by [[Telefunken]] in Germany in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/telefunken.html Telefunken], Early Electronic TV Gallery, Early Television Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/1934-35-Telefunken-FEIII.JPG 1934–35 Telefunken], Television History: The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flat panel display]]s dropped in price and started significantly displacing cathode-ray tubes in the 2000s, with LCD screens exceeding CRTs in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/10/04/GLB_TVTECH0410.gif]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The last known manufacturer of (in this case, recycled) CRTs ceased in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/08/15/489629491/saying-goodbye-to-old-technology-and-a-legendary-nyc-repair-shop|title=Saying Goodbye To Old Technology — And A Legendary NYC Repair Shop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oscilloscope CRTs==
[[File:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|thumb|An oscilloscope showing a [[Lissajous curve]]]]
In [[oscilloscope]] CRTs, [[electrostatic deflection]] is used, rather than the magnetic deflection commonly used with television and other large CRTs. The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an [[electric field]] between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.

===Phosphor persistence===
Various [[phosphor]]s are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one [[microsecond]] to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Doebelin |first= Ernest |title= Measurement Systems |publisher= McGraw Hill Professional |year= 2003 |page= 972 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=q1mOopLHnTEC&amp;pg=PA972 |isbn=978-0-07-292201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For visual observation of brief transient events, a long persistence phosphor may be desirable. For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence phosphor is generally preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shionoya |first= Shigeo |title= Phosphor handbook |publisher= CRC Press |year= 1999 |page= 499 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=lWlcJEDukRIC&amp;pg=PA499 |isbn=978-0-8493-7560-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microchannel plate===
When displaying fast one-shot events, the electron beam must deflect very quickly, with few electrons impinging on the screen, leading to a faint or invisible image on the display. Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]], this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Williams |first= Jim |title= Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities |publisher= Newnes |year= 1991 |pages= 115–116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&amp;pg=PA115 |isbn= 978-0-7506-9640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yen, William M. |author2=Shionoya, Shigeo |author3=Yamamoto, Hajime |title= Practical Applications of Phosphors |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |page= 211 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&amp;pg=PA211 |isbn=978-1-4200-4369-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graticules===
Most oscilloscopes have a [[oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements. The graticule may be permanently marked inside the face of the CRT, or it may be a transparent external plate made of glass or [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] plastic.

[[File:Tektronix 564 Analog Storage Oscilloscope.jpg|thumbnail|The Tektronix Type 564: First Mass Produced Analog Phosphor Storage Oscilloscope]]
These are found in ''[[analog television|analog]] phosphor storage oscilloscopes''. These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.

Where a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode-ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.

When the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970–1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data storage tubes===
{{Main|Williams tube}}
The Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode-ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.

==Color CRTs==
[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]
[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]
[[File:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]
Color tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in [[aperture grille]] designs) or clusters called [[Triad (monitors)|"triads"]] (as in [[shadow mask]] CRTs).&lt;ref name=crtmonitorwork&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/03/20/how_crt_and_lcd_monitors_work/1 |title=How CRT and LCD monitors work |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=bit-tech.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color CRTs have three electron guns, one for each primary color, arranged either in a straight line or in an [[equilateral triangle|equilateral triangular]] configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called "delta-gun", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta Δ.) A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor.&lt;ref name=maskgrill&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtMask-c.html |title=The Shadow Mask and Aperture Grill |work=PC Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[shadow mask]] tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube;&lt;ref name=crtmonitorwork/&gt; the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.&lt;ref name=maskgrill/&gt;

===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===
Due to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.

Color convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask. This is called convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of "static" and "dynamic" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color "shadows" or "ghosts" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were intaglio printed with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.

The solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.

On some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.

Dynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.

===Degaussing===
[[File:Degauss in progress.jpg|thumb|256px|A degaussing in progress.]]
If the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of "color purity" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. 

Most color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.

The degaussing circuit is often built of a [[thermo-electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.

This simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.

==Vector monitors==
{{Main|Vector monitor}}
Vector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971–1984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.

==CRT resolution==
[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moiré]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moiré Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gamma==
CRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types==

===Cat's eye===
{{Main|Magic eye tube}}
In better quality old-fashioned tube radio sets, a tuning guide consisting of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was also known as a "Magic Eye" or "Tuning Eye". Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=vacuumtube.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055711/http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.

===Charactrons===
{{Main|Charactron}}
Some displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=Cathode ray apparatus|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nimo===
{{Main|Nimo tube}}
[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]
Nimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood beam CRT===
{{Main|Electron-stimulated luminescence}}
Flood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels. This technology has largely been replaced with [[light emitting diode]] displays. Unfocused and undeflected CRTs were used as grid-controlled [[Strobe light|stroboscope lamps]] since 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/074/c/CL60.pdf |publisher=[[Ferranti]], Ltd. |title=''Vacuum light sources — High speed stroboscopic light sources'' data sheet |date=August 1958 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print head CRT===
CRTs with an unphosphored front glass but with fine wires embedded in it were used as [[Printer (computing)#Liquid ink electrostatic printers|electrostatic print head]]s in the 1960s. The wires would pass the electron beam current through the glass onto a sheet of paper where the desired content was therefore deposited as an electrical charge pattern. The paper was then passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/c/CK1366.pdf |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]]  |title= ''CK1366 CK1367 Printer-type cathode ray tube'' data sheet |date=1 November 1960 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/c/CK1368.pdf |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]]  |title= ''CK1368 CK1369 Printer-type cathode ray tube'' data sheet |date=1 November 1960 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeus thin CRT display===

===Slimmer CRT===
[[File:Tabgamb.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A comparison between 21-inch Superslim and Ultraslim CRT]]

Some CRT manufacturers, both LG Display and Samsung Display, innovated CRT technology by creating a slimmer tube. Slimmer CRT has a trade name Superslim and Ultraslim. A {{Convert|21|in|cm|adj=on}} flat CRT has a {{Convert|447.2|mm||adj=on}} depth. The depth of Superslim was {{Convert|352|mm||2}} and Ultraslim was {{Convert|295.7|mm|}}.

==21st century usage==

===Demise===
{{Update|date=May 2017}}
Despite being a mainstay of display technology for decades, CRT-based computer monitors and televisions are now virtually a dead technology. Demand for CRT screens dropped precipitously in the last half of the first decade of the 21st century. The rapid advances and falling prices of [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] [[flat panel]] technology -- first for computer monitors, and then for televisions -- spelled doom for competing display technologies such as CRT, [[rear-projection television|rear-projection]], and [[plasma display]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wong|first=May|title=Flat Panels Drive Old TVs From Market |publisher=AP via USA Today |date= 22 October 2006 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2006-10-22-crt-demise_x.htm |accessdate=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most high-end CRT production had ceased by around 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.veritasetvisus.com/LCDTVA/LCDTVA-8,%20Spring-Summer%202009.pdf |title= The Standard TV|publisher= Veritas et Visus |accessdate=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including high-end Sony and Mitsubishi product lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060120/news_1n20sony.html |title=End of an era |publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2005/12/01/matsushita-says-good-bye-to-crts/ |title=Matsushita says good-bye to CRTs |publisher=engadgetHD |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=12 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114110526/http://www.engadgethd.com/2005/12/01/matsushita-says-good-bye-to-crts/ |archivedate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada and the United States, the sale and production of high-end CRT TVs ({{Convert|30|in|cm|adj=on}} screens) in these markets had all but ended by 2007. Just a couple of years later, inexpensive "combo" CRT TVs ({{Convert|20|in|cm|adj=on}} screens with an integrated VHS player) disappeared from discount stores.

Electronics retailers such as Best Buy steadily reduced store spaces for CRTs. In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show; on 4 February 2008, they removed their 30" wide screen CRTs from their North American website and did not replace them with new models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&amp;type=televisions&amp;subtype=slimfithdtv |title=SlimFit HDTV|publisher=Samsung |accessdate=12 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110164950/http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&amp;type=televisions&amp;subtype=slimfithdtv &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[DSG International (retailer)|DSG (Dixons)]], the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80–90% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15–20% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006. Dixons ceased selling CRT televisions in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The future is flat as Dixons withdraws sale of 'big box' televisions |publisher=London Evening Standard |date= 26 November 2006 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23376023-details/The+future+is+flat+as+Dixons+withdraws+sale+of+'big+box'+televisions/article.do |accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the demise of CRTs has been happening more slowly in the developing world. According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Causes===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
CRTs, despite advances, remained relatively heavy and cumbersome in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens had much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size; it was largely impractical to build or use CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels, which allowed them to easily surpass these size limitations while also being thin and wall-mountable (two key features that were increasingly being preferred by customers).

==Health concerns==

===Ionizing radiation===
CRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&amp;nbsp;µC/(kg·h) or 36&amp;nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=Subchapter J, Radiological Health (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicity===
Older color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=Characterization of Lead Leachability from Cathode Ray Tubes Using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).

=== Recycling ===
Due to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[Electronic waste|e-waste recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/cew|title=Covered Electronic Waste Payment System|first=State of|last=California|website=www.calrecycle.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Recycling facilities that accept CRT devices from business and residential sector must obtain contact information such as address and phone number to ensure the CRTs come from a California source in order to participate in the CRT Recycling Payment System. 

In Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the [[WEEE Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |title=WEEE and CRT Processing |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flicker===
{{Main|Flicker (screen)}}
At low [[refresh rate]]s (60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and below), the periodic scanning of the display may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with [[peripheral vision]]. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (PAL) or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (NTSC), although there are some 100&amp;nbsp;Hz PAL televisions that are [[flicker-free]]. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75&amp;nbsp;Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcmech.com/article/crt-monitor-flickering/|title=CRT Monitor Flickering?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the 100 Hz PAL was often achieved using interleaved scanning, dividing the circuit and scan into two beams of 50 Hz. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for [[sonar]] or [[radar]] may have long [[Image persistence|persistence]] phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.

===High-frequency audible noise===
50&amp;nbsp;Hz/60&amp;nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&amp;nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&amp;nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&amp;pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

This problem does not occur on 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&amp;nbsp;kHz to over 100&amp;nbsp;kHz).

===Implosion===
High [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode-ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely—without colliding into molecules of air or other gas. If the glass is damaged, atmospheric pressure can collapse the vacuum tube into dangerous fragments which accelerate inward and then spray at high speed in all directions. The implosion energy is proportional to the evacuated volume of the CRT.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Although modern cathode-ray tubes used in televisions and computer displays have [[epoxy]]-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.&lt;ref name=Bali&gt;{{cite book |last= Bali |first= S.P. |title= Colour Television: Theory and Practice |publisher= Tata McGraw–Hill |year= 1994 |page= 129 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=53nnX4fnnNIC&amp;pg=PA129 |isbn=978-0-07-460024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric shock===
To accelerate the electrons from the cathode to the screen with sufficient velocity, a very [[high voltage]] (EHT or Extra High Tension) is required,&lt;ref&gt;Color Television Servicing Manual, Vol-1, by M.D. Aggarwala, 1985, Television for you, Delhi, India&lt;/ref&gt; from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV. This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain  a charge for some time and therefore dissipate that charge suddenly through a ground such as an inattentive human grounding a capacitor  discharge lead.

==Security concerns==
Under some circumstances, the signal radiated from the [[electron gun]]s, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely and used to reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called [[Van Eck phreaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf|title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special [[TEMPEST]] shielding can mitigate this effect. Such radiation of a potentially exploitable signal, however, occurs also with other display technologies&lt;ref name=Kuhn2004&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kuhn, M.G. |year= 2004 |title= Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays |journal= 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies |pages= 23–25 |url= http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with electronics in general.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Recycling==
As [[electronic waste]], CRTs are considered one of the hardest types to recycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.executiveblueprints.com/aboutweee/WEEECRTandMonitor.htm WEEE: CRT and Monitor Recycling]. Executiveblueprints.com (2 August 2009). Retrieved on 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; CRTs have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors (not phosphorus), both of which are necessary for the display. There are several companies in the United States that charge a small fee to collect CRTs, then subsidize their labor by selling the harvested copper, wire, and [[printed circuit board]]s. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of "hazardous household waste"&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smartbiz.com/article/articleprint/1525/-1/58|publisher=SmartBiz|title=Tips and Tricks for Recycling Old Computers|author=Morgan, Russell|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but considers CRTs that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded, speculatively accumulated, or left unprotected from weather and other damage.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Leaded CRT glass was sold to be remelted into other CRTs, or even broken down and used in road construction.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, David. [http://www.nyfederation.org/PDF/14_CRTDilemma.pdf The CRT Dilemma: Cathode Ray Tube Or Cruel Rude Trash]. RRT Design &amp; Construction&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3719">In [[music]] '''centonization''' (from Latin ''cento'' or patchwork (Randel 2002, 123)) is a theory about the [[musical composition|composition]] of a [[melody]], melodies, or piece based on pre-existing [[melodic figure]]s and formulas (Hoppin 1978, 69). A piece created using centonization is known as a "centonate" (Randel 2002, 123).

The concept of centonization was borrowed from literary theory, and first applied to [[Gregorian chant]] in 1934 by Dom Paolo Ferretti (Chew and McKinnon 2001; Treitler 1975, 7).

Centonization, according to Ferretti's theory, is a very old and widespread technique. The [[musical mode]]s used in [[Gregorian chant]] are supposed to reflect this use; according to the theory, the modes were more collections of appropriate melodic formulas than a set of pitches. Similar ideas appear in the music theory of other cultures; for example, the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] of Arab music, the [[raga]] of Indian music, or the [[pathet]] of Indonesian music. These do not designate merely [[scale (music)|scales]], but sets of appropriate melodies and specific [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] on certain tones (they are sometimes called "melody types") (Powers et al. 2001). The originality of the composer lies in how he or she links these formulas together and elaborates upon them in a new way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;!--It is true that Ferretti is somewhat conflicted on the question of "composing" as an individual activity, but this business about "originality" really must be supported by a citation.--&gt;

Regardless of whether the application of the concept to other branches of Christian chant, or other types of music is valid, its use with respect to Gregorian chant has been severely criticized, and opposing models have been proposed (Hiley 1993, 74–75; Treitler 1974, 356; Treitler 1975, 14–15 &amp; 22–23). The term "centonate" is not applied to other categories of composition constructed from pre-existing units, such as ''fricassée'', ''[[pasticcio]]'', ''[[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]]'', and ''[[quodlibet]]'' (Chew and McKinnon 2001).

{{Culture of Greece}}

The '''Cinema of Greece''' has a long and rich history. Though hampered at times by war or political instability, the Greek film industry dominates the domestic market and has experienced international success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-29|title=List of Greek award-winning films in International Film Festivals|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Greek_award-winning_films_in_International_Film_Festivals&amp;oldid=736720686|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics of Greek cinema include a dynamic plot, strong character development and erotic themes. Two Greek films, ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' (1982) and ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' (1998), have won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].  Five Greek films have received nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

Though Greek cinema took root in the early 1900s, the first mature films weren't produced until the 1920s, after the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]].&lt;ref name=karalisintro&gt;Vrasidas Karalis, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=328oUbR8iT0C&amp;dq=history+greek+cinema&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s History of Greek Cinema]'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2012), pp. ix-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Films during this period, such as ''Astero'' (1929) by Dimitris Gaziadis and ''Maria Pentagiotissa'' (1929) by Ahilleas Madras, consisted of emotional melodramas with an abundance of folkloristic elements.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;Ephraim Katz, "Greece," ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (New York: HarperResource, 2001), pp. 554-555.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orestis Laskos]]'s ''[[Daphnis and Chloe (film)|Daphnis and Chloe]]'' (1931), one of the first Greek films to be shown abroad, contained the first voyeuristic nude scene in a European film.&lt;ref&gt;Babis Aktsoglou, "[http://www.filmfestival.gr/tributes/2003-2004/cinemythology/uk/film1.html Daphnis and Chloe: Plasticity and Lyricism]," ''CineMythology'', 2003-2004. Retrieved: 15 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Axis occupation of Greece|Axis occupation]], the Greek film industry struggled as it was forced to relocate overseas.

Following the [[Greek Civil War]], Greek cinema experienced a revival.  Inspired by [[Italian neorealism]], directors such as Grigoris Grigoriou and Stelios Tatasopoulos created works during this period shot on location using non-professional actors.&lt;ref name=katz /&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, Greek cinema experienced a golden age, starting with [[Michael Cacoyannis]]'s ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955), which was screened at [[1955 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].  The 1960 film ''[[Never on Sunday]]'' was nominated for five Academy Awards, and its lead actress, [[Melina Mercouri]], won the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] at Cannes.  Cacoyannis's ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'' (1964) won three Academy Awards.

Censorship policies of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|1967 junta]] and rising foreign competition led to a decline in Greek cinema.&lt;ref name=karalisintro /&gt;  After the restoration of democracy in the mid-1970s, the Greek film industry again flourished, led by director [[Theodoros Angelopoulos|Theo Angelopoulos]], whose films frequently captured international awards.  The drift toward art-house cinema in the 1980s led to a decline in audiences, however.&lt;ref name=karalisintro /&gt;  In the 1990s, younger Greek filmmakers began experimenting with iconographic motifs.&lt;ref name=karalisintro /&gt;  In spite of funding issues created by the [[Greek government-debt crisis|financial crisis]] in the late 2000s, unique Greek films such as [[Yorgos Lanthimos]]'s ''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'' (2009) and [[Athina Rachel Tsangari]]'s ''[[Attenberg]]'' (2010) received international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Rose, "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/27/attenberg-dogtooth-greece-cinema Attenberg, Dogtooth and the Weird Wave of Greek Cinema]," ''The Guardian'', 26 August 2011.

== History of the Greek cinema ==

===Origins===
In the spring of 1897, the Greeks of [[Athens]] watched the first cinematic ventures (short movies in "journal"). In 1906 Greek Cinema was born when the [[Manakis brothers]] started recording in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and the French filmmaker "Leons" produced the first "Newscast" from the midi-[[Olympic games]] of Athens (the unofficial Olympic games of 1906).

The first cine-theater of Athens opened about a year later and other special 'projection rooms' begun their activity. In 1910-11 the first short comic movies were produced by director [[Spiros Dimitrakopoulos]], who also starred in most of his movies. In 1911 [[Kostas Bachatoris]] presented ''Golfo ({{lang|el|Γκόλφω}})'', a well known traditional love story, considered the first Greek [[feature film]]. In 1912 was founded the first film company ([[Athina Film]]) and in 1916 the [[Asty Film]].

During the [[First World War]], production was limited to documentaries and newscasts only. Directors like George Prokopiou and [[Dimitris Gaziadis]] are distinguished for filming scenes from the battlefield and later, during the Greco-Turkish War, the [[Great Fire of Smyrna|burning of Smyrna]] (1922).

[[File:Manaki Brothers.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Manakis brothers]].]]

The first commercially successful Greek film was ''Villar in the Women's Baths of Faliro'' (''{{lang|el|Ο Βιλλάρ στα γυναικεία λουτρά του Φαλήρου}}''), written, directed by and starring comedian Villar (Nikolaos Sfakianakis) and Nitsa Philosofou. In 1924, Michael Michael (1895&amp;ndash;1944), a Greek comedian, presented some [[short film]] comedies.

In 1926, Gaziadis founded [[Dag Films]] and tried to produce the first [[sound film|speaking movies]]. This company presented its first movie, ''Love and Waves'' (''Eros kai kymata''), in 1927, and experienced moderate success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The company mainly produced historical movies, usually adaptations of novels. In 1930, Dag produced a speaking movie, ''Apaches of Athens'' (''Oi Apahides ton Athinon''), which was based on a Greek [[operetta]] by [[Nikos Hatziapostolou]]. Gaziadis also filmed the 1927 Delphic Festival, an idea of [[Angelos Sikelianos]], with the support of his wife, as part of his general effort towards the revival of the "Delphic Idea". The event consisted of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] contests, an exhibition of [[folk art]], and a performance of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''.

The 1931 film ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''Δάφνις και Χλόη''), directed by [[Orestis Laskos]] (1908&amp;ndash;1992), contained the first voyeuristic nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1932 [[Olympia Films]] presented the movie ''The Shepherdess's Lover'' (''Ο αγαπητικός της βοσκοπούλας''), which was based on a play by Dimitris Koromilas.  Also influential during this period was director Ahilleas Madras, whose work included ''Maria Pentagiotissa'' (1929) and ''Sorcerer of Athens'' (1931).&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;

During the late 1930s, a number of Greek filmmakers fled Greece due to the hostility of [[4th of August Regime|Metaxas Regime]], which came to power following a coup in 1936.  The Greek film industry reemerged in [[Turkey]], and later in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=karalisintro /&gt;  In spite of German occupation during World War II, [[Philopemen Finos]], a film producer who was active in the [[Greek Resistance]], founded [[Finos Films]] (1942), which would later become one of the most commercially successful Greek studios. One of Finos's earliest productions, ''Voice of the Heart'' (''{{lang|el|Η φωνή της καρδιάς}}'') (1943, directed by Dimitris Ioannopoulos), drew large audiences, to the consternation of the Germans.  Another important film during this period, ''Applause'' (''{{lang|el|Χειροκροτήματα}}'') (1944, directed by [[George Tzavellas]]), was produced by Finos's rival, Novak Films.&lt;ref&gt;Kalaris, ''History of Greek Cinema'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as "Pilar" in the [[Sam Wood]] film, ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

===The Golden Age===
[[File:AlikiAutograf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aliki Vougiouklaki]] in [[Israel]], 1964]]

[[File:Έλλη Λαμπέτη.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Ellie Lambeti]]]]
&lt;!-- [[File:AλέκοςΣακελλάριος.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Alekos Sakellarios]]]] --&gt;

The 1950s and 1960s are considered by many to be the "Golden Age" of Greek cinema.&lt;ref name=katz /&gt; Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]], and [[Irene Papas]]. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Notable films were ''[[The Counterfeit Coin]]'' (''{{lang|el|Η κάλπικη λίρα}}'', 1955 directed by [[George Tzavellas]]), ''Bitter Bread'' (''{{lang|el|Πικρό Ψωμί}}'', 1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), and ''The Ogre of Athens'' (''{{lang|el|Δράκος}}'', 1956, directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]).

[[Finos Film]] and director [[Alekos Sakellarios]] collaborated on several films in the late 1950s, namely ''The Hurdy-Gurdy'' (''{{lang|el|Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο}}'', 1955) and its sequel, ''Laterna, ftoheia kai garyfallo'' (''{{lang|el|Λατέρνα}}'', 1958), as well as ''[[I theia ap' to Chicago|Aunt from Chicago]]'' (''{{lang|el|Η Θεία από το Σικάγο}}'', 1957) and ''Maiden's Cheek'' (''{{lang|el|Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο}}'', 1959).

The 1955 film ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'', directed by [[Michael Cacoyannis]] and written by [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], was screened at Cannes, and launched Greek cinema into its "golden age."&lt;ref name=katz /&gt; [[Melina Mercouri]], who starred in the film, met American expatriate director [[Jules Dassin]] at Cannes while attending the screening, and the two would eventually marry.  Dassin directed the 1960 Greek film, ''[[Never on Sunday]]'', which starred Mercouri.  The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Mercouri, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award for Best Song]] for composer [[Manos Hatzidakis]]' title track.&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;  The couple also collaborated on the 1967 musical stage adaptation, ''[[Illya Darling]]'', for which Mercouri received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She went on to star in such films as ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'' and ''[[Phaedra (film)|Phaedra]]'', both directed by Dassin, and the 1969 American comedy, ''[[Gaily, Gaily]]''.

Cacoyannis' 1964 film, ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'', which starred [[Anthony Quinn]], was a major commercial success, and was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film. The movie was based on the novel, ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'', by author [[Nikos Kazantzakis]].  Other important films during this period include ''[[Antigone (film)|Antigone]]'' (1961) and ''[[Electra (1962 film)|Electra]]'' (1962), both of which starred [[Irene Papas]], ''[[The Red Lanterns]]'' (1963) by director [[Vasilis Georgiadis]], and ''[[Ipolochagos Natassa|Battlefield Constantinople]]'' (1970), which starred the "Greek Brigitte Bardot," [[Aliki Vougiouklaki]].&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;

The [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] was first held in 1960, and would subsequently evolve into the primary showcase for emerging filmmakers from Greece and the Balkans region.  The festival showcases both international and Greek films, and awards the "Golden Alexander" for the best feature film.

In 1969, the [[Costa-Gavras]] film ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' was nominated for the Academy Award for both Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture.

===Modern period&lt;!--'Greek Weird Wave' redirects here--&gt;===
[[File:Theodoros Angelopoulos Athens 26-4-2009-2.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Theodoros Angelopoulos]], winner of the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|1998]]]]

The production of Greek films increased after the fall of the dictatorship in the mid-1970s, though the industry struggled with foreign competition and the rise of television.&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;   Michael Cacoyannis' 1977 film, ''[[Iphigenia (film)|Iphigenia]]'', was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.  During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of critically acclaimed movies, among them ''[[The Travelling Players]]'' (1975), ''[[The Hunters (1977 film)|The Hunters]]'' (1977), and ''[[Voyage to Cythera]]'' (1984). His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].  Costa-Gavras's film ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' won the Palme d'Or at [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]].  Director [[Costas Ferris]]'s 1983 film, ''[[Rembetiko (film)|Rembetiko]]'', won the [[Silver Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

When the left-leaning [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] was elected to power in 1981, actress Melina Mercouri, a member of the party, was appointed [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister for Culture]].  In this role, she obtained government support for the Greek film industry, and set up networks to promote Greek cinema abroad.&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;  The increase in government funding led to a predominance of slow-moving, cerebral [[art film|art-house]] films, which lacked mass appeal.&lt;ref name=karalisintro /&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, younger directors turned to more contemporary-paced films and social satires, which brought moderate commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Armstrong, Michael Clark, Christopher Deliso, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PDWSOx4lUwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=greek+cinema+1990s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xsHBUbnjF5Sc9QSerIGoBg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=greek%20cinema%201990s&amp;f=false Greek Islands]'' (Lonely Planet, 2008), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, TV series writers [[Michalis Reppas]] and [[Thanasis Papathanasiou]], collaborating with contemporary famous actors made the sex taboo comedy ''[[Safe Sex (film)|Safe Sex]]'', which was the most successful movie of the decade.

In 1998, with [[Money, A Mythology of Darkness]], [[Vassilis Mazomenos]] created the first European feature 3D animation film, a visual essay on the impact of money on humanity. The film has been acclaimed in both Greece and abroad, nominated for the European Fantasy Award (George Melies award) in 1999 and won the same year the jury's special award in [[Fantasporto]]. Known for his artistic experimentation and influences from early German expressionism, Mazomenos later developed a different narrative with his movies ''[[Guilt (movie)|Guilt]]'' (2009) and ''[[10th Day]]'' (2012). His latest film ''[[Lines (movie)|Lines]]'' (2016) focusing on seven individuals suffering from the economic crisis that has devastated Greece, earned critical and festival acclaim. 

In 2003, ''[[A Touch of Spice]]'' (''Politiki kouzina''), a big-budget film by director [[Tasos Boulmetis]], was the most successful film of the year at the Greek [[box office]], making over 12 million euros. 2004 was also a good year for Greek films, with [[Pantelis Voulgaris]]'s ''[[Brides (2004 film)|Brides]]'' (''Nyfes'') gathering more than a million spectators and over 7 million at the box office. In 2007 the most successful film was ''[[El Greco (2007 film)|El Greco]]'', directed by [[Yannis Smaragdis]].

In 2009, ''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'', directed by [[Yorgos Lanthimos]], won the Prix Un Certain Regard at the Cannes Film Festival, and in 2011 was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name="Oscar 83 nom"&gt;{{cite web |title=83rd Academy Awards Nominations Announced |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/presskits/nominations/pdf/83aa_release.pdf |publisher=oscars.org |accessdate=25 January 2011 |date=2011-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304052150/http://www.oscars.org/press/presskits/nominations/pdf/83aa_release.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 film ''[[Attenberg]]'', directed by [[Athina Rachel Tsangari]], won the Coppa Volpi Award for Best Actress ([[Ariane Labed]]) at the Venice Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/archive/67th-festival/awards/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 ''[[Alps (film)|Alps]]'' won the Osella Award for Best Screenplay ([[Yorgos Lanthimos]] and Efthimiοs Filippou) at the 68th Venice Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/awards/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912001913/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/awards/ |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dogtooth'', ''Attenberg'' and ''Alps'' are part of what some film critics, including Steve Rose of ''[[The Guardian]]'', have termed the "'''Greek Weird Wave'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;," which involves movies with haunting cinematography, alienated protagonists and absurdist dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/12/greek-cinema Dark, Haunting and Wonderfully Weird]," ''The Economist'', 6 December 2011. Retrieved: 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other films mentioned as part of this "wave" include [[Panos H. Koutras]]'s ''[[Strella]]'' (2009) and Yannis Economides's ''[[Knifer]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Steve Rose, "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/27/attenberg-dogtooth-greece-cinema Attenberg, Dogtooth and the Weird Wave of Greek Cinema]," ''The Guardian'', 26 August 2011. Retrieved: 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, just twenty feature-films were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 127 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 5 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[Miss Violence]]'', directed by [[Alexandros Arvanas]] won [[Silver Lion]] for best director at the [[ 70th Venice International Film Festival]]. [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'', compared the film to the previously mentioned, saying that "It (self-evidently) does not have the humour of those movies by [[Yorgos Lanthimos]] and [[Athina Rachel Tsangari]] and by that token, less of their richness and inventiveness. But its force can't be doubted."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bradshaw, "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/miss-violence-review-evil-and-greek-anguish Miss Violence Review - Macabre Tale of Evil and Greek Anguish]," ''The Guardian'', 19 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Dialogue''', in fiction, is a verbal exchange between two or more characters. If there is only ''one'' character talking aloud, it is a [[monologue]].

==Identifiers==
''"This breakfast is making me sick," George said.''

The ''George said'' is the identifier. ''Said'' is the [[verb]] most writers use because reader familiarity with ''said'' prevents it from drawing attention to itself. Although other verbs such as ''ask'', ''shout'', or ''reply'' are acceptable, some identifiers get in the reader's way. For example:

''"Hello," he croaked nervously, "my name's Horace."''&lt;br&gt;
''"What's yours?" he asked with as much aplomb as he could muster.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
another example is:
"My name is Peg, what's yours?" I asked.
"My name is William, but my friends call me Will," said Will.

[[Stephen King]], in his book ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'', expresses his belief that ''said'' is the best identifier to use. King recommends reading a novel by [[Larry McMurtry]], who he claims has mastered the art of well-written dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|King|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitutes are known as ''said-bookisms''. For example, in the sentence ''"What do you mean?" he smiled.'', the word ''smiled'' is a said-bookism.

'''''Fast Striker''''' is a single-player vertical scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo MVS]], [[Sega Dreamcast]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. It is developed by [[Germany|German]] [[Indie game|indie]] developer  [[NG.DEV.TEAM|NG:DEV.TEAM]] in 2010.

== Gameplay ==
2D arcade shooting game with emphasis on scoring originally developed for NEO·GEO. The game lets the player choose between 3 game modes with different scoring systems. Novice Mode for beginners, Original Mode for classic Shoot’ em Up players and Maniac for very experienced players. It features six stages of excellent 2D arcade game play with over 40 unique enemy types, super smooth 3D scrolling backgrounds, huge CGI bosses and it features the biggest megabit count ever since the beginning of NEO·GEO games.

=== Differences from Last Hope ===
In an interview with [[Dreamcast-Scene]] NG:Dev.Team were asked to compare Fast Striker with their previous shooter [[Last Hope (video game)|Last Hope]], Fast Striker was described as a fast-paced reflex action, whereas Last Hope was more bulky, as it required players to memorize the level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dreamcast-scene.com/interviews/ngdev-teams-rene-hellwig/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development ==
German shooter communities Triggerzone and Daddelking participated in the beta testing of Fast Striker.&lt;ref&gt;http://dcemulation.org/?title=Rene_Hellwig_interview&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release and reception ==

===Neo-Geo===
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

===Dreamcast===
The game comes packaged in Japanese style DVD Dreamcast skin (with the case being black instead of white), two editions are released; a regular edition and a deluxe edition. The deluxe edition has alternate box art and a soundtrack enclosed with the game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.segabits.com/?p=3705&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://the-dreamcast-junkyard.blogspot.com/2010/12/dcjy-insideout-fast-striker-limited.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2010 Fast Striker went gold with a tentative release date of December 21, 2010, while NGDEVDIRECT (Developer's online store) shipped the games out on 21 December,&lt;ref&gt;http://ngdevteam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:fast-striker-15-release-gone-gold&amp;catid=1:latest-news&lt;/ref&gt; Retailers such as [[Play-Asia]] and Videogamesnewyork had noted delays in receiving their shipments and adjusted their release dates numerous times.

FAST STRIKER for Dreamcast started shipping on December 21, 2010; the game was well received.

Spanish multiplatform game magazine ''[[Games Tribune]]'' covered Fast Striker in their February 2011 issue (published January 28, 2011), scoring 70%. It was Games Tribune's first review of a Dreamcast game ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/gamestribune/docs/gtm24/ |title=Games Tribune #24, Febrero 2011 |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preview article had already been published in their December 2010 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/gamestribune/docs/gtm22/ |title=Games Tribune #22, Diciembre 2010 |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2010-11-28 |accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freeway Warrior''''' is a series of 4 [[gamebook]]s, created by [[Joe Dever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Joe Dever|url=http://www.projectaon.org/en/pdf/misc/FW_Interview.pdf|publisher=Librogame’s Land|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The books were published between 1988 and 1989, detailing the complete story of a band of nuclear holocaust survivors as they flee Texas to the relative safety of California.

The reader plays the role of Cal Phoenix, the titular ''Freeway Warrior'', as he scouts a safe route for the rag-tag convoy of survivors on their journey to California.

==Timeline==
* 2011: Seventeen 100-kiloton nuclear warheads are stolen by HAVOC – The Hijack, Assassination and Violent Opposition Consortium.
* New Years Day, 2012: The stolen warheads are smuggled into major cities around the globe.  An ultimatum is issued: Unless a £2 trillion ransom is paid and all HAVOC agents being held prisoner released then the warheads will be detonated one by one.
* January 2, 2012: The world government refuses to cooperate; Paris, France is destroyed.
* January 3, 2012: The World Defense League retaliates by attacking HAVOC's command headquarters and killing the inhabitants.  Unknown to them, a failsafe is activated and the remaining warheads are detonated.  A disastrous chain reaction results, feeding on civil and military nuclear installations all across the northern hemisphere. The world as we know it ends...
* 2012–2019: Hundreds of millions of people are killed within days, and many more perish during the years that follow, falling victim to the radioactivity and the severe climatic changes that affect the earth.
* 2019–2020: Radiation decays to tolerable levels, climate returns to normal and survivors emerge to reclaim what little remains of the world they once knew.

==Prelude==
On the eventful day, Cal Phoenix was visiting his Uncle's [[oil-shale]] mine near Austin, Texas.  The mine shielded Cal from the explosions, along with his Aunt and Uncle.  Unfortunately they were left trapped underground.  They had sufficient supplies to survive, but it took eight long years to tunnel to the surface.  When they finally broke through, the world had changed forever.

Cal, Uncle Jonas and Aunt Betty-Ann managed to make radio contact with a colony of survivors near the ruins of McKinney. This colony grew over time, becoming Dallas Colony One (DC1), one of the few safe havens in Texas.

DC1 began entering troubled times; the water supply was drying up, leaving them with no alternative but to abandon their safe haven and attempt to relocate.  Rumours had been heard that California survived virtually intact, so the decision was made to head West, towards California.

==List of books==
# [[Highway Holocaust]] (1988)
# [[Slaughter Mountain Run]] (1989)
# [[The Omega Zone]] (1989)
# [[California Countdown]] (1989)

==Game Mechanics==
While based on the [[Lone Wolf (gamebooks)|Lone Wolf]] system (e.g.,  random number tables, combat results tables, etc.) a further level of complexity is added, making for a deeper experience:
*Skill sets are introduced (including, driving, stealth, shooting) which are often tested for outcomes. These vary and can be increased from book-to-book if the complete series is played (in a similar fashion to the Kai Disciplines in Lone Wolf). One of the most important details is that the more you carry, the more your stealth reduces.
*Ranged combat is as important as close combat and a variety of different weapons, with differing characteristics are available.
*In addition to meals, water and ammo are monitored.

==Notes==
*''Highway Holocaust'' and ''Slaughter Mountain Run'' were initially released as ''Freeway Warrior 1'' and ''Mountain Run'' respectively in the United States since the original titles were deemed too violent.  Later releases used the official titles.
*These books were published after the ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' book #13, ''[[Freeway Fighter]]'' (1985) which also involved driving a modified car in a similarly post-apocalypse world. However, the FF Book was more combat orientated and less character-based, as well as featuring game statistics for the actual motor vehicle.

'''Giorgio Sergio Alessando Gomelsky'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-giorgio-gomelsky-manager-of-the-rolling-stones-1-4005628 |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131744/https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-giorgio-gomelsky-manager-of-the-rolling-stones-1-4005628 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (28 February 1934 – 13 January 2016) was a film maker, [[impresario]], music manager, songwriter (as Oscar Rasputin) and record producer.  He was born in [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], grew up in Switzerland, and later lived in the United Kingdom and the United States.

He owned the ''[[Crawdaddy Club]]'' in London where [[The Rolling Stones]] were the house band, and he was involved with their early management.  He hired [[The Yardbirds]] as a replacement and managed them.  He was also their producer from the beginning through 1966. In 1967, he started [[Marmalade Records]] (distributed by [[Polydor]]), which featured "[[Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity]]", [[The Blossom Toes]], and early recordings by [[Graham Gouldman]] and [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]], who became [[10cc]].  The label closed in 1969.  Gomelsky was also instrumental in the careers of The [[Soft Machine]], [[Daevid Allen]] and [[Gong (band)|Gong]], [[Magma (band)|Magma]] and [[Material (band)|Material]].

==Early years==
Gomelsky was born in [[Tiflis]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. His father was a medical doctor, and his mother was from [[Monte Carlo]]. The family left in 1938 and via Syria, Egypt, and Italy, in 1944 settled in Switzerland, the country where his father had trained.

Giorgio discovered jazz at the age of 10, while living in Italy. One Sunday he was caught out by the 4pm German curfew, so he stayed in the house of friends. Exploring their attic he discovered a gramophone and some jazz records. As a symbol of defiance he and his friends took to occasionally briefly blasting the music out of the window. Fortunately they were never caught. After the liberation, eventually black [[GI (military)|GI]]s arrived and furthered his jazz education.

He attended a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] school in [[Ascona]], near [[Locarno]], Switzerland. With the war over, he was able to pool resources with friends to start a record collection. By 1946, the [[American Forces Network]] had been established and Giorgio was exposed to be-bop via the ''Cool City'' program on [[Voice of America|VOA]]. (In 1964, his father having died and left him some money, Giorgio would return to Ascona and stage a jazz festival in a local airfield.)

He attended a progressive private school, the [[:de:Ecole d’Humanité|School of Humanity]] run by [[:de:Paul Geheeb|Paul Gehheb]], in the mountains of Switzerland. While on vacation, with friends, he travelled around Europe by bicycle. In post-war Germany, they found a thriving cellar-jazz scene in towns like [[Düsseldorf]]. They visited Milan, and pedalled all the way to Paris to see [[Charlie Parker]] perform at the Salon de Jazz.

His mother was a hat designer. Her father had worked for the [[Monte Carlo Casino|Société des Bains de Mer]] (the casino operator) in Monte Carlo, a popular resort for the British, and so she spoke English and became an anglophile, with a particular love of English literature. Thus her employer, [[Claude Saint-Cyr]] of Paris, sent her to run her [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] in London. She would send her Swiss schoolboy son the English music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'' on a weekly basis, from which Giorgio learned English and also became familiar with the British jazz scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Giorgio+Gomelsky|title=Giorgio Gomelsky|website=Discogs|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was still at this time limited opportunity to hear new jazz in Europe, apart from [[Willis Conover]] on VOA. There was an Italian jazz radio show; Flavio Ambrosetti's show on Swiss Radio ran just 20 minutes a week; there was Charles Delaunay jazz show on [[Europe 1]] in Paris; and Charlie Fox on the [[BBC]]; and maybe a couple of German shows. There was a scene in Copenhagen. Aficionados in many cities set up jazz appreciation societies, and Giorgio and friends set one up in Locarno. A trio was formed, Roland Schramlei on bass, Bert Armbruster on piano, and Giorgio on drums. Resources were so limited that, only possessing a ride cymbal, Giorgio would have to hire a drum kit every time they had an engagement.

The main jazz magazine was Les Cahiers du Jazz from Paris, and there was also one in Italy. In both countries the magazines organized the local Jazz Societies into Federations which could then stage concert tours. Giorgio followed their model and formed a Swiss federation that staged concerts.  In 1954, having been denied permission to stage a concert during the Zurich Festival by the city fathers, the Federation staged a daring protest on a Sunday. The resulting publicity persuaded the City to reverse its decision, and thus the Zurich Jazz Festival was born (and exists to this day).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurock.com/features/giorgio.aspx Eurock Interview] posted July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Having become a Swiss citizen, Giorgio had to perform National Service, undergoing basic training with [[Swiss Air Force]], where he flew Bucher [[biplane]]s. Although a proficient pilot he deliberately failed promotion tests and, after rejection, was then free to leave the country.

==Film making in England==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The weekly readings of the Melody Maker, and the lack of further documentation, convinced Giorgio that his vocation would be to film the burgeoning UK jazz scene. He had seen the 1948 film ''[[Jammin' the Blues]]'' and had formed forward-thinking stylistic ideas including synchronised [[fast cutting]]. He succeeded in obtaining a 500 UKP commission from a young Italian TV station and departed for England.

In London he established a relationship with the National Jazz Federation, run by [[Harold Pendleton]], who also managed Britain's top jazz star of the time [[Chris Barber]]. Despite Giorgio's inclination to shoot the avant-garde [[John Dankworth|Johnny Dankworth]], Pendleton prevailed on him to shoot Chris Barber.  The resulting piece, comprising four songs, intercut establishing and audience reaction shots from the [[Royal Festival Hall]] with separate studio session footage. The studio footage, shot in one day, used cutting-edge technology like large Mitchell cameras with 'elephant' suspended mics that restricted camera movements in the small studio, preventing Giorgio from getting all the angles he had hoped for.

This first film was sufficiently well-received that two years later Giorgio filmed Chris Barber for a second time – now a 3 camera shoot in b&amp;w [[Cinemascope]].

Harold Pendleton had started the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival|National Jazz Festival]] and Giorgio had participated as a volunteer helper at the first one in 1959. He was able to secure the rights to film the 1960 festival. A producer/backer was found – Frank Green, the owner of a facility on [[Wardour Street]] where Giorgio had edited his earlier films. Filming was with 4 b/w cameras.  Sound was recorded on the Leevers-Rich synchro-pulse system, allowing separate recording of audio on magnetic tape. The intercom between the cameras was the [[Royal Artillery]]'s system which, designed to be heard over cannon fire, was so loud that at times it would get picked up by the stage mics. Giorgio edited two pilots from the footage, including a piece of the new [[Alexis Korner|Alexis Korner Blues Incorporated]] with [[Charlie Watts]] on drums, but Green was unable to find a buyer.

==British rhythm &amp; blues==
Chris Barber's trad-jazz band had launched the [[skiffle]] craze, and their hit "[[Rock Island Line]]" had made the band's banjo player [[Lonnie Donegan]] a star. As skiffle became passé, Chris, whose sets were structured around the history of jazz, began to feature [[blues]] in its place, utilizing his school friend vocalist/guitarist Alexis Korner, and harmonica player [[Cyril Davies]].&lt;ref name="YT1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRQgeVxx_0 |title=Giorgio Gomelsky – The Birth of British R&amp;B |accessdate=9 April 2009 |last=MacFie |first=Joly |date=8 April 2009 |work=Interview |publisher=Punkcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Barber blues set was strictly country style, Korner was set on expanding the sound to incorporate the more modern electric Chicago sound and an improvisational jazz approach. He formed his own group [[Blues Incorporated|Alexis Korner Blues Incorporated]] and recruited musicians like drummer Charlie Watts and saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith.. Giorgio, then writing for Jazz News, became inspired by this to the extent of becoming evangelical. He coined the term BRB – [[British Rhythm and Blues]], wrote articles, and bent the ear of anyone who would listen.&lt;ref name="YT1" /&gt;

Alex and Cyril had a club in a pub upstairs room on [[Wardour Street]] where blues aficionados would gather on Wednesdays but they needed a larger venue for the noisy big band. With some difficulty, and support from Barber, Giorgio persuaded Pendleton to run a weekly Blues Night on Thursdays at his newly opened neighbouring club [[Marquee Club|The Marquee]]. Korner's new band, and others, were duly booked. However the audiences were still limited to a small group of enthusiasts and the future was uncertain.&lt;ref name="YT1" /&gt;

A Jamaican [[Blue Beat]] club just off [[Portobello Road]] (immortalized in the move [[Scandal (1989 film)|Scandal]]) was one of the hottest spots in London at the time. On a visit Giorgio had a chance encounter with its most notorious clients – [[Christine Keeler]] &amp; [[Mandy Rice-Davies]]. He invited them to visit the Marquee Blues Night and they showed up the following week. The publicity generated was enough to give the night sufficient cachet to become fashionable and successful.&lt;ref name="YT1" /&gt;

Giorgio wanted to build on the success of The Marquee Blues night with more shows but Pendleton wasn't interested. Giorgio began to organize the bands, suggesting that they work [[Cooperative|co-operatively]] to obtain bookings and do other business, just as the earlier Jazz Societies had federated their efforts.  He even persuaded the Portobello Jamaican club to host a couple of blues bands, however the regular patrons were not impressed.&lt;ref name="YT2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVAhST0neJs |title=Giorgio Gomelsky – The First London Blues Festival |accessdate=9 April 2009 |last=MacFie |first=Joly |date=8 April 2009 |work=Interview |publisher=Punkcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio then discovered an alternative venue – the [[Cy Laurie|Cy Laurie Piccadilly Club]] in [[Ham Yard]]. Formerly a major London hotspot, it was now on its uppers. He was able to secure a Saturday night for a fee of $5 and proceeded to stage the first festival of [[British Blues]]. Bands appearing included Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, Blues By Six (which included [[Nicky Hopkins]]), and the Rolling Stones. &lt;!--full line-up needed--&gt; Although attendance was slight, as a promotional device Giorgio prevailed on a number of friends to stand in line outside to attract the attention of passers by, and give the impression of a larger crowd. Pendleton was not at all happy with this local competition for his club.&lt;ref name="YT2" /&gt;

==The Crawdaddy Club==
Gomelsky was certain that the vitality of the genre depended on attracting new young fans, and that attracting young fans depended on involving young musicians.  Giorgio believed that residencies were the key to building an audience for the new bands and, in an example of the lateral thinking instilled him in the Switzerland mountain school, hit on the idea of eschewing central London and weekday nights altogether – to become so far removed that Pendleton could have no grounds for complaint. Thus the Richmond Blues Association was formed and he secured a series of Sunday nights at the Station Hotel in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], a suburb of West London. What Giorgio knew, from his earlier [[be-bop]] interests, was that the nearby Kingston Art School was a fertile hotbed of musical enthusiasm, and also there already was an established blues club in the [[Ealing Jazz Club|basement of the ABC Cafe]] in nearby [[Ealing, London|Ealing]]. Another group having dropped out, The Rolling Stones were given the first residency. The first night only attracted three people, attendance not being helped by Giorgio, in a typical [[malaprop]]ism, accidentally writing "Rhythm &amp; Bulls" on the advertising sign outside the venue.   &lt;!--Some accurate dating needed--&gt; Nevertheless, the talents of the Rolling Stones, and a promotional scheme that gave complimentary admission to any patron that brought two friends, soon led to healthy crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=According to the Rolling Stones|author1=Mick Jagger |author2=Keith Richards |author3=Dora Loewenstein |author4=Charlie Watts |author5=Philip Dodd |author6=Ron Wood |publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8118-4060-6|pages=48–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xP_S-fAnMXYC&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in order to liven up the proceedings, he convinced the Stones, whose repertoire was stretched by the demands of two 45-minute sets, to incorporate a 20-minute rave-up version of [[Bo Diddley]]'s "Crawdad" (originally on the 1960 album ''Bo Diddley in the Spotlight'') as the finale of their show.&lt;ref name="YT3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLwPcNVhinI |title=Giorgio Gomelsky – The Crawdaddy Club |accessdate=9 April 2009 |last=MacFie |first=Joly |date=8 April 2009 |work=Interview |publisher=Punkcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Giorgio had taken on much of the responsibility for managing and promoting the Rolling Stones. Looking to get press on the band, he prevailed on The Richmond and Twickenham Times, a conservative local paper owned by TV presenter [[Richard Dimbleby]], to send a reporter to the Station Hotel. Eventually a reporter, Barry May, undertook to write an article and visited the venue with a photographer.&lt;ref name="YT3" /&gt;

Giorgio also considered he could exploit his reputation as a jazz writer and film-maker to generate interest in the band and entice the jazz critics to visit the Sunday Richmond sessions. He announced that he would make a short promotional film of these "illustrious unknowns".  The news spread and influential writers – first Norman Jopling, and then Peter Jones – showed up, but no copy resulted. Peter Jones did, however, return bringing his friend [[Andrew Loog Oldham]].&lt;ref name="YT3" /&gt;

Not having the facilities to film the band live at the club, he took them into the RG Jones recording studio in [[wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], one of the few independent studios in London at the time. Two songs were recorded and extra footage shot.&lt;ref name="YT3" /&gt; As Giorgio was editing he got a call from Gay, who was writing his article, asking how to name the club. Giorgio, on the spur of the moment, inspired by "Crawdad" – the high point of The Stones' show, with a chorus of "Hey, crawdaddy!" - came up with "The Crawdaddy".&lt;ref name="YT3" /&gt;

Somewhat to his surprise and delight, a full page feature duly appeared in the Richmond and Twickenham Times. Giorgio showed the article to acquaintance Patrick Doncaster, the music critic of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', the largest circulation British daily newspaper. Doncaster was persuaded to, in turn, visit the club, and a half-page feature duly appeared in the next day's ''Mirror''. The powers that be at [[Ind, Coope &amp; Co|Ind Coope Breweries]], owners of the Station Hotel, were aghast at the degenerate behaviour displayed in the article and the club was evicted forthwith.&lt;ref name="YT3" /&gt;

Almost immediately Giorgio had to return to Switzerland, for three weeks, as his father had died. His colleague, photographer Hamish Grimes, went to Pendleton, who provided an introduction to Commander Wheeler, director of the Richmond Athletic Association. They had grounds, just a block away from the Station Hotel, where the National Jazz Festival was held. An arrangement was made for the club to move to a room, almost triple the capacity of the Station Hotel, below the grandstand.&lt;ref name="YT3" /&gt;

==Later career==
In the 1960s, Giorgio went on to manage and produce [[The Yardbirds]], and form a record label [[Marmalade Records]].  He also signed [[Julie Driscoll]] and [[Brian Auger]] &amp; The Trinity and produced early recordings by [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimmy Page]] (both of whom played with the Yardbirds),[Blossom Toes]  [[Rod Stewart]], and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] (the 1969 album ''[[Extrapolation (album)|Extrapolation]]''), [[Alexis Korner]]. [[Graham Bond]] and the [[Soft Machine]].

He brought British rock musicians to record with American blues musicians including the Yardbirds featuring [[Eric Clapton]] with [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], who was Giorgio's roommate for a period in Britain. Giorgio claims that Sonny Boy jammed with [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]] in all keys on a single blues harmonica made to play in one key.

In the 1970s he became involved with progressive jazz rock bands such as [[Gong (band)|Gong]], [[Henry Cow]] and [[Magma (band)|Magma]]. In the 1980s he was pioneer of digital video winning awards for his work using the [[Video Toaster]].

Through the 1970s to the 2010s from his recording and rehearsal studio, [[Red Door (venue)]], in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, Giorgio has continued to nurture and mentor musicians. Following his relationship with the band [[Material (band)|Material]], in the early 1980s he produced "Tonka Wonka Mondays" at [[the Bitter End]], featuring three bands a night who were unnamed "mystery guests", and then had professional music critics dissect their performances during the break: at the end of each evening, a better known featured guest would play their material backed up by "The House Band" led by composer / arranger [[Dave Soldier]] and featuring trumpeter [[Roy Campbell, Jr.|Roy Campbell]]: featured guests included [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Billy Bang]], [[Frank Lowe]], and [[Dennis Charles]]. Giorgio was also a regular DJ at the club [[Tramps]], introducing fans to an array of styles, including new African and experimental jazz music.

With the producer [[Joe Papp]] and early b-boy hiphop stars including [[Futura 2000]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Lori Eastside]] and composers Dave Soldier and Mark Mazur of [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]] he attempted to produce the first hip-hop musical, Persons, at the [[Public Theater]] in 1982.

He was instrumental in bringing the important Czech group, the [[Plastic People of the Universe]], to the international public eye by producing a benefit concert for the band's lyricist [[Egon Bondy]] at [[The Kitchen]] on 29 January 1989, featuring their exiled saxophonist [[Vratislav Brabenec]] and New York musicians including [[Ed Pastorini]], the [[Soldier String Quartet]], [[Craig S. Harris (trombonist)|Craig Harris]], [[Borbetomagus]], [[Elliott Sharp]] and [[Gary Lucas]], who played the Plastic People's repertoire. News of the concert in Prague is said to have helped to inspire the [[Velvet Revolution]], a movement strongly influenced by experimental American rock and jazz music.

Giorgio was involved as guide, producer, and supporter to numerous adventurous New York bands including [[D Generation]], [[101 Crustaceans]], and [[Band of Susans]].

==Material==
In 1978, having received a substantial royalty payment for his work with The Yardbirds, Gomelsky relocated to New York in an attempt to open up the American market to the European progressive jazz-rock bands he was working with. He established the Zu Club in Manhattan and after meeting 24-year-old bass player [[Bill Laswell]], encouraged him to form a band, which began rehearsing in the club's basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/martinbisi.html |title=Martin Bisi interview |publisher=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band became known as the 'Zu Band' until Gomelsky hooked them up with former Gong frontman [[Daevid Allen]] for a performance at his Zu Manifestival at the Zu Club on 8 October 1978 (and for a 24-hour music festival at Entermedia, a performance space on the [[Upper West Side]] of Manhattan), for which they became 'New York Gong'. Allen and the band amicably parted company when they "discovered they couldn't stand the European way of life" during a tour of France. The band then took the name [[Material (band)|Material]], and their debut recording was 1979's instrumental post-punk industrial funk ''[[Temporary Music|Temporary Music 1]]'' EP for Gomelsky's Zu Records.

'''''Hacknet''''' is a 2015 video game that allows the player to perform simulated [[Hacker|computer hacking]]. 

== Gameplay ==
The game is controlled with a combination of a graphical interface and a text based [[Console application|console]]. Hacknet simulates the [[Unix]] terminal and file system, especially for the player's local machine. It is generally possible to use either interface to perform tasks. The core of the gameplay is to connect to other computers and run dedicated programs to break the security so that you can get superuser privileges on the computer. The general procedure is to first run a scan to see what protections the computer has and then run programs matching what the scan revealed.

The game notably averts the common trope of bouncing a connection between several intermediary computers before reaching the target computer. Instead a simplified system of a variable speed countdown is used to force the player to act quickly. If this countdown reaches zero, the player is given one last chance to avoid a game over by hacking their ISP and changing their IP address.

Once [[superuser]] privileges have been obtained, the file system of the computer is investigated. The exact task on each computer varies for each mission, but can in general be performed by running a specific command to access one or more files on the system.

A few systems have specialized interfaces, such as email systems and databases.

Most computer systems contain text files that can be read. A large majority of the files are quotes from the website bash.org.&lt;ref name="rps_august_2015" /&gt;

== Story ==
The game begins with the player being automatically contacted by a user by the username "Bit". The automated message tells the player that it was sent in the event of Bit's death and asks that the player investigate his death.

Bit then starts to teach you the game mechanics by way of simple missions. Bit will then tell you to join the hacking group Entropy

After the tutorial, the story largely takes a back seat for open-ended gameplay, with a mission to address Bit's fate. This mission suggests that Bit was involved in some sort of illegal activity.

=== Naix ===
One of the missions the player takes on involves an opposing hacker by the alias of "Naix". They take offense to being investigated and attack the player by hacking their system. This attack is nearly impossible to defend against and if successful will result in the game GUI disappearing and the virtual computer rebooting, leaving the player with a minimal console interface. Once the player has recovered their system from the attack, the storyline of the game splits: the player can choose to take revenge on the attacker and as a reward get access to a third faction in the game, or follow the guidance of their mission control and make a statement that such behavior is not acceptable, resulting in the resumption of your missions with the faction you were in (called Entropy) before the attack.

=== Project Junebug ===
One late game mission in the game is called "Project Junebug". While the player can see it right after joining the hacking group that offers it, the mission will remain locked until all other missions have been taken care of. The mission is a request to provide [[euthanasia]] for someone terminally ill by hacking their pacemaker.

=== Finale ===
As the final story arc of the game, the player breaks into the computers of a computer security software company, named, "EnTech". As they do so, they are faced with a security system that makes computers inviolable to the tools currently at the disposal of the player. As the player manages to find alternative ways into the protected systems, they discover that Bit was involved in a project for the company. Specifically, the creation of a highly advanced operating system specialized in computer hacking. It is revealed that the plan for the project is to unleash the new operating system to the world in order to cause consumer demand for the protection system.

Bit in particular was a major contributor. As the project was nearing its completion, Bit was starting to question the morality of the project. A project owner asked an anonymous figure to "discourage him." Due to miscommunication, this led to a hit being put out on Bit, and ending in his assassination, despite the project owners attempts to stop it.&lt;ref name="tfbit" /&gt;

Once all the facts of the story have been revealed to the player, they proceed to eradicate all copies of the Hacknet project. Additionally, by command of Bit himself, they bring down the server at the heart of Porthack, the tool that Bit made. Once this final mission is completed, Bit delivers a few final, voice acted words and the game credits roll.

==Development==
''Hacknet'' was developed by [[Matt Trobbiani]], the sole developer of Team Fractal Alligator, based in Australia.&lt;ref name="pcgamer_july_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/radio/adelaide/programs/mornings/hacknet/8421528 |work=abc.net |title=Matthew Trobbiani on developing games

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
| MC = 82/100&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt;
|GSpot=8/10&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

''Hacknet'' received generally positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt;

GameSpot gave the game an 8/10, praising the game for its unique presentation puzzle design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hacknet-labyrinths-review/1900-6416654/|title=Hacknet - Labyrinths Review|work=GameSpot|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DLC==
A DLC expansion for "Hacknet", titled "Hacknet Labyrinths" was announced on August 30 2016.&lt;ref name="rps_august_2016"/&gt; The expansion was set to come out December 2016, however, development issues delayed release to March 31, 2017.&lt;ref name="steam_august_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steam_march_2017"/&gt;

The expansion features new hacking tools and security systems, as well as a 3 to 4 hour chapter to the game, where the player is recruited by a hacker that goes by the alias "Kaguya" into a small elite hacking team. It includes more secrets, more UI themes and a full new soundtrack, from artists such as synthwave artist OGRE and Rémi Gallego, creator of metal/electronic act "[[The Algorithm]]".

==Extensions==
In May 2017, official mod support for ''Hacknet'' titled ''Hacknet Extensions'' was released worldwide, in which players can create their own custom stories and campaigns for the game. These extensions can be shared and downloaded from the [[Steam Workshop]]. Extensions are separate from the main game, and are accessed from a separate menu from the title screen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/hacknet-now-has-modding-tools-so-you-can-create-your-own-campaigns/|title=Hacknet now has modding tools, so you can create your own campaigns|last=Prescott|first=Shaun|date=2017-05-26|work=PC Gamer|access-date=2018-06-02|language=EN-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetech52.com/hacknet-become-great-added-mod-tools-helps-create-custom-campaigns/|title=Hacknet has become great again - Added Mod Tools Helps Create custom Campaigns {{!}} TheTech52|last=Reema|first=|date=2017-05-26|work=TheTech52|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School students in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Fiji]] often play a style of '''handball''' (Also known as four square or - square, with the number in the latter determined by the number of players) that is different from nearly all other types of [[handball (disambiguation)|handball]]. The game is played at [[Recess (break)|recess]], lunch or before and after school. It can also be played at home or anywhere that has a hard surface and at least one line. It has quick set-up time and simple rules, contributing to its popularity.
[[File:Spaldeen.jpg|thumb|The most common handball, a [[Spaldeen]].]]

Unlike most types of handball, this version does not incorporate a wall, instead relying on lines on the ground. A typical handball court is a square split into four, usually by painted lines or [[expansion joint]]s, with the highest and most prestigious position on the court being Ace, followed by King, Queen, then Dunce. The most radical change from [[American handball]] is that players must bounce the ball (usually a tennis ball or a high bounce ball) in their own square first, until it is allowed to bounce into another player's square. Each player, if the ball bounces within their square, must then hit the ball with their hand, have it bounce within their own square once, and then an opponent's square. Failure to do so results in the player being relegated to the lowest position on the court, or the last of the players waiting to enter the court.
Due to the social nature of handball at school and the simplicity of playing, many variations to the rules can occur. For example, one group may play in a square of four while the next school over, the game is played in a straight line of six squares, radically altering the game. In addition, some variations of the game allow for the head or feet to be used to return the ball. As a result, this article only covers the most common rules and is not representative of every variation. In other words, the rules may vary between schools, but basic rules usually remain the same.

==Rules==

=== Basic rules ===
* A game must have at least two players.
* The person in the leading square, ''''serves'''' the ball, bouncing once within their square before entering an opponent's square.
* Once the serve is complete, the receiver must hit the ball to another player.
* The ball must be hit so that it bounces in the player's own square on the first bounce, and into another player's on the second bounce.
* If the first bounce lands on the line and is not a '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''full'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or a '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''double'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', it is known as ''''line'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. When ''''line'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is called the point is replayed.
* If the second bounce of the ball lands on a line between their and another player's square, the ball is deemed to have bounced in the other player's square, thus play continues.
* If an outside object interferes with the play, the point will be replayed.
* When a player is ''''out'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', they must proceed to the lowest square, or to the end of the line of players waiting to enter the court. Players on the court who were of a lower position each move up a square.
The player is 'out' when they have committed any of the following:
* '''Full:''' when the ball lands in another player's square on the first bounce, the player has 'fulled' or has hit a 'full'.
* '''Out:''' when the ball lands outside of the court, the last person who touched the ball or the last court the ball touched is out.
* '''Double:''' when the ball bounces twice in a person's square, the person who is in that square is out. Usually known as 'double', 'double bounce'.
* '''Double touch:''' when the ball is touched twice in a row by the same person.
* '''Grabs/Carry:''' when the ball is held or scooped instead of a clean hit.
* '''Interference:''' if a player interferes with another player, they are out.
* '''Foul:''' when the ball bounces in players square and is not returned to another players square via a hit (the ball then goes out or into another players square).
[[File:Handball Shots.jpg|449x449px|Getting out in handball usually is caused by (anti-clockwise starting top-right): Out, Doubles, Full. The four image is what normal play looks like.|thumb]]

=== Variations ===
Due to the rules of handball varying from school to school, the following variations have developed:

'''Lines:''' depending on the location or age-group, the definition of a 'line' changes and their role in the game also changes. Generally, in younger age groups, if the ball lands on any line separating two opponents on any bounce, it is treated as if it were a line and the point 'replayed'. However, depending on the school or institution, lines can be treated as if they are a part of an opponent's square, thus the game will always continue if the ball hits the line. In instances where the ball may fall on a line separating two squares on the full, the square that the majority of the ball bounces in is consider to be where the ball landed. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some games will deem a ball to be 'out' if it hits any line that does not border another square.

'''Outs:''' in some locations, due to surrounding objects, a handball court may 'extend' onto walls, the roof or external objects such as poles, lockers and windows. In this variation, commonly known as ''''rebounds'''', the ball can bounce off, hit or roll along any other surface near the court as long as it is returned to the court. In this game, the ball is only considered to bounce when it hits the floor of a player's square.

'''Grab:''' in many establishments, the definition of a 'grab' is hotly debated. In some instances, a grab is considered to be any motion when the ball is held. In others, a grab is outlawed however a ''''cradle'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', a low bouncing shot where the ball is balanced in the palm, is allowed. In some games, especially for lower aged groups, grabbing the ball may be allowed.

'''Interference:''' in some versions of the game, interference will resulting in the point being replayed. In other versions a player may commit a ''''ghost'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' without repercussions, where a play attempts to put another player off by moving any part of their body near the ball as the player attempts to hit it.

'''Readiness of the players:''' in some games, players must be fully ready before the player in the top square can serve. In other styles, the player must only be in the square to be considered 'ready'. Finally, in some versions a player may serve at any time, as long as they call '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ever-ready'''' as a warning to players to prepare to commence the point.

'''Serving:''' In most games, as serve is conducted by the player it the highest square throwing the ball into the other square. In other variations, the player must hit the ball out of their hand to make a serve. It is common in games that a player call ''''decent'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' on a serve that not easy to hit, and the point is retaken.

'''Cherries:''' in younger age groups, a game may develop where 'fulls' are allowed, to make play easier.

'''Playing on:''' In the majority of games the ''''first-fault'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' style is used, where - when a player gets out and play continues or multiple outs occur - the play is stopped and the first person to get out is deemed to be out. In other games, ''''two-play-on-play'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is used, where the point may continue if two hits by two other players occur.

== The court ==
Even though each part of the court is referred to as a 'square', a square can be any shape or size. Its edges or 'lines' can be marked with any material, including: paint, expansion joints, cracks, chalk or points where the square meets an object such as a wall or locker. Commonly, the court is either a bitumen or concrete surface. Depending on the school, the squares will either be labelled Ace, King, Queen and Dunce or King, Queen, Jack and Dunce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mooreteachingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/handball-rules.pdf|title=Four Square Handball Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=Moore Teaching Tips|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Handball4.jpg|thumb|263x263px|A paint marked handball court]]

== In popular culture ==
In popular culture, handball has grown popularity in the current '[[meme]]' culture. In Australia, former prime minister [[Kevin Rudd]] released a video in March, 2013 of him playing handball at [[Brisbane State High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kevin Rudd|title=Playing handball at Brisbane State High School|date=2013-03-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoVua2LBeDU|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered a growth of popularity in handball, and lead to him being ingrained into 'handball meme' culture. In late November, 2017, Kevin Rudd played handball with students in a school in Brisbane, and the accompanying video - claiming he is the "king of handball' - reached 40,000 views on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/handball420/videos/1951839748406160/|title=Handball Memes|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handball is also the main theme of the children's television series, ''[[Handball Heroes]]'', which aired on [[ABC Me]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/handball-heroes/|title=Handball Heroes|website=ABC Television|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harvey Thriller''' was a [[comic book]] imprint used by [[Harvey Comics]] for their brief foray into publishing super heroes and other non-'kiddie' comics in the mid-1960s. Overseen by [[Joe Simon]], all the titles featured work by many well-known creators, including [[Jack Kirby]], [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]], [[Wally Wood]], [[Otto Binder]], and the earliest known work by [[Jim Steranko]].

== History ==
=== Thrill Adventure ===
While Harvey Comics has for decades been known for their many kids' comics, such as [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], [[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]], etc., they have published other kinds of comics over the years. From 1955 to 1962, most of their non-kid comic output was done under the "Thrill Adventure" line, under the editorship of [[Joe Simon]], after which they stopped publishing any non-kid comics.

=== Harvey Thriller ===
In the mid-1960s, with the [[camp (style)|camp]] craze created by the [[Batman (TV series)|Batman television series]], Harvey approached Joe Simon again to oversee a new line of comics, mainly [[superhero]]es, but with [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] stories thrown in as well. They also continued the Thrill Adventures title [[Warfront (comics)|Warfront]], after a 7-year hiatus.

The line started off with one-shots ''Unearthly Spectaculars'' #1, ''Thrill-O-Rama'' #1, ''Blast-Off'' #1, and ''Warfront'' #36 in October  1965, using work that was apparently done for the 1950s Thrill Adventure line.  The next issues would not come out until almost a year later in September 1966. Along with the new titles were two reprint titles for [[Fighting American]] and [[The Spirit]], which did include new stories for these characters. All the titles ended by March 1967; unpublished work for ''Jigsaw'' #3 and ''Thrill-O-Rama'' #3 may exist.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">In [[film theory]], the '''institutional mode of representation''' ('''IMR''') is the dominant mode of film construction, which developed in the years after the turn of the century, becoming the norm by about 1914.  Although virtually all films produced today are made within the IMR, it is not the only possible mode of representation.  Other possibilities include the '''primitive mode of representation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which was dominant before being replaced by the IMR; certain [[avant-garde film]]s that constitute a “[[deconstructionist]]” challenge to the IMR; and various non-western modes, notably pre-war Japanese film,&lt;ref&gt;Noël Burch (1979). ''[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.aaq5060.0001.001 To the Distant Observer: Form and Meaning in Japanese Cinema]''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that were possible before the IMR became the worldwide norm.   [[Classical Hollywood cinema]] is the dominant style within the IMR, but other styles such as [[art house]], [[independent film|independent]], and most (current) foreign styles fall no less under the IMR.  

==Overview==
The concept was developed by [[Noël Burch]] in his 1969 book ''Praxis du cinéma''.  Burch’s goal is to show that the IMR was a class-determined practice, developed out of the bourgeois desire for totalizing illusionistic representation.  [[André Bazin]] had identified the “myth of total cinema,” or a constant desire to represent reality as completely as possible, which he claimed as the root of cinema innovations (both technology such as sound, color, and widescreen as well as techniques such as more elaborate editing).  Burch, on the other hand, argues that IMR is no more elaborate or realistic a system than its alternatives.  

The IMR is characterized by the attempt to create an entirely closed fictional world on screen.  The audience is completely imaginatively involved in the film, instead of being distant from it and seeing it as an object to be examined.  Burch argues that the key to the IMR is "spectatorial identification with a ubiquitous camera."&lt;ref&gt;Noël Burch (1986).  "Primitivism and the Avant-Gardes: A Dialectical Approach" in ''Narrative-Apparatus-Ideology'', ed. Phil Rosen.  New York: Columbia UP. p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;  Various techniques (often referred to as the “language of cinema”) were developed in order to accomplish this identification:

* Films are constructed out of a sequence of shots, each of which presents the viewer with one clear piece of information.  In contrast to the Primitive Mode, IMR therefore uses close-ups.
* A three-dimensional space is created, using Renaissance rules of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] as well as new [[cinematic techniques]] such as [[editing]] and [[lighting]].  To preserve the illusion of spatial integrity, which was lost with the introduction of close-ups, eye-line and directional matches were introduced.  The film is thus perceived as taking place in an environment around the viewer.
* Characters are psychologically individuated, through close-ups on faces and acting methods borrowed from (bourgeois) theater.  Psychological depth is prized, and the narrative is driven by character psychology.  The audience is therefore invited to interpret the motivations of the characters, and thus involve itself with the film.

'''Jenkka''' ['jeŋkːɑ] is a fast [[Culture of Finland|Finnish]] [[partner dance]] originated in Finnish [[folk dance]], the Finnish version of [[Schottische]]. It is danced to the music in [[Time signature|2/4]] or [[4/4 time|4/4]] [[time signature]] of about 140 [[beats per minute]].

Men and women do similar steps. The initial [[dance position]] is the man is to the left of the woman both facing in the direction of the [[line of dance]], with their inner arms on each other's waists. The dancers go forward in a run similar to [[Polka]]: "left-right-left-hop(on the left foot)", "right-left-right-hop". After that they join the free arms, assume the face-to-face closed dance position and proceed with the chain of [[pivot turn]]s stepping "left-right-left-right" or "left-hop-right-hop". The runs of similar steps are normally started at the beginnings of musical phrases.

[[Georg Malmstén]] composed many Jenkkas.

==Career==
Jarcho began her career in experimental theater as a performer, acting in plays by [[Richard Maxwell (director)|Richard Maxwell]] in Downtown New York theaters such as the [[Incubator Arts Project#Ontological Theater (1992-2005)|Ontological Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/theater/farewell-to-the-second-floor-theater-at-st-marks-church.html|title=Farewell to the Second-Floor Theater at St. Mark’s Church|first=Alexis|last=Soloski|date=19 June 2014|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soho Rep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/theater/theater-review-drone-on-the-range-adventures-in-the-mild-mild-west.html|title=Drone on the Range: Adventures in the Mild, Mild West|date=6 April 1999|work=The New York Times|first=Peter|last=Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
Nursery, written when she was a senior at Hunter College High School, was a winner of the Young Playwrights Festival National Playwriting Competition and was performed at the Cherry Lane Theater in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/movies/theater-review-works-by-playwrights-too-young-to-drink.html|title=Works by Playwrights Too Young to Drink|date=23 November 2001|work=The New York Times|first=Bruce|last=Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her adaptation of [[Alfred Noyes]]’ poem, ''[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]'' was presented at the [[National Theater of the United States of America|NTUSA]] performance space in Brooklyn in December 2004 and published in ''The Best American Short Plays 2005-2006''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223807521|title=The Best American Short Plays 2005-2006|first1=Barbara|last1=Parisi|first2=David|last2=Ives|first3=Quiara Alegría|last3=Hudes|first4=Jules|last4=Tasca|first5=Pamela|last5=Sneed|first6=Carol K|last6=Mack|first7=Michael|last7=Roderick|first8=Jeni|last8=Mahoney|first9=Dano|last9=Madden|first10=James|last10=Armstrong|first11=Cary|last11=Pepper|first12=Adam|last12=Kraar|first13=Joan|last13=Lipkin|first14=Cara|last14=Restaino|first15=Julia|last15=Jarcho|first16=Murray|last16=Schisgal|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Delmar'' was staged at the Prenzlkasper theater in Berlin, Germany, in October 2005. Jarcho later collaborated with visual artist, Meredith James, who adapted the play as a video installation at the Jack Hanley Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meredith-james.com/work/delmar/1 |title=Work : Delmar |publisher=Meredith James |date= |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the playwrights' collective, 13P, Jarcho's ''American Treasure'' was staged at Paradise Factory Theatre in November 2009. ''The New York Times'' called the play, "an odd, dense, oblique but haunting work" and noted that Jarcho is "a remarkably clever, bewitching writer and a master of stylized behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/theater/reviews/09american.html|title=Historical Whodunit by Julia Jarcho at Paradise Factory|first=Anita|last=Gates|date=8 December 2009|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grimly Handsome'' premiered at the Incubator Arts Project in January 2013 as part of the Other Forces Festival and won the Obie for Best New American Play that year. In January 2015 it was remounted at JACK in Brooklyn.

Other productions by Jarcho include: ''Dreamless Land'' which premiered with [[New York City Players]] at the [[Abrons Arts Center]] in November 2011; ''Nomads'', directed by [[Alice Reagan]], was the final play performed at the Incubator Arts Project in June 2014; ''Every Angel is Brutal'', directed by Knud Adams, was part of [[Clubbed Thumb]]'s Summerworks 2016 lineup and staged at the Wild Project.

Her most recent play, ''The Terrifying'', premiered at the Abrons Arts Center in March 2017.

===Style===
The playwright [[Mac Wellman]] described Jarcho’s work as a writer and director as “[[Menippean satire]]...dealing with the whole analysis of what theater is.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323485704578255950313410458|title=Every Golden Age Needs a Sage|first=Lizzie|last=Simon|date=21 January 2013|work=WSJ}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playwrightslocal4181.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Every-Golden-Age-Needs-a-Sage-WSJ-2013.pdf|title=Every Golden Age Needs a Sage|first=Lizzie|last=Simon|date=21 January 2013|work=WSJ|via=playwrightslocal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kara Nova moved to San Francisco from Ohio when she was 18. She performs regularly as a pole acrobat in venues along the West Coast with burlesque troupe ''Hubba Hubba Revue'', and with avant-garde cabaret circus troupe ''The Vau de Vire Society''.&lt;ref name="Oakland Tribune"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_19050122?source=rss | title=Oakland Tribune | publisher=Oakland Tribune Press | work=Artist's Path Leads to the Pole | date=October 6, 2011 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author=Tietz, Janko | pages=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

According to reviewers, Kara Nova is an exceptionally strong acrobat and an impressive performer. [[Der Spiegel]] commented (in German) ''"Strip Clubs? Topless bars? Cheap Callgirls? Forget it. Pole Dance has long been a trend sport, and Kara Nova is one of the best dancers in the United States. The 22-year-old is all muscle, and performs feats which are frivolous, lascivious - but never vulgar."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,792243,00.html Der Spiegel (in German)]"Poledance-Star Nova: Mädel von der Stange." ('Pole Girl') Janko Tietz, San Francisco. 21 October 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; [[SF Weekly]] wrote ''"Kara Nova's 'Burned at the Cross' pole dance routine is a must see."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/slideshow/july-2011-the-month-in-sf-weekly-pictures-33859499/ SF Weekly] July 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">'''Ken Testi''' is [[Great Britain|British]] [[entrepreneur]] most notable for his involvement with the bands [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Deaf School]] and with the Liverpool music venue [[Eric's Club]].

==Biography==
In the mid-1960s whilst at school, Testi began promoting shows in venues as diverse as scout huts, youth clubs, schools, pubs and civic halls.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 1969, with a band formed at school, he went to London where he met Freddie Bulsara.  A few weeks later Bulsara appeared on stage for the first time, fronting the band Testi had taken to London.  Bulsara changed the band’s name from [[Ibex (band)|Ibex]] to Wreckage and later changed his own name to [[Freddie Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, Jacky &amp; Jenkins, Jim (1992). Queen: As It Began. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0-283-06052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1970, as a college social secretary, Testi continued to follow Mercury’s progress with Roger Taylor and Brian May in the newly formed [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and arranged three shows for the band; at a youth club in Potters Bar, at St Helens College of Technology and at Liverpool’s Cavern Club.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1972 Testi returned to Merseyside, working with local musicians until 1974 when he met members of a band from Liverpool College of Art who had taken their name from the building where they rehearsed – [[Deaf School]].  Deaf School became the spark that ignited a creative, musical explosion in Liverpool which had seen scant original musical output since The Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During two years of tour management with Deaf School, Testi formed an alliance with Roger Eagle.  The two first met in the 1960s at the Magic Village in Manchester.  Together they established [[Eric's Club]] in Mathew Street, Liverpool in 1976.  The first band to play was Deaf School, followed by many of the leading acts of the day: [[The Stranglers]], [[The Runaways]], [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Police]], [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[The Clash]], [[The Ramones]] and [[Talking Heads]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before it closed in March 1980, many new local acts had been encouraged to take to the stage for the first time including [[Jayne Casey]], [[Bill Drummond]], [[Ian Broudie]] and [[Holly Johnson]] ([[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]]), [[Paul Rutherford (singer)|Paul Rutherford]] and [[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]] ([[The Spitfire Boys]]) and [[Pete Wylie]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Killing Heat''''' (released in Sweden as ''Gräset sjunger'') is a 1981 film based on [[Doris Lessing|Doris Lessing's]] 1950 novel ''[[The Grass Is Singing]]''. It stars [[Karen Black]] and  [[John Thaw]] and was filmed in [[Zambia]] and [[Sweden]]. The film was released in Zimbabwe as ''The Grass is Singing''. Apart from the change of the title, possibly to pander to the US market for violence, the urban life depicted in the film would not have existed in Livingstone in the 1960s, or the 1940s for that matter. The film's interiors were reportedly filmed in Sweden, whereas the exteriors were shot in Zambia. The film deals with the issues of colonialism, the white man's role in [[Africa]], and the relationships between the races and genders. The cultural differences between the races also play a cryptic part in the storyline - some aspects of which will be opaque to viewers without local knowledge. Possibly the film expects viewers to be familiar with the novel. There may be an actual case which inspired the novel.

== Plot ==
The film purportedly takes place in [[South Africa]] in the 1960s (unlike the novel which was set in Southern Rhodesia pre-1950). Mary, a city woman, marries a farmer named Dick Turner. Mary leaves the comfortable familiarity of her urban life and goes to live on Dick's struggling farm.  Mary has little experience handling Africans as servants or employees and is harsh and tactless in her treatment of the African farm workers. Mary runs away by herself (to the town of Livingstone, crossing the bridge at Victoria Falls by train - which takes her into what was pre-1964 still Northern Rhodesia), only to find that she cannot get her old job back, and has nowhere to take permanent refuge and no means of financial support. She returns to the farm. Mary slowly becomes insane and breaks the Rhodesian taboo of inter-racial over-familiarity with the African houseboy, Moses. After Mary and Moses are accidentally observed by a newly appointed farm manager in the act of taking what would be considered liberties, Dick decides to send Mary away from the farm. Learning of Mary's forthcoming departure, Moses murders Mary during a rainstorm. Moses is arrested by the police and led off in handcuffs. &lt;ref name="Plot summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petermalone.misacor.org.au/tiki-index.php?page=Grass%20is%20Singing,%20The|title=: Grass is Singing, The|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with two Indian agents working under Ranvir Singh ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) chasing an international arms dealer Mikhail ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran]]), who has been on the radar of several intelligence agencies, but instead he kills them both and escapes. A year later Shabana Khan ([[Taapsee Pannu]]) a college student who is also a Judo fighter is being followed by Indian agency as a potential recruit. One of Shabana's friends, Jai ([[Taher Shabbir]]) who likes Shabana, and always tries to hit on her, asks her on a date a day before his birthday, she agrees to go with him on the date and there he confesses his love for her. During the date he asks her about her past, and Shabana tells him that she had been kept in juvenile detention for killing her abusive father who used to physically assault her mother. During their bike ride home Shabana is a victim of [[eve teasing]] from a group of four drunk men in a Jeep, with the exchange turning into a physical altercation resulting in Jai getting killed and the assailants running away. Soon after, Shabana receives a call from an unknown number asking if she wants to avenge her lover's death. The unknown caller agrees to help her terminate the killer in exchange for Shabana joining a secret agency. Shabana agrees to this and accordingly receives information on the killer's whereabouts, and the agents aid her in killing them. Shabana then goes to Goa, to the same hotel where the main culprit who killed Jai was staying. As instructed, Shabana enters his room killing him and later escapes with the help of Ajay Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]). The unknown caller is then revealed to be agent Ranvir Singh.

Following this Shabana is recruited into the secret agency on a trial basis, wherein she is receives extensive training in physical fitness and fighting techniques. The story then focuses on global arms dealer and supplier Mikhail. Three Indian agents then track down Tony, Mikhail's right hand. During interrogation Tony tips them off as to the identity of a German doctor who has surgically changed Mikhail's face. By the time the agency contacts the doctor to find out how Mikhail looks now Tony kills all three agents and escapes, revealing that he himself is Mikhail. Ranvir Singh gets the tip that Mikhail is planning another plastic surgery to change his face. This time Shabana is sent to kill Mikhail with the help of Ajay Singh and Om Prakash Shukla ([[Anupam Kher]]). Shabana enters the adjacent operation theater disguised as a patient, and after getting rid of Mikhail's private security is about to kill Mikhail in the [[operating theater]]. To her surprise he is awake as he had refused to take general anesthesia during the operation.

==Response==
Shubhra Gupta of ''The Indian Express'' wrote, "What does come as a surprise, however, is just how much of a drag the film is. Except for a few stray sequences in which the limber Taapsee Pannu goes after the bad guys, and the ones in which co-star Akshay Kumar moves in to demonstrate how the big boys do it, there is nothing either novel or interesting about the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Shubhra|title=Naam Shabana movie review: Taapsee Pannu’s action, Akshay Kumar are highlights of this film|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/naam-shabana-movie-review-taapsee-pannu-akshay-kumar-star-rating-4591275/|work= Indian Express|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
"'''One'''" is the 93rd episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the 25th and penultimate episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4)|fourth season]].

This episode's plot was later re-used in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' for the episode "[[Doctor's Orders (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Doctor's Orders]]" with [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr. Phlox]] playing the role of Seven, and [[T'Pol]] playing the role of the Doctor. The episode was based on a premise by [[James Swallow]], based on an invitation to pitch after he submitted a [[spec script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One in a Million|work=Star Trek Magazine|publisher=Titan Magazines|date=August 1998|author=Jim Swallow|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometown.aol.co.uk/redwingproject/one.htm|title=Star Trek Voyager: One|author=James Swallow|year=2001|accessdate=2006-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527182740/http://hometown.aol.co.uk/redwingproject/one.htm#|archive-date=2007-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The crew of ''Voyager'' reaches a Mutara-class nebula in their path towards home. As they start to enter it, the entire crew begins to suffer from intense pain, and one crewmember dies from burns on his skin; only [[Seven of Nine]] is unaffected. Realizing that they cannot withstand the subatomic radiation emanating from the nebula for the month it would take to cross, they consider travelling around it, which would take an additional year to clear.  [[The Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]] proposes a novel solution: to place the crew, save for himself and Seven, in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], allowing them to cross the nebula safely. Captain [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] agrees, and soon, the crew is safely stowed into stasis chambers.

Seven adopts a daily cycle to assure the ship maintains its course and the crew remains healthy while in stasis, at times dealing with [[Tom Paris]]'s fear of small spaces and placing him back in stasis with the Doctor's help. The Doctor attempts to engage Seven in human activities such as a holodeck party with the virtualized crew, but Seven continues to try to keep working during these times.  Suddenly, the computer reports failure in the anti-matter storage tanks, but when Seven arrives in engineering to eject them, there is no sign of problems. They discover the gel packs are starting to fail due to the nebula's radiation, but are able to reroute the computer processor to avoid these faults. The Doctor discovers his mobile emitter has started to fail as well, and is forced to stay in sickbay until the journey is complete.

As the ship nears the edge of the nebula, Seven becomes concerned she is feeling the effects of prolonged isolation, experiencing disturbing dreams and hallucinations. Another ship appears, helmed by Trajis Lo-Tarik, looking for supplies. Seven brings him aboard and provides him with the requested equipment, but when she is struck by another hallucination, Trajis disappears. She warns the Doctor of the intruder on board and attempts to locate Trajis, who seems intent on destroying ''Voyager''. Seven continues to suffer intense hallucinations, including [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]] and Tom Paris [[Spontaneous human combustion|bursting into flames]]. The Doctor [[hot-wiring|hot-wires]] his mobile emitter to try to help Seven, assuring her there is no one else on board, before his emitter dies out. As the hallucinations worsen for Seven, she finds that the ship's propulsion system is failing. Knowing that the ship must clear the nebula, she opts to route power from life support while maintaining the stasis chambers, eventually [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].

Seven regains consciousness in sickbay, surrounded by Janeway, the Doctor, and other crew members. They congratulate her on successfully getting the ship out of the nebula, and that all has been returned to normal. Later, Seven observes Paris, Kim, and [[B'Elanna Torres|Torres]] at the mess hall. She asks to join them, feeling the need for companionship after her ordeal, and they invite her to sit down.

'''Sir Peter Alexander Ustinov''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRSA|size=100|commas=on}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|s|t|ɪ|n|ɒ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|uː|s|t|ɪ|n|ɒ|f}}; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BBC pronouncing dictionary of British names|last=Miller|first=Gertrude M.|date=1971|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=British Broadcasting Corporation|isbn=978-0194311250|location=London|pages=|oclc=154639|postscript=The pronunciations were accepted by Sir Peter himself.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 April 1921{{spaced ndash}}28 March 2004), was an English [[actor]], [[voice actor]], writer, [[dramatist]], [[filmmaker]], [[Theatre director|theatre]] and [[opera director]], [[stage designer]], [[screenwriter]], [[comedian]], [[humourist]], [[Newspaper columnist|newspaper]] and magazine columnist, [[radio broadcaster]] and [[television presenter]]. He was a fixture on television [[talk show]]s and lecture circuits for much of his career. An intellectual and diplomat, he held various academic posts and served as a [[Goodwill Ambassador]] for [[UNICEF]] and President of the [[World Federalist Movement]].

Ustinov was the winner of numerous awards over his life, including two [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor]], [[Emmy Awards]], [[Golden Globes]] and [[BAFTA Awards]] for acting and a [[Grammy Award]] for best recording for children, as well as the recipient of governmental honours from, amongst others, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. He displayed a unique cultural versatility that has frequently earned him the accolade of a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]. [[Miklós Rózsa]], composer of the music for ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' and of numerous concert works, dedicated his String Quartet No. 1, Op. 22 (1950) to Ustinov.

In 2003, [[Durham University]] changed the name of its [[Graduate Society]] to [[Ustinov College]] in honour of the significant contributions Ustinov had made as chancellor of the university from 1992 until his death.

==Family background and early life==
Peter Alexander ''[[Freiherr]]'' von Ustinov was born in London, England. His father, [[Jona von Ustinov|Jona ''Freiherr'' von Ustinov]], was of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Polish Jews|Polish Jewish]], [[Germans|German]] and [[Ethiopia]]n descent. Peter's paternal grandfather was [[Baron]] [[Plato von Ustinov]], a Russian noble, and his grandmother was Magdalena Hall, of mixed Ethiopian-German-Jewish origin. Peter's paternal great-great-grandparents (through Magdalena's mother) were the German painter Eduard Zander and the Ethiopian aristocrat Court-Lady Isette-Werq in Gondar.&lt;ref name="McEwan45"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ltudAgAAQBAJ|title=The Story of Däräsge Maryam|last1=McEwan|first1=Dorothea|date=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag|isbn=978-3643904089|location=Münster|pages=45|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ustinov's mother, [[Nadia Benois|Nadezhda Leontievna Benois]], known as Nadia, was a painter and ballet designer of [[French people|French]], [[Germans|German]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Russians|Russian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitmaria.ru/en/2011/vy-sokij-gost-v-prihode-poseshheniya-pre/|title=Distinguished Guest in the Visitation Parish|last=Strutynski|first=Stanislaw|date=|website=visitmaria.ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215012718/http://www.visitmaria.ru/en/2011/vy-sokij-gost-v-prihode-poseshheniya-pre/|archive-date=Feb 15, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seplis.com/person/peter-ustinov/4309297/|title=Peter Ustinov|last=|first=|date=|website=SEPLIS Beta|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100437/http://www.seplis.com/person/peter-ustinov/4309297/|archive-date=Sep 24, 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Leon Benois]], was an [[Imperial Russia]]n architect and owner of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting ''[[The Benois Madonna|Madonna Benois]]''. Leon's brother [[Alexandre Benois]] was a stage designer who worked with [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]]. Their paternal ancestor Jules-César Benois was a chef who had left France for [[St. Petersburg]] during the [[French Revolution]] and became a chef to Emperor [[Paul I of Russia]].

Jona (or Iona) worked as a press officer at the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom|German Embassy in London]] in the 1930s and was a reporter for a German news agency. In 1935, two years after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany, Jona von Ustinov began working for the British intelligence service [[MI5]] and became a British citizen, thus avoiding internment during the war. He was the controller of [[Wolfgang Gans zu Putlitz]], an MI5 spy in the German embassy in London who furnished information on Hitler's intentions before the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/oct/05/politicians-soviet-agents-mi5-book|title=MI5 monitored union and CND leaders with ministers' backing, book reveals|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|date=Oct 5, 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622134149/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/oct/05/politicians-soviet-agents-mi5-book|archive-date=Jun 22, 2012|dead-url=no|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Peter Wright]] mentions in his book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' that Jona was possibly the spy known as U35; Ustinov says in his autobiography that his father hosted secret meetings of senior British and German officials at their London home.) Ustinov's great-grandfather Moritz Hall, a Jewish refugee from [[Kraków]] and later a Christian convert and collaborator of Swiss and German missionaries in Ethiopia, married into a German-Ethiopian family.&lt;ref&gt;For his biography, with references to archival documentation and publications on him and his family, see Holtz: "Hall, Moritz", in: Siegbert Uhlig (ed.): [[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]], vol. 2, Wiesbaden 2005. Also, a family photo shows Ustinov's grandmother with her husband and their children, including Ustinov's father Jona.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ustinov was educated at [[Westminster School]] and had a difficult childhood because of his parents' constant fighting. One of his schoolmates was [[Rudolf von Ribbentrop]], the eldest son of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. While at school, Ustinov considered anglicising his name to "Peter Austin" but was counselled against it by a fellow pupil who said that he should "Drop the 'von' but keep the 'Ustinov'". After training as an actor in his late teens, along with early attempts at playwriting, he made his stage début in 1938 at the [[Players' Theatre]], becoming quickly established. He later wrote, "I was not irresistibly drawn to the drama. It was an escape road from the dismal rat race of school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ustinov|first=Peter|title=Dear Me|edition=1st|year=1977|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-316-89051-9|oclc=3071948|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career highlights==
[[File:Peter Ustinov 2.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ustinov as [[Nero]] in ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951)]]

In 1939, he appeared in ''White Cargo'' at the [[Aylesbury]] Rep, where he performed in a different accent every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eYOPQgAACAAJ|title=Exit through the fireplace: the great days of the rep|last=Dunn|first=Kate|date=1998|publisher=J.

The difference in their ranks{{mdashb}}Niven was a [[lieutenant-colonel]] and Ustinov a private{{mdashb}}made their regular association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven's batman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1260975.stm|title=Obituary: Sir Peter Ustinov|last=|first=|date=Mar 29, 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=Nov 13, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in propaganda films, debuting in ''[[One of Our Aircraft Is Missing]]'' (1942), in which he was required to deliver lines in English, Latin and Dutch. In 1944, under the auspices of [[Entertainments National Service Association|ENSA]], he presented and performed the role of Sir Anthony Absolute, in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] ''[[The Rivals]]'', with [[Dame Edith Evans]], at the Larkhill Camp theater.

After the war, he began writing; his first major success was with the play ''The Love of Four Colonels'' (1951). He starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Aldo Ray]] in ''[[We're No Angels (1955 film)|We're No Angels]]'' (1955). His career as a dramatist continued, his best-known{{clarify|presumably, this means something like "most widely performed" or "most commercially successful"|date=April 2018}} play being ''[[Romanoff and Juliet (play)|Romanoff and Juliet]]'' (1956). His film roles include Roman emperor [[Nero]] in ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951), [[Lentulus Batiatus]] in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960), Captain Vere in ''[[Billy Budd (film)|Billy Budd]]'' (1962) and an old man surviving a totalitarian future in ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'' (1976). Ustinov voiced the [[anthropomorphic]] lions [[John, King of England|Prince John]] and [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] in the 1973 [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. He also worked on several films as writer and occasionally director, including ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944), ''[[School for Secrets]]'' (1946), ''[[Hot Millions]]'' (1968) and ''[[Memed, My Hawk (film)|Memed, My Hawk]]'' (1984).

[[File:פיטר יוסטינוב וסר ג׳ון גילגוד בסרט מפגש עם המוות.jpg|thumb| Ustinov (''left'') as Hercule Poirot with [[John Gielgud]] in ''[[Appointment with Death (film)|Appointment with Death]]'' (1988)]]
In half a dozen films, he played [[Agatha Christie]]'s detective [[Hercule Poirot]], first in ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978) and then in 1982's ''[[Evil Under the Sun (1982 film)|Evil Under the Sun]]'', 1985's ''[[Thirteen at Dinner (film)|Thirteen at Dinner]]'' (TV movie), 1986's ''[[Dead Man's Folly (film)|Dead Man's Folly]]'' (TV movie), 1986's ''[[Murder in Three Acts]]'' (TV movie) and 1988's ''[[Appointment with Death (film)|Appointment with Death]]''.

[[File:Peter Ustinov.jpg|thumb|Ustinov in ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960)]]
Ustinov won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his roles in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) and ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'' (1964). He also won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for the film ''Quo Vadis'' (he set the Oscar and Globe statuettes up on his desk as if playing doubles tennis; the game was a love of his life, as was ocean yachting). Ustinov was also the winner of three Emmys and one Grammy and was nominated for two Tony Awards.

Between 1952 and 1955, he starred with [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] in the [[BBC]] radio comedy ''In All Directions''. The series featured Ustinov and Jones as themselves in a London car journey perpetually searching for Copthorne Avenue. The comedy derived from the characters they met, whom they often also portrayed. The show was unusual for the time, as it was improvised rather than scripted. Ustinov and Jones improvised on a tape, which was difficult and then edited for broadcast by [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]], who also sometimes took part.

During the 1960s, with the encouragement of Sir [[Georg Solti]], Ustinov directed several operas, including [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'', [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[L'heure espagnole]]'', [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Erwartung]]'' and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. Further demonstrating his great talent and versatility in the theatre, Ustinov later undertook set and costume design for ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

His autobiography, ''[[Dear Me (book)|Dear Me]]'' (1977), was well received and had him describe his life (ostensibly his childhood) while being interrogated by his own ego, with forays into philosophy, theatre, fame and self-realisation. From 1969 until his death, his acting and writing took second place to his work on behalf of [[UNICEF]], for which he was a Goodwill Ambassador and fundraiser. In this role, he visited some of the neediest children and made use of his ability to make people laugh, including many of the world's most disadvantaged children. "Sir Peter could make anyone laugh", UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy is quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNICEF mourns death of Goodwill Ambassador Sir Peter Ustinov|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_20193.html|publisher=UNICEF|date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October 1984, Ustinov was due to interview [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]] for Irish television. She was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] on her way to the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books/about/Terror_in_the_Mind_of_God.html|title=Terror in the mind of God: the global rise of religious violence|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520930612|edition=3rd|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=779141234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Ustinov black &amp; white Allan Warren.jpg|right|thumb|Ustinov in 1986]]
Ustinov also served as President of the [[World Federalist Movement]] from 1991 until his death. He once said, "World government is not only possible, it is inevitable, and when it comes, it will appeal to patriotism in its truest, in its only sense, the patriotism of men who love their national heritages so deeply that they wish to preserve them in safety for the common good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfm.org/site/index.php/pages/673|title=President|last=|first=|website=World Federalist Movement|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029022410/http://www.wfm.org/site/index.php/pages/673|archive-date=Oct 29, 2008|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a frequent guest of [[Jack Paar]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' in the early 1960s and was a guest on the "upside down" episode of the American talk show ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'', during which the camera, mounted on a slowly revolving wheel, gradually rotated the picture 360° during the course of an hour; Ustinov appeared midway through and was photographed upside down in close-up as he spoke while his host appeared only in long shots. Towards the end of Ustinov's life, he undertook some one-man stage shows in which he let loose his raconteur streak: he told the story of his life, including some moments of tension with the society into which he was born. For example, he took a test as a child, asking him to name a Russian composer; he wrote [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] but was marked down. He was then told the correct answer, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], since he had been studying him in class and was told to stop showing off.

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in November 1977 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at [[Pinewood Studios]] on the set of ''Death on the Nile'' and a week before, he was surprised at a book signing at book printers Butler and Tanner in Frome, Somerset. This footage was not used, as Ustinov flatly refused to take part and swore at Andrews. His wife persuaded him to change his mind.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} He was surprised again in December 1994, when [[Michael Aspel]] approached him at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva.

A car enthusiast since the age of four, he owned a succession of interesting machines ranging from a [[Fiat Topolino]], several [[Lancia]]s, a [[Hispano-Suiza]], a [[preselector gearbox]] [[Delage]] and a special-bodied [[Jowett Jupiter]]. He made records like Phoney Folklore that included the song of the Russian peasant "whose tractor had betrayed him" and his "Grand Prix of Gibraltar" was a vehicle for his creative wit and ability at car-engine sound effects and voices.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

He spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian fluently, as well as some Turkish and modern Greek. He was proficient in accents and dialects in all his languages. Ustinov provided his own German and French dubbing for some of his roles, both for [[Lorenzo's Oil]]. As [[Hercule Poirot]], he provided his own voice for the French versions of [[Thirteen at Dinner (film)|Thirteen at Dinner]], [[Dead Man's Folly (film)|Dead Man's Folly]], [[Murder in Three Acts]], [[Appointment with Death (film)|Appointment with Death]] and [[Evil Under the Sun (1982 film)|Evil under the Sun]] but unlike [[Jane Birkin]], who had dubbed herself in French for this film and [[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]], Ustinov did not provide his voice for the latter (his French voice being provided by [[Roger Carel]], who had already dubbed him in [[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]] and other films). He dubbed himself in German as Poirot only in [[Evil Under the Sun (1982 film)|Evil under the Sun]] (his other Poirot roles being undertaken by three actors). On the other hand, he provided only his English and German voice for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]] and [[NBC]]'s [[Alice in Wonderland (1999 film)|Alice in Wonderland]].&lt;ref&gt;For French dubbings, see the corresponding article for each film on French Wikipedia.

In the 1960s, he became a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] resident to avoid the British tax system, which heavily taxed the earnings of the wealthy. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1990 and was appointed [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Durham University]] in 1992, having previously been elected as the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Dundee]] in 1968 (a role in which he moved from being merely a figurehead to taking on a political role, negotiating with militant students).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=University Education in Dundee 1881–1981 A Pictorial History|last=Shafe|first=Michael|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=Dundee|page=205|asin=B00178Z2BG|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ustinov was re-elected to the post for a second three-year term in 1971, narrowly beating [[Michael Parkinson]] after a disputed recount.&lt;ref name=Archives&gt;{{cite web|title=Rectorial Elections|url=http://www.archives-records-artefacts.blogspot.com/2010/02/rectorial-elections.html|work=Archives, Records and Artefacts at the University of Dundee|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=20 August 2016|date=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Kenneth|title=A Dundee Celebration|year=2007|publisher=University of Dundee|location=Dundee|page=32|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an honorary doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium).

Ustinov was a frequent defender of the Chinese government, stating in an address to Durham University in 2000, "People are annoyed with the Chinese for not respecting more human rights. But with a population that size it's very difficult to have the same attitude to human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001811/quotes|title=Peter Ustinov: Quotes|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|language=en|access-date=Nov 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Durham's postgraduate college (previously known as the Graduate Society) was renamed [[Ustinov College]]. Ustinov went to [[Berlin]] on a UNICEF mission in 2002 to visit the circle of [[United Buddy Bears]] that promote a more peaceful world between nations, cultures and religions for the first time. He was determined to ensure that [[Iraq]] would also be represented in this circle of about 140 countries. Ustinov also presented and narrated the official video review of the [[1987 Formula One season]] and narrated the documentary series ''Wings of the Red Star''. In 1988, he hosted a live television broadcast entitled ''The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper''. Ustinov gave his name to the Foundation of the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] for their [[Sir Peter Ustinov Television Scriptwriting Award]], given annually to a young television screenwriter.

==Personal life==
[[File:Peter Ustinov with family 1950s.jpg|thumb|Ustinov with Suzanne Cloutier and daughter in the 1950s]]
Ustinov was married three times—first to Isolde Denham (1920–1987), daughter of [[Reginald Denham]] and [[Moyna Macgill]]. The marriage lasted from 1940 to their divorce in 1950, and they had one child, daughter [[Tamara Ustinov]]. Isolde was the half-sister of [[Angela Lansbury]], who appeared with Ustinov in ''Death on the Nile''. His second marriage was to [[Suzanne Cloutier]], which lasted from 1954 to their divorce in 1971. They had three children, two daughters, Pavla Ustinov and Andrea Ustinov, and a son, Igor Ustinov. His third marriage was to Helene du Lau d'Allemans, which lasted from 1972 to his death in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leninimports.com/peter_ustinov.html|title=Peter Ustinov: Biography|last=|first=|website=leninimports.com|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031120047/http://www.leninimports.com:80/peter_ustinov.html|archive-date=Oct 31, 2016|dead-url=no|access-date=Nov 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ustinov was a [[secular humanist]]. He was listed as a distinguished supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]], and had once served on their advisory council.&lt;ref name="BHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/recent-humanist-obituaries/peter-ustinov/|title=Our people - Sir Peter Ustinov (1921-2004) |publisher=[[British Humanist Association]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|date=2014-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A43jAAAAMAAJ|title=Humanist|last=|first=|publisher=Rationalist Press Association Limited|year=1963|isbn=|location=London|pages=|issn=0018-7380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ustinov suffered from [[diabetes]] and a weakened heart in his last years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-03-30/news/0403300193_1_peter-ustinov-romanoff-and-juliet-play-award|title=Peter Ustinov, 82|last=|first=|date=Mar 30, 2004|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215071620/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-03-30/news/0403300193_1_peter-ustinov-romanoff-and-juliet-play-award|archive-date=Feb 15, 2017|dead-url=yes|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his death, Ustinov was a member of [[English PEN]], part of the [[PEN International]] network that campaigns for freedom of expression.

State.gov (2006-03-08). Retrieved on 2011-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; but related activities such as brothel keeping are prohibited.&lt;ref name="procon"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Countries and Their Prostitution Policies - Legal Prostitution - ProCon.org|url=https://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772#paraguay|website=prostitution.procon.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution]] is common in the country. [[Brothels]] are also common, even some rural villages have a small bar/brothel on the outskirts.&lt;ref name="kopczinski" /&gt;

==Asunción==
Whilst there is no [[red-light district]] in the capital, [[Asunción]], [[street prostitution]] is widespread in the city centre,especially around Plaza Uruguaya.&lt;ref name="points"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scam City: Asuncion Paraguay|url=http://first2board.com/pointssummary/2014/10/28/scam-city-asuncion-paraguay-edition/|website=Points Summary|accessdate=30 December 2017|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brothels are also common in the city centre.&lt;ref name="points" /&gt; Prostitutes can also be found in bars and discos.&lt;ref name="kopczinski"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopczinski|first1=H.W.|title=Domizilland Paraguay|url=http://paraguay-online.net/alltag/prostitution.html|website=Paraguay Online|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 30 "motels" in and around the city that cater for illicit sex. Rented by the hour, the suites are approached through a garage so people can't be seen entering or leaving. Any refreshments required are ordered by telephone and delivered through a flap in the door, payment is also made through the flap. The staff never see the guests.&lt;ref name="kopczinski" /&gt;

After the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864 to 1870), Asunción was occupied by troops from [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. Many women turned to prostitution. An unfinished theatre was converted into a brothel where 400 women worked and lived. When the occupying troops withdrew from the city, the Argentinian National Guard took 300 prostitutes back to [[Buenos Aires]] with them. In an attempt to 'clean up' the city, the authorities shipped many prostitutes to rural areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Harris Gaylord|last2=Warren|first2=Katherine F|title=Paraguay and the Triple Alliance : the postwar decade, 1869-1878|date=1978|publisher=Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas at Austin|location=[Austin]|isbn=978-0292764453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV==
[[HIV]] is a problem in the country  and sex workers are a high group. Since 1995 the government has been running a scheme for sex workers as part of their "Struggle Against AIDS" campaign. Social and health workers offer support, information, free testing and distribute [[condoms]].&lt;ref name="luxner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luxner|first1=Larry|title=Paraguay: AIDS program targets prostitutes|url=http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=669|website=Luxner News Inc|accessdate=30 December 2017|date=22 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reluctance to use condoms in the country,&lt;ref name="kopczinski" /&gt; partially due to the Catholic Church's opposition.&lt;ref name="luxner" /&gt; Some clients offer to pay more for sex without a condom.&lt;ref name="luxner" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] estimated the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers to be 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child prostitution==
[[Child prostitution]] is a problem. Poor children are trafficked from rural areas to urban centers such as Asunción, [[Ciudad del Este]], and
[[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]] for commercial sexual exploitation. [[Street children]] and working children are common targets for trafficking recruiters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/123363.pdf |title=PDF 123363 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the International Labour Organisation’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour found that in [[Ciudad del Este]], 250 of the 650 sex workers in the streets were underage.&lt;ref name="diaz"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Díaz|first1=Natalia Ruiz|title=NGO Offers Girls a Way Out of Sexual Exploitation|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/08/rights-paraguay-ngo-offers-girls-a-way-out-of-sexual-exploitation/|website=IPS News.|accessdate=30 December 2017|date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study by [[UNICEF|United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)]] estimated two out of three sex workers were underage girls.&lt;ref name="diaz" /&gt; Many [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and international organisations are working to alleviate the problem.&lt;ref name="diaz" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Paraguay}}
Paraguay is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Paraguayan women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, and [[transgender]] Paraguayans are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Thousands of Paraguayan children work as domestic servants in exchange for food, board, and occasionally education or a small stipend in a system called criadazgo; many of these children are subjected to domestic servitude and are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Indigenous persons are particularly at risk for sex trafficking. In 2015, authorities reported at least 24 Paraguayan women were recruited for work in [[Turkey]] and later exploited in forced prostitution in brothels throughout Turkey, [[Spain]], and the northern area of [[Cyprus]] administered by Turkish Cypriots. The reliance of international trafficking rings on local recruiters remains a problem. Traffickers offer victims their freedom or pardon of debts if they recruit other victims and often rely on social media outlets as recruiting tools. Foreign victims of sex trafficking in Paraguay are mostly from other South American countries. Paraguayan victims of sex trafficking are found in Argentina, Spain, Brazil, [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], and other countries. Paraguayan women are recruited as couriers of illicit narcotics to Europe and Africa, where they are subjected to forced prostitution.&lt;ref name="state16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraguay 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258841.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=30 December 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NGOs and authorities reported government officials, including police, border guards, judges, and public registry employees, facilitated human trafficking, including by taking bribes from brothel owners in exchange for protection, extorting suspected traffickers in order to prevent arrest, and producing fraudulent identity documents.&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt; 

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranked Paraguay as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]] country.&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt;

'''Sand festivals''' or '''festivals of sand sculpture''' are exhibitions of [[sculpture]]s made of [[sand]] carried out in various places around the world. These events usually include a competition.

Traditional [[Sand art and play|sand sculptures]] are sandcastles. However, at sand festivals one may see virtually any kinds of sculptures you would expect to see in stone, bronze or wood.

==Australia==
The ''Sand Sculpting Australia'' festival has been held annually in [[Frankston, Victoria]] since 2008, and was held for seven years prior to this on the foreshore at [[Rye, Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianexplorer.com/events/9119848/profile.htm|title=Sand Sculpting Australia - Frankston Waterfront 2008-2009|work=australianexplorer.com: Australian Travel Information|publisher=Australian Explorer Pty Ltd|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event features a different theme each year, with the 2008–2009 theme being [[dinosaurs]] in an exhibit called "Dinostory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandstormevents.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=70|title=Dinostory sand sculpting exhibition|year=2008|work=Sandstorm|publisher=Sandstorm Events Pty Ltd|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian sand artist [[Sudarshan Patnaik]] created a sculpture in memory of the victims of the tsunami disaster in [[Puri Beach|Puri]], south of the capital of the Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[Bhubaneshwar]]. The determination of this man, support, and a consorted effort from his friends in Puri, culminated in the formation of the [[Golden Sand Art Institute]] 1995. The institute is an open-air institute with no boundaries and limitations. It is located on the seashore that spans between Hotel May Fair Beach Resort and the Panthanivas in [[Puri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiadaily.in/2009/10/19/best-sand-sculptures-by-sudarsan-pattnaik/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Caldwell''' (March 6, 1924{{spaced ndash}}March 23, 2006) was an American [[opera]] [[conducting|conductor]], [[impresario]], and stage director.

== Life ==

Caldwell was born in [[Maryville, Missouri]], and grew up in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. She was a child prodigy and gave public performances on the [[violin]] by the time she was ten years old. She graduated from [[Fayetteville High School (Arkansas)|Fayetteville High School]] at the age of 14.

Caldwell graduated from [[Hendrix College]] in 1944 and attended the [[University of Arkansas]] as well as the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. She won a scholarship as a [[viola]] player at the [[Berkshire Music Center]] in 1946. In 1947, she staged [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]'s ''Riders to the Sea''. For 11 years she served as the chief assistant to [[Boris Goldovsky]].

Caldwell moved to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1952 and became head of the [[Boston University]] opera workshop. In 1957 she started the [[Boston Opera Group]], which became the [[Opera Company of Boston]], where she staged a wide range of operas, establishing a reputation for producing difficult works under pressure. She was also known for putting together interesting variations on standard operas. Highlights in Boston that she conducted and/or stage directed included ''La voyage de la lune'', ''[[Otello]]'' (with [[Tito Gobbi]] as Iago), ''Command Performance'' (world premiere), ''[[Manon]]'' and ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' (both with [[Beverly Sills]] and [[Norman Treigle]]), ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (U.S. East Coast premiere), ''[[I puritani]]'' (with Dame [[Joan Sutherland]]), ''[[Intolleranza 1960|Intolleranza]]'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' (original version), ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' (U.S. stage premiere, with [[Plácido Domingo]]), ''[[La bohème]]'' (with [[Renata Tebaldi]] and Domingo), ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', ''[[Carmen]]'' (with [[Marilyn Horne]]), ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (original version), ''The Good Soldier Schweik'', ''The Fisherman and His Wife'' (world premiere, with [[Muriel Costa-Greenspon]]), ''[[La finta giardiniera]]'', ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' (with Sills), ''[[Les Troyens]]'', ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (U.S. premiere of original French version), ''[[Don Quichotte]]'', ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]'' (U.S. stage premiere, with [[Arlene Saunders]]), ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'' (U.S. premiere, with [[Jon Vickers]]), ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'', ''Montezuma'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Ludmila]]'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (with Sills, [[Richard Fredricks]], and [[Susanne Marsee]]), ''[[Stiffelio]]'' (U.S. stage premiere), ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'' (with [[Magda Olivero]]), ''La vide breve'', ''[[El retablo de maese Pedro]]'', ''[[The Ice Break]]'' (U.S. premiere), ''Aïda'' (with [[Shirley Verrett]] in the title role), ''[[Die Soldaten]]'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[The Invisible City of Kitezh]]'', ''[[Taverner (opera)|Taverner]]'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[The Makropoulos Case]]'' (with [[Anja Silja]], [[William Cochran (tenor)|William Cochran]], and [[Chester Ludgin]]), ''Médée'' (in French and Greek), ''Dead Souls'' (U.S. premiere), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (with Dame [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]]) and, finally, ''The Balcony'' (world premiere, 1990).

At the [[New York City Opera]], Caldwell staged ''Der junge Lord'' and ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' (with [[Carol Neblett]]), both in 1973.  In 1976, she both conducted and directed ''Il barbiere di Siviglia'' (with Sills and [[Alan Titus]]), which was televised over PBS, and did the same for ''Falstaff'' (with [[Donald Gramm]]) in 1979.

In 1976, Caldwell became the first female conductor at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], with ''La traviata'' (with Sills).&lt;ref&gt;

Caldwell also directed one non-musical production, the 1981 [[Lincoln Center]] staging of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', presented on cable TV in 1982. It starred [[Philip Anglim]] and [[Maureen Anderman]], with a then-unknown [[Kelsey Grammer]] in the supporting role of Ross.

In 1975 Caldwell received a [[Doctor of Fine Arts|D.F.A.]] from [[Bates College]]. In 1996 she received the [[National Medal of Arts]]. She has been inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame.

In the 1980s, Opera New England, a branch of Ms. Caldwell's [[Opera Company of Boston]], was the touring ambassador of opera to the New England states. She employed young professional singers in productions that were fully staged and with orchestra.  She organized financing through local, state and federal funding which included the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], Massachusetts Council of the Arts &amp; Humanities, Connecticut Commission on the Arts, New Hampshire Commission of the Arts and the Maine Commission on the Arts &amp; Humanities.

She died, aged 82, at [[Maine Medical Center]] in [[Portland, Maine]], from [[heart failure]]. She is remembered on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinatown/South Cove|url=http://bwht.org/chinatown-south-cove/|website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''''' ([[Middle English]]: ''Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt'') is a late 14th-century Middle English [[chivalric romance]]. It is one of the best known [[Arthurian]] stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. Written in stanzas of [[alliterative verse]], each of which ends in a rhyming [[bob and wheel]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, James. "A Note on Middle English Meter." In ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (A New Verse Translation)'' by Simon Armitage. Norton, 2008. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; it draws on [[Welsh people|Welsh]], Irish, and English stories, as well as the French [[chivalric]] tradition. It is an important example of a [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]], which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Simon Armitage]], and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.

It describes how Sir [[Gawain]], a knight of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]], accepts a challenge from a mysterious "[[Green Knight]]" who challenges any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]]. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates [[chivalry]] and [[loyalty]] until his honour is called into question by a test involving [[Lady Bertilak]], the lady of the Green Knight's castle.

The poem survives in a single manuscript, the ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', which also includes three religious [[narrative poetry|narrative poems]]: ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Cleanness (poem)|Purity]]'' and ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]''. All are thought to have been written by the same unknown author, dubbed the "[[Pearl Poet]]" or "Gawain Poet", since all four are written in a [[North Midlands|North]] [[West Midlands (region)|West Midland]] dialect of Middle English.&lt;ref name = norton&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Gawain and the Green Knight.jpg|thumb|230px|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (from original manuscript, artist unknown)]]
In [[Camelot]] on New Year's Day, King Arthur's court is exchanging gifts and waiting for the feasting to start when the king asks first to see or hear of an exciting adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak to take him on, he insists he has come for a friendly "Christmas game": someone is to strike him once with his axe on condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day.&lt;ref&gt;First found in English c.1400, a phrase 'specified in certain legal matters in order to ensure the completion of a full year': comparable terms date from slightly earlier in Middle Dutch, Middle Low German and Anglo-Norman. From :"year, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2017. Web. 15 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The splendid axe will belong to whoever takes him on. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, begs for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen [[Guinevere]] while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the [[Green Chapel]]. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.

As the date approaches, Sir Gawain sets off to find the Green Chapel and keep his side of the bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his beautiful wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the start of the path that will take him to the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.

Before going hunting the next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain whatever he catches on the condition that Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, [[Lady Bertilak]] visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted [[boar]] for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die the next day, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.

The next day, Gawain binds the belt twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch with the second swing; but again the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay]], Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters of British Literature Volume A|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=9780321333995|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The [[Knights of the Round Table]] absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green [[sash]] in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.

=="Pearl Poet"==
{{Main|Pearl Poet}}
Though the real name of "The ''Gawain'' Poet" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him can be drawn from an informed reading of his works. The manuscript of ''Gawain'' is known in academic circles as ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', following a naming system used by one of its owners, [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], a collector of Medieval English texts.&lt;ref name="ucalgary"/&gt; Before the ''Gawain'' manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile in [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Pearl: Introduction| publisher = Medieval Institute Publications, Inc.| year = 2001| url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/pearlint.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of [[Thomas Warton]]'s ''History'' edited by [[Richard Price (British historian)|Richard Price]], it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the ''Gawain'' poem was not published in its entirety until 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Turville-Petre, Thorlac. The Alliterative Revival. Woodbridge: Brewer [[etc.]], 1977. pp.&amp;nbsp;126–129. {{ISBN|0-85991-019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, J. ''Ricardian Poetry.'' London: Routledge and K. Paul, 1971. {{ISBN|0-7100-7031-4}} pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Now held in the [[British Library]], it has been dated to the late 14th century, meaning the poet was a contemporary of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], author of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', though it is unlikely that they ever met.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Medieval Period'', Vol. 1., ed. Joseph Black, ''et al.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;235. {{ISBN|1-55111-609-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three other works found in the same manuscript as ''Gawain'' (commonly known as ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', and ''[[Cleanness (poem)|Purity]]'' or ''Cleanliness'') are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.&lt;ref name = poet&gt;Nelles, William. "The Pearl-Poet". ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'', Fourth Revised Edition Database: MagillOnLiterature Plus, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is known today about the poet is largely general. As [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon]], after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:
{{quote|He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.&lt;ref name = Tolkien/&gt;}}

The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Peterson| first1 = Clifford J| year = 1974| title = The Pearl-Poet and John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire| url =| journal = The Review of English Studies |series=New Series| volume = 25| issue = 99| pages = 257–266| doi=10.1093/res/xxv.99.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to ''Gawain''. ''St. Erkenwald'', however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.&lt;ref name = poet/&gt;

==Verse form==
The 2,530 lines and 101 [[stanzas]] that make up ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' are written in what linguists call the "[[Alliterative Revival]]" style typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] syllabic count and [[rhyme]], the [[Alliterative verse|alliterative form]] of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a ''[[caesura]]'', at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he largely follows the form of his day, the Gawain poet was somewhat freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the ''[[bob and wheel]]'', in which the "bob" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the "wheel," longer lines with [[internal rhyme]].&lt;ref name = norton /&gt;

[[Image:Cuslayshound.jpg|thumb|left|The legendary Irish figure [[Cúchulainn]] faced a trial similar to Gawain's (''Cúchulain Slays the Hound of Culain'' by [[Stephen Reid (artist)|Stephen Reid]], 1904).]]
The earliest known story to feature a beheading game is the 8th-century [[Middle Irish]] tale ''[[Bricriu's Feast]]''. This story parallels ''Gawain'' in that, like the Green Knight, [[Cú Chulainn]]'s antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th-century ''[[Caradoc|Life of Caradoc]]'', a [[Middle French]] narrative embedded in the anonymous [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. [[Lancelot]] is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.&lt;ref name = Brewer/&gt;

The stories ''The Girl with the Mule'' (alternately titled ''The Mule Without a Bridle'') and ''Hunbaut'' feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In ''Hunbaut,'' Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include ''Yder'', the [[Lancelot-Grail]], ''Hunbaut'', and ''The Knight of the Sword''. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain [[chaste]] in trying circumstances.&lt;ref name = Brewer&gt;Brewer, Elisabeth. ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: Sources and Analogues''. Woodbridge: D.S. Brewer, 1992. {{ISBN|0-85991-359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first branch of the medieval Welsh collection of tales known as the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', [[Pwyll]] exchanges places for a year with [[Arawn]], the lord of [[Annwn]] (the Otherworld). Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn's wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. This story may, then, provide a background to Gawain's attempts to resist the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game and seduction test stories. Additionally, in both stories a year passes before the completion of the conclusion of the challenge or exchange. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a "seduction test" per se, as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly ''against'' the wishes of the Lord.&lt;ref name =friedman&gt;Friedman, Albert B. "Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight." ''Speculum.'' Vol. 35, No. 2 (Apr 1960) pp. 260–274&lt;/ref&gt;

After the writing of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', several similar stories followed. ''[[The Greene Knight]]'' (15th–17th century) is a rhymed retelling of nearly the same tale.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Greene Knight". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications, 2000. {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}. Full text: [http://lib.rochester.edu/Camelot/teams/greenfrm.htm ''The Greene Knight'']&lt;/ref&gt; In it, the plot is simplified, motives are more fully explained, and some names are changed. Another story, ''The Turke and Gowin'' (15th century), begins with a [[Turkish people|Turk]] entering Arthur's court and asking, "Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?"&lt;ref name = turke&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Turke and Sir Gawain". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications, 2000. {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}. Online: [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/turkfrm.htm ''The Turke and Sir Gawain''].&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this poem the Turk, rather than buffeting Gawain back, asks the knight to cut off his head, which Gawain does. The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. ''[[The Carle of Carlisle]]'' (17th century) also resembles ''Gawain'' in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords are hanging and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Carle of Carlisle", in ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications, 2000. {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}. Online: [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/carintro.htm ''The Carle of Carlisle''].&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain obliges and strikes, but the Carle rises, laughing and unharmed. Unlike the ''Gawain'' poem, no return blow is demanded or given.&lt;ref name = Brewer/&gt;&lt;ref name =friedman/&gt;

==Themes==

=== Temptation and testing ===
[[Image:Leighton-God Speed!.jpg|thumb|Knights of ''Gawain's'' time were tested in their ability to balance the male-oriented [[chivalry|chivalric code]] with the female-oriented rules of [[courtly love]]. (''God Speed!'' – [[Edmund Blair Leighton#List of works|Edmund Blair Leighton]] 1900)]]
At the heart of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' is the test of Gawain's adherence to the code of [[chivalry]]. The typical [[temptation]] [[fable]] of [[medieval literature]] presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or "proofs" of moral [[virtue]]. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested.&lt;ref name="kittsix"&gt;Kittredge, George Lyman. ''A Study of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Harvard University Press, 1960. p.&amp;nbsp;76. ASIN B0006AWBXS&lt;/ref&gt; Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or "instinctive-courtesy" that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test.&lt;ref name="kitteight"&gt;Kittredge, p.&amp;nbsp;83&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain does not realize, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by Sir Bertilak.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, Sir Orfeo''. Translated by J.R.R. Tolkien, New York: Ballantine Books, 1975. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning [[courtly love]]. The [[knight]]'s code of honour requires him to do whatever a [[wikt:damsel|damsel]] asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host (Bertilak), he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, J.A. ''A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1965. p.&amp;nbsp;162. {{ISBN|0-7100-8695-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting and seduction===
Scholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in ''Gawain''. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of [[courtly love]] relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.&lt;ref name = Burnley&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Burnley| first1 = J.D.| year = 1973| title = The Hunting Scenes in 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' ".| url =| journal = The Yearbook of English Studies| volume = 3| issue =| pages = 1–9| doi=10.2307/3506850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned.&lt;ref name = Burnley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The "hyndez" (hinds) first described in the poem are probably from [[red deer]], a species with large antlers like the [[elk|American elk]], while the subsequent "dos and of oþer dere" (does and other deer) likely refer to the smaller [[fallow deer]]. (Ong, Walter J. "The Green Knight's Harts and Bucks". ''Modern Language Notes''. (December 1950) 65.8 pp.&amp;nbsp;536–539.)&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.&lt;ref name = Burnley/&gt;

The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars were (and are) much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.&lt;ref name = Burnley/&gt;
Masculinity has also been associated with hunting. The theme of masculinity is present throughout. In an article by Vern L. Bullough, "Being a Male in the Middle Ages," he discusses Sir Gawain and how normally, masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active. He notes that Sir Gawain is not part of this normalcy.

===Nature and chivalry===
Some argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur’s peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Cawley, A. C. 'Pearl, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight':"...the Green Knight, ''alias'' Sir Bertilak, is an immensely vital person who is closely associated with the life of nature: his greenness, the birds and flies of his decorative embroidery, his beard as great as a bush, the holly branch in his hand, the energy he displays as a huntsman-all give him kinship with the physical world outside the castle."&lt;/ref&gt; Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak’s wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the [[sin]]-stained girdle, [[nature]] is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense).&lt;ref name = woodsw&gt;Woods, William F. "Nature and the Inner Man in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''The Chaucer Review'', Vol. 36, No. 3, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–227.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.&lt;ref name = rhg&gt;Green, Richard Hamilton. "Gawain's Shield and the Quest for Perfection". ''ELH''. (June 1962) 29.2 pp.&amp;nbsp;121–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.&lt;ref&gt;This interpretation was first advanced by John Speirs in ''Scrutiny'', vol.XVI, iv, 1949 (incorporated in his ''Medieval English Poetry: The Non-Chaucerian Tradition'', rev.ed. 1962. Similar interpretations were later offered by Francis Berry in ''The Pelican Guide to English Literature: The Age of Chaucer'', 1954; Goldhurst, "The Green and the Gold: The Major Theme of ''Sit Gawain and the Green Knight'', ''College English'', Nov. 1958; A.C, Spearing, ''The Gawain-Poet: A Critical Study'', 1970; W. A. Davenport, ''The Art of the Gawain-Poet'', 1978; J. Tambling, "A More Powerful Life: ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''", ''Haltwhistle Quarterly'' 9, 1981; and K. Sagar, "Sir Gawain and the Green Girdle", in his ''Literature and the Crime Against Nature'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chivalry that is represented within 'Gawain' is one which was constructed by court nobility. The violence that is part of this chivalry is steeply contrasted by the fact that King Arthur's court is Christian and the initial beheading event takes place while celebrating Christmas. The violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and Christian ideals, and yet it is seen as part of knighthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Martin| first1 = Carl Grey| year = 2009| title = The Cipher of Chivalry: Violence as Courtly Play in the World of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = The Chaucer Review| volume = 43| issue = 3| pages = 311–29| jstor=25642113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during Gawain's interactions with Bertilak's wife. He cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour, and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess. Gawain plays a very fine line and the only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals the green girdle from Bertilak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Jucker| first1 = Andreas H.| year = 2015| title = Courtesy and Politness in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = Studia Anglica Posnaniensia| volume = 43| issue = 3| pages = 5–28| doi=10.1515/stap-2015-0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
The word ''gomen'' (game) is found 18 times in ''Gawain''. Its similarity to the word ''gome'' (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a "Christmas game".&lt;ref name = game /&gt; The "game" of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a "beheading game").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Harwood| first1 = Britton J| year = 1991| title = Gawain and the Gift| url =| journal = PMLA| volume = 106| issue = 3| pages = 483–99| doi=10.2307/462781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to ''Gawain''.&lt;ref name = norton /&gt;&lt;ref name = Tolkien&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Edited J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, revised Norman Davis, 1925. introduction, xv. ASIN B000IPU84U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Times and seasons===
Times, dates, seasons, and cycles within ''Gawain'' are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year's Eve with a beheading and culminates on the next New Year's Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on [[All Saints Day]] and arrives at Bertilak's castle on Christmas Eve. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in "a year and a day"—a period of time seen often in medieval literature.&lt;ref name = year&gt;For reasons not entirely understood, the Celts used the phrase "a year and a day", to refer to exactly one year. See for example W. J. McGee's "The Beginning of Mathematics." ''American Anthropologist.'' (Oct 1899) Vol. 1 Iss. 4 pp.&amp;nbsp;646–674.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of [[Trojan War|Troy]], a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the ''[[Aeneid]]'', fell to the Greeks due to pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two virtually identical descriptions of Troy's destruction. The poem's first line reads: "Since the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy" and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is "After the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy".&lt;ref name = christian&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Clark| first1 = S. L.| last2 = Wasserman| first2 = Julian N.| year = 1986| title = The Passing of the Seasons and the Apocalyptic in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''| url =| journal = South Central Review| volume = 3| issue = 1| pages = 5–22| doi=10.2307/3189122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion and Narrative Empathy===
The entire 'Gawain' poem follows one individual experiencing highly emotional situations. He participates in the beheading contest, watches as a man he has beheaded walks away unscathed, prepares for a journey where he will then also receive a blow that will behead him, is tempted by the sexual advances of Sir Bertilak's wife, decides what to do with the moral conundrum that is the girdle, suffering humiliation, and returning to court to retell his entire adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Harbus| first1 = Antonina| year = 2016| title = Emotion and Narrative Empathy in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''| url =| journal = English Studies| volume = 97| issue = 6| pages = 594–607| doi=10.1080/0013838X.2016.1183929}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events invite the reader to empathize with Gawain, the flawed hero, and understand that he is also human.

Humans experience an emotional contagion, which was defined by psychologists Elaine Hatfield, John Cacioppo, and Richard Rapson as 'the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person, and, consequently, to converge emotionally.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hatfield| first1 = Elaine| last2 = Cacioppo| first2 = John T.| last3 = Rapson| first3 = Richard L.| year = 1993| title = Primitive Emotional Contagion| url =| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 2| issue = 3| pages = 96–99| jstor=20182211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Coplan explains that emotional contagion is something that happens so quickly and automatically that we are typically unaware of it happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Coplan| first1 = Amy| year = 2006| title = Catching Characters' Emotions: Emotional Contagion Responses to Narrative Fiction Film| url =| journal = Film Studies| volume = 8| pages = 26–38| issn=1469-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet capitalized on this emotional reaction and thus has the reader empathizing with Sir Gawain almost without realizing it.

==Symbolism==

=== Significance of the colour green ===
[[Image:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|In the 15th-century ''[[Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'' by [[Michael Pacher]], the [[Devil]] is green. Poetic contemporaries such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] also drew connections between the colour green and the devil, leading scholars to draw similar connections in readings of the Green Knight.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, D.W. Jr. "Why the Devil Wears Green". ''Modern Language Notes''. (November 1954) 69.7 pp.&amp;nbsp;470–472.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Given the varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In [[English folklore]] and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Vernon A. "Symbolic Green: A Time-Honored Characterizing Device in Spanish Literature". ''Hispania''. (March 1968) 51.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;29–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldhurst, William. "The Green and the Gold: The Major Theme of Gawain and the Green Knight". ''College English''. (November 1958) 20.2 pp.&amp;nbsp;61–65. {{doi|10.2307/372161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its connection with [[faeries]] and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified [[witchcraft]], devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;Williams, Margaret. The Pearl Poet, His Complete Works. Random House, 1967. ASIN B0006BQEJY&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John S. "Gawain and the Green Knight". ''College English''. (October 1959) 21.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Celtic mythology]], green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt; The green girdle, originally worn for protection, became a symbol of shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of [[Camelot]], signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.&lt;ref name = knight&gt;Besserman, Lawrence. "The Idea of the Green Knight". ''ELH''. (Summer 1986) 53.2 The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Green Knight===
{{Main|Green Knight}}
Scholars have puzzled over the Green Knight's symbolism since the discovery of the poem. British medievalist [[C. S. Lewis]] said the character was "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature" and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he was the "most difficult character" to interpret in ''Sir Gawain''. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt; He appears in only two other poems: ''The Greene Knight'' and ''King Arthur and King Cornwall''.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Greene Knight". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications, 2000 p.&amp;nbsp;314. {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "King Arthur and King Cornwall". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications, 2000. p.&amp;nbsp;427. {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have attempted to connect him to other mythical characters, such as [[Jack in the green]] of English tradition and to [[Al-Khidr]],&lt;ref name="lasater"&gt;Lasater, Alice E. ''Spain to England: A Comparative Study of Arabic, European, and English Literature of the Middle Ages''. University Press of Mississippi, 1974. {{ISBN|0-87805-056-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no definitive connection has yet been established.&lt;ref name="lasater" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rix, Michael M. "A Re-Examination of the Castleton Garlanding". ''Folklore''. (June 1953) 64.2 pp.&amp;nbsp;342–344&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a possibility, as Alice Buchanan has argued, that the colour green is erroneously attributed to the Green Knight due to the poet's mistranslation or misunderstanding of the Irish word ''glas'', which could either mean grey or green. In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from Bricriu's Feast), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called "the man of the grey mantle". Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are ''lachtna'' or ''odar'', roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word ''glas'' is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Buchanan|title=The Irish Framework of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|journal=PLMA|volume=47|issue= 2|date=June 1932|pages=315–338|doi=10.2307/457878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project edit.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Another famous Arthurian woman, [[The Lady of Shalott]], with a medieval [[girdle]] around her waist ([[John William Waterhouse]], 1888)]]

===Girdle===
{{See also|Girdle#Girdle in literature|l1=Girdle in literature}}
The girdle's symbolic meaning, in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a "trophy".&lt;ref&gt;. Friedman, Albert B. Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Medieval Academy of America. Speculum, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not entirely clear who the "winner" is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Sidney E. "Gawain's Departure from the Peregrinatio". Morgantown: West Virginia University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In ''Sir Gawain'', the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one.  While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of ''Sir Gawain'', Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, J.A.

===Pentangle===
{{See also|Pentagram}}
[[Image:Gold pentagram on red.png|thumb|180px|The pentangle on Gawain's shield is described as gold on a red background]]
The poem contains the first recorded use of the word ''pentangle'' in English &lt;ref&gt;(''Oxford English Dictionary Online'').&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the only representation of such a symbol on Gawain's shield in the Gawain literature. What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines in order to describe the meaning of the pentangle; no other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, Ross G. ''Medieval Sign Theory and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987. pp.&amp;nbsp;22, 26. {{ISBN|0-8020-5717-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an "endless knot". From lines 640 to 654, the five points of the pentangle relate directly to Gawain in five ways: five senses, his five fingers, his faith found in the [[five wounds of Christ]], the five joys of [[Holy Mary|Mary]] (whose face was on the inside of the shield) and finally friendship, fraternity, purity, politeness and pity (traits that Gawain possessed around others). In line 625, it is described as "a sign by Solomon". [[Solomon]], the third king of [[Israel]], in the 10th century BC, was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over [[demons]].&lt;ref&gt;LaBossière, Camille R., and [[Jerry Gladson|Gladson, Jerry A.]] "Solomon", in ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;722.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol was called a ''Drudenfuß'' and was placed on household objects to keep out evil.&lt;ref name = Hulbert&gt;Hulbert, J. R. "Syr Gawayn and the Grene Knyzt (Concluded)". ''Modern Philology''. (April 1916) 13.12 pp.&amp;nbsp;689–730.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.&lt;ref name = Hulbert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, I. "Sir Gawain's Coat of Arms." ''The Modern Language Review''. (January 1920) 15.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawain’s pentangle also symbolises the "phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain’s poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a "circular number", since it "reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers".&lt;ref name="rossfour"&gt;Arthur, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this "process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles".&lt;ref name="rossfour"/&gt; Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain's pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Lady's Ring===
Gawain's refusal of the Lady Bertilak's ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in ''Pearl''.&lt;ref name="cooke"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooke|first=Jessica|year=1998|title=The Lady's 'Blushing' Ring in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''|journal=[[The Review of English Studies]]|volume=49|issue=193|pages=1–8|doi=10.1093/res/49.193.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a [[ruby]] or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a "brygt sunne" (line 1819),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Andrew|first=Malcolm|author2=Ronald Waldron|title=The Poems of the Pearl Manuscript|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|year=1996|page=273|isbn=0-85989-514-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "fiery sun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Borroff|first=Marie|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Patience, Pearl: Verse Translations|publisher=Norton|location=New York|year=2001|page=58|isbn=978-0-393-97658-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion of the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for,&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, "The Lady's 'Blushing,'" 3.&lt;/ref&gt; but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, "The Lady's 'Blushing,'" 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the importance of magic rings in [[Arthurian romance]], this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, "The Lady's 'Blushing,'" 2,5,7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers===
The poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak's wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Donald R. "Structure and Symmetry in Sir Gawain". ''Speculum''. (July 1964) 39.3 pp.&amp;nbsp;425–433.&lt;/ref&gt; The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain's virtues, for he is "faithful five ways and five times each".&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the [[Rosary#Sorrowful Mysteries|five wounds of Christ]], as well as the [[Rosary#Joyful Mysteries|five joys]] of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of [[chivalry]]: "[[friendship]], [[generosity]], [[chastity]], [[courtesy]], and [[piety]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kittredge, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in the "Endless Knot" of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken.&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain's quest.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M. "Christian Significance and Roman Tradition in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight." Critical Studies of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Eds. Donald R. Howard &amp; Christian Zacher. 2nd ed. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1970. 85–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in [[knighthood]] through number symbolism.&lt;ref name =stanza/&gt;
&lt;!-- Scholars believe that the poet uses this symbol of fives not only to give insight into the virtues of Gawain, but also to set the stage for the remainder of the poem. Through the five points of the pentangle the reader is presented with the five dilemmas of Sir Gawain. The Green Knight's challenge is the first: known for his valour and courtesy, Gawain would damage his reputation by refusing it. In accepting the challenge of the Green Knight, Gawain enters into his second dilemma. He must escape with both his life and honour intact.&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt, George J. "The Predicament of Gawain." ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain enters into a bargain with Bertilak which leads to his third dilemma: "Whatever I win in the woods I will give you at eve, and all you have earned you must offer to me."&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', lines&amp;nbsp;1105–08.&lt;/ref&gt; With a "gift of body",&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt, George J. "The Predicament of Gawain." ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain is tempted by Bertilak's wife. He cannot exchange this gift with Bertilak, nor can he, a knight of renowned courtesy, refuse it. Gawain must refuse the lady’s attempts at [[seduction]], yet he must do so courteously; this dilemma is his fourth. Gawain encounters his fifth dilemma when he accepts the gift of the girdle. He agrees to hide it from Bertilak, yet his bargain with the lord requires him to exchange it. --&gt;

The number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. ''Sir Gawain'' is 101&amp;nbsp;stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22&amp;nbsp;stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22&amp;nbsp;stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the [[Ten Commandments]]). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.&lt;ref name =stanza&gt;Robertson, Michael. "Stanzaic Symmetry in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''Speculum''. (October 1982) 57.4 pp.&amp;nbsp;779–785.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wounds===
At the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to [[Will (philosophy)|will]], connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous—evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful "stiffneckedness" will be healed among fallen mortals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/462158|last=Reichardt|first=Paul F.|year=1984|title=Gawain and the Image of the Wound|journal=PMLA|volume=99|issue=2|pages=154–61|jstor=462158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

=== ''Gawain'' as medieval romance ===
{{Further|Order of the Garter|Romance (heroic literature)}}
[[Image:Pettie, The Vigil.jpg|thumb|right|Gawain represented the perfect knight, as a fighter, a lover, and a religious devotee. (''[[The Vigil]]'' by [[John Pettie]], 1884)]]
Many critics argue that ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' should be viewed, above all, as a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, [[hero]]ic [[knight]], often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry's strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a [[quest]] and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a [[princesse lointaine|lady]]. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term "romance" implies today), but on [[adventure novel|adventure]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Northrop. ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;186. {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawain's function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, "is the function of the romance hero&amp;nbsp;… to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action."&lt;ref name = markman/&gt; Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view in the midst of the poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain "shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way."&lt;ref name = markman&gt;Markman, Alan M. "The Meaning of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''PMLA''. (September 1957) 72.4 pp.&amp;nbsp;574–586&lt;/ref&gt;

In viewing the poem as a medieval romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and [[courtly love]] laws under the English [[Order of the Garter]]. The group's motto, 'honi soit qui mal y pense', or "Shamed be he who finds evil here," is written at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain's peers wearing girdles of their own as evidence of the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem ''[[The Greene Knight]]'', the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter.&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', second edition. Ed. J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, 1925, note to lines 2514ff. ASIN B000IPU84U&lt;/ref&gt; The motto on the poem was probably written by a copyist and not by the original author. Still, the connection made by the copyist to the Order is not extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, Vol. BEd Stephen Greenblatt. New York, London: W. W. Norton and Co., 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;213 (footnote). {{ISBN|0-393-92833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian interpretations===
[[Image:Adam-und-Eva-1513.jpg|thumb|Scholars have pointed out parallels between the girdle Bertilak's wife offers Gawain, and the fruit [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]] in the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]]. (''Adam and Eve'' [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], ca. 1513)]]

The poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare ''Sir Gawain'' to the other three poems of the ''Gawain'' manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret ''Gawain'' similarly. Comparing it to the poem ''[[Cleanness]]'' (also known as ''Purity''), for example, they see it as a story of the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] fall of a civilisation, in ''Gawain's'' case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like [[Noah]], separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In ''Cleanness'' the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.&lt;ref name = christian/&gt;

One of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. ''Gawain'' was written around the time of the [[Black Death]] and [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]], events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture.&lt;ref name = christian/&gt; However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.&lt;ref name = game&gt;Goodlad, Lauren M. (1987) [http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol18/iss1/art4 "The Gamnes of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"], ''Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'', Vol. 18, Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the character of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of Christ in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that "the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions." This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt;

Furthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ's crown of thorns at the conclusion of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to "the thorn-crowned God".&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 2529.&lt;/ref&gt; Besserman theorises that "with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain's "yntrawpe/renoun") to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ's humiliation turned triumph)."&lt;ref name = knight/&gt;

Throughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the [[Virgin Mary]] does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;Cox, Catherine.

Retrieved on 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.&lt;ref&gt;Beauregard, David. “Moral Theology in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: The Pentangle, the Green Knight, and the Perfection of Virtue,” Renascence XLV.3 (2013), 146-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogy is also made between Gawain's trial and the [[Biblical]] test that [[Adam]] encounters in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam succumbs to [[Eve]] just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle.&lt;ref name = "cox"/&gt; Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing him to become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, Tison.

===Feminist interpretations===
[[Image:Lady tempt Gawain.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lady Bertilak at Gawain's bed (from original manuscript, artist unknown)]]
[[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist literary critics]] see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, are the most powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar can be seen as symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's [[misogynist]] passage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Mills| first1 = David| year = 1970| title = The Rhetorical Function of Gawain's Antifeminism?| url =| journal = Neuphilologische Mitteilungen| volume = 71| issue =| pages = 635–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.&lt;ref name = fem&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Heng| first1 = Geraldine| year = 1991| title = Feminine Knots and the Other Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = PMLA| volume = 106| issue = 3| pages = 500–514| doi=10.2307/462782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, others argue that the poem focuses mostly on the opinions, actions, and abilities of men. For example, on the surface, it appears that Bertilak's wife is a strong leading character.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, E. Jane. "Courtly Love: Who Needs It? Recent Feminist Work in the Medieval Tradition". ''Signs''. (Autumn 2001) 27.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;23–57. Retrieved on 7 September 2007 from
 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3175865 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; By adopting the masculine role, she appears to be an empowered individual, particularly in the bedroom scene. This is not entirely the case, however. While the Lady is being forward and outgoing, Gawain's feelings and emotions are the focus of the story, and Gawain stands to gain or lose the most.&lt;ref name="Burns, p.&amp;nbsp;24"&gt;Burns, p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; The Lady "makes the first move", so to speak, but Gawain ultimately decides what is to become of those actions. He, therefore, is in charge of the situation and even the relationship.&lt;ref name="Burns, p.&amp;nbsp;24"/&gt;

In the bedroom scene, both the negative and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rowley| first1 = Sharon M| year = 2003| title = Textual Studies, Feminism, and Performance in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = The Chaucer Review| volume = 38| issue =| pages = 158–177| doi=10.1353/cr.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her feelings cause her to step out of the typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered.&lt;ref&gt;Rowley, p.&amp;nbsp;161&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;378&lt;/ref&gt; By forcing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e. the apple, the pact made with Bertilak—and therefore the Green Knight—is broken.&lt;ref name="cox2"&gt;Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;379&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is clear that at the hands of the Lady, Gawain is a "good man seduced".&lt;ref name="cox2"/&gt;

===Postcolonial interpretations===
From 1350 to 1400—the period in which the poem is thought to have been written—[[Wales]] experienced several raids at the hands of the English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a [[English Midlands|North West Midlands]] dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of [[postcolonialism]], and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.&lt;ref name = arner&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Arner| first1 = Lynn| year = Summer 2006| title = The Ends of Enchantment: Colonialism and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = Texas Studies in Literature and Language| volume = 48| issue = 2| pages = 79–101| doi=10.1353/tsl.2006.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh–English border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an "us versus them" scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.&lt;ref name="arner" /&gt;

In contrast to this perception of the colonial lands, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak’s territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are "intelligently immoral", choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a "distinction&amp;nbsp;… of moral insight versus moral faith". Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and—in the case of Bertilak's appearance at Arthur’s court—literal sense. Lander’s argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.&lt;ref name = lander&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Lander| first1 = Bonnie| year = 2007| title = The Convention of Innocence and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight's Literary Sophisticates| url =| journal = Parergon| volume = 24| issue = 1| pages = 41–66| doi=10.1353/pgn.2007.0046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gawain's journey===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hollywell.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Winifred|St. Winifred's]] well in [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell, Wales|]], Wales, possibly one of Gawain's stopping points on the way to the Green Chapel]] --&gt;
Several scholars have attempted to find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The [[Anglesey]] islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =Anglesey and North Wales| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the "Holy Head", believed by many scholars to be either [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] or the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey of Poulton in [[Pulford]]. Holywell is associated with the beheading of [[Winefride|Saint Winifred]]. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =The Holy Head and the Wirral| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawain's trek leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =Hautdesert| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Chapel is thought to be in either [[Lud's Church]] or [[Wetton Mill]], as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =The Green Chapel| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Elliott]] located the chapel ("two myle henne" v1078) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley ("bothm of the brem valay" v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" v2147) in an enormous fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" v2182-83).&lt;ref&gt;RWV Elliott.

===Homoerotic interpretations===
According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight represents a threat to [[homosocial]] friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.&lt;ref&gt;Zeikowitz, Richard E. "Befriending the Medieval Queer: A Pedagogy for Literature Classes." ''College English: Special Issue: Lesbian and Gay Studies/Queer Pedagogies.'' Vol. 65 No. 1  (Sep 2002) pp. 67–80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carolyn Dinshaw]] argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem ''Cleanness'', he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into ''Gawain'' in his descriptions of the Green Knight.&lt;ref name="dinshaw1994"&gt;Dinshaw, Carolyn. "A Kiss Is Just a Kiss: Heterosexuality and Its Consolations in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight." ''Diacritics''. Vol. 24 No. 2/3 (Summer 1994) pp. 204–226&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. He is the passive one in the advances of Lady Bertilak, as well as in his encounters with Lord Bertilak, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet in order to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain's world. The poem does this by making the kisses between Lady Bertilak and Gawain sexual in nature, but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Lord Bertilak "unintelligible" to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.&lt;ref name=dinshaw1994/&gt;

==Modern adaptations==

=== Books ===
Though the surviving manuscript dates from the fourteenth century, the first published version of the poem did not appear until as late as 1839, when [[Sir Frederic Madden]] of the British Museum recognized the poem as worth reading.&lt;ref name=manus&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, ed. Marie Borroff and Laura Howes, New York: Norton, 2010, pg. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Madden's scholarly, Middle English edition of the poem was followed in 1898 by the first Modern English translation – a prose version by literary scholar [[Jessie L. Weston]].&lt;ref name=manus/&gt; In 1925, [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon|E.V. Gordon]] published a scholarly edition of the Middle English text of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''; a revised edition of this text was prepared by [[Norman Davis (academic)|Norman Davis]] and published in 1967. The book, featuring a text in Middle English with extensive scholarly notes, is frequently confused with the translation into Modern English that Tolkien prepared, along with translations of ''Pearl'' and ''Sir Orfeo'', late in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tolkien|first=J.R.R.|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo|editor=Christopher Tolkien|publisher=Random House|year=1980|isbn=978-0-345-27760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many editions of the latter work, first published in 1975, shortly after his death, list Tolkien on the cover as author rather than translator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=White|first=Michael|title=Tolkien: A Biography|publisher=New American Library|year=2003|isbn=0-451-21242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For students, especially undergraduate students, the text is usually given in translation. Notable translators include [[Jessie Weston]], whose 1898 prose translation and 1907 poetic translation took many liberties with the original; [[Theodore Banks]], whose 1929 translation was praised for its adaptation of the language to modern usage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farley|first=Frank E.|year=1930|title=Rev. of Banks, ''Sir Gawain'', and Andrew, ''Sir Gawain''|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=222–24|doi=10.2307/2847870|jstor=2847870|url=https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/39640/1/tsa%20uaac%201980.2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie Borroff]], whose imitative translation was first published in 1967 and "entered the academic canon" in 1968, in the second edition of the ''[[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]''. In 2010, her (slightly revised) translation was published as a Norton Critical Edition, with a foreword by [[Laura Howes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baragona|first=Alan|year=2012|title=Rev. of Howes, Borroff, ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''|journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=111|issue=4|pages=535–38|doi=10.5406/jenglgermphil.111.4.0535}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Simon Armitage]], who grew up near the Gawain poet's purported residence, published a translation which attracted attention in the US and the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/books/review/Hirsch-t.html|title=A Stranger in Camelot|last=Hirsch|first=Edward|date=16 December 2007|publisher=The New York Times|pages=7.1|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in the United States by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armitage|first=Simon|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A New Verse Translation|publisher=Norton|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=978-0-393-06048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced Borroff's translation with Armitage's for the ninth edition of the ''Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Other modern translations include those by [[Larry Benson]], Brian Stone, James Winny, [[Helen Cooper (literary scholar)|Helen Cooper]], [[W. S. Merwin]], Jacob Rosenberg, William Vantuono, Joseph Glaser, [[Bernard O'Donoghue]], [[John Gardner (American writer)|John Gardner]], and Francis Ingledew. In 2015, [[#Other Projects|Zach Weinersmith]] published '''''Augie and the Green Knight''''', a children's adaptation in which the protagonist is a young girl. A new and illustrated translation of the work by illustrator and historian Michael Smith is currently being crowdsourced by publisher [https://unbound.com/books/sir-gawain Unbound] with a planned publication date of 2018.

===Film and television===
The poem has been adapted to film twice, on both occasions by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as ''[[Gawain and the Green Knight (1973 film)|Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' in 1973 and again in 1984 as ''[[Sword of the Valiant: The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', featuring [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Gawain and [[Sean Connery]] as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Maldwyn|year=1991|title=Review|url=|journal=The Yearbook of English Studies|volume=21|issue=|pages=336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; French/Australian director Martin Beilby directed a short (30') film adaptation in 2014. There have been at least two television adaptations, ''Gawain and the Green Knight'' in 1991 and the animated ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what are believed to be the actual locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kvbny|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|work=[[BBC Four]]|date=17 August 2010|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 2018, it was announced that a new film adaptation titled ''Green Knight'' is in the works, to be directed by American filmmaker [[David Lowery (director)|David Lowery]] for [[A24 (company)|A24]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=N'Duka|first1=Amanda|title=‘The Old Man &amp; The Gun’ Director David Lowery, A24 Team On Fantasy Epic ‘Green Knight’|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/the-old-man-the-gun-director-david-lowery-a24-green-knight-1202496454/|accessdate=7 November 2018|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Penske Business Media, LLC]]|date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was also adapted for the ''[[Adventure Time]]'' episode "Seventeen" where the Green Knight arrives on Finn's 17th birthday, issuing him the challenge, as well as a series of follow-up games.

===Theatre===
The Tyneside Theatre company presented a stage version of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' at the [[Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne|University Theatre]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] at Christmas 1971. It was directed by [[Michael Bogdanov]] and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|last= Stone|first= Brian|year= 1974|publisher= Penguin|isbn=978-0-140-44092-8|page= 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music and lyrics were composed by Iwan Williams using medieval carols, such as the ''[[Boar's Head Carol]]'', as inspiration and folk instruments such as the [[Northumbrian pipes]], whistles and [[bhodran]] to create a "rough" feel. Stone had referred Bogdanov to ''Cuchulain and the Beheading Game'', a sequence which is contained in The [[Grenoside]] Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before getting up to go to the Green Chapel. The dancers made the knot of the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords. The interlacing of the hunting and wooing scenes was achieved by frequent cutting of the action from hunt to bed-chamber and back again, while the locale of both remained on-stage.

In 1992 [[Simon Corble]] created an adaptation with medieval songs and music for The Midsommer Actors' Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.corble.co.uk/page_1212407743203.html| title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A Seasonal Play in Verse with Medieval Christmas Songs and Music| work=Simon Corble website| accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed as [[Site-specific theatre|walkabout productions]] in the summer 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Francesca|title=Gawayne and the Green Knight|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Thurstaston Common]] and [[Beeston Castle]] and in August 1995 at [[Brimham Rocks]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Gawain&amp;w=9470542%40N07 photos from Midsommer Actors archive on flickr]&lt;/ref&gt; Corble later wrote a substantially revised version which was produced indoors at the [[O'Reilly Theatre]], Oxford in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nirula|first=Srishti|title=Sir Gawain pulls our strings|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2014/02/16/sir-gawain-pulls-our-strings/|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=The Oxford Student|date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Andrea|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|url=http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/reviews/feature/9002/Sir_Gawain_And_The_Green_Knight|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Daily Info, Oxford|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer [[Richard Blackford]] on commission from the village of [[Blewbury]], Oxfordshire. The libretto was written for the adaptation by the children's novelist John Emlyn Edwards.  The "Opera in Six Scenes" was subsequently recorded by [[Decca Records|Decca]] between March and June 1979 and released on the [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo]] label&lt;ref&gt;Argo ZK 85: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; an opera in six scenes by Richard Blackford. The Decca Record Company Ltd. Argo Division, 115 Fulham Road, London, SW3 6RR: 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1979.

''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' was adapted into an opera called ''[[Gawain (opera)|Gawain]]'' by [[Harrison Birtwistle]], first performed in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/965691|last=Bye|first=Anthony|date=May 1991|title=Birtwistle's Gawain|journal=[[The Musical Times]]|volume=132|issue=1779|pages=231–33|jstor=965691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's ''Gwyneth and the Green Knight'', first performed in 2002. This opera uses ''Sir Gawain'' as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female [[squire]], Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title = Opera&amp;nbsp;– Gwyneth and the Green Knight| work =| publisher = lynneplowman.co.uk| url = http://www.lynneplowman.co.uk/gwyneth.htm| doi =| accessdate = 2007-11-03|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014060625/http://www.lynneplowman.co.uk/gwyneth.htm|archivedate = 14 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Kimberley| first = Nick| title = Classical: The footstomping way to repay a sound investment| work = The Independent on Sunday| date = 11 May 2003| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/birmingham-contemporary-music-group-cbso-centre-birmingham-gwyneth-and-the-green-knight-linbury-590455.html| accessdate = 2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horse racing]], the '''starting price''' ('''SP''') is the [[odds]] prevailing on a particular horse in the on-course [[fixed-odds betting]] market at the time a race begins. The method by which SPs are set for each runner varies in different countries but is generally by [[consensus]] of an appointed panel on the basis of their observations of the fluctuation in prices at the racetrack.  The principal function of a starting price is to determine returns on those winning bets where fixed odds have not been taken at the time the bet was struck.

Typically, on the day of the race, UK bookmakers offer a choice between placing a bet at SP, or taking a fixed price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whichbookie.co.uk/sp-mean-bookmakers/|title=What Does SP Mean At Bookmakers? » Which Bookie|date=2017-02-01|newspaper=Which Bookie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewing future races, SP may be the only option available.

Some [[bookmaker]]s offer ''best odds guaranteed'', meaning that if a punter takes fixed odds on a race when the bet is struck and the SP turns out to be better (that is, higher), then if the punter wins, the payout is calculated using the SP.  This is aimed at removing hesitancy among punters prompted by fears of taking what might prove to be a poor (that is, low) price before the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.betting-explained.com/LearnBetting/what_is_a_starting_price_bet.htm |title=What is a Starting Price or SP bet? |publisher=Betting-explained.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the stake on an SP bet is returned if the horse is withdrawn before the race starts. For fixed-odds ([[ante-post]]) bets, the stake is retained by the bookmaker.

'''''Talley's Folly''''' is a 1980 play by American playwright [[Lanford Wilson]]. The play is the second in ''The Talley Trilogy'', between his plays ''[[Talley &amp; Son]]'' and ''[[Fifth of July]]''. Set in an boathouse near rural [[Lebanon, Missouri]] in 1944, it is a romantic comedy following the characters Matt Friedman and Sally Talley as they settle their feelings for each other. Wilson received the 1980 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for the work. The play is unlike Wilson's other works, taking place in one act with no intermission, set in ninety-seven minutes of real time, with no set change.

==Plot summary==
''Talley's Folly'' depicts one night in the lives of two unlikely sweethearts, Matt Friedman and Sally Talley. The [[one-act play]] takes place in a boathouse on the Talley farm in Missouri on the [[Fourth of July]], 1944.

The play opens with Matt directly addressing the audience, telling them that the play will take ninety-seven minutes and he hopes to relay his story properly in that time. Taking the time to point out some staging elements, he tells the audience that the gazebo-like structure next to him is a Victorian boathouse, which has fallen into disrepair. While on vacation in [[Lebanon, Missouri]] the previous summer, Matt met Sally and has sent her a letter every day since. Though the single reply from Sally gave him no hope for romantic encouragement, he has returned to ask her to marry him.

Sally arrives at the boathouse and is in disbelief that Matt has shown up uninvited, even though he had written her that he planned to come for the holiday. Matt's arrival has created a stir in Sally's conservative [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] household, where a [[Jews|Jewish]] man is not welcomed, especially when his intentions are to court their daughter, who is eleven years younger than he.

Matt's interest in Sally had never waned. He once drove from his home in [[St. Louis]] to the hospital where she worked and waited hours for her, even after being informed that she was not available.

The conversation turns to the boathouse structure. Sally tells him it was constructed by her uncle, who built [[folly|follies]] all over town. Her uncle did only what he wanted to do, and Sally considers him the healthiest member of the family for his courage.

Eventually, the couple begins to reminisce about the night they met and the time they spent together the previous summer. Matt takes it as a positive sign that she has changed into a nice dress before coming to see him tonight. Sally's protests do not match her behavior and he pushes forward. She is the most intriguing woman he has ever met, and he is determined to make her his wife.

Admitting that he has called Sally's aunt every two weeks during the past year, Matt reveals that he knows Sally was fired from a [[Sunday school]] teaching job. Apparently, she had been encouraging the students to read [[Thorstein Veblen|Thortstein Veblen]]'s ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' in addition to the [[Methodist]] reader. The rise of [[Trade union|labor unions]] was affecting the families of the children in her class and she felt obligated to help educate them. Her unorthodox methods earned her the consternation of the [[Church elder|church elders]] as well as her own family, who own the [[garment factory]] on which the labor issue centered.

Sally then tries to glean some information about Matt's background, a subject about which he is very guarded. He finally admits to Sally that he was probably born in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]. His father had been an engineer. In 1911, his father was overheard in a French cafe discussing his work with [[nitrogen]], a reference to the [[Haber process]] developed in 1909 by a [[Jewish-German]] chemist, [[Fritz Haber]], to extract nitrogen from the air, which made the manufacture of gunpowder and fertilizer inexpensive. The family was later detained as they were attempting to cross the border.

Matt's father and older sister were tortured until the French realized that the father had no information of any value to them. In the meantime, the sister had fallen into a coma from which she never awoke. They later went to the German authorities and were again detained. Matt escaped to America through the help of some relatives. Haunted by his childhood grief, Matt vowed never to bring another child into the world. He was content with his life until he met Sally. He now feels forever changed and hopeful for  the first time in his life.

Having risked the vulnerability of revealing his background, Matt presses Sally to share why she, a beautiful 31-year-old woman, has never married. She diverts the conversation to [[economics]], which frustrates Matt. Sally finally reveals her disappointment in love many years ago, which makes her reluctant to fall in love again. Her family had partnered her with Harley Campbell, whose family was also wealthy. The match was supposedly made in heaven, especially for the business interests of the two families. Sally had been a cheerleader and Harley had been a basketball star.

Unfortunately, the families' fortunes waned during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. In addition, Sally was struck with [[tuberculosis]] and sequestered for a long time. A [[pelvic infection]] left her barren, and Harley's family no longer condoned their marriage.

Matt comments on the irony of their situation, that he'd been lamenting over the fact that he was in love with a woman but could never have children and now this woman presents him with the same situation. He believes that an angel has guided his path to her. Sally agrees to marry him and move to [[St. Louis]], and they vow to return to the boathouse every year so they don't forget where they fell in love.

[[File: China Zorrilla as Emily Dickinson.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[China Zorrilla]] as [[Emily Dickinson]], 1981]]
'''''The Belle of Amherst''''' is a one-woman play by [[William Luce]].

Based on the life of poet [[Emily Dickinson]] from 1830 to 1886, and set in [[Emily Dickinson Museum|her Amherst, Massachusetts home]], the 1976 play makes use of her work, diaries, and letters to recollect her encounters with the significant people in her life&amp;nbsp;– family, close friends, and acquaintances. It balances the agony of her seclusion with the brief bright moments when she was able to experience some joy.

After one preview, the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] and starring [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], opened on April 28, 1976 at the [[Longacre Theatre]], where it ran for 116 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel.[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A1EF73558167493CBAB178FD85F428785F9&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22Julie+Harris%22&amp;st=p "Stage: 'Belle of Amherst'; Julie Harris Portrays Emily Dickinson"] ''The New York Times'' (abstract), April 29, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' reviewer wrote "With her technical ability and her emotional range, Miss Harris can convey profound inner turmoil at the same time that she displays irrepressible gaiety of spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, Thomas S. and Bordman, Gerald Martin.[https://books.google.com/books?id=1aSM__nVScAC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22William+Luce%22+%22The+Belle+of+Amherst%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22William%20Luce%22%20%22The%20Belle%20of%20Amherst%22&amp;f=false "Act Two, 1975-1984"]''American theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1969-2000'' (2001), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-512347-6}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris, who portrayed 15 different characters in the play, won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Play, earned a [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience, and won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Recording]]. She appeared in a televised [[PBS]] production&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202812/ "The Belle of Amherst"] Internet Movie Database, accessed October 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively toured the country with the play for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Rohmann, Chris.[http://www.aislesay.com/CT-BELLE.html "Review:'The Belle of Amherst' at Columbus Center, Springfield, Mass."] aislesay.com, accessed October 31. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehren, Christine.[https://archive.is/20120908080806/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/55996-Julie-Harris-Returns-to-Belle-of-Amherst-Oct-13-Nov-5-in-Seattle "Julie Harris Returns to 'Belle of Amherst' Oct. 13-Nov. 5 in Seattle"] playbill.com, October 13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickinson biographer Lyndall Gordon criticized the play for perpetuating [[Mabel Loomis Todd]]'s chaste, hermit-like image of Dickinson, as opposed to the lively, witty, provocative, and sometimes erotic Dickinson present in her work and known to those who knew her more personally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon "A bomb in her bosom: Emily Dickinson's secret life"] The Guardian. Lyndall Gordon. 12 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish translation of the play was done by Argentinean poet [[Silvina Ocampo]] for the [[Buenos Aires]] premiere starring [[China Zorrilla]] on January 1981. The production ran for more than 500 performances and Zorrilla embarked on a Latin American tour that ended at New York's [[Hunter College]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/28/arts/weekender-guide.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983 and Washington's [[Kennedy Center]]. With ''Emily'', the Uruguayan actress made a triumphant comeback to her country after 10 years of proscription for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correo.com.uy/index.asp?codpag=detProd&amp;smen=filatelia&amp;idp=1107&amp;s=1 Correo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Adventures of Pinocchio''''' is a 1999 direct to video film that is a sequel to the 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''. The film was directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]] and featured [[Martin Landau]] reprising his role as [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]] with [[Udo Kier]] reprising his role as Lorenzini, but also playing Lorenzini's widow Madame Flambeau. The film also featured [[Sarah Alexander]], [[Simon Schatzberger]], [[Warwick Davis]] and [[Ben Ridgeway]], and introduced [[Gabriel Thomson]] as Pinocchio. This is the last film Michael Anderson directed, before his death in 2018.

==Plot==
In July 1890, Pinocchio and his friend Lampwick skip school to go to a carnival. While there, they watch a presentation by the carnival's leader, Madame Flambeau. She gives a man with one shorter leg some of her Elixir, and his leg grows to the length of the other one. The carnival's dwarf then leads Pinocchio and Lampwick to "The Hall of Freaks", a place with a clown that washes his face, an albino who can blow fire from his mouth, a large fish tank that have fish with human faces, a woman with a beard, and a fairy called "Blue" who only Pinocchio can see. They then return to Pinocchio's house and find his father Geppetto, who is very sick. Pinocchio and Lampwick then return to the carnival to each buy some of Madame Flambeau's Elixir. Felinet and Volpe, a human-cat and human-fox respectively, lead them to Madame Flambeau. They don't have enough money for the Elixir, so they agree to work for her in the carnival. Lampwick drinks his Elixir and returns home, and Pinocchio gives his Elixir to Geppetto.

The next morning, Pinocchio finds the Elixir has transformed his father into a puppet. Madame Flambeau enters their house, and gets angry at Pinocchio for giving the Elixir to his father instead of himself. She reveals she is Lorenzini's widow. Geppetto and Pinocchio are then forced to work at the carnival's show. Geppetto eventually accepts and enjoys being a puppet, much to Pinocchio's dismay. Lampwick had been transformed into a sea donkey because of the Elixir, and Pinocchio finds him in the large fish tank. Madame Flambeau compromises Pinocchio that if he becomes a puppet, then Geppetto and Lampwick will automatically become human again; but this was a trick so that Pinocchio would perform in front of the prince. Seconds before the show, the dwarf takes Pinocchio; Felinet and Volpe take Geppetto and replace the two with inanimate puppets. The prince angrily leaves due to the audience booing. Madame Flambeau and her team go on a search for Geppetto and Pinocchio. The dwarf takes Pinocchio and Lampwick to the forest where Pinocchio came from. The dwarf transforms and reveals himself as Pepe.

Madame Flambeau finds Geppetto and then finds Pinocchio. Geppetto apologizes to Pinocchio for being more interested in his fame than his son, and it is implied he wants to be human again. Madame Flambeau then transforms into Lorenzini, a secret he had been hiding the whole time. He plans on cooking Lampwick using Pinocchio and Geppetto as the firewood. Pepe gives Pinocchio clues on how to find the Heart of the Mountain. Pinocchio, Geppetto and Lampwick get to the Heart of the Mountain via sliding down a long pathway. Once there, they find a pool called the "magic water", something that turns someone/something into their true nature. Lorenzini and the others also enter the Heart of the Mountain. Lampwick falls into the water and is instantly restored to human. Lorenzini laughs and jumps in the magic water thinking it will make him powerful, but it instead turns him into "the sea monster" over a period of time. Geppetto and Pinocchio then jump in and are instantly restored to human. Volpe and Felinet jump in but their true nature remains.

The next day, Lorenzini is locked up in a cage, and is laughed at by the carnival's audience for his grotesque sea monster appearance. Pinocchio and Lampwick go to see Geppetto's puppet show, along with a girl called "Isabella" who looks just like Blue but with black hair. Isabella tells Pinocchio that the Elixir can't truly fix anyone's troubles. Geppetto performs in front of the prince, and is applauded by Pinocchio and the rest of the audience. As the second lot of credits roll by, Lorenzini escapes his prison.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- As per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. --&gt;
A [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] ship crash-lands on Earth. Army Ranger [[sniper]] Quinn McKenna and his team are attacked by the Predator on a hostage retrieval mission. McKenna incapacitates the Predator and has its armor mailed off. At the behest of government agent Will Traeger, he is captured and held for examination. Traeger also takes the Predator to a lab for experimentation and observation, recruiting evolutionary biologist Casey Bracket to study it. The Predator awakes, breaks out of its bonds, kills lab workers, but spares Bracket before leaving. 

McKenna is bussed off with a group of other government captives, including ex-Marine Gaylord "Nebraska" Williams, military veterans Coyle and Baxley, helicopter pilot Nettles, and Lynch, another ex-Marine. Seeing the Predator escape from the lab firsthand, they take over the bus. Taking Bracket with them, they head over to McKenna's estranged wife, Emily, where he expects to find the Predator armor he mailed off. However, McKenna's [[autism|autistic]] son Rory has gone trick-or-treating while wearing this armor in hopes of avoiding detection from bullies.

McKenna and the others find his son just in time to stop a pair of Predator Dogs from ambushing the boy. The Predator chases them into a nearby school. They start to give the Predator's armor back when another, larger Predator arrives and kills the first. They flee, and the second Predator sets out to retrieve the lost technology.

Bracket concludes that the Predators are attempting to improve themselves with the DNA of humans and, presumably, other planets' inhabitants. The team flees to an abandoned barn, but Traeger finds them, captures them, and shares his theory that the Predators anticipate that climate change will end their ability to retrieve human DNA for further hybridization, so they are scrambling to retrieve it before it is too late. Seeing Rory drawing a map to the spaceship, Traeger takes the boy away to go to the ship. The team escapes and goes after him with the help of a brain-damaged Predator Dog. 

When all are at the crashed Predator ship, the second Predator arrives, kills Lynch, and explains through translation software that it will blow up the ship to keep it out of their hands and then give them all a head start before it hunts them down. The Predator quickly kills off most of the team. Traeger tries to use a Predator weapon on the alien but accidentally kills himself in the process. 

The Predator takes Rory, presumably because his autism reflects an advancement in human evolution and is therefore worthwhile in the Predator hybridization, and flies away in his ship. McKenna, Nebraska, and Nettles land on the ship's exterior, but the Predator activates a [[Force field (fiction)|force field]]. This slices Nettles' legs off, and he falls off of the ship to his death. Nebraska sacrifices himself and slides into the ship's turbine, causing it to crash. McKenna sneaks into the ship as it crashes and attacks the Predator. After the crash, Bracket arrives, and the three manage to overpower and finish the Predator with its own weapons. They pay their respects to their fallen comrades with trinkets representing each one before heading off.

After these events, McKenna and Rory are seen in a science lab watching the opening of cargo found on the Predator's ship. A piece of technology floats out and attaches itself to a lab worker, working as a transformative "Predator killer" suit before deactivating.

Chief-executive-officer of 20th Century Fox [[Stacey Snider]] shared her thoughts on ''The Predator'' and Shane Black and Fred Dekker’s script:
{{quote|We’ve got a ''Predator'' film coming out that is unexpected and utterly fresh. I just imagined that it would take 500 hours to read the script — that it would be interior jungle, exterior more jungle and then fighting happens, but Emma [Watts] went out and recruited Shane Black. From the first page, it didn’t read like a ''Predator'' film. It’s set in suburbia. There’s a little boy and his dad at the center of the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/features/stacey-snider-21st-century-fox-first-year-1202563799/|title=Fox’s Stacey Snider Gets Candid About Netflix, Diversity and the Future of Wolverine|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=September 20, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 253 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 4.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Predator'' has violence and quips to spare, but its chaotically hollow action adds up to another missed opportunity for a franchise increasingly defined by disappointment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_predator/ |title=The Predator (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-predator |title=The Predator Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, those on [[PostTrak]] gave it a 66% positive score and a 55% "definite recommend", and social media monitor RelishMix noted there were "mixed reactions" about the film online.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Jordan Mintzer called the film "bigger, meaner, gorier, funnier" than previous installments, writing, "Whether the world actually needs [a sequel], and whether this reboot was necessary at all, is probably a question worth raising, but at least Black's take on it is to never take it too seriously while keeping us duly entertained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mintzer |first1=Jordan |title='The Predator' Film Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/predator-review-1140779 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=September 7, 2018 |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Tallerico of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' praised the ensemble, pacing and Black's direction, writing, "Black is assisted greatly by an incredibly charismatic cast, and he knows how to use them to amplify their strengths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tallerico|first=Brian|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-predator-2018|title=''The Predator'' (2018)|date=September 7, 2018|work=[[RogerEbert.com]]|publisher=''Ebert Digital LLC''|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote "''The Predator'', which Black penned with ''[[The Monster Squad|Monster Squad]]'' co-writer and director Fred Dekker, makes a few concessions to modern blockbuster filmmaking, including an overabundance of CGI, a blatantly franchise-thirsty ending, and some winking references to the original. But the movie's values are more 1988 than 2018, and that's what it makes it fun, at least in spurts: Black has captured the spirit of that bygone era of adrenaline-junkie junk without getting all retro-fussy about it." He graded the film a B-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowd|first=A.A.|url=https://film.avclub.com/1989-called-and-it-wants-its-predator-sequel-back-1828909639|title=1989 Called, And It Wants Its ''Predator'' Sequel Back|date=September 9, 2018|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=''Onion, Inc.''|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a negative review, Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "an exhaustingly energetic mess in which a coherent plot and credible characters aren't even on the cluttered menu."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/the-predator-review-1202931727/|title=Toronto Film Review: ''The Predator''|date=September 7, 2018|work=[[Variety Magazine]]|publisher=''[[Penske Media]]''|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Nerdist]]'', Katie Walsh called the film "messy, chaotic, and convoluted", adding that its "comedy and action are at war with each other. Characters spew rat-a-tat quips, while tussling with Predators and their pets, essentially neutralizing the effect of both the humor and the action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Katie|url=https://nerdist.com/the-predator-review-shane-black/|title=Shane Black's ''The Predator'' Is At War With Itself (Review)|date=September 7, 2018|work=[[Nerdist]]|publisher=''Digital Entertainment''|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Barkan, writing for ''[[Dread Central]]'', gave the film two out of five stars, saying, "Poor story choices and strange, if not outright silly, character decisions result in an experience that will ultimately leave audiences feeling a great amount of 'meh'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|title=TIFF 2018: THE PREDATOR Review – A Disappointing Return for The Universe’s Greatest Hunter|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/282260/tiff-2018-the-predator-review-a-disappointing-return-for-the-universes-greatest-hunter/|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Vejvoda of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the film a 6.5 out of 10, saying, "''The Predator'' does a lot right to reinvigorate the 31-year-old series. But everything crashes down during its frenzied, messy final act, a disappointing conclusion to what had largely been a fun romp up until that point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|title=The Predator Review|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/07/the-predator-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Director Shane Black hired his longtime friend, Steven Wilder Striegel (known professionally as "Steve Wilder"), for a minor, un-auditioned role in ''The Predator'' (he had also appeared in Black's previous films ''Iron Man 3'' and ''The Nice Guys'').&lt;ref name="VarietyPredator"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/fox-deletes-sex-offender-predator-1202929542/|title=Fox Deletes Scene From ‘The Predator’ With Registered Sex Offender|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|publisher=Variety|date=September 6, 2018|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilder has been a registered felony sex offender since 2010, when he pleaded guilty to "enticing a minor by computer" after he attempted to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship via email.&lt;ref name="TimesPredator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-predator-shane-black-steven-wilder-striegel-20180906-story.html|title=Twentieth Century Fox pulls scene from 'The Predator' after director Shane Black casts his friend, a registered sex offender|last1=Kaufman|first1=Amy|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=September 6, 2018|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before [[picture lock]] on the film, Olivia Munn became aware of Wilder's history and approached Fox executives, insisting that the scene be removed.&lt;ref name="DeadlinePredator"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/the-predator-sex-offender-controversy-hurricane-florence-box-office-forecast-the-nun-blake-lively-anna-kendrick-1202463425/|title=‘The Predator’ Won’t Be Stopped By Hurricane Florence, Or Controversy, At Box Office|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=September 12, 2018|work=Deadline|access-date=September 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PeoplePredator"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/movies/olivia-munn-criticizes-predator-director-casting-registered-sex-offender/|title=Olivia Munn Criticizes Predator Director for Casting Registered Sex Offender: It's 'Unsettling'|last1=Pasquini|first1=Maria|publisher=People Magazine|date=September 6, 2018|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Predator'' suggests not only that autistic persons who exhibit [[savant syndrome|savant qualities]] and other forms of [[neurodiversity]] are or were advantageous, but that they represents a forward step on the [[human evolution]]ary path. According to the scientific opinions reported by ''[[Syfy Wire]]'', such a thesis would have some issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ward |first=Cassidy |title=Science Behind the Fiction: Predator suggests autism is human evolution - is that true? |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/science-behind-the-fiction-predator-suggests-autism-is-human-evolution-is-that-true |website=[[Syfy Wire]] |date=September 19, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the ''[[New York Post]]'' review ends by stating: "But worse is a plot line involving autism and a dubious scientific theory that will leave parents fuming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oleksinski |first=Johnny |title=‘The Predator’ is offensively bad |url=https://nypost.com/2018/09/12/the-predator-is-offensively-bad/ |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=September 12, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==

''The Predator'' will be released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and 4K Ultra HD formats on December 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Predator 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray &amp; Digital HD Details And Cover Art Revealed|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/sci-fi/predator/the-predator-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-digital-hd-details-and-cover-art-revealed-a164424|publisher=''Comic Book Movie''|accessdate=November 12, 2018|date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's third act was originally set during the day; after the resulting sequences were deemed ineffective, they were largely reshot at night. Black wanted the home media release to include both versions of the film, ''Predator AM'' and ''Predator PM'', but the studio declined, not wanting to pay to complete the daylight version's digital effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KqLGl5P6VQ|title=The Predator Reshoots Explained by Shane Black|publisher=Collider Videos|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sequels==
The producer, [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], has said that ''The Predator'' sets up two sequels that he hopes Shane Black will return to direct. About this, Black said: "I would love to say we've been planning a trilogy, but I take one day at a time, in motion-picture terms that's one movie at a time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/the-predator-reboot-shane-black-1202874827/|title=Director Shane Black Took a ‘Butch-and-Sundance Approach’ to ‘The Predator’|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=July 18, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tricia Rose''' (born 1962) is an American academic. She is Chancellor's Professor of [[Africana studies|Africana Studies]] and Director of the Center for Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at [[Brown University]]. Through a sociological framework Rose has examined, taught, and written about U.S. black culture, especially the intersectionality of pop music, social issues, gender and sexuality.

== Early life ==
Born in [[New York City]], Rose lived in a [[Harlem]] tenement until she was seven. In 1970 her family moved north to [[Co-op City]], a new housing development located in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rose received her B.A in [[Sociology]] from [[Yale University]] and her Ph.D. in American Studies from [[Brown University]], where she became the first person in the United States to write a doctoral dissertation on [[Hip hop|hip-hop]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=Class With the 'Ph.D. Diva'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/18/books/class-with-the-phd-diva.html|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=The New York Times|date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Lipsitz]] was one of her dissertation advisors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Career ==
Rose taught for nine years in the [[Africana studies|Africana Studies]] program at [[New York University]], then moved in 2002 to [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California at Santa Cruz]]; in July 2003 she became chair of its [[American studies|American Studies]] department there.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rose is currently the Chancellor's Professor of Africana Studies and Director of the Center for Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triciarose.com/biography.html|title=Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she became Director of the Center on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2013/04/hip-hop-scholar-tricia-rose-named-director-of-brown-universitys-center-for-the-study-of-race-and-ethnicity-in-america/|title=Hip-Hop Scholar Tricia Rose Named Director of Brown University’s Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America|last=Dionne|first=Evette|date=April 2013|work=Clutch Magazine|newspaper=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose has written three books, ''[[Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America]]'' (Wesleyan University Press, May 15, 1994), ''[[Longing to Tell: Black Women Talk About Sexuality And Intimacy]]'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, June 11, 2003), ''The Hip Hop Wars: What We Talk About When We Talk About Hip Hop - And Why It Matters'' (December 2, 2008), and co-wrote a fourth entitled ''Microphone Fiends: Youth Music and Youth Culture'' (June 23, 1994).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/article/turning-tables-interview-author-and-scholar-tricia-rose|title=Turning the Tables: An Interview with author and scholar Tricia Rose|last=Peterson|first=Latoya|date=May 5, 2016|work=Bitch Magazine|newspaper=|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Black Noise'', developed from her doctoral dissertation, is regarded as the first piece of published work to frame [[Hip hop music|hip hop']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s legacy in such a way that granted it legitimacy among scholars; ultimately shaping the field of hip hop academic study.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/2310/32|title=It's All About Love|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Noise'', which made ''[[The Village Voice]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s top 25 books of 1994, was awarded an American Book Award&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; from the Before Columbus Foundation in 1995.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/sociology/events/vss/rose.html|title=Tricia Rose|last=|first=|date=|website=Boston College|publisher=Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Longing to Tell: Black Women’s Stories of Sexuality and Intimacy'' is Rose's second book and focuses on black women's sexuality in America. Through testimonies which seek to dispel prevailing myths and provide insights, this oral narrative project illustrates the complexities of exploring black female sexuality within contemporary culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:High res fire poi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A hobby &amp;mdash; performance &amp;mdash; sport &amp;mdash; traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] dance, flaming [[Poi (juggling)|poi]] are among a wide variety of twirling gear in modern use.]]

'''Twirling''' is a form of [[object manipulation]] where an object is twirled by one or two hands, the fingers or by other parts of the body. Twirling practice manipulates the object in circular or near circular patterns. It can also be done indirectly by the use of another object or objects as in the case of devil stick manipulation where handsticks are used. Twirling is performed as a hobby, sport, exercise or performance.

==Types of Twirling==
Twirling includes a wide variety of practices that use different equipment or props. All props are 'stick' or simulated stick shape and are rotated during the activity. The types of twirling are arranged alphabetically.

==Astrowheeling==

[[File:Astrowheeling.jpg|thumb|right|Astrowheeling is a form of twirling used as personal exercise for improving dexterity, focus and balance.]]
By using a heavy spinning wheel with handles, astrowheeling combines the aesthetics of twirling and the resistance of spinning wheels into a form of practical exercise. It was inspired by ancient practices that manipulate the rotational inertia of spinning objects in order to develop balance, focus, and control. The current trend of astrowheeling, which uses "bike-like" wheels, was popularized in the 1980s in North America.&lt;ref&gt;''Astrowheeling: Space-age twirling'' (Hardcover) by Charles Roy Schroeder, Memphis State University Press; 1st edition (1979) {{ISBN|9780878700745}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baton twirling==
{{Main article|Baton twirling}}
[[File:Baton-practice-Manzanar-Adams.jpeg|thumb|alt=Japanese teenage girl in 1940s sweater, skirt, and blouse twirling two batons and smiling, backlit by the sun against a nearly-cloudless sky.|Baton twirling, [[Manzanar War Relocation Center]], 1943. Photographed by [[Ansel Adams]].]]
Baton twirling has expanded beyond parades and is now more comparable to rhythmic gymnastics (see below). The sport is popular in many countries including the United States, Japan, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada. Many countries compete each year at the World Baton Twirling Championships.

The sport of baton twirling is a relatively new discipline that has evolved through many dimensions.

The distinguishing fundamental characteristics are:

Handling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures and patterns, executed with dexterity, smoothness, fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air.

Expression of the body through dance and movement to create a demonstration of strength, flexibility, physical fitness, beauty, aesthetics, and harmony in coordination with the manipulation of the baton.
The incorporation of gymnastic movements adapted to baton twirling to create additional elements of risk and excitement.

The discipline requires the simultaneous blending of these fundamental characteristics all set to music, utilizing time and space to display both technical merit and artistic expression in creating a total package for the viewer’s eye. Baton twirling is an entertaining and exciting sport to watch. The intricate timing and precision required to perform these feats is difficult. Baton twirling requires complete concentration and coordination. It demands top physical conditioning.

Baton twirling encompasses the physical stamina and agility of gymnastics and dance, the beauty of figure skating and ballet, and the technical skill of all these sports combined.

The distinguishing fundamental characteristics are:

Handling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures and patterns, executed with dexterity, smoothness, fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air.

Routines for competitive sport baton twirling are designed for athletes of novice through elite stages of development, experience and ability. Individual competitive events utilize one-baton, two-baton, or three-baton to standardized music while Group competitive events are performed with members twirling together with precision and unison. Also there are pair and group events which include Freestyle Pairs and Freestyle Team at the highest level. Groups utilize their own pre-recorded music.

Professionally trained and certified WBTF Judges adjudicate the competitions.

One of the highest honors in twirling is winning "WBTF Gold Medalist."

Origins:

Baton twirling started in Eastern Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where the goers used knives, guns, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The "activity" progressed into the armies of some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler to the front of the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a "mace". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace barer or "drum major" twirled the baton whilst leading the army or band. This was very popular in the United States following World War II with the American Legion Bands and the Fireman’s Bands. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females ("drum majorettes") and the progression of twirling that resulted in the lightening and balancing of the baton. The sport came to North America when Major Millsap’s created baton twirling when he established Millsap's College in the United States in Mississippi after the Civil War.

While many member countries have their own national organizations, the World Baton Twirling Federation governs the sport of baton twirling on an international level.

==Pen spinning==
{{Main article|Pen spinning}}
[[Image:Unknown Combo (Animated).gif|thumb|A combination of pen spinning tricks.]]
Pen spinning &amp;mdash; using one's fingers to manipulate an ordinary inexpensive writing-pen &amp;mdash; can be performed anywhere. Sometimes classified as a form of [[contact juggling]], pen spinning may also include tossing and catching of the pen.

Called ''"rōnin mawashi"'' in Japan, where it is popular among the per-collegiate community, pen twirling has its stars, as does any other performance or skill. Accomplished masters of the art form that are well known &amp;mdash; at least among those who follow the sport &amp;mdash; have developed a reputation for creation of certain signature 'moves'. David Weis is credited with creating numerous 'back' style moves, such as the ''"BackAround"''. Hideaki Kondoh is generally credited with giving the pen trick ''"Sonic"'' its name, because of the way the pen would blur in his fingers.

Penspinning only recently saw a rapid increase in recognition due to the emergence of internet media websites such as YouTube. From 2006 onwards, the art of Penspinning has developed subcultures in many countries of the world including the Asiatic-regions and Europe (France, Germany and Poland).

==Poi==
{{Main article|Poi (juggling)}}
'''Poi''' is a form of [[juggling]], [[dance]] or performance art, accomplished using balls, or various other weights, on ropes or chains &amp;mdash; held in each hand, and swung in various circular patterns, similar to [[Indian club|club-twirling]]. It was originally practiced by the [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]] (the word ''poi'' means "ball" in Māori).

==Rhythmic gymnastics==

{{Main article|Rhythmic gymnastics}}
Combining elements of ballet, [[gymnastics]], theatrical dance, and apparatus manipulation, Rhythmic Gymnastics, once largely considered a sport for women and girls, is growing in popularity among men as well. The Japanese's version of Men's rhythmic gymnastics includes tumbling and is performed on a spring floor. Men compete in four types of apparatus: rope, stick, double rings and clubs. Groups do not use any apparatus. Japan hosted the first men's world championships in 2003.

Rhythmic gymnastics as a sport began in the 1940s in the former Soviet Union. It was there that for the first time, the spirit of sports was combined with the sensuous art of classical ballet. (To Isadora Duncan, we credit the famous rebellion against the dogma of classical ballet and the shift toward the creation of a new discipline that would blend art and sport.)
Recognized in 1961 as 'modern gymnastics', later 'rhythmic sportive gymnastics', rhythmic gymnastics experienced its first World Championships for individual gymnasts in 1963 in [[Budapest, Hungary|Budapest]].

Today, Rhythmic gymnastics as a sport continues on, and hobbyists have adopted rhythmic gymnastics props such as the women's [[Ball (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ball]], [[Clubs (rhythmic gymnastics)|Clubs]], [[Hoop (rhythmic gymnastics)|Hoop]], [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ribbon]], and [[Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)|Rope]], plus the '''stick''' and '''rings''' of men's gymnastics, as exercise and recreational gear. These props have found their way into the modern '[[juggling]] and [[:Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys|dexterity play]] community' where they are used to perform tricks and maneuvers for fun fitness, and flexibility.

==Sticks and staves==

===Devil sticks===
{{Main article|Devil sticks}}

"Twirling", "sticking," and "stick juggling" are all common terms for using the twirling prop known as devil sticks, flower sticks, or various other names. A set of devil sticks is made up of one baton and two control sticks.

In use the central stick, the baton, is pushed, lifted and caressed by the two control sticks causing the stick to flip, wobble, spin, and fly through various maneuvers or tricks.

Juggling sticks similar to the modern variants have continuously evolved as they were passed down through the centuries. Apparently originating in Africa earlier than 3000 BCE, &lt;nowiki&gt;"devil sticks"&lt;/nowiki&gt; may have followed the [[Silk Road]], from [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]] to [[China]], and have been used in [[Europe]] since the [[Renaissance]].

===Morris dancing===
{{Main article|Morris dance}}
In some forms of [[Morris dance|Morris dancing]], a stick is twirled in one hand during a dance. For example, in stick dances from [[Brackley]] in the Cotswold tradition, each dancer twirls one or two sticks throughout the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Lionel|title=A Handbook of Morris Dances|year=1974|publisher=The Morris Ring}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staff twirling&lt;!--[[Staff twirling]] redirects directly here.--&gt;===

'''Staff twirling''' is the art or sport of skillfully manipulating a staff, such as a [[quarterstaff]], [[Bo (weapon)|bo]], or other long length of wood, metal, or plastic as recreation, sport, or as a performance.

In the martial art of ''bojutsu'', a bo is used as a weapon, increasing the force delivered in a strike, through leverage. Bojitsu ''kata''—detailed patterns of movements practiced to perfect one's form—are also used in many traditional Japanese arts, such as [[kabuki]]. Some of these kata, are very flowing and pleasant to experience, both as the one executing the movement, and as a spectator.

Staff twirling has enjoyed recent growth in the [[:Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys|dexterity play]], [[juggling]] and [[fire dancing]] communities, in part due to the influence of martial arts, and in part due to increasing popularity of adult play as recreation.

==Mathematical significance==
The figure-eight twirl can be used as a demonstration that a double rotation is a loop in rotation space that can be shrunk to a point.

[[Image:William Sharp 1894.jpg|thumb|William Sharp photographed in 1894 by [[Frederick Hollyer]].]]
'''William Sharp''' (12 September 1855 – 12 December 1905) was a Scottish writer, of poetry and [[Biography in literature|literary biography]] in particular, who from 1893 wrote also as '''Fiona Macleod''', a pseudonym kept almost secret during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E10FE385F12738DDDAC0994DA415B858CF1D3 Sharp's Death Solves Literary Mystery], NY Times, 15 December 1905&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an editor of the poetry of [[Ossian]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Eugene Lee-Hamilton]].

==Biography==
Sharp was born in [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]] and educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] and the [[University of Glasgow]], which he attended 1871–1872 without completing a degree. In 1872 he contracted [[typhoid]]. During 1874–5 he worked in a Glasgow law office. His health broke down in 1876 and he was sent on a voyage to Australia. In 1878 he took a position in a bank in London.

He was introduced to [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] by [[Joseph Noel Paton|Sir Noel Paton]], and joined the Rossetti literary group; which included [[Hall Caine]], [[Philip Bourke Marston]] and Swinburne. He married his cousin Elizabeth in 1884, and devoted himself to writing full-time from 1891, travelling widely.

Also about this time, he developed an intensely romantic but perhaps asexual attachment to Edith Wingate Rinder, another writer of the consciously Celtic Edinburgh circle surrounding [[Patrick Geddes]] and "[[The Evergreen]]". It was to Rinder ("EWR") he attributed the inspiration for his writings as Fiona Macleod thereafter, and to whom he dedicated his first Macleod novel ("Pharais") in 1894. Sharp had a complex and ambivalent relationship with [[W. B. Yeats]] during the 1890s, as a central tension in the [[Celtic Revival]]. Yeats initially found Macleod acceptable and Sharp not, and later fathomed their identity. Sharp found the dual personality an increasing strain.

On occasions when it was necessary for "Fiona Macleod" to write to someone unaware of the dual identity, Sharp would dictate the text to his sister (Mary Beatrice Sharp), whose handwriting would then be passed off as Fiona's manuscript. During his Macleod period, Sharp was a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

He died (and is buried) at [[Ducea di Nelson]], [[Bronte, Sicily|Bronte]], Sicily: the Dukedom donated to [[Horatio Nelson]] from [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]].  In 1910, Elizabeth Sharp published a biographical memoir attempting to explain the creative necessity behind the deception, and edited a complete edition of his works.

__NOTOC__
"'''Worst Case Scenario'''" is the 67th series and 25th and penultimate episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 3)|third season]] of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''.

==Plot==
Various members of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew discover a [[holodeck]] simulation called "Insurrection Alpha", in which the [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] members of the ship's crew mutiny against the [[Starfleet]] officers. The program appears unfinished, and its author is unknown. As the program becomes popular, [[Tuvok]] admits he wrote the program himself, to train his security officers in the event of a possible Maquis rebellion; however, as the Maquis proved to integrate well with their crewmates, Tuvok abandoned the program, believing that it would only exacerbate tensions on board the ship. However, given how popular that Insurrection Alpha has already become amongst the crew, [[Tom Paris]] offers to help complete the remainder of the program with Tuvok's help, turning the program into a full-fledged [[holonovel]].

When Paris and Tuvok start to work on the program in the holodeck, they suddenly find themselves trapped in the virtual brig. They are addressed by the simulation's version of former crew member [[Seska]], who admits that before she had escaped the ship, she had discovered Tuvok's program, and created this trap should he attempt to alter it. Seska's alterations not only affect the holodeck but other parts of ''Voyager'', threatening the well-being of the whole crew. While Tuvok and Paris attempt to survive the simulation, Captain [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] and [[B'Elanna Torres]] attempt to effect changes in the simulation to help them. Ultimately, finding themselves cornered by the virtual Seska and her Maquis crew, Tuvok causes one of the simulation's phaser rifles to overload; the impact ends the simulation, and allows Tuvok and Paris to safely exit the holodeck.

'''''Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.''''', 433 U.S. 562 (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.|volume=433 |page=562 |year=1977}} {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an important [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case concerning [[Personality rights#United States|rights of publicity]].  The Court held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]s do not [[Immunity from prosecution|immunize]] the news media from [[civil liability]] when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, and the Constitution does not prevent a state from requiring broadcasters to compensate performers.  It was the first time (and so far the only time) the Supreme Court heard a case on rights of publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightofpublicity.com/brief-history-of-rop|title=RightOfPublicity.com|last=Faber|first=Jonathan|accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts and procedural history ==
[[Petitioner]] [[Hugo Zacchini]] had a [[human cannonball]] act which he performed at various venues.  During August 1972, he was performing his act at the [[Geauga County Fair]] in [[Burton, Ohio]].  On August 30, Zacchini noticed a freelance reporter from [[Scripps-Howard Broadcasting]] (which operated [[WEWS-TV]] in Cleveland) who had brought a [[movie camera]] into the fair.  Zacchini asked the reporter not to film his act.  The reporter did not film Zacchini's act that day, but did film him the next day.  The footage taken by the reporter was about fifteen seconds long, sufficient to capture Zacchini's entire act.

Zacchini filed suit against Scripps-Howard in Ohio state court, alleging that the local reporter "showed and commercialized the film of his act without his consent," and that such conduct was an "unlawful appropriation of plaintiff's professional property."  The trial court granted the defendant [[summary judgment]].  The [[Ohio District Courts of Appeal|Ohio Court of Appeals]] reversed, holding that Zacchini's complaint stated a [[cause of action]] for [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] and for [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] of a [[common law copyright]], and that the press was not privileged to show Zacchini's entire act on television without compensating him.

The case was then heard by the [[Ohio Supreme Court]], who reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of Scripps-Howard.  The Ohio Supreme Court held that although Scripps-Howard would be liable for appropriating Zacchini's name, likeness, and performance, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A TV station has a privilege to report in its newscasts matters of legitimate public interest which would otherwise be protected by an individual's right of publicity, unless the actual intent of the TV station was to appropriate the benefit of the publicity for some nonprivileged private use, or unless the actual intent was to injure the individual.&lt;ref&gt;433 U.S. at 565 (internal quotation marks omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' to determine whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments immunized respondent from damages for its alleged infringement of Zacchini's right of publicity under Ohio state law.

== Decision ==
=== Majority opinion ===
[[Byron White|Justice White]] wrote for the majority.  He held first that, because the Ohio Supreme Court based its decision on the scope of protection offered to the press by the [[United States Constitution|Federal constitution]] (rather than the [[Ohio state constitution]]), no [[adequate and independent state ground]] existed for the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court therefore had jurisdiction.

Moving on to the substantive constitutional issue of the case, White disagreed with the Ohio Supreme Court that the press should be privileged in showing Zacchini's entire act.  He distinguished this case from ''[[Time, Inc. v. Hill]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|385|374|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court case upon which the Ohio Supreme Court relied in their opinion.  ''Time, Inc. v. Hill'' was a case which dealt with the [[tort]] of "[[false light]]", i.e. portraying a person in a misleading or embarrassing manner, rather than the appropriation of a performer's act or likeness, which was at stake there.  White analogized Zacchini's interest in protecting his act from being shown without his permission to those interests protected by [[United States patent law|patent]] and [[United States copyright law|copyright]]:  Zacchini not only had a commercial interest in being compensated for the time and effort involved in his performance, but also the "economic incentive for him to make the investment required to produce a performance of interest to the public".&lt;ref&gt;433 U.S. at 576&lt;/ref&gt;  White concluded by saying that while a state government may pass a law shielding the press from liability for broadcasting performers' acts, the First and Fourteenth amendments do not require the states to do so.

=== Dissenting opinions ===
[[Lewis F. Powell|Justice Powell]], joined by justices [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Brennan]] and [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]], disagreed with the standard set forth by the majority.  Powell felt that the majority concentrated too heavily on the fact that the footage which was broadcast constituted Zacchini's "entire act" (which, Powell noted, was a rather uncertain standard in itself), rather than examining the purpose for which the footage was used.  Since the footage was used for the purpose of reporting news, rather than for commercial exploitation, Powell asserted that the television station's use of the footage should be considered privileged from liability.  He worried that the majority's holding may have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on [[freedom of the press]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Court's holding that the station's ordinary news report may give rise to substantial liability has disturbing implications, for the decision could lead to a degree of media self-censorship.  Hereafter, whenever a television news editor is unsure whether certain film footage received from a camera crew might be held to portray an "entire act," he may decline coverage – even of clearly newsworthy events – or confine the broadcast to watered-down verbal reporting, perhaps with an occasional still picture. The public is then the loser. This is hardly the kind of news reportage that the First Amendment is meant to foster.&lt;ref&gt;433 U.S. at 580–581 (Powell, J., dissenting) (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]] wrote a separate dissent.  He felt that a better resolution of the case would have been to remand it back to the Ohio Supreme Court for clarification of the state law issue before attempting to resolve the constitutional issue.  Stevens felt that it was not clear whether the Ohio Supreme Court was basing its holding purely on the boundaries of common law torts or the First Amendment.
