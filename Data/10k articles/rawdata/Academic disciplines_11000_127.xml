The '''Architecture Studies Library''' (ASL) is located in the ''Paul B. Sogg Architecture Building'', located on the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] campus. The services of the library  address both the needs of the faculty and students of the  [[UNLV School of Architecture]], and also responds to the needs of researchers  through an email reference service.  The Library provides historical and current information and resources about [[architecture in Las Vegas]], primarily through its [http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/archdb/arch.php  Las Vegas Architects and Buildings Database]. 

==History==
The building was completed and occupied in August 1997. The Architecture Studies Library (approximately 16,000 gross square feet) includes spaces for book and periodical stacks, individual carrels on both of its floors, current periodicals display shelving, exhibits, a reference area, clippings files, special collections, group study rooms, and a computer lab.

The architect for the building was Swisher &amp; Hall Architects of Las Vegas. The interiors furniture selection and placement was a project of one of the School's interior design classes.

[[File:Plan Rome - Arcus Novus.png|thumb|Location of Arcus Novus]]
The '''Arcus Novus''' was an ancient arch in Rome, located on the ''[[Via Lata (Rome)|Via lata]]'' (now the Via del Corso ), at the site of the church of [[Santa Maria in Via Lata]].

== History ==
The arch was dedicated to [[Diocletian]] either for the occasion of his ''[[decennalia]]'' in 293&amp;nbsp;AD, or his [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] celebrated with [[Maximian]] in 303–304. The name Arcus novus (new arch) probably refers to the earlier [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|Arch of Claudius]] on the same street.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

The Arcus Novus was decorated with reliefs reused (''[[spolia]]'') from a large altar of the Julio-Claudian period, most probably the ''Ara pietatis'', while the column [[plinths]] were decorated with images of ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]'', barbarian prisoners and the [[Dioskouri]], probably from the facade of the nearby [[Sol invictus|Temple of the Sun]] of [[Aurelian]]. The arch was destroyed in 1491 by order of Pope [[Innocent VIII]] during reconstruction of Santa Maria in Via Lata.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

Fragments of the reliefs were discovered in 1523 and added to the [[Andrea della Valle|Della Valle]] collection before being acquired by [[Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici]] in 1584, from where the plinths found their way to the [[Boboli Gardens]] in Florence. Other fragments from the [[Antonine]] period, reused by [[Diocletian]], were included in the rear facade of the cardinal's [[Villa Medici]] in Rome. More recently excavations carried out in 1923–1933 discovered further fragments now in the [[Capitoline Museums#Centrale_Montemartini|Centrale Montemartini]].{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

'''Argonne National Laboratory''' is a science and engineering research [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] operated by the [[University of Chicago]] Argonne LLC for the [[United States Department of Energy]] located near [[Lemont, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]]. It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the [[Midwest]].

Argonne was initially formed to carry out [[Enrico Fermi]]'s work on [[nuclear reactor]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page xx (Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the US's [[nuclear navy]], and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994 the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and [[renewable energy]], environmental [[sustainability]], [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]], and [[national security]].

UChicago Argonne, LLC, the operator of the laboratory, "brings together the expertise of the [[University of Chicago]] (the sole member of the LLC) with [[Jacobs Engineering Group|Jacobs Engineering Group Inc]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicagoargonnellc.org/ |title=World-class Scientific Research &amp; Innovation |publisher=UChicago Argonne, LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne is a part of the expanding [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West (or simply Argonne-West) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In 2005, the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|work = Post Register|location = Idaho Falls, ID|title = Cleaning house and charting a future at INL|last = Menser|first = Paul|publisher = |accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020138/http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|archivedate = 2013-11-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Argonne has five main areas of focus. These goals, as stated by the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|accessdate=2009-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095748/http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of:

* Conducting [[Basic research|basic scientific research]];
* Operating national scientific facilities;
* Enhancing the nation's energy resources;
* Developing better ways to manage environmental problems;
* Protecting national security.

==History==
[[Image:ZGS preaccelerator.png|thumb|200px|[[Albert Crewe]] (right), Argonne's third director, stands next to the [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]]'s [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]].]]
Argonne began in 1942 as the "[[Metallurgical Laboratory]]" at the [[University of Chicago]], which became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The Met Lab built [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium. Considered unsafe, in 1943, CP-1 was reconstructed as CP-2, in what is today known as [[Red Gate Woods]] but was then the Argonne Forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]]. The lab was named after the surrounding Argonne Forest, which in turn was named after the [[Forest of Argonne]] in [[France]] where U.S. troops fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.gov/about-argonne/history|title=Argonne: History|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermi's pile was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest, and construction plans were set in motion, but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt. Since speed was paramount, the project was moved to the squash court under [[Stagg Field]], the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago. Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations, which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction, which would have contaminated the city.

Other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years. On July 1, 1946, the "Metallurgical Laboratory" was formally re-chartered as Argonne National Laboratory for "cooperative research in nucleonics." At the request of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated [[DuPage County, Illinois]] and established a remote location in [[Idaho]], called "Argonne-West," to conduct further nuclear research.

In quick succession, the laboratory designed and built [[Chicago Pile 3]] (1944), the world's first [[heavy water reactor|heavy-water moderated reactor]], and the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (Chicago Pile 4), built in Idaho, which lit a string of four light bulbs with the world's first nuclear-generated electricity in 1951. A complete list of the reactors designed and, in most cases, built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the, "[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/ANL-Reactors.html Reactors Designed by Argonne]" page. The knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1) formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2) inform the current evolving designs of liquid-metal reactors for future commercial power stations.

Conducting classified research, the laboratory was heavily secured; all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint, many of the buildings were classified, and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded. Such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized—including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]] and [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne Highlights: 1950–1959 |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/fifties.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and unauthorized. Shortly past 1 a.m. on February 6, 1951, Argonne guards discovered reporter [[Paul Harvey]] near the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} perimeter fence, his coat tangled in the barbed wire. Searching his car, guards found a previously prepared four-page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified "hot zone". He was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public, but was not indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephens |first = Joel |title = New documents show longtime friendship between J. Edgar Hoover and Paul Harvey |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2010-01-23 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012202602.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors, however. While designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957, Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] images of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = William Nelson "Nels" Beck: Joliet Physicist's Work Changed Medical World |publisher = CityofJoliet.com |url = http://www.cityofjoliet.com/halloffame/scientists/wnbeck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas, sealed laboratories or caves.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the "Janus" reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life, providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants, laboratories and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Research helps safeguard nuclear workers worldwide |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960803.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the [[Moon|moon's]] surface using [[alpha decay|alpha radiation]], which launched aboard the [[Surveyor 5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Jacobsen |first = Sally |title = Getting Aboard Viking: No Room on the Mars Lander. |date = December 1971|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgsAAAAAMBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the [[Apollo 11]] mission.

In addition to nuclear work, the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1955, Argonne chemists co-discovered the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], elements 99 and 100 in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert [[noble gas]] [[xenon]], opening up a new field of chemical bonding research.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, they discovered the [[Aqueous electron|hydrated electron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Innovation and Serendipity |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/chemhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy physics made a leap forward when Argonne was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]], a [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] that opened in 1963. A [[bubble chamber]] allowed scientists to track the motions of [[subatomic particle]]s as they zipped through the chamber; in 1970, they observed the [[neutrino]] in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|U.S.S. ''Nautilus'']], which steamed for more than 513,550 nautical miles (951,090&amp;nbsp;km). The next nuclear reactor model was Experimental [[Boiling Water Reactor]], the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants, and [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] (EBR-II), which was sodium-cooled, and included a fuel recycling facility. EBR-II was later modified to test other reactor designs, including a [[fast-neutron reactor]] and, in 1982, the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] concept—a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel, reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Frontline: Nuclear Reaction: Interview with Dr. Charles Till |publisher = PBS |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, however, the U.S. Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argonne's nuclear programs.

Argonne moved to specialize in other areas, while capitalizing on its experience in physics, chemical sciences and [[metallurgy]]. In 1987, the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called [[plasma wakefield acceleration]], which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne History: Understanding the Physical Universe |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |url=http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html#neutrino |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909173546/http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html |archivedate=9 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cultivated a strong [[battery (electricity)|battery]] research program.

Following a major push by then-director Alan Schriesheim, the laboratory was chosen as the site of the [[Advanced Photon Source]], a major X-ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest X-rays in the world at the time of its construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4492">'''Association of Law Students’ Library of the Jagiellonian University''' (pol. ''Towarzystwo Biblioteki Słuchaczów Prawa Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego'' – ''TBSP UJ'') is the oldest and one of the biggest student scientific associations in [[Poland]]. 

==History==

TBSP was established on 23 June 1851, the aim of the association was to organize and equip an independent law library for Polish law students at [[Jagiellonian University]], which was [[Germanisation|Germanised]] at that time as [[Galicia (Central Europe)#Galician autonomy|Galician autonomy]] has not been introduced yet.

Association’s activities could be performed thanks to multiple donations made by professors and students. The book collection was growing systematically as well as TBSP’s activities – as early as in 1890s scientific and oratorical competitions, congresses and lectures were orgranised. The association was actively participating in patriotic initiatives in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].

During the years 1914-1915, when [[Jagiellonian University]] was closed, TBSP moved to [[Vienna]] to continue its activities there and came back to [[Kraków]] after re-opening of the university. During the [[Second World War]], the association joined [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground education]] and made its library (the part which has not been requisitioned yet) fully available to students. 
In 1950, when [[Poland]] found itself in the [[History_of_Communism#Communism_in_Eastern_Europe_during_the_post-war_era|Soviet zone of influence]], the association was formally liquidated, its headquarters taken over by university and its book collection – by the [[Jagiellonian Library]]; scripts duplicating centre was suppressed. However TBSP’s traditions were continued by informal circles of penal law students and historians of law.
In 1957 TBSP was officially reactivated, efforts have been made to recover the book collection. Since that time, the association has not been an independent entity but a unit of [[Jagiellonian University]].

==Activities==

At present, TBSP unites about 1500 students and runs various educational and cultural activities. In the framework of 23 sections, additional classes are organised for younger students to help them prepare for participation in faculty competitions and final examinations. More advanced students participate in discussions and specialist workshops organised in cooperation with partner institutions and law firms. The association runs intensive publishing activities, just to mention regular Scientific Books of the TBSP UJ or repetitory courses for students. Traditionally, respective sections organise study trips to the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]], the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland|Supreme Court]] etc., to help students to get to know most important [[Politics of Poland|Polish institutions]]. Each year various scientific congresses are organized, many of them of international dimension, while permanent evening meetings with the most prominent professors and law practitioners allow students to get some less formal contact with legal profession.

==History==
[[Image:NIEdot362.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early 20th-century comparison of elemental, solar, and stellar spectra]]
Although astronomy is as ancient as recorded history itself, it was long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging [[Celestial spheres|spheres]] whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent [[Generation and corruption|growth and decay]] and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its goal.  Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] as maintained by [[Plato]], or [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] as maintained by [[Aristotle#Physics|Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.E.R. | authorlink = G.E.R.

During the 17th century, natural philosophers such as [[Galileo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Galilei | first = Galileo | author-link = Galileo Galilei | editor-last = Van Helden | editor-first = Albert | publication-date = 1989 | title = Sidereus Nuncius or The Sidereal Messenger | publisher = University of Chicago Press | publication-place = Chicago | pages = 21, 47 | isbn = 978-0-226-27903-9 | date = 1989-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Edward Slowik |title=Descartes' Physics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/ |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=2013 |origyear=2005 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Westfall | first = Richard S. | author-link = Richard S.

For much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Case | first = Stephen | date = 2015 | title = 'Land-marks of the universe': John Herschel against the background of positional astronomy | journal = Annals of Science | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–434 | doi = 10.1080/00033790.2015.1034588 | quote = The great majority of astronomers working in the early nineteenth century were not interested in stars as physical objects.

Among those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was [[Norman Lockyer]], who in 1868 detected bright, as well as dark, lines in solar spectra. Working with the chemist, [[Edward Frankland]], to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements.  He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called [[helium]], after the Greek [[Helios]], the Sun personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Cortie | first = A.

In 1885, [[Edward C. Pickering]] undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at [[Harvard College Observatory]], in which a team of [[Harvard Computers|woman computers]], notably [[Williamina Fleming]], [[Antonia Maury]], and [[Annie Jump Cannon]], classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering's vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|catalog]] to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the [[Stellar classification#Harvard spectral classification|Harvard Classification Scheme]] which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hetherington |first=Norriss S. |last2=McCray |first2=W.

In 1895, [[George Ellery Hale]] and [[James E. Keeler]], along with a group of ten associate editors from Europe and the United States,&lt;ref name = Hale1895&gt;{{Citation | last = Hale | first = George Ellery | author-link = George Ellery Hale | title = The Astrophysical Journal | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–84 | bibcode = 1895ApJ.....1...80H | doi = 10.1086/140011| year = 1895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  established [[The Astrophysical Journal|''The Astrophysical Journal: An International Review of Spectroscopy and Astronomical Physics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{List journal | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope; on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics, including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption; on theories of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors, and nebulae; and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories.&lt;ref name = Hale1895/&gt;

Around 1920, following the discovery of the [[Hertsprung-Russell diagram]] still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [[nuclear fusion]] processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;

S. | author-link = Arthur Eddington | year=1916 | doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered.{{Primary source inline|reason=Paragraph needs source other than Eddington|date=September 2017}}

In 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at [[Radcliffe College]], in which she applied ionization theory to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |last=Payne |first=C.

Despite Eddington's suggestion, this discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication. However, later research confirmed her discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Haramundanis | first = Katherine | editor-last = Hockey | editor-first = Thomas | editor2-last = Trimble | editor2-first = Virginia | editor2-link = Virginia Trimble | editor3-last = Williams | editor3-first = Thomas R. | title = Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers | chapter = Payne-Gaposchkin [Payne], Cecilia Helena | accessdate = July 19, 2015 |year=2007 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-BF1CHkc50C | pages=876–878 | publisher = [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] | publication-place = New York | isbn = 978-0-387-30400-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |mode=cs2 |last=Biermann |first=Peter L. |last2=Falcke |first2=Heino |author2-link=Heino Falcke |editor-last=Panvini |editor-first=Robert S. |editor2-last=Weiler |editor2-first=Thomas J. |date=1998 |book-title=Fundamental particles and interactions: Frontiers in contemporary physics an international lecture and workshop series.

==Observational astrophysics==
[[Image:N 63A- Chandra and Hubble - Heic0507f.tif|thumb|right|200px|Supernova remnant LMC N 63A imaged in x-ray (blue), optical (green) and radio (red) wavelengths. The X-ray glow is from material heated to about ten million degrees Celsius by a shock wave generated by the supernova explosion.]]
[[Observational astronomy]] is a division of the [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[science]] that is concerned with recording data, in contrast with [[theoretical astrophysics]], which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical [[model (abstract)|model]]s. It is the practice of observing [[celestial object]]s by using [[telescope]]s and other astronomical apparatus.

The majority of astrophysical observations are made using the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

* [[Radio astronomy]] studies radiation with a [[wavelength]] greater than a few millimeters. Example areas of study are [[radio waves]], usually emitted by cold objects such as [[interstellar gas]] and dust clouds;  the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the [[redshift]]ed light from the [[Big Bang]]; [[pulsar]]s, which were first detected at [[microwave]] frequencies. The study of these waves requires very large [[radio telescope]]s.
* [[Infrared astronomy]] studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible to the naked eye but is shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the familiar [[optical]] telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.
* [[Optical astronomy]] is the oldest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a [[charge-coupled device]] or [[spectroscope]]s are the most common instruments used. The Earth's [[atmosphere]] interferes somewhat with optical observations, so [[adaptive optics]] and [[space telescope]]s are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this wavelength range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, galaxies and [[nebula]]e.
* [[Ultraviolet]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] and [[gamma ray astronomy]] study very energetic processes such as [[binary pulsar]]s, [[black hole]]s, [[magnetar]]s, and many others. These kinds of radiation do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere well. There are two methods in use to observe this part of the electromagnetic spectrum—[[space-based telescope]]s and ground-based [[imaging air Cherenkov telescope]]s (IACT). Examples of [[Observatory|Observatories]] of the first type are [[RXTE]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]]. Examples of IACTs are the [[High Energy Stereoscopic System]] (H.E.S.S.) and the [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] telescope.

Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few [[gravitational wave]] observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. [[Neutrino]] observatories have also been built, primarily to study our Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.

Observations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning [[century|centuries]] or [[millennia]]. On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale ([[millisecond pulsar]]s) or combine years of data ([[Rotation-powered pulsar|pulsar deceleration]] studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.

The study of our very own Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Our understanding of our own Sun serves as a guide to our understanding of other stars.

The topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.

==Theoretical astrophysics==
[[File:Illuminated line volume supernova.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stream lines on this simulation of a [[supernova]] show the flow of matter behind the shock wave giving clues as to the origin of pulsars]]
Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include [[mathematical model|analytical model]]s (for example, [[polytrope]]s to approximate the behaviors of a star) and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=H. |last=Roth |title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=525–529 |year=1932 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525 |bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |title=Internal Constitution of the Stars |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |origyear=1926 |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-521-33708-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include: stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')physics and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]], are the [[Big Bang]], [[cosmic inflation]], dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics. [[Wormhole]]s are examples of hypotheses which are yet to be proven (or disproven).

== Popularization ==
The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.&lt;ref name = Burtt&gt;{{Citation | last = Burtt | first = Edwin Arthur | authorlink = Edwin Arthur Burtt | publication-date = 2003 | origyear = First published 1924 | title = The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science | edition = second revised | publisher = Dover Publications | publication-place = Mineola, NY | pages = 30, 41, 241–2 | isbn = 9780486425511 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Metaphysical_Foundations_of_Modern_S.html?id=G9WBMa1Rz_kC | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics.  In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and notable [[Science education|educators]] such as prominent professors [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Hubert Reeves]], [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]. The efforts of the early, late, and present scientists continue to attract young people to study the history and science of astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=D.

Ultimately, the application of attachment theory to health care may enable health care practitioners to provide more personalized medicine by creating a deeper understanding of patient distress and allowing clinicians to better meet their needs and expectations.

==History of Attachment Theory==
{{main|History of attachment theory}} {{see also|Attachment Theory}}

===Infant attachment===
[[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed attachment theory in the 1960s while investigating the effects of [[Maternal deprivation|maternal separation]] on infant development.&lt;ref name="bretherton1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bretherton|first1=Inge|title=The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1992|volume=28|issue=5|pages=759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the [[Strange Situation]] task in 1965 by Ainsworth and Wittig allowed researchers to systematically investigate the attachment system operating between children and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mary|first1=Ainsworth|title=Patterns of attachment : a psychological study of the strange situation|date=1978|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=978-0-89859-461-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation involves separating infant-parent dyads and observing infant behaviours upon reunion. Infant behaviour tended to follow patterns, leading to the development of three attachment categories: Secure, Anxious-Avoidant, and Anxious-Resistant. In 1990, Ainsworth added a new category, championed by [[Mary Main]], called Disorganized/Disoriented attachment, characterized by its less reliable pattern of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M., &amp; Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of a new, insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern. In M. Yogman &amp; T. B. Brazelton (Eds.), Affective development in infancy (pp. 95–124). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby believed attachment to be a primary biological drive to achieve proximity with a caregiver that transforms across child development to also encompass a psychological drive to find security by achieving a preferred interpersonal distance with an important caregiver he called an attachment figure.&lt;ref name="bretherton1992" /&gt; Insecure attachment patterns develop when caregivers are experienced as inconsistent or unpredictable, which necessitates the development of different strategies to achieve a sense of comfort and safety within an interpersonal setting. Furthermore, he posited that attachment figures function as a ''secure base'' that facilitate environmental eexploration and that ''attachment behaviours'' are triggered by perceived stress, danger or pain, and are thus ''state dependent''.&lt;ref name="fonagy2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis|date=2001|publisher=Other Press|last1=Fonagy|first1=P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult attachment===
{{main|Attachment in adults}}

In the late 1980s Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult romantic relationships based on observations of the interactions between adult romantic partners.☃☃ They noticed that romantic partners often prefer to be physically close, become anxious when they are separated and that stressful situations can be buffered by the presence of a romantic partner. Three main methods of measuring adult attachment have been developed (see [[attachment measures]]), with slightly different purposes and variable amounts of concordance between them.&lt;ref name= eagle2013 /&gt; Some aim to categorize attachment style while others rate degrees of attachment anxiety and avoidance.

==Attachment Styles==
Attachment styles refer to characteristic patterns of thought concerning the ability of self and others to help an individual achieve security. Longitudinal studies have suggested attachment is fairly stable from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Weinfield2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sroufe|first2=LA|last3=Egeland|first3=B|date=2000|title=Attachment from infancy to early adulthood in a high-risk sample: continuity, discontinuity, and their correlates.|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=695–702|pmid=10953936|last1=Weinfield|first1=NS|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="waters2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Merrick|first2=S|last3=Treboux|first3=D|last4=Crowell|first4=J|last5=Albersheim|first5=L|date=2000|title=Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: a twenty-year longitudinal study|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=684–9|pmid=10953934|last1=Waters|first1=E|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When shifts do occur it is usually with good reason, with shifts away from secure attachment due to increased hardship and shifts towards secure related to finding partners in adulthood or finding symbolic attachments (God, places, pets) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=DL|last2=Needham|first2=TN|last3=Coolidge|first3=FL|title=Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment|journal=International Journal of Aging &amp; Human Development|date=2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=119–32|pmid=19960862|doi=10.2190/ag.69.2.c|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people generally have positive views about themselves and about others. They tend to agree with statements "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me."&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Horowitz|first2=LM|date=August 1991|title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–44|pmid=1920064|last1=Bartholomew|first1=K|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===
'''Anxious-preoccupied''' people tend to view themselves less positively than okthey view others. They are more likely to become highly anxious when they are away from their attachment partners and are at risk of becoming, or seeming, dependent. They tend to agree with statements such as “I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." &lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;

'''Avoidant-dismissive''' people tend to have a positive view of themselves and a less positive view of others. They often highly value independence and become uncomfortable in, or resist, situations where they become dependent on others. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is very important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." This is considered to be roughly equivalent to the anxious-avoidant style in children.&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;

'''Fearful-avoidant''' people tend to have conflicted, and often negative, views of themselves and of others. They often desire to have emotional relationships but feel uncomfortable when others get too close. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others."&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt; People with loss or trauma in childhood are at greater risk of developing this style of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byun|first1=S|last2=Brumariu|first2=LE|last3=Lyons-Ruth|first3=K|title=Disorganized Attachment in Young Adulthood as Partial Mediator of Relations Between Severity of Childhood Abuse and Dissociation |journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26836233|pmc=5004628|doi=10.1080/15299732.2016.1141149|volume=17|issue=4|pages=460–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure Attachment Styles in Healthcare Settings===

'''Anxious-Preoccupied'''
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment tend to be hypervigilant to signs of danger and to worry or catastrophize about symptoms. In health care appointments, their narrative is full of intense negative emotion but relatively sparse in the specific detail desired by health care providers. This presentation can readily be perceived as “needy” or “dramatic”. If the healthcare provider pulls away in response it may reinforce the patient’s need to articulate their distress, creating a cycle of distress-withdrawal-distress.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maunder|first1=R|last2=Hunter|first2=J|title=Love, Fear and Health: How our attachments to others shape health and health care|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=J|last2=Maunder|first2=R|title=Improving Patient Treatment with Attachment Theory: a guide for primary care providers and specialists|date=2015|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avoidant-Dismissive'''
People with avoidant dismissive attachment emphasizetheir independence and minimizing expressing distress. They may delay seeking healthcare (see healthcare utilization), minimize reporting symptoms and disclose limited personal information.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt;

'''Fearful-Disorganized'''
People with fearful attachment often avoid routine healthcare, but present in a crisis with volatile, intense, negative emotions. Due to their degree of distress, they can present a disorganized narrative that is difficult for providers to follow and interpret diagnostically.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt;

==Working Model== 
Working models are representatives of the cognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], or psychological structure (often unconscious), which underlie the different attachment classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=P|title=Structure and functions of internal working models of attachment and their role for emotion regulation|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=December 1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=291–306|pmid=11708228|doi=10.1080/14616739900134161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working models develop in children over time based on their experiences with their attachment figures. The cognitive schema for attachment consists of views of the efficacy of self and other to create security in times of distress.

===Bartholomew and Horowitz Model===
Bartholomew and Horowitz proposed and verified a working model based on two dimensions; the view of the self (self-esteem) and the view of others (sociability)&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;
*Secure- Positive view of self, Positive view of other 
*Dismissive- Positive view of self, Negative view of other
*Preoccupied- Negative view of self, Positive view of other
*Fearful- Negative view of self, Negative view of other

===Prototype-Insecurity Classification Model===
In 2012 Maunder and Hunter&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=RG|last2=Hunter|first2=JJ|title=A prototype-based model of adult attachment for clinicians|journal=Psychodynamic Psychiatry|date=December 2012|volume=40|issue=4|pages=549–73|pmid=23216396|doi=10.1521/pdps.2012.40.4.549}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined the internal working model with the attitudes, behaviours and emotional expression of the different styles to create a prototype based classification that included severity of insecurity. This model was designed to be clinically useful, allowing healthcare providers to identify and predict the behaviours of patients whose attachment systems were activated by pain and illness.

They distinguish the different attachment styles by; 1) attachment anxiety, the discomfort someone feels when separated, 2) attachment avoidance, which is discomfort associated with closeness and 3) severity of insecurity 
*Secure- Low anxiety, low avoidance, low severity of insecurity 
*Dismissive- Low anxiety, high avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Preoccupied- High anxiety, low avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Fearful- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity 
*Disorganized- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity. The difference between disorganized and fearful is that people with disorganized attachment do not use a consistent strategy to find security.

==Attachment and health outcomes==
Attachment and health interact on multiple levels. Attachment is a biologically based system tied to our response to distress and attachment styles appear to confer differences in stress physiology. Illness and pain themselves act as an “activating signal” for attachment systems, and health care providers act as attachment figures in their role addressing illness and pain. Accordingly, attachment styles influence patient perception of illness, health care utilization, medication compliance and treatment response.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feeney2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feeney|first1=J A|title=Implications of attachment style for patterns of health and illness|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|date=July 2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=277–288|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2214.2000.00146.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health===
While strong social support has been linked to greater resilience to stress and lower medical morbidity and mortality, the mechanism behind this association is poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozbay|first1=F|last2=Fitterling|first2=H|last3=Charney|first3=D|last4=Southwick|first4=S|title=Social support and resilience to stress across the life span: a neurobiologic framework|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=August 2008|volume=10|issue=4|pages=304–10|pmid=18627668|doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Paul Ciechanowski investigated the role of attachment styles in patients managing diabetes, finding that individuals with an avoidant-dismissive style were less likely to be compliant with treatment recommendations and had less well-controlled disease as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin.&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Russo|first2=J|last3=Katon|first3=W|last4=Von Korff|first4=M|last5=Ludman|first5=E|last6=Lin|first6=E|last7=Simon|first7=G|last8=Bush|first8=T|date=2004|title=Influence of patient attachment style on self-care and outcomes in diabetes|journal=Psychosomatic Medicinevolume=66|issue=5|pages=720–8|pmid=15385697|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=P|doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000138125.59122.23|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger scale evidence comes from a large American survey of self-reported attachment styles and physical illness conducted by McWilliams and Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McWilliams|first=Lachlan A.|last2=Bailey|first2=S.

Specifically, they found preoccupied individuals reported more heart disease, and dismissive individuals more pain conditions. A prospective study followed children until the age of 32 and found a similar pattern of results. They found that people with anxious-resistant (dismissive) styles of attachment reported vague, non-specific symptoms more often, and those with anxious-preoccupied classification had a higher rate of inflammation-based illnesses. This prospective study was particularly important because of the difficulty assigning causation in the often observed relationship between chronic pain and insecure attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=K.

Causal relationships between insecure attachment and mental illness may be complex.&lt;ref name="fonagy2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eagle2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt; Some risk factors for insecure attachment such as loss of parental figure, and sexual or physical abuse, are also risk factors for mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="eagle2013" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=M.|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis: Theory, research and clinical|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-report measures of attachment may be biased by mental health conditions. For example, clinical depression is often associated with negative thoughts about the self, and this cognitive bias may influence the self-report in attachment questionnaires. There may be interpersonal consequences from untreated mental health conditions. Pre-existing psychological problems can increase the likelihood of secure attachment changing to insecure attachment over time.&lt;ref name="mikulincer&amp;shaver2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaver|first2=PR|date=February 2012|title=An attachment perspective on psychopathology|journal=World Psychiatry : Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)|volume=11|issue=1|pages=11–5|pmid=22294997|last1=Mikulincer|first1=M|doi=10.1016/j.wpsyc.2012.01.003|pmc=3266769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms by which Attachment Influences Health==
Maunder and Hunter outline 3 ways in which insecure attachment can serve as a risk factor for health problems: 1) it may increase one’s susceptibility to stress by changing stress physiology, 2) it may be related to potentially harmful behaviours undertaken to regulate affect, and 3) it may change the way people interact with the healthcare system.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001" /&gt;

===Attachment and Stress===
See also: [[stress (biology)]], [[stress (psychological)]]
The stress response in humans is largely governed by the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) and [[sympathetic nervous system]]. The HPA axis has garnered particular attention from attachment researchers because it is known to be activated by social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa M.|title=Contributions of Psychophysiology to Research on Adult Attachment: Review and Recommendations|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=November 2001|volume=5|issue=4|pages=276–295|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_1|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.2676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal response for this system is to release stress hormones, particularly cortisol, for a brief duration and then shut itself off due to negative feedback, resulting in a short, strong release of cortisol. The HPA axis also follows a [[circadian rhythm]], with highest release within about 30 minutes to 1 hour upon awakening, called the cortisol response to awakening (CRA), and a slow taper throughout the day. Researchers have looked at both cortisol response to stress (CRS) and CRA to determine if attachment anxiety and avoidance underlie individual differences in HPA activity.

Findings in the field have inconsistent. The evidence suggests that (a) individuals with high attachment anxiety perceive a higher degree of distress when faced with a stressor and have higher baseline anxiety compared to those low in attachment anxiety,&lt;ref name="ditzen2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ditzen|first1=B|last2=Schmidt|first2=S|last3=Strauss|first3=B|last4=Nater|first4=UM|last5=Ehlert|first5=U|last6=Heinrichs|first6=M|title=Adult attachment and social support interact to reduce psychological but not cortisol responses to stress|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=May 2008|volume=64|issue=5|pages=479–86|pmid=18440400|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maunder2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Robert G.|last2=Lancee|first2=William J.|last3=Nolan|first3=Robert P.|last4=Hunter|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Tannenbaum|first5=David W.|title=The relationship of attachment insecurity to subjective stress and autonomic function during standardized acute stress in healthy adults|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=March 2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=283–290|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2005.08.013|pmid=16516661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidd2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Tara|last2=Hamer|first2=Mark|last3=Steptoe|first3=Andrew|title=Adult attachment style and cortisol responses across the day in older adults|journal=Psychophysiology|date=September 2013|volume=50|issue=9|pages=841–847|doi=10.1111/psyp.12075|pmid=23808770|pmc=4298031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitte2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewitte|first1=Marieke|last2=De Houwer|first2=Jan|last3=Goubert|first3=Liesbet|last4=Buysse|first4=Ann|title=A multi-modal approach to the study of attachment-related distress|journal=Biological Psychology|date=September 2010|volume=85|issue=1|pages=149–162|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.06.006|pmid=20600574|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1091912|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finding that those with fearful attachment would show small cortisol reactivity in response to a stressor may seem counterintuitive but is in line with the predictions of stress researcher [[Bruce McEwen]], who hypothesized that frequent early stressors in life would cause an initial hyper-reactivity in the HPA axis that would over time become pathologically sluggish as the individual ages, leading to greater overall cortisol release and less adaptive responsivity.&lt;ref name="mcewen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McEwen|first1=BS|title=Allostasis and allostatic load: implications for neuropsychopharmacology.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=February 2000|volume=22|issue=2|pages=108–24|pmid=10649824|doi=10.1016/s0893-133x(99)00129-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related biological system that regulates stress response is the [[autonomic nervous system]]. In general, the sympathetic system is activated during times of stress and the parasympathetic system acts to decrease physical readiness for stress. These systems are sometimes called the “fight-or-flight” and “rest-or-digest” systems, respectively, and operate in a balance, as opposed to being totally on or off. Researchers can approximate the relative balance by looking at skin conductance, blood pressure and heart rate. Studies of this kind provided hard evidence that avoidant infants were truly distressed during the strange situation task&lt;ref name="gander2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gander|first1=Manuela|last2=Buchheim|first2=Anna|title=Attachment classification, psychophysiology and frontal EEG asymmetry across the lifespan: a review|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=19 February 2015|volume=9|pages=79|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00079|pmid=25745393|pmc=4333768}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite their minimally distressed appearance as they showed elevations in heart rate when caregivers were away and took longer to return to baseline when the caregiver returned in comparison to securely attached infants. Studies of skin conductance and heart rate in adults have shown that those with avoidant attachment and anxious attachment will show markers of increased distress during attachment and non-attachment stressors compared to those securely attached.&lt;ref name="maunder2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gander2015" /&gt;

===Health behaviours===
According to attachment theory people with insecure attachment have less effective strategies for dealing with negative emotions compared to people with secure attachment. One way in which insecurely individuals may try to regulate their distress is by using strategies or behaviours that are attractive for their short term relief but may have deleterious risks over years like eating, drug use or risky sex. 
In a survey of 356 primary care patients in Toronto, rates of smoking, harmful drinking and obesity, were all found to be highest in those with the most severe anxious and avoidant attachment.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt; Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have been linked in separate studies to increasing the risk of eating disorders and substance use in adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Kearney|first1=R|title=Attachment disruption in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: a review of theory and empirical research.|journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=September 1996|volume=20|issue=2|pages=115–27|pmid=8863063|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199609)20:2&lt;115::aid-eat1&gt;3.0.co;2-j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Andreas|last2=Bröning|first2=Sonja|title=A Review on Attachment and Adolescent Substance Abuse: Empirical Evidence and Implications for Prevention and Treatment|journal=Substance Abuse|date=25 November 2014|volume=36|issue=3|pages=304–313|doi=10.1080/08897077.2014.983586|pmid=25424652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eating'''
A review of attachment and eating disorder literature in 2010 showed rates of insecure attachment to be approximately 70% in eating disorder populations in contrast to the 30-40% prevalence in the normal population.&lt;ref name="zachrisson2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zachrisson|first1=HD|last2=Skårderud|first2=F|title=Feelings of insecurity: review of attachment and eating disorders.|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|date=March 2010|volume=18|issue=2|pages=97–106|pmid=20148392|doi=10.1002/erv.999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rates are similar to those found in other mental health populations.&lt;ref name="bakermans2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakermans-Kranenburg|first1=Marian J.|last2=van IJzendoorn|first2=Marinus H.|title=The first 10,000 Adult Attachment Interviews: distributions of adult attachment representations in clinical and non-clinical groups|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=May 2009|volume=11|issue=3|pages=223–263|doi=10.1080/14616730902814762|pmid=19455453}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review noted small trends for anxious attachment to be more highly associated with binge-purging symptomatology and avoidant attachment to be more highly associated with restrictive.&lt;ref name="zachrisson2010" /&gt; The relationship between high attachment anxiety and disinhibited eating, or binge eating, has also been found in non-clinical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Han|first1=Suejung|last2=Pistole|first2=M.

'''Drug Use'''
Recreational substances provide a powerful external means of regulating affect. Insecure attachment is considered to be one of the chief psychological constructs associated with increased risk for drug use.&lt;ref name="kassel2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kassel|first1=JD|last2=Wardle|first2=M|last3=Roberts|first3=JE|title=Adult attachment security and college student substance use|journal=Addictive Behaviors|date=June 2007|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1164–76|pmid=16996225|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2006.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olsson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=Craig A.|last2=Moyzis|first2=Robert K.|last3=Williamson|first3=Elizabeth|last4=Ellis|first4=Justine A.|last5=Parkinson-Bates|first5=Mandy|last6=Patton|first6=George C.|last7=Dwyer|first7=Terry|last8=Romaniuk|first8=Helena|last9=Moore|first9=Elya E.|title=Gene-environment interaction in problematic substance use: interaction between                            and insecure attachments|journal=Addiction Biology|date=2013|volume=18|issue=4|pages=717–726|doi=10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00413.x|pmid=22126256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zeinali2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeinali|first1=A|last2=Sharifi|first2=H|last3=Enayati|first3=M|last4=Asgari|first4=P|last5=Pasha|first5=G|title=The mediational pathway among parenting styles, attachment styles and self-regulation with addiction susceptibility of adolescents|journal=Journal of Research in Medical Sciences|date=2011|volume=16|issue=9|pages=1105–21|pmid=22973379|pmc=3430035}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small study in Germany found that drug users were less likely to be secure than non-drug users and that heroine users in particular had a markedly high rate of fearful attachment.&lt;ref name="schindler2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Andreas|last2=Thomasius|first2=Rainer|last3=Petersen|first3=Kay|last4=Sack|first4=Peter-Michael|title=Heroin as an attachment substitute?

[[Jaak Panksepp]] hypothesized in the 1980s that endogenous opioids are responsible for the warm, affiliative, interpersonal feelings that come with social connection, and this has been supported by recent evidence showing that naloxone administration, an opioid blocker, results in a decreased feeling of social connection in healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inagaki|first1=Tristen K.|last2=Ray|first2=Lara A.|last3=Irwin|first3=Michael R.|last4=Way|first4=Baldwin M.|last5=Eisenberger|first5=Naomi I.|title=Opioids and social bonding: naltrexone reduces feelings of social connection|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=2016|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw006|pmid=26796966|pmc=4847702|volume=11|issue=5|pages=728–735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work also demonstrates that attachment dimensions have bearing on natural opioid signaling, with brain scans showing that those high in attachment avoidance have decreased opioid receptor availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nummenmaa|first1=Lauri|last2=Manninen|first2=Sandra|last3=Tuominen|first3=Lauri|last4=Hirvonen|first4=Jussi|last5=Kalliokoski|first5=Kari K.|last6=Nuutila|first6=Pirjo|last7=Jääskeläinen|first7=Iiro P.|last8=Hari|first8=Riitta|last9=Dunbar|first9=Robin I.M.|last10=Sams|first10=Mikko|title=Adult attachment style is associated with cerebral μ-opioid receptor availability in humans|journal=Human Brain Mapping|date=2015|volume=36|issue=9|pages=3621–3628|doi=10.1002/hbm.22866|pmid=26046928}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinical samples insecure attachment is related to higher opioid use in chronic pain patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=TE|title=Does attachment insecurity affect the outcomes of a multidisciplinary pain management program?

'''Sex'''
Risky sexual behaviour is defined as sexual contact with an increased risk of either unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection. In a study aimed at evaluating the evidence supporting six major risky sex theories, Leslie Simons and her colleagues found that only the social support and attachment theory had strong empirical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=Leslie Gordon|last2=Sutton|first2=Tara E.|last3=Simons|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Gibbons|first4=Frederick X.|last5=Murry|first5=Velma McBride|title=Mechanisms That Link Parenting Practices to Adolescents’ Risky Sexual Behavior: A Test of Six Competing Theories|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2015|volume=45|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0409-7|pmid=26718543}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the attachment theory model, risk is enhanced in insecurely attached individuals due to negative working models of relationships, reduced closeness in intimate relationships and through decreased self-control. In terms of conscious motivations for sex, attachment anxiety is related to many attachment-related motivations including using sex for desire for emotional closeness, reassurance, self-esteem enhancement, stress reduction, the experience and exertion of power, elicitation of caregiving from a partner, protection from a partner’s anger or bad moods.&lt;ref name="davis2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Deborah|last2=Shaver|first2=Phillip R.|last3=Vernon|first3=Michael L.|title=Attachment Style and Subjective Motivations for Sex|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 August 2004|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1076–1090|doi=10.1177/0146167204264794|pmid=15257790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those high in attachment avoidance report using sex for power or partner manipulation and endorse a desire to use sex as a way of avoiding emotional closeness.&lt;ref name="davis2004" /&gt; Accordingly, there is evidence that attachment avoidance is associated with positive attitudes towards casual sex, a higher number of casual sex partners, and an interest in emotionless sex and one-night stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beaulieu-Pelletier|first1=Genevieve|last2=Philippe|first2=Frederick L.|last3=Lecours|first3=Serge|last4=Couture|first4=Stéphanie|title=The role of attachment avoidance in extradyadic sex|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=2011|volume=13|issue=3|pages=293–313|doi=10.1080/14616734.2011.562419|pmid=21506032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Treatment adherence'''
Attachment insecurity also plays an important role in how people follow the advice of the healthcare community. Attachment avoidance has consistently been linked to poorer treatment adherence&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calia|first1=Rosaria|last2=Lai|first2=Carlo|last3=Aceto|first3=Paola|last4=Luciani|first4=Massimiliano|last5=Camardese|first5=Giovanni|last6=Lai|first6=Silvia|last7=Amato|first7=Giara|last8=Pietroni|first8=Valentina|last9=Salerno|first9=Maria Paola|last10=Pedroso|first10=Jose Alberto|last11=Romagnoli|first11=Jacopo|last12=Citterio|first12=Franco|title=Attachment style predict compliance, quality of life and renal function in adult patients after kidney transplant: preliminary results|journal=Renal Failure|date=2015|volume=37|issue=4|pages=678–680|doi=10.3109/0886022X.2015.1010989|pmid=25687387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=JK|last2=Fuertes|first2=JN|last3=Keitel|first3=M|last4=Phillips|first4=R|title=The role of patient attachment and working alliance on patient adherence, satisfaction, and health-related quality of life in lupus treatment|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=2011|volume=85|issue=1|pages=53–9|pmid=20869188|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently to no shows in scheduled follow up appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sockalingam|first1=Sanjeev|last2=Cassin|first2=Stephanie|last3=Hawa|first3=Raed|last4=Khan|first4=Attia|last5=Wnuk|first5=Susan|last6=Jackson|first6=Timothy|last7=Okrainec|first7=Allan|title=Predictors of Post-bariatric Surgery Appointment Attendance: the Role of Relationship Style|journal=Obesity Surgery|date=2013|volume=23|issue=12|pages=2026–2032|doi=10.1007/s11695-013-1009-9|pmid=23757051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment avoidance has also been linked to lower rates of cervical cancer screening in both American and Iranian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=EM|last2=Gick|first2=ML|title=Attachment and barriers to cervical screening|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|date=2013|volume=18|issue=5|pages=648–57|pmid=22933580|doi=10.1177/1359105312454910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajializadeh|first1=K|last2=Ahadi|first2=H|last3=Jomehri|first3=F|last4=Rahgozar|first4=M|title=Psychosocial predictors of barriers to cervical cancer screening among Iranian women: the role of attachment style and social demographic factors|journal=Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene|date=2013|volume=54|issue=4|pages=218–22|pmid=24779284|pmc=4718322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare utilization===
Attachment theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance and people high in attachment anxiety would display different utilization of health care resources based on their prototypical behavioural responses when stressed.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt; The theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance, when faced with an illness, are likely to minimize their symptoms, and wait longer to see a health care provider, since they view their own distress as a sign of unacceptable vulnerability and also because their internal working model dictates that other people are not useful in helping them manage distress. For those high in attachment anxiety, they would have higher distress when faced with an illness, less perceived ability to manage it on their own, and thus visit health care services more frequently to try to attain security. For those with high anxiety and high avoidance, or fearful attachment, they would be predicted to present less frequently than those with secure attachment, but show up in a crisis when they do, which may interfere with optimal care. Research findings have generally been supportive of these predictions. One of the earliest studies in the field found correlations between preoccupied attachment and increased symptom reporting and an inverse relationship between avoidant attachment and visits to health professionals.&lt;ref name="feeney&amp;ryan1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ryan|first2=SM|date=July 1994|title=Attachment style and affect regulation: relationships with health behavior and family experiences of illness in a student sample|journal=Health Psychology : Official Journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association|volume=13|issue=4|pages=334–45|pmid=7957012|last1=Feeney|first1=JA|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.13.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt; High attachment anxiety has been associated with increased symptom reporting and visits to healthcare providers,&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Katon|first2=WJ|last3=Russo|first3=JE|last4=Walker|first4=EA|date=January 2001|title=The patient-provider relationship: attachment theory and adherence to treatment in diabetes.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=1|pages=29–35|pmid=11136630|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=PS|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.1.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high attachment avoidance associated with less visits and decreased treatment compliance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=RE|last2=Marshall|first2=T|last3=Mann|first3=A|last4=Goldberg|first4=DP|title=Insecure attachment and frequent attendance in primary care: a longitudinal cohort study of medically unexplained symptom presentations in ten UK general practices.|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=2012|volume=42|issue=4|pages=855–64|pmid=21880165|doi=10.1017/s0033291711001589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2458">The '''Australian Plant Census''' (APC) provides an online interface to currently accepted, published, scientific names of the vascular flora of Australia, as one of the output interfaces of the national government Integrated Biodiversity Information System (IBIS – an [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle Co.]] [[relational database management system]]). The [[Australian National Herbarium]], [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]], [[Australian Biological Resources Study]] and the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria coordinate the system.

The Australian Plant Census interface provides the currently accepted scientific names, their synonyms, illegitimate, misapplied and excluded names, as well as state distribution data. Each item of output hyperlinks to other online interfaces of the information system, including the [[Australian Plant Name Index]] (APNI) and the [[Australian Plant Image Index]] (APII).&lt;ref name=CSIRO/&gt; The outputs of the Australian Plant Census interface provide information on all native and naturalised vascular plant [[Taxon|taxa]] of Australia, including its offshore islands, but excludes taxa only known in Australia from their cultivation and not (yet) naturalised.&lt;ref name=APC/&gt;

The classification of plant families is based on the [[APG III system|Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III system]] (2009).&lt;ref name=APCprogress/&gt;

'''Bioelectromagnetics''', also known as '''bioelectromagnetism''', is the study of the interaction between [[electromagnetic field]]s and biological entities. Areas of study include [[Electric field|electrical]] or electromagnetic fields produced by living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[biological tissue|tissue]]s or [[organism]]s, including [[bioluminescent bacteria]]; for example, the cell [[membrane potential]] and the [[electric current]]s that flow in [[nerve]]s and [[muscle]]s, as a result of [[action potential]]s. Others include [[animal navigation]] utilizing the geomagnetic field; the effects of man-made sources of electromagnetic fields like [[mobile phone]]s; and developing new therapies to treat various conditions. The term can also refer to the ability of living cells, tissues, and organisms to produce electrical fields and the response of cells to electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malmivuo |first=Jaakko |first2=Robert |last2=Plonsey |title=Bioelectromagnetism: principles and applications of bioelectric and biomagnetic fields |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-505823-9 }}{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-lived electrical events called [[action potentials]] occur in several types of animal cells which are called excitable cells, a category of cell include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. These action potentials are used to facilitate inter-cellular communication and activate intracellular processes. The physiological phenomena of action potentials are possible because [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s allow the resting potential caused by [[electrochemical gradient]] on either side of a cell membrane to resolve.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Bioelectromagnetism is studied primarily through the techniques of [[electrophysiology]]. In the late eighteenth century, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[physician]] and [[physicist]] [[Luigi Galvani]] first recorded the phenomenon while dissecting a [[frog]] at a table where he had been conducting experiments with [[static electricity]]. Galvani coined the term ''animal electricity'' to describe the phenomenon, while contemporaries labeled it [[galvanism]]. Galvani and contemporaries regarded muscle activation as resulting from an electrical fluid or substance in the [[nerve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Myers |first=Richard |title=The basics of chemistry |year=2003 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-31664-7 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some usually aquatic animals, such as sharks, have acute bioelectric sensors providing a sense known as [[electroreception]], while migratory [[bird]]s navigate in part by orienteering with respect to the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. In an extreme application of electromagnetism the [[electric eel]] is able to generate a large electric field outside its body used for hunting and self-defense through a dedicated [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Thermal effects==
Most of the molecules in the human body interact weakly with [[electromagnetic fields]] in the [[radio frequency]] or [[extremely low frequency]] bands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One such interaction is absorption of energy from the fields, which can cause tissue to heat up; more intense fields will produce greater heating. This can lead to biological effects ranging from muscle relaxation (as produced by a [[diathermy]] device) to burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hazards of the MR Environment |publisher=Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging
 |url=http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/userInfo/safety/safetyHazards.php |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations and regulatory bodies like the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection have established safety guidelines to limit EMF exposure to a non-thermal level. This can be defined as either heating only to the point where the excess heat can be dissipated, or as a fixed increase in temperature not detectable with current instruments like 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, biological effects have been shown to be present for these non-thermal exposures;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain these,&lt;ref&gt;Binhi, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and there may be several mechanisms  underlying the differing phenomena observed. Biological effects of weak electromagnetic fields are the subject of study in [[magnetobiology]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Behavioral effects==
Many behavioral effects at different intensities have been reported from exposure to magnetic fields, particularly with pulsed magnetic fields. The specific pulseform used appears to be an important factor for the behavioural effect seen; for example, a pulsed magnetic field originally designed for spectroscopic [[MRI]], referred to as [[Low Field Magnetic Stimulation]], was found to temporarily improve patient-reported mood in bipolar patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.1.93 |pmid=14702256 |title=Low-Field Magnetic Stimulation in Bipolar Depression Using an MRI-Based Stimulator |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=1 |pages=93–8 |year=2004 |last1=Rohan |first1=Michael |last2=Parow |first2=Aimee |last3=Stoll |first3=Andrew L |last4=Demopulos |first4=Christina |last5=Friedman |first5=Seth |last6=Dager |first6=Stephen |last7=Hennen |first7=John |last8=Cohen |first8=Bruce M |last9=Renshaw |first9=Perry F }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another MRI pulse had no effect. A whole-body exposure to a pulsed magnetic field was found to alter standing balance and pain perception in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=A.W|author2=White, K.P |author3=Drost, D.J |author4=Cook, C.M |author5= Prato, F.S |title=A comparison of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls exposed to a pulsed (200 μT) magnetic field: effects on normal standing balance|journal=Neuroscience Letters|year=2001|volume=309|issue=1|pages=17–20|doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(01)02009-2|pmid=11489536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shupak|first=Naomi M|author2=Prato, Frank S |author3=Thomas, Alex W |title=Human exposure to a specific pulsed magnetic field: effects on thermal sensory and pain thresholds|journal=Neuroscience Letters|year=2004|volume=363|issue=2|pages=157–162|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2004.03.069|pmid=15172106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TMS and related effects==
{{main|Transcranial magnetic stimulation}}
A strong changing magnetic field can induce electrical currents in conductive tissue such as the brain. Since the magnetic field penetrates tissue, it can be generated outside of the head to induce currents within, causing [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). These currents depolarize neurons in a selected part of the brain, leading to changes in the patterns of neural activity. In repeated pulse TMS therapy or rTMS, the presence of incompatible EEG electrodes can result in electrode heating and, in severe cases, skin burns.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0168-5597(92)90077-O |pmid=1373364 |title=The heating of metal electrodes during rapid-rate magnetic stimulation: A possible safety hazard |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Evoked Potentials Section |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=116–23 |year=1992 |last1=Roth |first1=Bradley J |last2=Pascual-Leone |first2=Alvaro |last3=Cohen |first3=Leonardo G |last4=Hallett |first4=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scientists and clinicians are attempting to use TMS to replace [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) to treat disorders such as severe depression. Instead of one strong electric shock through the head as in ECT, a large number of relatively weak pulses are delivered in TMS therapy, typically at the rate of about 10 pulses per second. If very strong pulses at a rapid rate are delivered to the brain, the induced currents can cause convulsions much like in the original [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=Wassermann1998&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0168-5597(97)00096-8 |pmid=9474057 |title=Risk and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: Report and suggested guidelines from the International Workshop on the Safety of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, June 5–7, 1996 |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Evoked Potentials Section |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=1998 |last1=Wassermann |first1=Eric M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Rossi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016 |pmid=19833552 |pmc=3260536 |title=Safety, ethical considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=2008–39 |year=2009 |last1=Rossi |first1=Simone |last2=Hallett |first2=Mark |last3=Rossini |first3=Paolo M |last4=Pascual-Leone |first4=Alvaro |hdl=11572/145680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, this is done deliberately in order to treat depression, such as in ECT.

==Health effects==
While health effects from extremely low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields (0 to 300&amp;nbsp;Hz) generated by power lines, and radio/microwave frequencies (RF) (10&amp;nbsp;MHz - 300&amp;nbsp;GHz)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000093061 |pmid=16804297 |title=Effects of Electromagnetic Fields on Cells: Physiological and Therapeutical Approaches and Molecular Mechanisms of Interaction |journal=Cells Tissues Organs |volume=182 |issue=2 |pages=59–78 |year=2006 |last1=Funk |first1=Richard H.W |last2=Monsees |first2=Thomas K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfv205 |pmid=26396154 |title=2.45 GHz Microwave Radiation Impairs Learning and Spatial Memory via Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress Induced p53-Dependent/Independent Hippocampal Apoptosis: Molecular Basis and Underlying Mechanism |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=380–99 |year=2015 |last1=Shahin |first1=Saba |last2=Banerjee |first2=Somanshu |last3=Singh |first3=Surya Pal |last4=Chaturvedi |first4=Chandra Mohini }}&lt;/ref&gt; emitted by radio antennas and wireless networks have been well studied, the intermediate range (IR) used increasingly in modern telecommunications (300&amp;nbsp;Hz to 10 MHz) has been studied far less.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Direct effects of electromagnetism on human health have been difficult to prove, and documented life-threatening interferences from electromagnetic fields are limited to medical devices such as pacemakers and other electronic implants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/intmedfrequencies/en/ Electromagnetic fields &amp; public health: Intermediate Frequencies (IF). Information sheet February 2005. World Health Organization.] Retrieved Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of studies have been conducted with artificial [[magnetic fields]] and [[electric fields]] to investigate their effects on cell metabolism, [[apoptosis]], and tumor growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bem.20361 |pmid=17786977 |title=Direct current electrical fields induce apoptosis in oral mucosa cancer cells by NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |year=2008 |last1=Wartenberg |first1=Maria |last2=Wirtz |first2=Nina |last3=Grob |first3=Alexander |last4=Niedermeier |first4=Wilhelm |last5=Hescheler |first5=Jürgen |last6=Peters |first6=Saskia C |last7=Sauer |first7=Heinrich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electromagnetic radiation in the intermediate frequency range has found a place in modern medical practice for the treatment of bone healing and for nerve stimulation and regeneration. It is also approved as cancer therapy in form of [[Tumor Treating Fields]], using alternating electric fields in the frequency range of 100–300&amp;nbsp;kHz.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Since some of these methods involve magnetic fields that invoke electric currents in biological tissues and others only involve electric fields, they are strictly speaking [[electrotherapy|electrotherapies]] albeit their application modi with modern electronic equipment have placed them in the category of bioelectromagnetic interactions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Byzantine fault tolerance''' ('''BFT''') is the dependability of a [[fault-tolerant computer system]], particularly [[distributed computing]] systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed. In a "Byzantine failure", a component such as a [[Server (computing)|server]] can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure-detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. 

It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]] regarding which component has failed in the first place. The term is derived from the [[#Byzantine Generals' Problem|Byzantine Generals' Problem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamport | first1 = L. | authorlink1 = Leslie Lamport| last2 = Shostak | first2 = R. | last3 = Pease | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/357172.357176 | title = The Byzantine Generals Problem | journal = ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 382&amp;ndash;401 | year = 1982 | url = https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Fbyz.pdf | dead-url = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180613015025/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Fbyz.pdf | archivedate = 13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, but some of the actors are unreliable. Byzantine fault tolerance has been also referred to with the phrases '''interactive consistency''' or '''source congruency''', '''error avalanche''', '''Byzantine agreement problem''', '''Byzantine generals problem''', and '''Byzantine failure'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamspeople.epfl.ch/kirrmann/Pubs/FaultTolerance/Fault_Tolerance_Tutorial_HK.pdf#page=94

==Background==
A Byzantine fault is any fault presenting different symptoms to different observers.&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Driscoll| first1=K.| last2=Hall| first2=B.| last3=Paulitsch| first3=M.| last4=Zumsteg| first4=P. |last5=Sivencrona| first5=H.| title=The Real Byzantine Generals| year=2004| pages=6.D.4–61-11| doi=10.1109/DASC.2004.1390734}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Byzantine failure is the loss of a system service due to a Byzantine fault in systems that require [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]].&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2003"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Driscoll| first1=Kevin| last2=Hall| first2=Brendan| last3=Sivencrona| first3=Håkan| last4=Zumsteg| first4=Phil
| title=Byzantine Fault Tolerance, from Theory to Reality| volume=2788| year=2003| pages=235–248| issn=0302-9743| doi=10.1007/978-3-540-39878-3_19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of Byzantine fault tolerance is to be able to defend against failures of system components with or without symptoms that prevent other components of the system from reaching an agreement among themselves, where such an agreement is needed for the correct operation of the system.

Remaining correctly operational components of a Byzantine fault tolerant system will be able to continue providing the system's service as originally intended, assuming there are sufficiently many accurately operating components to maintain the service.

Byzantine failures are considered the most general and most difficult class of failures among the [[Failure cause|failure modes]]. The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas fail-stop failure mode simply means that the only way to fail is a [[Node (computer science)|node]] crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions, which means that the failed node can generate arbitrary data, pretending to be a correct one. Thus, Byzantine failures can confuse failure detection systems, which makes fault tolerance difficult. Despite the analogy, a Byzantine failure is not necessarily a [[security]] problem involving hostile human interference: it can arise purely from electrical faults.

The terms fault and failure are used here according to the standard definitions&lt;ref name="AvizienisLaprie2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Avizienis
| first1=A.| last2=Laprie| first2=J.-C.| last3=Randell| first3=Brian| author-link3=Brian Randell| last4=Landwehr| first4=C.| title=Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing| journal=IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing| volume=1| issue=1| year=2004| pages=11–33| issn=1545-5971
| doi=10.1109/TDSC.2004.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally created by a joint committee on "Fundamental Concepts and Terminology" formed by the [[IEEE]] Computer Society's Technical Committee on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerance and [[IFIP]] Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance| url = http://www.dependability.org| accessdate = 2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of these definitions is also described in the [[Dependability]] Wikipedia page.

==Byzantine Generals' Problem==
''Byzantine'' refers to the Byzantine Generals' Problem, an agreement problem (described by [[Leslie Lamport]], Robert Shostak and Marshall Pease in their 1982 paper, "The Byzantine Generals Problem")&lt;ref name=BGP_Paper /&gt; in which a group of generals, each commanding a portion of the [[Byzantine army]], encircle a city.  These generals wish to formulate a plan for attacking the city.  In its simplest form, the generals must decide only whether to attack or retreat.  Some generals may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat.  The important thing is that every general agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a [[rout]], and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

The problem is complicated by the presence of treacherous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so selectively.  For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest.  Those who received a retreat vote from the ninth general will retreat, while the rest will attack (which may not go well for the attackers).  The problem is complicated further by the generals being physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.

Byzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if the loyal (non-faulty) generals have a majority agreement on their strategy.  There can be a default vote value given to missing messages.  For example, missing messages can be given the value &amp;lt;Null&amp;gt;.  Further, if the agreement is that the &amp;lt;Null&amp;gt; votes are in the majority, a pre-assigned default strategy can be used (e.g., retreat).&lt;ref name=BGP_Paper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamport | first1 = L. | authorlink1 = Leslie Lamport| last2 = Shostak | first2 = R. | last3 = Pease | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/357172.357176 | title = The Byzantine Generals Problem | journal = ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 387&amp;ndash;389 | year=1982 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170207104645/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf | archivedate = 7 February 2017 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical mapping of this story onto computer systems is that the computers are the generals and their digital communication system links are the messengers. Although the problem is formulated in the analogy as a decision-making and security problem, in electronics, it cannot be solved simply by [[cryptographic]] [[digital signature]]s, because failures such as incorrect voltages can propagate through the encryption process. Thus, a component may appear functioning to one component and faulty to another, which prevents forming a consensus whether the component is faulty or not.

==Examples of Byzantine failures==
Several examples of Byzantine failures that have occurred are given in two equivalent journal papers.&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2003" /&gt; These and other examples are described on the [[NASA]] DASHlink web pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These web pages also describe some phenomenology that can cause Byzantine faults.

Byzantine errors were observed infrequently and at irregular points during endurance testing for the newly constructed [[Virginia-class submarine|''Virginia'' class submarines]], at least through 2005 (when the issues were publicly reported).&lt;ref name="WalterEllis2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walter|first1=C.|last2=Ellis|first2=P.|last3=LaValley|first3=B.|title=The Reliable Platform Service: A Property-Based Fault Tolerant Service Architecture|year=2005|pages=34–43|doi=10.1109/HASE.2005.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem faces honeybee swarms. They have to find a new home, and the many scouts and wider participants have to reach consensus about which of perhaps several candidate homes to fly to. And then they all have to fly there, with their queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/587249075|title=Honeybee democracy|last=D.|first=Seeley, Thomas|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691147215|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=587249075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early solutions==
Several solutions were described by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in 1982.&lt;ref name=BGP_Paper/&gt; They began by noting that the Generals' Problem can be reduced to solving a "Commander and Lieutenants" problem where loyal Lieutenants must all act in unison and that their action must correspond to what the Commander ordered in the case that the Commander is loyal.
* One solution considers scenarios in which messages may be forged, but which will be ''Byzantine-fault-tolerant'' as long as the number of traitorous generals does not equal or exceed one third of the generals. The impossibility of dealing with one-third or more traitors ultimately reduces to proving that the one Commander and two Lieutenants problem cannot be solved, if the Commander is traitorous. To see this, suppose we have a traitorous Commander A, and two Lieutenants, B and C:  when A tells B to attack and C to retreat, and B and C send messages to each other, forwarding A's message, neither B nor C can figure out who is the traitor, since it is not necessarily A—another Lieutenant could have forged the message purportedly from A. It can be shown that if ''n'' is the number of generals in total, and ''t'' is the number of traitors in that ''n'', then there are solutions to the problem only when ''n'' &amp;gt; 3''t'' and the communication is synchronous (bounded delay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* A second solution requires unforgeable message signatures.  For [[Critical system#Security critical|security-critical systems]], [[digital signature]]s (in modern computer systems, this may be achieved in practice using [[public-key cryptography]]) can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in the presence of an arbitrary number of traitorous generals.  However, for [[safety-critical system]]s (where "security" addresses intelligent threats while "safety" addresses the inherent dangers of an activity or mission), simple error detecting codes, such as [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRCs]], provide weaker but often sufficient coverage at a much lower cost.  This is true for both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. Furthermore, sometimes security measures weaken safety and vice versa--Thus, cryptographic digital signature methods are not a good choice for safety-critical systems, unless there is also a specific security threat as well.&lt;ref name="PaulitschMorris2005"&gt;{{cite journal

This is illustrated by the ''Schrödinger CRC'' scenario where a CRC-protected message with a single Byzantine faulty bit presents different data to different observers and each observer sees a valid CRC.&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2003" /&gt;
* Also presented is a variation on the first two solutions allowing Byzantine-fault-tolerant behavior in some situations where not all generals can communicate directly with each other.

Several system architectures were designed c. 1980 that implemented Byzantine fault tolerance.  These include: Draper's FTMP,&lt;ref name="HopkinsLala1987"&gt;

==Software==
UpRight&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/upright/ UpRight]. Google Code repository for the UpRight replication library.&lt;/ref&gt; is an open source library for constructing services that tolerate both crashes ("up") and Byzantine behaviors ("right") that incorporates many of these protocols' innovations.

In addition to PBFT and UpRight, there is the BFT-SMaRt library,&lt;ref&gt;[https://bft-smart.github.io/library/ BFT-SMaRt]. Google Code
repository for the BFT-SMaRt replication library.&lt;/ref&gt; a high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication library developed in Java. This library implements a protocol very similar to PBFT's, plus complementary protocols which offer state transfer and on-the-fly reconfiguration of hosts. BFT-SMaRt is the most recent effort to implement state machine replication, still being actively maintained.

[[Archistar]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/Archistar/archistar-core Archistar]. github repository for the Archistar project.&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes a slim BFT layer&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/Archistar/archistar-bft Archistar-bft BFT state-machine]. github repository for the Archistar project.&lt;/ref&gt; for communication. It prototypes a secure multi-cloud storage system using Java licensed under LGPLv2. Focus lies on simplicity and readability, it aims to be the foundation for further research projects.

Askemos&lt;ref&gt;[http://ball.askemos.org/ Askemos/BALL] project home page&lt;/ref&gt;  is a concurrent, garbage-collected, persistent programming platform atop of replicated state machines which tolerates Byzantine faults. It prototypes an execution environment facilitating [[Smart contracts]].

Tendermint&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint Tendermint] github repository for the Tendermint project&lt;/ref&gt; is general purpose software for BFT state machine replication. Using a socket protocol, it enables state machines to be written in any programming language, and provides
means for the state machine to influence elements of the consensus, such as the list of active processes. Tendermint is implemented in the style of a [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]], which amortizes the overhead of BFT and allows for faster recovery from failure.

==Product implementations==
One example of BFT in use is [[bitcoin]], a peer-to-peer digital cash system{{Citation needed|reason=Is there a proof that blockchain is BFT? |date=August 2018}}. The [[bitcoin network]] works in parallel to generate a [[blockchain]] with [[proof-of-work]] allowing the system to overcome Byzantine failures and reach a coherent global view of the system's state.

and the Boeing 787 flight control systems use Byzantine fault tolerance;  because these are real-time systems, their Byzantine fault tolerance solutions must have very low latency.  For example, SAFEbus can achieve Byzantine fault tolerance within the order of a microsecond of added latency.

Some spacecraft flight systems such as that of the [[SpaceX Dragon]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/540368/ ELC: SpaceX lessons learned [LWN.net&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; consider Byzantine fault tolerance in their design.

Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms use components that repeat an incoming message (or just its signature) to other recipients of that incoming message.  All these mechanisms make the assumption that the act of repeating a message blocks the propagation of Byzantine symptoms.  For systems that have a high degree of safety or security criticality, these assumptions must be proven to be true to an acceptable level of [[fault coverage]].  When providing proof through testing, one difficulty is creating a sufficiently wide range of signals with Byzantine symptoms.&lt;ref name="NanyaGoosen1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nanya|first1=T.|last2=Goosen|first2=H.A.|title=The Byzantine hardware fault model|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems|volume=8|issue=11|year=1989|pages=1226–1231|issn=0278-0070|doi=10.1109/43.41508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such testing likely will require specialized fault injectors.&lt;ref name="MartinsGandhi2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martins|first1=Rolando|last2=Gandhi|first2=Rajeev|last3=Narasimhan|first3=Priya|last4=Pertet|first4=Soila|last5=Casimiro|first5=António|last6=Kreutz|first6=Diego|last7=Veríssimo|first7=Paulo|title=Experiences with Fault-Injection in a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Protocol|volume=8275|year=2013|pages=41–61|issn=0302-9743|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45065-5_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

The '''Carnac stones''' ([[Breton language|Breton]]: ''Steudadoù Karnag'') are an exceptionally dense collection of [[megalith]]ic sites around the village of [[Carnac]] in [[Brittany]], consisting of [[stone row|alignments]], [[dolmen]]s, [[tumulus|tumuli]] and single [[menhir]]s. More than 3,000 [[prehistoric]] [[standing stone]]s were hewn from local [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and erected by the pre-[[Celts|Celtic]] people of [[Brittany]], and form the largest such collection in the world.&lt;ref name="Menhir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menhirs.tripod.com/intro.html |title=Megaliths of Carnac: Introduction |publisher=menhirs.tripod.com |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stones are within the Breton village of [[Carnac]], but some to the east are within [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]]. The stones were erected at some stage during the [[Neolithic]] period, probably around [[33rd century BCE|3300 BCE]], but some may date to as early as 4500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/carnac-stones.htm| title=Carnac Stones, Brittany| publisher=Sacred Destinations Travel Guide| accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the stones date from 4500 BCE, modern myths were formed which resulted from 1st century AD [[Roman Gaul|Roman]] and later Christian occupations. A Christian myth associated with the stones held that they were pagan soldiers in pursuit of [[Pope Cornelius]] when he turned them to stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.therecord.com/Life/Travel/article/320293 |title=TheRecord.com - Travel - Marvelling at Carnac's stones |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceholidays.co.uk/france_holidays/brittany.php |title=France Holidays, Brittany |publisher=Franceholidays.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/why-are-carnac-stones-called-megaliths |title=Why are Carnac Stones Called Megaliths? |publisher=Big Site of Amazing Facts  |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany has its own local versions of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] cycle. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a [[Roman legion]] turned to stone by [[Merlin]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====''Kerlescan'' alignments====
[[File:Kerlescan.JPG|thumb|left|Model of the ''Kerlescan'' alignment]]
A smaller group of 555 stones, further to the east of the other two sites. It is composed of 13 lines with a total length of about {{convert|800|m|ft|}}, ranging in height from {{convert|80|cm|ftin|lk=on|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|m|ft||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="dino"/&gt; At the extreme west, where the stones are tallest, there is a [[stone circle]] which has 39 stones.

A much smaller group, further east again of Kerlescan, falling within the commune of [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]]. These are now set in woods, and most are covered with moss and ivy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/petit_menec.htm |title=Petit Ménec |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66adtG0Vq?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/petit_menec.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tumuli===
There are several [[tumulus|tumuli]], mounds of earth built up over a grave. In this area, they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts.

[[File:tumulus carnac.jpg|thumbnail|''Tumulus of Saint-Michel'']]
;Saint-Michel:{{Main article|Saint-Michel tumulus}}The [[tumulus]] of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000&amp;nbsp;BC and 3400&amp;nbsp;BC. At its base it is {{convert|125|by|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.  It required {{convert|35000|m3|cuyd}} of stone and earth.  Its function was the same as that of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]]: a tomb for the members of the ruling class.  It contained various funerary objects, such as 15 stone chests, pottery, jewellery, most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ot-carnac.fr/version_anglaise/histoire_alignement.php  |title=Office de Tourisme de Carnac |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-07-03 |accessdate=2009-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060703063525/http://www.ot-carnac.fr/version_anglaise/histoire_alignement.php |archivedate = 2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was excavated in 1862 by [[René Galles]] with a series of vertical pits, digging down {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Le Rouzic also excavated it between 1900 and 1907 discovering the tomb and the stone chests.&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{cite web |author=Annick Jacq |url=http://www.bretagne-celtic.com/carte_carnac.htm |title=Carnac |publisher=Bretagne-celtic.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66adtkqCc?url=http://www.bretagne-celtic.com/carte_carnac.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813, before being destroyed in 1923.  The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel, built in 1926. &lt;!-- according to tourist office info, the chapel was built in 1664, also refers to this extra reconstruction "vers 1813" --&gt;

Also known as ''Er Mané'', it is a [[chamber tomb]] {{convert|85|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. It has a dolmen at the west end, and two tombs at the east end.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; A small menhir, approximately {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, is nearby.

===Dolmens===
[[File:Dolmen Roch-Feutet.JPG|thumb|The dolmen Er-Roc'h-Feutet. An inscription next to every standing stone formation proclaims ownership by the state of France.]]
 
There are several [[dolmen]]s scattered around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, in various states of ruin.
;''Er-Roc'h-Feutet'': North, near the Chapelle de La Madeleine. Has a completely covered roof.
;''La Madeleine'' &lt;small&gt;{{coord|47.6208|N|3.0482|W|type:landmark}}&lt;/small&gt;:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178 |title=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: La Madeleine (Carnac) Burial Chamber (Dolmen) |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66aduXnp6?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178 |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large dolmen measuring {{convert|12|by|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long broken capstone.&lt;ref name="megalithic 9178"/&gt; It is named after the nearby Chapelle de La Madeleine, which is still used.
[[File:Tumulus de Kercado 2005 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Dolmen of Kercado'''. Though smaller than St. Michel, older by many centuries before 4800 BC]]
;''Kercado'': A rare dolmen still covered by its original [[cairn]]. South of the Kermario alignments, it is {{convert|25|to(-)|30|m|ft}} wide, {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and has a small menhir on top. Previously surrounded by a circle of small menhirs {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} out,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; the main passage is {{convert|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and leads to a large chamber where numerous artifacts were found, including axes, arrowheads, some animal and human teeth, some pearls and [[sherd]]s, and 26 beads of a unique bluish [[Nephrite]] gem. It has some [[Megalithic art]] carved on its inner surfaces in the form of serpentines and a human-sized double-axe symbol carved in the underside of its main roof slab. In ancient cultures, the axe and more precisely the [[Labrys|bi-pennis]] used to represent the lightning powers of divinity. It was constructed around 4600&amp;nbsp;BC and used for approximately 3,000 years.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

;''Mané Brizil''
;''Kerlescan'':A roughly rectangular mound, with only one [[Caprock|capstone]] remaining. It is aligned east-to-west, with a passage entrance to the south.&lt;ref name="tiscali kerlescan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/kerlescan.htm |title=Kerlescan |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66adsjbqU?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/kerlescan.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;''Kermarquer'': On a small hill, has two separate chambers.
;''Mané-Kerioned'' (Pixies' mound or ''Grotte de Grionnec''&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;):A group of three dolmens with layout unique in Brittany,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;  once covered by a tumulus. Whereas most groups of dolmens are parallel, these are arranged in a [[horseshoe]]. The largest of the three is at the east, {{convert|11|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt;
[[File:Crucuno dolmen.jpg|thumb|right| The Crucuno dolmen]]
;''Crucuno'':A "classic" dolmen, with a {{convert|40|tonne|short ton|lk=on|adj=on}}, {{convert|7.6|m|ftin|adj=on}} tablestone resting on pillars roughly {{convert|1.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high. Prior to 1900, it was connected by a passage making it {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;
;''Crucuno stone rectangle'' &lt;small&gt;{{coord|47.625|N|3.121667|W|type:landmark}}&lt;/small&gt;: A classic 3, 4, 5 rectangle of 21 [[menhir]]s varying in height from {{convert|0.91|m|ft}} to {{convert|2.4|m|ft}} that is aligned along its diagonal to the midsummer sunrise. [[Alexander Thom]] suggested it measured forty by thirty of his [[megalithic yard]]s.&lt;ref name="ThomThom1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexander Thom|author2=Archibald Stevenson Thom|title=Megalithic remains in Britain and Brittany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbTeKi00QH0C|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-858156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other formations===
[[File:QuadrilatereduManio.JPG|thumb|left|The Manio quadrilateral arrangement.]]
[[File:Carnac Geant du Manio.jpg|thumb|upright|The Manio "Giant".]]
There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories.
;''Manio'' quadrilateral: An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle. Originally a "tertre tumulus" with a central mound, it is {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and aligned to east of northeast. The quadrilateral is {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide to the east, but only {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide at the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/manio_quadrilateral.htm |title=Manio Quadrilateral |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66advg6GF?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/manio_quadrilateral.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir, now known as the "Giant". Over {{convert|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}  tall, it was re-erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/geant_de_manio.htm |title=Géant de Manio |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024131838/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/geant_de_manio.htm |archivedate=2007-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation and analysis==
[[File:Menec Single.JPG|thumb|left|Large upright in the ''Ménec'' alignment]]
From the 1720s increasing interest was shown in these features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/megalithes/en/mega/megacarhis_en.htm Astonishing Heaps of Stones]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, for example, [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne|La Tour d'Auvergne]] attributed them to [[druid]]ic gatherings.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; In 1805, A. Maudet de Penhoët claimed they represented stars in the sky.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

Englishmen [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[Alexander Blair (writer)|Alexander Blair]] made a detailed survey of the stones in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronalds created the first accurate drawings of many of them with his patented [[perspective machine|perspective tracing instrument]], which were printed in a book ''Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sketches_at_Carnac_Brittany_in_1834.html?id=HuA-AAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834|last=Blair and Ronalds|first=|date=1836|website=Google Books|publisher=|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miln and Le Rouzic===
The first extensive excavation was performed in the 1860s by Scottish antiquary [[James Miln]] (1819–1881), who reported that by then fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing.&lt;ref name="ml"&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410728 The Independent: Bretons fight for Carnac to stay in the Stone Age] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66adqwmsr?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410728 |date=2012-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards 1875, Miln engaged a local boy, {{Interlanguage link multi|Zacharie Le Rouzic|fr}} (1864–1939), as his assistant, and Zacharie learnt archaeology on the job. After Miln's death, he left the results of his excavations to the town of Carnac, and the ''James Miln Museum'' was established there by his brother Robert to house the artifacts. Zacharie became the director of the Museum and, although self-taught, became an internationally recognised expert on megaliths in the region. He too left the results of his work to the town, and the museum is now named ''Le Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic''.&lt;ref name=megalithia&gt;[http://www.megalithia.com/brittany/carnac/ Carnac&amp;nbsp;— Megalithic alignments of standing stones.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=museedecarnac&gt;[http://www.museedecarnac.com/musee_carnac.htm Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517075032/http://www.museedecarnac.com/musee_carnac.htm |date=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
[[File:Carnac Ménec alignments.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The ''Ménec'' alignments of some 1,100 stones in 11 columns.]]
In 1887, H. de Cleuziou argued for a connection between the rows of stones and the directions of sunsets at the solstices.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

Among more recent studies, [[Alexander Thom]] worked with his son Archie from 1970 to 1974 to carry out a detailed survey of the Carnac alignments, and produced a series of papers on the [[Archaeoastronomy|astronomical alignments]] of the stones as well as [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] supporting his concept of the [[Megalithic Yard|megalithic yard]].&lt;ref name=megalithia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John Edwin | last=Wood | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | title= Sun, Moon and Standing Stones | edition=paperback 1980 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-285089-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom's megalithic yard has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heggie|first=Douglas C.|title=Megalithic Science: Ancient Mathematics and Astronomy in North-west Europe|year=1981|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05036-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=Clive|title=Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07814-5|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also general theories on the use of the stones as astronomical observatories, as has been claimed for [[Stonehenge]]. According to one such theory, the [[Broken Menhir of Er Grah|massive menhir]] at nearby [[Locmariaquer]] was linked to the alignments for such a purpose.&lt;ref name="dino"&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.dinosoria.com/dolmen_menhir.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:Carnac Kerlescan sheep.jpg|thumb|left|Sheep grazing around the Kerlescan alignment, part of a new management strategy.]]
The ''Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic'' is at the centre of conserving and displaying the artefacts from the area.&lt;ref name=museedecarnac/&gt;  It also contains the "world's largest collection [of] prehistoric[al] exhibits"&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; with over 6,600 prehistoric objects from 136 different sites.

The monuments themselves were listed and purchased by the State at the start of the 20th century to protect them against quarrymen, and while this was successful at the time, in the middle of the century, redevelopment, changes to [[Agriculture|agricultural practices]] and increasing tourism bringing visitors to the stones led to rapid deterioration. The ''Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication'' (Heritage Ministry) re-examined the issue starting in 1984, and subsequently set up the ‘Mission Carnac’ in 1991 with the aim of rehabilitating and developing the alignments. This involved restricting [[Public-access television|public access]], launching a series of scientific and technical studies, and producing a plan for conservation and development in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/megalithes/en/rea/reacar_en.htm The Carnac Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the megalithic structure of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], management of the stones can be controversial. Since 1991, the main groups of stone rows have been protected from the public by fences "to help vegetation growth",&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; preventing visits except by organised tours. They are open during winter, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/carnac.htm |title=Carnac |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68HCZwQLf?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/carnac.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When [[James Miln]] studied the stones in the 1860s, he reported that fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing, and subsequent work during the 1930s and 1980s (using bulldozers) rearranged the stones, re-erecting some, to make way for roads or other structures. In 2002, protesters invaded the site, opening the padlocks and allowing tourists free entry.&lt;ref name="ml"/&gt; In particular, the group ''Collectif Holl a gevred'' (French and Breton for "the everyone-together collective") occupied the visitor centre for the Kermario alignment, demanding an immediate stop to current management plans and local input into further plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://nopasaran.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=662 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227231719/http://nopasaran.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=662 |archivedate=2008-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, management of the site has also experimented with allowing sheep to graze among the stones, in order to keep [[gorse]] and other weeds under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/menec_west.htm |title=Menec West |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68HCaWx6P?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/menec_west.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ICAR - Central Tuber Crops Research Institute''', often abbreviated to '''ICAR - CTCRI''', is a constituent institute under the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] (ICAR) is the only [[research]] organization in the world dedicated solely to the research on [[tropical]] [[tuber|tuber crops]]. The Institute established in 1963&lt;ref name=ctcritvm-institute/&gt; with its Headquarters at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]] has with an area of 48.19 [[hectare]]s. The headquarters of ICAR - CTCRI is located at [[Sreekaryam]] at a distance 12&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Thiruvananthapuram International Airport]] and 10&amp;nbsp;km from [[Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station]] as well as [[Central Bus Station Thiruvananthapuram]]. The Institute has a regional centre at [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] established in 1976 &lt;ref name=ctcribbs-institute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcri.org/regional_center.html|title=Regional Center|publisher=Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with an area of 20 [[hectare]]s located 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bhubaneswar Airport]] and 7&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bhubaneswar railway station]] to cater the needs of [[East India|Eastern India]].

==Research==
Research on [[tropical]] [[tuber|tuber crops]] is the primary mandate of CTCRI. Each division of CTCRI concentrate its research programmes on separate aspects of tuber crops. '''Crop improvement division focus''' its activities on collection [[germplasm]] of different tuber crops from different parts of the world and conserving it in field gene bank as well as [[in vitro]]. Development of new varieties of tuber crops with higher yield and other attributes suitable for industrial applications as well as for food purpose is another important activity of this division. '''Crop production division''' is engaged in developing new agro techniques for tropical tuber crops in different agro climatic regions. '''Crop protection division''' develop strategies and products for managing pests and diseases affecting tropical tuber crops. '''Crop utilization division''' concentrates its activities on value addition and post harvest processing of tropical tuber crops. '''Section of Extension and social sciences''' is involved in transferring the technologies developed by CTCRI to its clienteles.

The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,

'''Comparative negligence''', or non-absolute [[contributory negligence]] outside the United States, is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim, based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the [[plaintiff]]'s negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Victor E.|title=Strict Liability and Comparative Negligence|journal=Tennessee Law Review|date=1974|volume=42|page=171|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/tenn42&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Explanation ==
Prior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called "pure" comparative negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooter|first1=Robert D.|last2=Ulen|first2=Thomas S.|title=An Economic Case for Comparative Negligence|journal=New York University Law Review|date=1986|volume=61|page=1067|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.)

The second and third versions are lumped together in what is called "modified" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only" if the plaintiff's negligence is "not greater than" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties).

The other variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only if" the plaintiff's negligence is "not as great as" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.

== Contributory negligence doctrine ==
Some states, though, still use the [[contributory negligence]] doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, [[Alabama]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] continue to use contributory negligence.

Neither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with [[joint and several liability]], which generally holds each of two or more culpable [[defendants]] responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.

|quote= Gruenewald was a "cynologist" (a self-styled dog man with an interest in genetics)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Five quotes are used in the Wiktionary to justify inclusion of the word cynology/cynologist.
*''1892, The Journal of Comparative Medicine and Veterinary Archives, 'Professor Mills has done excellent work in his course on "Cynology, the Dog and his Diseases," a subject hitherto only taught incidentally in any college ...'''
*''1948, Dogs In Britain Clifford L.B. Hubbard, MacMillan &amp; Co, 'Buffon's table is here reproduced as it was a sincere attempt towards laying a foundation upon which cynologists might work out the origin of breeds and their varieties and the analysis of dog groups.'''
*''1951, The American Mercury, 'Students of cynology can trace in the dictionary the dog's remarkable rise in the public esteem in this century.'''
*''1985, The Complete Dog Book, published by the American Kennel Club, 'The annals of cynology make no further mention of the breed until 1901 when a combined Rottweiler and Leonberger Club was formed.'''
*''1990, Austin Farrer, in his introduction to G. W. Leibniz’ "Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil"; quoted in Charles Taliaferro’s 2005 Evidence and Faith ([http://www.bored.com/ebooks/Religion/about%20religion%20and%20ethics/theodicy.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423062037/http://www.bored.com/ebooks/Religion/about%20religion%20and%20ethics/theodicy.html |date=2008-04-23 }}) 'Now neither probatology nor cynology could hope to be universal — the world is not all sheep nor all dog: it would have to be hylology;'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Cynology is a classical compound word (from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κύων}}, ''kyōn'', [[genitive]] {{lang|grc|κυνός}}, ''kynos'', "dog"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') referring to the study of [[dog]]s.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.
Similar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch ''kynologie'', and the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''кинология'', from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|''*ḱwon-''}}, which is the source of ''hound''.

κυν is also the source of the English word ''cynic'', and is directly related to ''canine'' and ''hound''.

== Usage in English ==
The suffix '-logy' in [[English language|English]] words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.

Usage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.

== The study of dogs ==
Studies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by [[biologist]]s, [[geneticist]]s, [[zoologist]]s, [[ethology|behaviourist]]s, and others [[Science|scientist]]s, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.

Informally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, [[Dog breeding|breeders]], [[Dog trainer|trainers]], [[Police dog|police dog handlers]], [[Pet Psychic|animal communicators]] and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.
Those who, very rarely, refer to themselves as "cynologists", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, [[Dog breed|breed]] development, dog [[Dog behavior|behavior]] and training, and the literature and history of dogs.

== Usage in other languages ==
Cynology may have other connotations or uses in languages other than English, see German [[:de:Kynologie|Kynologie]], Dutch [[:nl:Kynologie|Kynologie]] and Czech [[:cs:Sportovní kynologie|Sportovní kynologie]].

'''Disability Studies in Education''' (DSE) is a field of academic study concerned with education research and practice related to [[disability]]. DSE scholars promote an understanding of disability from a [[social model of disability]] perspective to “challenge social, medical, and psychological models of disability as they relate to education".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aera.net/SIG143/DisabilityStudiesinEducationSIG143/tabid/12121/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A DSE perspective situates disability within social and political context and is concerned with the civil and human rights of students with disabilities, including issues of equity, access, and inclusion in educational settings, curricula, and activities. DSE emerged as a part of the broader, interdisciplinary [[Disability Studies]] movement and as a critique of [[special education]].

==Foundations==

DSE scholarship is based on a social conception of disability that identifies barriers, attitudes, and actions that serve to systematically exclude individuals with disabilities society.  It is a reaction to the dominant [[medical model of disability]] which positions people with disabilities as having limitations outside of the "normal" or typical boundaries that require remediation and intervention. DSE has its origins in sociological theories of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]], [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1961 ). Asylums: Notes on the management of a spoiled identity. Boston: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, H. (1963). Outsiders: Studies in the sociology of deviance. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, K. T. (1962). Notes on the sociology of deviance. Social Problems, 9, 307-314&lt;/ref&gt; and [[labeling theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, L.M. (1969). Small, special-purpose residential facilities for the retarded. In R. B. Kugel and W. Wolfensberger (Eds.), Changing patterns in residential services for the mentally retarded (pp. 211-226). Washington, DC: President' s Committee on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J. R. ( 1965). Social system perspective and clinical perspective: Frames of reference for understanding career patterns of persons labeled as mentally retarded. Social Problems, 13(1), 18-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J. R. (1973). Labelling the mentally retarded: Clinical and social system perspectives on mental retardation. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, R., and Taylor, S. J. (1976). The judged, not the judges: An insider's view of mental retardation. American Psychologist, 31(1), 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, there emerged critiques of labeling in special education, now referred to as [[ableism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabel, S. L. (2005). Disability studies in education: Readings in theory and method (Vol. 3). Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability positions physical, intellectual, psychological, sensory, and emotional variations as natural and therefore requires societal changes in the response to those variations. The problem therefore resides not within the individual with impairments, but in the attitudes toward and treatment of people with disabilities.  A DSE perspective is grounded in the belief that a collective social response to disability has resulted in systematic inequality, [[marginalization]], discrimination, and oppression. There is also the recognition that disability is both a form of individuation and group identification. Because individual identities are complex and intersect with other identity categories (i.e. race, gender, social class, sexual orientation), there are varied ways that individuals may identify themselves as disabled.

==Issues==

DSE is concerned with critical issues concerning the education of people identified as disabled.  Central questions of concern to DSE scholars are:

;1. What is an appropriate education for students with disabilities?

DSE scholars promote academic activism in that they seek to counter the dominant discourse of the disabled student as deficient and abnormal. They criticize [[special education]] as an inadequate response to disability which seeks to remediate the individual in order for them to fit in with the norm. They promote a [[social justice]] perspective in which the purpose of education is to accept and care for all students.

;2. What counts as research and inquiry?

DSE scholars challenge research methodologies that serves to objectify, marginalize, and oppress disabled people. They promote research that is created by and accountable to disabled people, rather than portraying them as subjects. They recognize the value of interdisciplinary approaches within and outside the educational field and promote interaction among researchers from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.

;3. What is [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]] and who is included?

A DSE perspective foregrounds the interests and voices of disabled students in their education. DSE scholars reject deficit models of disability and assume that all children have the right to equitable, full, and meaningful access to educational opportunities. At the same time, DSE scholars understand that special education ≠ inclusive education ≠ disability studies in education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6217">'''Face-ism''' or '''facial prominence''' is the relative prominence of the face in the portrayal of men and women; media tend to focus more on men's faces and women's bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Gary N., and Laura M. Graves (3rd Edition, SAGE 2003) ''Women and Men in Management'' (page 59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and evidence==

[[File:Face-ism Mona Lisa.svg|thumb|300px|Illustration of calculation of face-ism index on two crops of the Mona Lisa.]]

The term "face-ism" or "facial prominence" was initially defined in a 1983 study in which facial prominence was measured by a "Face-ism index", which is the ratio of two linear measurements, with the distance (in millimeters or any other unit) from the top of the head to the lowest visible point of the [[chin]] being the numerator and the distance from the top of the head to the lowest visible part of the subject's body the denominator. It was found that across societies and time, facial prominence of men has been much higher than that of women.&lt;ref name=archer1983&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.45.4.725 | issn=1939-1315 | volume=45 | issue=4 | pages=725–735 | last=Archer | first=Dane |author2=Iritani, Bonita |author3=Kimes, Debra D. |author4= Barrios, Michael  | title=Face-ism: Five studies of sex differences in facial prominence | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent studies have generated consistent findings and thus helped confirm the pervasive presence of face-ism. For instance, a prevalent face-ism phenomenon was observed in [[news magazine]]s and [[women's magazine]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1988.tb00938.x | issn=0361-6843 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=225–235 | last=Nigro | first=Georgia N. |author2=Hill, Dina E. |author3=Gelbein, Martha E. |author4= Clark, Catharine L.  | title=Changes in the Facial Prominence of Women and Men Over the Last Decade | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |date=1 June 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Face-ism has been documented in [[prime-time television]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/08838158909364075 | issn=1550-6878| volume=33 | issue=2 | pages=209–214 | last=Copeland | first=Gary A. | title=Face-ism and primetime television | journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | year= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has been shown that face-ism is still present in mainstream printed media from as recently as 2004, and showed that men in intellectually focused occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than women in similar professions, while women in physical occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than men in similar professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9276-3 | issn=0360-0025 | volume=57 | issue=7-8 | pages=515–525 | last=Matthews | first=Justin L. | title=Hidden Sexism: Facial Prominence and Its Connections to Gender and Occupational Status in Popular Print Media | journal=Sex Roles | date=17 August 2007 | url=https://www.academia.edu/353822/Hidden_Sexism_Facial_Prominence_and_Its_Connections_to_Gender_and_Occupational_Status_in_Popular_Print_Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-cultural study on face-ism found that face-ism in photographs of politicians is more pronounced in gender-egalitarian societies compared to gender-unequal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0361684312455317 | issn=0361-6843 | last=Konrath | first=Sara |author2=Au, Josephine |author3=Ramsey, Laura R.  | title=Cultural Differences in Face-ism: Male Politicians Have Bigger Heads in More Gender-Equal Cultures | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | date=8 August 2012 | url=http://www.sarakonrath.com/media/publications/konrath_au_ramsey_2012_in_press_faceism.pdf | volume=36 | pages=476–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no relation between face-ism and the perception of intellect.&lt;ref name=zuckerman1994 /&gt;

==Implications==

It was found that regardless of gender difference, news photographs featuring high face prominence tend to generate more positive ratings with regard to intelligence, ambition and physical appearance than those with low face prominence.&lt;ref name=archer1983 /&gt;

Similarly, another study argued that as a series of mental life dimensions including intelligence, personality, and character, are closely associated with the face and head; higher face-ism of men may convey impressions of greater intelligence, dominance, and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00987481 | issn=0191-5886 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=215–229 | last=Zuckerman | first= Miron | title=On the meaning and implications of facial prominence | journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior | date=1 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the greater body-ism of women (analyzed in [[Alcohol advertising|television beer commercials]]) serves to reinforce the stereotypical images of women as trophies or [[sex object]]s without personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF01544592 | issn=0360-0025 | volume=31 | issue=5-6 | pages=329–337 | last=Hall | first=Christine C. Iijima |author2=Crum, Matthew J. | title=Women and "body-isms" in television beer commercials | journal=Sex Roles | date=1 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face-ism may not be merely restricted to gender difference but can apply to racial difference as well. For instance, the study revealed that Caucasians have higher face-ism than blacks across different media types.&lt;ref name=zuckerman1994&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.86 | issn=1939-1315 | volume=66 | issue=1 | pages=86–92 | last=Zuckerman | first=Miron |author2=Kieffer, Suzanne C. | title=Race differences in face-ism: Does facial prominence imply dominance? | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">A '''facultative parasite''' is an  [[organism]] that may resort to [[Parasite|parasitic]] activity, but does not absolutely rely on any [[host (biology)|host]] for completion of its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

Examples of facultative parasitism occur among many species of [[Fungus|fungi]], such as family members of the [[genus]] ''[[Armillaria]]''. ''Armillaria'' species do parasitise living trees, but if the tree dies, whether as a consequence of the fungal infection or not, the fungus continues to eat the wood without further need for parasitic activity; some species even can ingest dead wood without any parasitic activity at all. As such, although they also are important [[Ecology|ecological]] agents in the process of [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] by microbial decomposition, the fungi become pests in their role as destructive agents of [[Wood-decay fungus|wood rot]].&lt;ref&gt;Agrios, George N. Plant Pathology. Publisher: Academic Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0120445653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, green plants in [[Genus|genera]] such as ''[[Rhinanthus]]'' and [[Colpoon]] can grow independently of any host, but they also act [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistically]] as facultative root parasites of neighboring green plants.

Among animals, facultatively [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasitic]] species generally can survive by hunting or [[Scavenger|scavenging]] for themselves, but it often is more profitable for them to rob food from other animals kleptoparasitically, whether their hosts are of the same species or not. Such behavior occurs in lions and hyaenas for example, and also among insects such as "Jackal flies" in the family [[Milichiidae]].

More intimately, normally free-living microbes may opportunistically live as facultative parasites in other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds Bruce D. "Colpoda steini, a Facultative Parasite of the Land Slug, Agriolimax agrestis" The Journal of Parasitology Vol. 22, No. 1 (Feb., 1936), pp. 48-53. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3271896&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this in humans is [[Naegleria fowleri]]. As a rule this [[amoeboid]] species is a free-living predator on microbes, but occasionally it successfully infects humans as a facultative internal parasite.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist political ecology''' is a [[feminist]] perspective on [[political ecology]], drawing on theories from  [[post-structuralism]], [[feminist geography]], and [[cultural ecology]]. Feminist political ecology examines the place of gender in the political ecological landscape, exploring gender as a factor in ecological and political relations. Specific areas in which feminist political ecology is focused are development, landscape, resource use, [[Agrarianism|agrarian reconstruction]] and [[Urbanization|rural-urban transformation]] (Hovorka 2006: 209).  Feminist political ecologists suggest gender is a crucial variable – in relation to class, race and other relevant dimensions of political ecological life – in constituting access to, control over, and knowledge of natural resources.

== Linking gender hierarchy with environmental degradation ==

Feminist political ecology attempts to include gender as a "key element" in  political ecology analysis (Hovorka 2006: 209). It is informed by several decades of feminist scholarship on the material and cultural links between gender hierarchy (where the masculine is valued more than the feminine) and the domination of the natural world. Ecological feminist scholars working in different disciplines, such as Carolyn Merchant (1980), [[Val Plumwood]] (1993; 2002) and Vandana Shiva (1989), laid the foundations for this field by providing empirical evidence and conceptual tools for the systematic analysis of the twin devaluation/domination of nature and the feminine.

== Research ==

The study of the relationship between environments, gender, and development has grown in importance because of the restructuring of economies, environments and cultures at a global and local level (Mitchell 2000). Women and men are being viewed as actors who affect environmental management, resource use, and the creation of policies for health and well-being. Feminist political ecology does not view gender differences in environmental impact as being biologically-rooted. Rather, they are derived from social constructs of gender, which vary depending on culture, class, race, and geographical location, and they change over time between individuals and societies. A key moment on the development of the approach was the publication of ''Feminist Political Ecology'', edited by Dianne Rocheleau ''et.al.'' at [[Clark University]] in 1996. The book showed how usage of environment and labor patterns are gendered, but also how certain environmental problems have particularly negative effects on women (Rocheleau ''et al.'' 1996). These concerns were largely absent in the better-known [[political ecology]] volume ''Liberation Ecologies'', which was published in the same year and also developed at Clark (Peet &amp; Watts, 1996).

In a study on the [[Rural Federation of Zambrana-Chacuey]] (a peasant federation) and an international nongovernmental organization ([[ENDA-Caribe]]) in the Dominican Republic, [[Dianne Rocheleau]] examines social forestry within the region. Women are involved in the forestry industry, but previous research (summary numbers, "regional maps of forestry-as-usual" (Rocheleau 1995: 460) had not represented the "different publics (differentiated by gender, class, locality, and occupation) within the Federation (p460)". Rocheleau's study draws upon post-structuralism to "expand our respective partial and situated knowledges through a politics a science that go beyond identity to affinities then work from affinities to coalitions" (p459).In other words, the study does not assume that the identity of a person defines them, but instead focuses on "affinities" (defined as "based on affiliations, and shared views of interests, subject to change over time"). The purpose of this was to "address women within the context in which they had organized and affiliated themselves (p461)". The purpose of the study was to include women in the general study of the area in a way that gave justice to the "ecological and social contexts that sustain their lives" (p461), instead of separating them from the context, rendering them invisible.

In a Botswana study on urban poultry agriculture, [[Alice J. Hovorka]] (2006) examines the implications of fast-paced urbanization on social and ecological relations in a Feminist Political Ecology framework. Men and women are both involved and affected by development issues, so therefore "gender is an integral part of a key element of agrarian change and rural-urban transformation" (Hovorka 2006:209). Before urbanization took off, socially constructed gender roles played a huge part in gendered experiences of the landscape. Gender determined the different roles, responsibilities and access to resources. It is important to note that although Botswana women gained the right to vote in 1966, they remain excluded from political power. Gender issues are rarely raised in this country where "powerful conventions restrict women's domain to the household and women's autonomy under male guardianship" (p211). With urbanization, land use is becoming more accessible to Botswana women. But studies have revealed that "women's access to social status and productive resources remains limited compared to men's" (p213). Traditional gender roles affect women's economic situation, their access to resources and land, their education, and their labor market.

== Quotes on feminist political ecology ==

* New research in feminist political ecology moves "from a focus on women's vulnerabilities and the silencing of gendered and subaltern knowledges to stress the global significance of women's embodied practices, emerging social movements, and collaborative action". —Stephanie Buechler and Anne-Marie Hanson (2015)
* "Feminist Political Ecology aims at analyzing gendered experiences of and responses to environmental and political-economic change that brings with it changing livelihoods, landscapes, property regimes, and social relations." —Alice Hovorka (2006)
* "Rather than "adding women" to standard methods of empirical research it was possible to include gender as a subject of study, to incorporate feminist post-structuralist perspective into the research design, and to apply it to an analysis of social and environmental change within the region." —Dianne Rocheleau 1995.
* "My first feminist paper was published, out of research I did in the late 1970s on sex difference in migration and social change in rural Puerto Rica. It had to do with how rural industrialization, reflecting US development policies, was affecting who stayed and who left. And how class and gender intersected with migration patterns in rural Puerto Rico." —Jan Monk

'''Flight envelope protection''' is a [[human machine interface]] extension of an [[Aircraft flight control systems|aircraft’s control]] system that prevents the pilot of an aircraft from making control commands that would force the aircraft to exceed its structural and aerodynamic operating limits.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;Pratt, R. (2000). Flight control systems: practical issues in design and implementation.

(2001). Controlling Pilot Error: Automation. McGraw-Hill Professional. {{ISBN|978-0-07-137320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in some form in all modern commercial [[fly-by-wire]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;North, David. (2000) "Finding Common Ground in Envelope Protection Systems". ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'',  Aug 28, pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; The professed advantage of flight envelope protection systems is that they restrict a pilot's excessive control inputs, whether in surprise reaction to emergencies or otherwise, from translating into excessive [[flight control surface]] movements. Notionally, this allows pilots to react quickly to an emergency while blunting the effect of an excessive control input resulting from "startle," by electronically limiting excessive control surface movements that could over-stress the airframe and endanger the safety of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"&gt;Waldrop MM. (1989). Flying the Electric Skies. Science, 244: 1532-1534. {{JSTOR|1704109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alizart R. Fulford GA. (1989) Electric Airliners. Science, 245: 581-583. {{JSTOR|1704444}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, these limitations have sometimes resulted in unintended [[human factors]] errors and accidents of their own.

==Function==
Aircraft have a [[flight envelope]] that describes its safe performance limits in regard to such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength.&lt;ref name="Pratt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abzug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Risukhin"/&gt; Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop [[aviator|pilots]] from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; For example, if the pilot uses the rearward [[side-stick]] to [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|pitch]] the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection will prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] [[angle of attack]]. As a result, even if the pilot tried to apply more and more if rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command.&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply in an emergency maximum control forces while not at the same time inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.

Examples of where this might stop [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air accidents]] are when it allows a pilot to make a quick evasive maneuver in response to a [[ground proximity warning system]] warning, or in quick response to an approaching aircraft and a potential [[mid air collision]].&lt;ref name="North"/&gt; In this case without a flight envelope protection system, "you would probably hold back from maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or worse. You would have to sneak up on it [2.5 G, the design limit], and when you got there you wouldn't be able to tell, because very few commercial pilots have ever flown 2.5 G. But in the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], you wouldn't have to hesitate: you could just slam the controller all the way to the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you."&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; Thus the makers of the Airbus argue: "envelope protection doesn't constrain the pilot. It liberates the pilot from uncertainty-and thus enhances safety."&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt;

== Airbus and Boeing==
The [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] was the first commercial aircraft to incorporate full flight-envelope protection into its flight-control software. This was instigated by former Airbus senior vice president for engineering [[Bernard Ziegler]].  In the Airbus, the flight envelope protection cannot be overridden completely, although the crew can fly beyond flight envelope limits by selecting an alternate "control law".&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traverse P.

==Incidents==

===China Airlines Flight 006===
{{further|China Airlines Flight 006}}
One objection raised against flight envelope protection is the incident that happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a [[Boeing 747SP|Boeing 747SP-09]], northwest of San Francisco in 1985.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; In this flight incident, the crew was forced to overstress (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a [[Aerobatic maneuver|roll]] and near-vertical dive. (This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the [[autopilot]] and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine flame-out).  The pilot recovered control with about 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise). But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; If the aircraft had a flight envelope protection system, this recovery could not have been performed. Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 "never would have fallen out of the air
in the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine".&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt;

===FedEx Flight 705===
{{further|FedEx Flight 705}}
FedEx Flight 705, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]-30, was a case of a [[FedEx]] Flight Engineer who, facing a dismissal, attempted to hijack the plane and crash it into FedEx Headquarters in order for his family to collect his life insurance policy.  After being attacked and severely injured, the flight crew was able to fight back and land the plane safely. In order to keep the attacker off balance and out of the cockpit the crew had to perform extreme maneuvers, including a [[barrel roll]] and a dive so fast the airplane couldn't measure its speed. Had the crew not been able to exceed the plane's flight envelope, the crew might not have been successful {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

===American Airlines Flight 587===
{{further|American Airlines Flight 587}}
American Airlines Flight 587, an [[Airbus A300]], crashed when the vertical stabiliser broke off due to large rudder inputs by the pilot. A flight-envelope protection system could have prevented this crash, though it can still be argued that an override button should be provided for contingencies when the pilots are aware of the need to exceed normal limits.

===US Airways Flight 1549===
{{further|US Airways Flight 1549}}
US Airways Flight 1549, an [[Airbus A320]], experienced a dual engine failure after a bird strike and subsequently landed safely in the Hudson River. The NTSB accident report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf in particular section 1.6.3 and 2.7.2&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the effect of flight envelope protection: ''"The airplane’s airspeed in the last 150 feet of the descent was low enough to activate the alpha-protection mode of the airplane’s fly-by-wire envelope protection features... Because of these features, the airplane could not reach the maximum AOA attainable in pitch normal law for the airplane weight and configuration; however, the airplane did provide maximum performance for the weight and configuration at that time... The flight envelope protections allowed the captain to pull full aft on the sidestick without the risk of stalling the airplane."''

===Air France Flight 447===
{{further|Air France Flight 447}}
Air France Flight 447, an [[Airbus A330]], entered an aerodynamic stall from which it did not recover and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing all aboard.
Temporary inconsistency between measured speeds, likely a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, caused autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to alternate law; 
A second consequence of the reconfiguration into alternate law was that stall protection no longer operated. The crew made inappropriate control inputs that caused the aircraft to stall and did not recognize that the aircraft had stalled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8609">A '''formula restaurant''' is a type of [[formula retail]] business. It is characterized as a restaurant regulated by contractual or other arrangements to standardize menus, ingredients, food preparation, interior and exterior design and/or uniforms. The term refers to the characteristics of the restaurant rather than its ownership, following a business model controlled by an overseeing corporation.  Most formula restaurants are [[chain store|chain restaurants]], though this does not have to be the case.

In legal definitions, there may be a minimum number of "substantially identical" restaurants for them to be considered formula restaurants. This number varies across jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="mccall"&gt;[http://www.mccall.id.us/uploads/committees/planning_zoning/20161004pzap.pdf McCall, ID proposal to amend restriction from "one or more" to "five"] (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sf_use"&gt;[http://sf-planning.org/chain-stores-formula-retail-use San Francisco retail use] (11 or more)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="porttownsend"&gt;[http://www.codepublishing.com/WA/PortTownsend/html/PortTownsend17/PortTownsend1754.html Port Townsend] (14 or more)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula retail==

Formula retail is a type of sales activity required by contractual or other arrangements to offer a standardized array of services and/or merchandise, trademark, interior or exterior design and/or uniforms.&lt;ref name="jaffrey_NH"&gt;[http://www.townofjaffrey.com/sites/jaffreynh/files/pages/summary_of_proposed_zoning_changes.pdf Town of Jaffrey Planning Board Proposed Zoning Changes Summary], Public Hearing January 22, 2018, Town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies to the restaurant industry where menus, ingredients and food preparation may be standardized according to the overseeing corporation's business model, intended to maximize marketing potential.

===Comparison with chain restaurants===

Although there is considerable [[financial]] overlap, "[[chain store|chain restaurant]]" refers to ownership or franchise while "formula restaurant" refers to the characteristics of the business. A formula restaurant doesn't need to belong to a chain but it generally does. Nevertheless, most codified municipal regulation relies on definitions of formula restaurant or formula retail (although non-codified restrictions will sometimes target "chains").

Some [[chain store|chain restaurants]] are not considered formula restaurants because the chain does not maintain a formulaic or monolithic character at different locations, or has few enough locations that they are substantially dissimilar to what is commonly considered to be a formula restaurant. In addition, the term "chain restaurants" generically describes a business arrangement, whereas formula restaurants describe the aesthetic characteristics and customer experience.

===Disguised formula restaurants===

In some cases, a chain may establish a set of formula restaurants but attempt to present each venue as unique. This is common with hotel chains, which rely on centralized meal planning and management, but want to avoid the appearance of their in-house dining facilities being formulaic. Generally, the local manager is encouraged to modify the corporate menu so as to present the appearance of a unique character, while still building the menu around a corporate model (e.g., several entrees based on frozen chicken breast in accordance with a corporate formula).&lt;ref name="cookiecutter"&gt;[https://www.hotelfandb.com/articles/39-building-a-successful-hotel-restaurant Building a Successful Hotel Restaurant], ''Hotel F&amp;B'', 4-Jul-2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrecipe"&gt;[https://www.hotelmanagement.net/food-beverage/first-hospitality-group-s-john-harkey-wants-hotels-to-cook-a-new-recipie First Hospitality Group's Justin Harkey wants hotels to create a new recipe], ''Hotel Management'' 13-Apr-2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Disguised formula restaurants may be recognized by marketing indicators: intense use of staged photographs on the menu, frequent use of marketing [[Marketing buzz|buzzwords]] (or [[Corporate jargon#Marketing speak|marketing terms]]) such as "add" listed under multiple menu items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gritsandgrids.com/2012/10/restaurant-menus-and-pictures-yes-or-no/ Restaurant menus and pictures: Yes or No?], gritsandgrids.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Cultural===

Concerns have been expressed that formula restaurants detract from the unique characteristics of cities and towns.&lt;ref name="ILSR-impact"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/impact-chain-stores-community/ The Impact of Chain Stores on Community], Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILSR-sanibel"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/rule/formula-business-restrictions/2323-2/ ILSR report on Sanibel, Florida business restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marketplace-gentrification"&gt;[https://www.marketplace.org/2014/12/05/business/how-do-chain-restaurants-embody-gentrification How do chain restaurants embody gentrification?] ''Marketplace'' 5-Dec-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of menus can mean fewer choices for consumers. Formula restaurants tend to be marketing centric or based on perception.

===Economic===

Formula restaurants can harm local independent businesses.&lt;ref name="ILSR-impact" /&gt;&lt;ref name="governing"&gt;[http://www.governing.com/columns/assessments/gov-gentrification-local-business-extinction.html Hyper gentrification and the Disappearance of Local Businesses], governing.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=October 2018}} Formula restaurants accelerate [[gentrification]] but deteriorate quality of life.&lt;ref name="governing" /&gt;{{how|date=October 2018}}

Formula restaurants often rely on an economic model that encourages the use of disposable tableware.&lt;ref name="dontbus"&gt;[http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html  www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  This can create a negative economy in waste&lt;ref name="dontbus" /&gt; and food distribution, in part to support the business model of the controlling corporation.

==Response and regulation==
===Informal restrictions===
* [[Ketchum, Idaho]] has traditionally restricted franchise restaurants through the zoning approval process. The city has no formal formula restaurant ordinances.
* Iceland has informal health restrictions that discourage some formula restaurants.&lt;ref name="iceland webcam"&gt;[https://www.bushostelreykjavik.com/last-mcdonalds-in-iceland/ webcam] of "the last McDonald's in Iceland"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal restrictions===
* [[Malibu, California]] compiled a list of municipalities that restrict formula retail.&lt;ref name="malibu"&gt;[https://www.malibucity.org/DocumentCenter/View/4882/PC130729_Item-6D_Correspondence_DWaite2 Analysis of Cities with Formula Business Ordinances], Malibu (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bermuda has banned all franchised restaurants in the country (Prohibited Restaurant Act of 1997).&lt;ref name="dailymeal-mcd"&gt;[https://www.thedailymeal.com/travel/10-countries-banned-mcdonalds-slideshow (dailymeal slideshow listicle)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal challenges===
In the United States, legal restrictions on formula restaurants (and formula retail in general) have been challenged as an impermissible restriction on [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]], and as exceeding municipal zoning authority.&lt;ref name="park_v_malibu"&gt;[https://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2017-b271620.pdf?ts=1498075335 The Park at Cross Creek v.

==Biography==
Born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], he
did his schooling in the ''liceo classico'' of the 'Pius XI' diocesan seminary at [[Venegono Inferiore]], in the province of [[Varese]], [Italy]. Subsequently, he followed the usual cycle of studies at the major seminary itself and in 1990 gained the pontifical baccalaureate in [[theology]] from the [[Facoltà Teologica dell'Italia Settentrionale]]. On June 8, 1891 he was ordained [[priest]] at [[Milan]] for the diocese by the then [[archbishop]], Cardinal [[Carlo Maria Martini]], a noted biblical exegete.

From 1991 to 1994 Manzi pursued studies for the licentiate at the [[Biblical Faculty]] of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] in [[Rome]]. Under the direction of Fr [[Albert Vanhoye]], S.J., later made cardinal by Pope [[Benedict XVI]], he prepared the required thesis for the licentiate, entitled 'L'opera salvifica di [[Gesù Cristo]] tra ''[[kenosi]]'' (Fil 2,6-11) e ''solidarietà'' (Eb 5,5-10)' (''The Salvific Work of [[Jesus Christ]] between [[Kenosis]] (Phil 2:6-11) and Solidarity (Heb 5:5-10)').
He was granted the [[Licentiate in Biblical Sciences]] (SSL), on February 15, 1994, with an average grade of ''summa cum laude''. Similarly the dissertation for the ad doctoratum year on the subject '[[Melchisedek]] a [[Qumran]] e nella [[Lettera agli Ebrei]]' ('Melchisedek at Qumran and in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]]'), prepared under the direction of Fr [[Albert Vanhoye]] received the grade of ''summa cum laude''. On February 24, 1995, he successfully delivered the ''lectio coram'' prior to the drawing up of the doctoral thesis.

In the meanwhile (1992–1994), he was a resident student at the [[École Biblique et Archéologique Française de Jérusalem]], where in the second semester of the academic year 1992-1993 he followed courses that were recognized by the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] for the ''curriculum ad licentiam'' and followed further courses in the corresponding semester of 1993-1994. As a result of work undertaken in Jerusalem, he was granted the title ''élève titulaire de l'École Biblique''.

On February 15, 1995 he began the final phase of research for the doctorate on 'Melchisedek e l'[[angelologia]] nell'[[Epistola agli Ebrei]] e a Qumran' ('[[Melchisedek]] and [[Angelology]] in the Epistle to the Hebrews and at [[Qumran]]'), under the direction of Fr [[Albert Vanhoye]] (moderator) and Fr [[Joseph Sievers]] (relator). On December 18, 1996, he defended his thesis at the Biblical Faculty of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] in [[Rome]], being awarded the grade ''summa cum laude''. On  February 3, 1997 he published the complete text of the doctoral thesis in the book series ''[[Analecta Biblica]]'' (n. 136).

He received from Cardinal [[Carlo Maria Martini]] his formal appointment as lecturer for theological courses at the diocesan major seminary at [[Venegono Inferiore]] (February 1, 1997) and on June 3, 1999 was awarded a doctorate in [[Theology]] with specialization in [[Mariology]] in the [[Pontifical University|Pontifical Theological Faculty]] [[Marianum]] in [[Rome]], with the grade ''summa cum laude'', defending a thesis 'La ''forma'' obbedienziale del servizio di Gesù Cristo e di Maria. Confronto esegetico-teologico di Fil 2,7 con Lc 1,48' ('Obedience as ''Form'' of the Service of [[Jesus Christ]] and of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]: Exegetical and Theological Comparison between Phil 2:7 and Lk 1:48'), of which an extract was published in July that year.

He is currently lecturer of [[New Testament]] and [[Hebrew]] at the diocesan seminary of Milan (from 1997), and guest lecturer in Old and New Testament in the [[Facoltà Teologica dell’Italia Settentrionale]] (from 2000), in the [[Istituto Superiore di Scienze Religiose]] of [[Milan]] and in the [[Faculty of Theology]] at [[Lugano]], Switzerland (from 2006). He is also ''cultore della materia'' in New Testament [[philology]] and [[exegesis]], [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], at the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] di Milano (from 1997), director of the journal ''[[La Scuola Cattolica]]'', official theological journal of the Milan diocesan seminary, and contributes to a number of other journals of biblical exegesis, of theology, of [[liturgy]] and [[pastoral]] questions. He is an active member of various associations: the [[Associazione Biblica Italiana]], the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] of America, the [[Society of Biblical Literature]], the [[Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas]] and the [[Associazione Mariologica Italiana]], and also of the [[Congregazione del Rito Ambrosiano]] (dal 2000).

==Links between Qumran and the Letter to the Hebrews==
In his doctoral research, Manzi does not detect direct dependence of the Letter to the Hebrews upon the texts and intellectual systems of Qumran, but at the very most, an indirect dependence that is owing to the common origin in the Jewish cultural background, and in particular speculation about the cultic role of angels. Manzi's proposal that the Melchizedek of llQMelchizedek is to be identified with the Almighty is not generally shared by earlier researchers and it remains for time to tell whether it gains acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;For reviews and other evaluations of the work ''Melchisedek e l’angelologia nell’Epistola agli Ebrei e a Qumran'' (1997), see:
P. Puca, in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' 137, Mercoledì 19 Marzo 1997, p. 9; A. Ward, in ''Ephemerides Liturgicae'' 111 (1997) 299-300; G. Marconi, in ''Gregorianum'' 79 (1998) 181-182;

A. Urbán, in ''Estudios Biblicos'' 58 (2000) 429-431.&lt;/ref&gt; being contested by those who maintain that the instances where Melchizedek is presented as an agent of God rather than God himself are numerous. Nevertheless, Manzi's thesis, despite its inaccessibility to those who cannot cope with Italian, the only language in which it has been published so far, has been found "on many points, ... useful and convincing".&lt;ref&gt;Casimir Bernas, in ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 118 (Summer, 1999) 370&lt;/ref&gt; The published version includes many extensive schemes, indices and bibliographical elements for anyone with a will to examine his arguments.
In his later research and publications, Manzi has generally not pursued further investigation of the world of Qumran, which is not lacking in the attention of other scholars, but has been occupied with various themes connected with the Letter to the Hebrews and angelology, as well as the Pauline corpus. He was also one of the editors of the festschrift for his teacher Cardinal Vanhoye.&lt;ref&gt;*''“Il Verbo di Dio è vivo”. Studi sul Nuovo Testamento in onore del Cardinale [[Albert Vanhoye]], S.I.''

'''Geometric abstraction''' is a form of [[abstract art]] based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, though not always, placed in [[Perspective (visual)|non-illusionistic]] space and combined into non-objective (non-representational) compositions. Although the genre was popularized by [[avant-garde]] artists in the early twentieth century, similar motifs have been used in art since ancient times.

==History==
Geometric abstraction is present among many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves. [[Islamic art]], in its prohibition of depicting religious figures, is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art, which existed centuries before the movement in Europe and in many ways influenced this Western school. Aligned with and often used in the architecture of Islamic civilations spanning the 7th century-20th century, geometric patterns were used to visually connect spirituality with science and art, both of which were key to Islamic thought of the time.

==Scholarly analysis==
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|alt=Piet Mondriaan abstract painting "Composition No. 10" from 1939–42|[[Piet Mondrian]], ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–42, oil on canvas]]
Throughout 20th-century art historical discourse, critics and artists working within the [[reductionism|reductive]] or pure strains of abstraction have often suggested that geometric abstraction represents the height of a non-objective art practice, which necessarily stresses or calls attention to the root plasticity and two-dimensionality of painting as an artistic medium. Thus, it has been suggested that geometric abstraction might function as a solution to problems concerning the need for modernist painting to reject the illusionistic practices of the past while addressing the inherently two dimensional nature of the picture plane as well as the canvas functioning as its support. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting, was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work. Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as [[Kasimir Malevich]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting. Mondrian's painting "Composition No. 10" (1939–1942) clearly defines his radical but classical approach to the construction of horizontal and vertical lines, as Mondrian wrote, "constructed with awareness, but not with calculation, led by high intuition, and brought to harmony and rhythm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mondrian's Philosophy of Visual Rhythm|last=Tosaki|first=Eiichi|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9402411984|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there are both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries, the abstract sculpture of the 20th century was of course no less affected than painting by geometricizing tendencies. [[Georges Vantongerloo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=6091|title=The Collection: Georges Vantongerloo|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Bill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/obituaries/max-bill-85-painter-sculptor-and-architect-in-austere-style.html|author=Smith, Roberta|date=December 14, 1994|title=Max Bill, 85, Painter, Sculptor And Architect in Austere Style|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, are perhaps best known for their geometric sculpture, although both of them were also painters; and indeed, the ideals of geometric abstraction find nearly perfect expression in their titling (e.g., Vantongerloo's "Construction in the Sphere") and pronouncements (e.g., Bill's statement that "I am of the opinion that it is possible to develop an art largely on the basis of mathematical thinking.") Expressionist abstract painting, as practiced by artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], and [[Wols]], represents the opposite of geometric abstraction.

==Relationship with music==

Abstract art has also historically been likened to [[music]] in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality. [[Wassily Kandinsky]] has discussed this connection between music and painting, as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work, at length in his seminal essay ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''.

[[File:Domreiter, Blattmaske.jpg|thumb|A foliate head in the shape of an [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf: a [[corbel]] supporting the [[Bamberg Horseman]], Bamberg cathedral, Germany, early 13th century]]

A '''Green Man''' is a sculpture or other representation of a face surrounded by or made from [[leaf|leaves]]. Branches or [[vine]]s may sprout from the mouth, nostrils, or other parts of the face and these shoots may bear flowers or fruit. Commonly used as a decorative [[ornament (art)|architectural ornament]], Green Men are frequently found in [[Wikt:carving|carvings]] on both secular and [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] buildings. "The Green Man" is also a popular name for English [[public house]]s and various interpretations of the name appear on inn signs, which sometimes show a full figure rather than just the head.

The Green Man [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] has many variations. Found in many cultures from many ages around the world, the Green Man is often related to natural [[vegetation deity|vegetative deities]]. It is primarily interpreted as a [[symbol]] of rebirth, representing the cycle of growth each spring. Some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheade|first=Shirlyn|title=Green Man Mythology|url=http://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=Green_Man_Mythology|work=TarValon.net Library|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenks|first=Kathleen|title=Common Themes East &amp; West: The Green Man|url=http://www.mythinglinks.org/ct~greenmen.html|work=Myth*ing Links|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speculate that the [[mythology]] of the Green Man developed independently in the traditions of separate ancient cultures and evolved into the wide variety of examples found throughout history.

==Types==

Usually referred to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense [[foliage]]. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.

[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Julia, Lady Raglan]] applied the term "Green Man" to this type of architectural feature in her 1939 article "The Green Man in Church Architecture" in ''The Folklore Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Raglan | first=Lady |date=March 1939 | title=The Green Man in Church Architecture | journal=Folklore | volume=50 | issue=90990 | pages=45–57 | jstor=1257090 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1939.9718148}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that her interest stemmed from carvings at [[St Jerome's Church, Llangwm|St. Jerome’s Church]] in [[Llangwm, Monmouthshire|Llangwm]], [[Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenmanenigma.com/theories.html |title= : Theories and Interpretations|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= The Enigma of the Green Man|publisher= |access-date= 24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators conflate or associate the term with "[[Jack in the green|Jack in the Green]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Centerwall | first=Brandon S. | year=1997 | title=The Name of the Green Man | journal=Folklore | volume=108 | pages=25–33 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1997.9715933}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green [[cat]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[demon]]s are also found. On [[gravestone]]s and other [[memorial]]s, [[human skull]]s are sometimes shown sprouting [[grape vine]]s or other vegetation, presumably as a symbol of [[resurrection]] (as at [[Shebbear, Devon]], England).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Green Man appears in many forms, with the three most common types categorized as:

*the Foliate Head: completely covered in green leaves
*the Disgorging Head: spews vegetation from its mouth
*the Bloodsucker Head: sprouts vegetation from all facial orifices (e.g. tear ducts, nostrils and mouth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harding | first=Mike | title=A Little Book Of The Green Man | publisher=Aurum Press | year=1998 | page=38 | url=http://www.em-online.com/lifestyle/article.asp?id=34 | isbn=1-85410-561-2 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710185348/http://www.em-online.com/lifestyle/article.asp?id=34 | archivedate=2011-07-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pesznecker | first=Susan | title=Gargoyles: From the Archives of the Grey School of Wizardry | publisher=Career Press | year=2007 | location=Franklin Lakes NJ | pages=127–128 | isbn=1-56414-911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches==
Superficially the Green Man would appear to be [[Paganism|pagan]], perhaps a fertility figure or a nature spirit, similar to the [[woodwose]] (the wild man of the woods), and yet he frequently appears, carved in [[wood carving|wood]] or [[stone carving|stone]], in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[chapel]]s, [[abbey]]s and [[cathedral]]s, where examples can be found dating through to the 20th century. The earliest example of a green man disgorging vegetation from his mouth is from St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, c. 400 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=William|title=Green Man|year=1990|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=0-06-250077-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the Green Man being carved on to Christian churches exists across Europe, including examples such as the Seven Green Men of [[Nicosia]] in [[Cyprus]], a series of seven green men carved in the thirteenth century on to the facade of St Nicholas Church in Nicosia.&lt;gallery&gt;

==Later variations==

From the [[Renaissance]] onwards, elaborate variations on the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather than human faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including [[manuscript]]s, [[metalwork]], [[bookplate]]s, and [[stained glass]]). They seem to have been used for purely decorative effect rather than reflecting any deeply held belief. A Swiss engraver, Numa Guyot&lt;ref name="Numa"&gt;[http://www.guyotbrothers.com/numa1.htm Numa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107020949/http://www.guyotbrothers.com/numa1.htm |date=2016-01-07 }}, Guyot Brothers&lt;/ref&gt; created a bookplate depicting a Green Man in exquisite detail. It was completed circa 1887.

In Britain, the image of the Green Man enjoyed a revival in the 19th century, becoming popular with [[architect]]s during the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] era, when it appeared as a decorative motif in and on many buildings, both religious and secular. American architects took up the motif around the same time. The Green Man travelled with the Europeans as they colonized the world. Many variations can be found in Neo-gothic [[Victorian architecture]]. He was very popular amongst Australian stonemasons and can be found on many secular and sacred buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesrose/164464514/in/photolist-fwVz5-CGLsqi-zb9xE-57nB3x-NPYYH-cXH6tW-4ZBKCU-3iPiZ6-xzNzE-3iTMbf-buqGHT-4JYnSS-7ZggoR-jnSku-hk3Dc5-bCfKoU-aDqEeQ-kmDzzp-EUBjx-i7iw5B-apCqHS-gpjn5-93Zenk-mp5yN-8aNWZa-hFXU1f-82c6i6-pqTS6r-8aKnj4-9xEffL-bMX9oM-x6VT1X-8hoeS1-75R9ej-3iTM6f-5ewQjQ-nRs78-5Jg5V6-6AMtAo-9b9Mrr-5vBFJk-ajvLug-4xqQz6-aB979v-5mVrEm-4ckixq-nREjy-9ptokg-6MPztE-6atk3k&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern images===
The Green Man image has made a resurgence in modern times, with artists from around the world interweaving the imagery into various modes of work.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Phyllis Araneo | title=Green Man Resurrected: An Examination of the Underlying Meanings and Messages of the Re-Emergence of the Ancient Image of the Green Man in Contemporary, Western, Visual Culture. | journal=Master's thesis: University of the Sunshine Coast, 2006. Queensland, Australia. | url=http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:894 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are English artist [[Paul Sivell]], who created the ''Whitefield Green Man'', a wood carving in a dead section of a living oak tree; [[David Eveleigh]], an English garden designer who created the ''Penpont Green Man Millennium Maze'', in [[Powys]], [[Wales]] (the largest depiction of a Green Man image in the world); [[Zambia]]n sculptor [[Toin Adams]] who created the 12m-tall ''Green Man'' in Birmingham, UK (the largest free-standing sculpture of the Green Man in the world); and sculptor [[M. J. Anderson]], who created the marble sculpture titled ''Green Man as Original Coastal Aboriginal Man of All Time from Whence the Bush and All of Nature Sprouts from his Fingers.''

Others include Jane Brideson, Australian artist Marjorie Bussey, American artist Monica Richards, and English fantasy artist [[Peter Pracownik]], whose artwork has appeared in several media, including full-body tattoos.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"/&gt;

American artist Rob Juszak has taken the theme of the Green Man as Earth’s spiritual protector and turned it into a vision of the Green Man cradling the planet; artist Dorothy Bowen created a kimono silk painting, titled ''Greenwoman'', as an expression of the feminine aspect of the legend.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"/&gt;

===Literature===

The Green Man is a recurring theme in literature.  Sometimes the figures of [[Robin Hood]] and [[Peter Pan]] are associated with a Green Man, as is that of the Green Knight in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. The Green Knight in this poem serves as both a monster antagonist and as mentor to Sir Gawain, belonging to a pre-Christian world which seems antagonistic to, but is in the end harmonious with, the Christian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braudy|first1=Leo|title=Haunted: On Ghosts, Witches, Vampires, Zombies, and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds|date=Oct 25, 2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300224729|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqAqDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the post-war era literary scholars interpreted the Green Knight as being a literary representation of Lady Raglan's Green Man as described in her article "The Green Man in Church Architecture", published in the "Folklore" journal of March 1939. This association ultimately helped consolidate the belief that the Green Man was a genuine, Medieval, folkloric, figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larrington|first1=Carolyne|title=The Land of the Green Man: A Journey Through the Supernatural Landscapes of the British Isles|date=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1780769911|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5E4FCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mastin|first1=Luke|title=THEORIES AND INTERPRETATIONS|url=http://www.greenmanenigma.com/theories.html|website=www.greenmanenigma.com|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sir James Frazer]] mentions the tradition in ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[The Green Man (Kingsley Amis novel)|The Green Man]]'' (1969) is about a modern incarnation of the Green Man, who, in the novel, is portrayed as ancient pagan monster. [[Stephen Fry]] wrote a [[pastiche]] of a [[poem]] called "The Green Man" as part of his novel ''[[The Hippopotamus]]''. In [[Charles Olson]]'s book, ''[[Archaeologist of Morning]]'', there is a [[poem]] entitled "The Green Man". [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]] also wrote a book-length poem sequence, ''The Book of the Green Man''. The premise has even made its way into comics, most notably with the character of [[Swamp Thing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Green men, and variants on the theme, frequently occur in modern fantasy literature and science fiction. [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Ents]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' could be considered possible examples. In [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s 1908 children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', a depiction of a natural deity, analogous with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Green Man legend, appears as the climax of a mystical experience within the chapter "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn". (Later, the psychedelic rock band [[Pink Floyd]]'s debut studio album took [[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|its name from that chapter]].) Elsewhere, [[Robert Jordan]]'s series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' features a character named [[Someshta]], referred to as "the Green Man". He is the sole survivor of a race called the Nym, who were originally entrusted as the gardeners of the world, and who had the ability to manipulate the life and growth of plants around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Cornish people|Cornish]] poet [[Charles Causley]], the 1967 winner of the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] wrote a poem titled ''Green Man In The Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrysoup.com/charles_causley/biography|title=Charles Causley Biography|website=www.poetrysoup.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of the 20th century and earliest of the 21st, the appearance of the Green Man proliferated in children's literature.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}} Examples of such novels in which the Green Man is a central character are [[Bel Mooney]]'s 1997 works ''The Green Man'' and ''Joining the Rainbow'', [[Jane Gardam]]'s 1998 ''The Green Man'', and [[Geraldine McCaughrean]]'s 1998 ''The Stones are Hatching''.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}} Within many of these depictions, the Green Man figure absorbs and supplants a variety of other wild men and gods, in particular those which are associated with a seasonal death and rebirth.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}}

===Music===
The Green Man was a track by early English acid house outfit [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]] who entered the UK charts in 1992.  A song "Greenman" by English band [[XTC]] featured on their album ''[[Apple Venus Volume 1]]'' (lyrics included "See the Greenman blow his kiss from high church wall"). A song called "Green Man" is on American heavy metal band [[Type O Negative]]'s album ''[[October Rust]]''. The green man is the subject of [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s "The Green Man", the lead song on his [[The Green Man (album)|album of the same name]]. The track "Diadem" on [[Waterson–Carthy]]'s 2006 album ''[[Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man]]'' has phrases which suggest that the figure being adored is some kind of Green Man.

===Cinema===
The Green Man is featured in several films, such as ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' by [[Peter Greenaway]] (1982) and the first episode of ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (1972). The 2012 [[Disney]] film ''[[The Odd Life of Timothy Green]]'' also appears to depict a Green Man figure in its title character, a magical child who appears in the garden of a childless couple one night. He has leaves growing on his legs, takes nourishment from sunlight and returns to the earth in the fall, after fulfilling his purpose. In the 1973 horror film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', the local tavern of Summerisle is named 'The Green Man', and is the haunt of a group of paganistic islanders.

==Outside Europe==
[[File:Osiris-tomb-of-Nefertari.jpg|thumb|[[Osiris]], ruler of the underworld and of rebirth and regeneration, was typically shown with a green face. (Tomb of [[Nefertari]]), 1295–1253 BC]]

[[File:Khidr.jpg|left|100px|thumb|[[al-Khidr]]]]

In his ''A Little Book of The Green Man'', as well as his website, [[Mike Harding]] gives examples of similar figures in [[Borneo]], [[Nepal]], and [[India]]: the earliest is a foliate head from an 8th-century [[Jain]] [[temple]] in [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/ |title=The Official Mike Harding Web Site |publisher=Mikeharding.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that heads from [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]] can be dated to the 2nd century and that there are early Romanesque foliate heads in 11th century [[Knights Templar|Templar]] churches in [[Jerusalem]]. He tentatively suggests that the symbol may have originated in [[Asia Minor]] and been brought to [[Europe]] by travelling stonecarvers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are legends of him ([[Al-Khidr|Khidr]]) in which, like [[Osiris]], he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies connecting him, like the Green Man, with the end of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of his roles the ancient Egyptian God [[Osiris]] is regarded as a corn-deity and is commonly depicted with a green face representing vegetation, rebirth and resurrection. Containers of soil in the shape of Osiris planted with seed ("Osiris Beds") are found in some [[New Kingdom]] tombs. The sprouting corn implied the resurrection of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;''Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses'', George Hart, p119, Routledge, 2005
{{ISBN|0-415-34495-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gods depicted green are (in Tibet) Amogha-siddhi and (in Mexico) [[Tlaloc]].

In Sanskrit the Green Man is cognate with the [[gana]] [[Kirtimukha]] or "[[Face Of Glory]]" which is related to a [[lila (Hinduism)|lila]] of [[Shiva]] and [[Rahu]]. The Face of Glory is often seen in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist [[Thanka]] art and [[iconography]] where it is often incorporated as a cloudform [[simulacrum]]; and depicted crowning the 'Wheel of Becoming' or the [[Bhavachakra]].&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert.

[[Khidr]] or al-Khidr ([[Arabic]]: الخضر al-Khiḍr "the Green One", also transcribed as Khidar, Khizr, Khyzer, Khizar) is a revered figure in [[Islam]], whom the [[Qur'an]] describes as a righteous servant of [[God in Islam|God]],&lt;ref name="Qur'an, 18:65"&gt;Qur'an, 18:65&lt;/ref&gt; who possessed great wisdom or mystic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Qur'an, 18:65"/&gt; He is most often said to be a contemporary of  [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], but in other variations of his story, he lived at the same time as Abraham, the mythological Persian king [[Fereydun|Afridun]] and Nashiya bin Amus.&lt;ref name="al-Khadir al-Khidr"&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Khadir (al-Khidr)|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-khadir-al-khidr-COM_0483?s.num=4&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=khidr|work=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, 18:64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Al-Kahf|18th sura ("The Cave")]] presents a narrative where Khidr accompanies Moses and tests him about his oath to not ask any questions. Tom Cheetham, an authority on Islamic mysticism, identifies Khidr of esoteric [[Sufism]] with the Green Man. In his book about the work of [[Henry Corbin]] and others concerning the 12th-century Muslim saint [[Ibn Arabi]], he develops the idea of the Green Man/Khidr as the principle mediating between the imaginary realm and the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2917">The '''Harmonised monitoring scheme''' is a long term [[river]] [[water quality]] [[environmental monitoring|monitoring]] scheme in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm DEFRA - Freshwater quality - Harmonised Monitoring Scheme] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402151656/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm |date=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to the long term [[data set]]s produced by the scheme.

==Establishment==

The scheme was established in 1974 by the [[Department of the Environment]] with much of the initial planning and implementation undertaken by the [[Water Research Centre]]. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream [[freshwater]] limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific sampling location was identified based on the results of the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive [[Analytical quality control|AQC]] exercise was conducted to ensure comparability of data derived from the monitoring programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1979/AN/an9790400290 Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The scheme was originally intended to operate for 10 years from 1974 to 1984 to provide date to the Department of the Environment to permit the identification of national trends in water quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/research/completed-research/reports/dwi0224.pdf Co-ordination of analytical control for DOE Harmonised monitoring scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also intended to satisfy the acquirements of the EU decision on the exchange of monitoring data requirements.

==Operation==
The scheme is administered by the [[Environment Agency]] in [[England]], by [[Natural Resources Wales]] in [[Wales]] and by [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]] in [[Scotland]] and involves routine monitoring at 230 sites including 56 river systems in Scotland.

==Data==
The data produced by the scheme provides a continuous and consistent record of quality of rivers across the UK for more than 30 years and can be used to demonstrate changes in water quality over that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/data_and_reports/water/scottish_river_water_quality.aspx SEPA -Scottish River water quality trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11396">A '''home range''' is the area in which an animal lives and moves on a periodic basis. It is related to the concept of an animal's [[territory (animal)|territory]] which is the area that is actively defended. The concept of a home range was introduced by W. H. Burt in 1943. He drew maps showing where the animal had been observed at different times. An associated concept is the [[utilization distribution]] which examines where the animal is likely to be at any given time. Data for mapping a home range used to be gathered by careful observation, but nowadays, the animal is fitted with a transmission collar or similar [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device.

The simplest way of measuring the home range is to construct the smallest possible convex polygon around the data but this tends to overestimate the range. The best known methods for constructing utilization distributions are the so-called bivariate Gaussian or [[normal distribution]] [[Multivariate kernel density estimation|kernel density methods]]. More recently, nonparametric methods such as the Burgman and Fox's alpha-hull and Getz and Wilmers [[local convex hull]] have been used. Software is available for using both parametric and nonparametric kernel methods.

==History==
The concept of the home range can be traced back to a publication in 1943 by W. H. Burt, who constructed maps delineating the spatial extent or outside boundary of an animal's movement during the course of its everyday activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burt |first=W. H. |year=1943 |title=Territoriality and home range concepts as applied to mammals |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=346–352 |doi= |jstor=1374834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Associated with the concept of a home range is the concept of a [[utilization distribution]], which takes the form of a two dimensional [[probability density function]] that represents the probability of finding an animal in a defined area within its home range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jennrich |first=R. I. |last2=Turner |first2=F. B. |year=1969 |title=Measurement of non-circular home range |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=227–237 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(69)90002-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ford |first=R.

Such data are now collected automatically using collars placed on individuals that transmit through [[satellite]]s or using mobile [[cellphone]] technology and global positioning systems ([[GPS]]) technology, at regular intervals.

==Methods of calculation==
The simplest way to draw the boundaries of a home range from a set of location data is to construct the smallest possible [[convex polygon]] around the data.  This approach is referred to as the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method which is still widely employed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Population density and home range estimates for the Eastern Bristlebird at Jervis Bay, south-eastern Australia |journal=Corella |volume=25 |issue= |pages=62–67 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Creel |first=S. |last2=Creel |first2=N.

The best known methods for constructing utilization distributions are the so-called bivariate Gaussian or [[normal distribution]] [[Multivariate kernel density estimation|kernel density methods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverman |first=B.

Recently, the kernel approach to constructing utilization distributions was extended to include a number of nonparametric methods such as the Burgman and Fox's alpha-hull method &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burgman |first=M.

Although, currently, more software is available to implement parametric than nonparametric methods (because the latter approach is newer), the cited papers by Getz et al. demonstrate that LoCoH methods generally provide more accurate estimates of home range sizes and have better convergence properties as sample size increases than parametric kernel methods.

(1998), "Canaanites" (British Museum People of the Past)&lt;/ref&gt; city of [[Ugarit]], a headland in northern Syria, which date to approximately 1400 BC. One of these tablets, which is nearly complete, contains the '''[[Hurrians|Hurrian]] hymn to [[Nikkal]]''' (also known as the '''Hurrian cult hymn''' or '''A Zaluzi to the Gods''', or simply '''h.6'''), making it the oldest surviving substantially complete work of [[Musical notation|notated music]] in the world. While the composers' names of some of the fragmentary pieces are known, '''h.6''' is an [[anonymous work]].

==History==
[[File:Ugarit mapa.jpg|thumb|150px|Ugarit, where the Hurrian songs were found]]

The complete song is one of about 36 such hymns in [[cuneiform]] writing, found on fragments of [[clay tablet]]s excavated in the 1950s from the [[Royal Palace of Ugarit|Royal Palace]] at [[Ugarit]] (present day [[Ras Shamra]], [[Syria]]),&lt;ref&gt;K. Marie Stolba, ''The Development of Western Music: A History'', brief second edition (Madison: Brown &amp; Benchmark Publishers, 1995), p. 2.; M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 171.&lt;/ref&gt; in a stratum dating from the fourteenth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, "Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; but is the only one surviving in substantially complete form.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Kilmer, "Mesopotamia §8(ii)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; An account of the group of shards was first published in 1955 and 1968 by [[Emmanuel Laroche]], who identified as parts of a single clay tablet the three fragments catalogued by the field archaeologists as RS 15.30, 15.49, and 17.387. In Laroche's catalogue the hymns are designated '''h.''' (for "Hurrian") 2–17, 19–23, 25–6, 28, 30, along with smaller fragments RS. 19.164 ''g'', ''j'', ''n'', ''o'', ''p'', ''r'', ''t'', ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''aa'', and ''gg''. The complete hymn is h.6 in this list.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Laroche, ''Le palais royal d' Ugarit'' 3: Textes accadiens et hourrites des archives Est, Ouest et centrales, 2 vols., edited by Jean Nougayrol, Georges Boyer, Emmanuel Laroche, and Claude-Frédéric-Armand Schaeffer, 1:327–35 and 2: plates cviii–cix (Paris: C. Klincksieck, 1955):; "Documents en langue houritte provenent de Ras Shamra", in ''Ugaritica 5: Nouveaux textes accadiens, hourrites et ugaritiques des archives et bibliothèques privées d'Ugarit'', edited by Claude-Frédéric-Armand Schaeffer and  Jean Nougayrol, 462–96. Bibliothèque archéologique et historique / Institut français d'archéologie de Beyrouth 80; Mission de Ras Shamra 16 (Paris: Imprimerie nationale P. Geuthner; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1968). In the latter, the transcribed text of h.6 is on p. 463, with the cuneiform text reproduced on p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; A revised text of h.6 was published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz, "Kollationen zum Musiktext aus Ugarit", ''Ugarit-Forschungen'' 7 (1975): 521–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet h.6 contains the lyrics for a hymn to Nikkal, a [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic]] goddess of [[orchard]]s, and instructions for a singer accompanied by a nine-stringed ''sammûm'', a type of [[harp]] or, much more likely, a [[lyre]].&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 166.&lt;/ref&gt; One or more of the tablets also contains instructions for [[Musical tuning|tuning the harp]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "[http://www.amaranthpublishing.com/hurrian.htm The Oldest Song in the World]" (Amaranth Publishing, 2006). (Accessed 12 January 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hurrian hymn pre-dates several other surviving early works of music, e.g., the [[Seikilos epitaph]] and the [[Delphic Hymns]], by a millennium, but its transcription remains controversial. A reconstruction by Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin may be heard at the Urkesh webpage,&lt;ref name=Urkesh/&gt; though this is only one of at least five "rival decipherments of the notation, each yielding entirely different results".&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 161.

==Notation==
[[File:Ugarit Corbel.jpg|right|thumbnail|The Entrance to the royal palace at Ugarit, where the Hurrian songs were found.]]

The arrangement of the tablet h.6 places the [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] words of the hymn at the top, under which is a double division line. The hymn text is written in a continuous spiral, alternating recto-verso sides of the tablet—a layout not found in Babylonian texts.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, "Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 10, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Below this is found the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] musical instructions, consisting of interval names followed by number signs.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Kilmer, "Mesopotamia §8(ii)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in transcriptions hinge on interpretation of the meaning of these paired signs, and the relationship to the hymn text. Below the musical instructions there is another dividing line—single this time—underneath which is a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in Akkadian reading "This [is] a song [in the] ''nitkibli'' [i.e., the ''nid qabli'' tuning], a ''zaluzi'' … written down by Ammurabi".&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/734711 "The Earliest Musical Notation"], ''Music and Letters'' 52 (1971): 365–82. Citation on 372. {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name and another scribe's name found on one of the other tablets, Ipsali, are both Semitic. There is no composer named for the complete hymn, but four composers' names are found for five of the fragmentary pieces: Tapšiẖuni, Puẖiya(na), Urẖiya (two hymns: h.8 and h.12), and Ammiya. These are all Hurrian names.&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akkadian cuneiform music notation refers to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] [[diatonic scale]] on a nine-stringed lyre, in a tuning system described on three Akkadian tablets, two from the Late Babylonian and one from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period (approximately the 18th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;O. R. Gurney, "An Old Babylonian Treatise on the Tuning of the Harp", ''Iraq'' 30 (1968): 229–33. Citations on pp. 229 and 233. Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, ""Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Babylonian theory describes [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of [[Interval (music)#Number|third]]s, [[Perfect fourth|fourth]]s, [[Perfect fifth|fifth]]s, and [[Interval (music)#Number|sixth]]s, but only with specific terms for the various groups of strings that may be spanned by the hand over that distance, within the purely theoretical range of a seven-string lyre (even though the actual instrument described has nine strings). Babylonian theory had no term for the abstract distance of a fifth or a fourth—only for fifths and fourths between specific pairs of strings. As a result, there are fourteen terms in all, describing two groups of six strings, three groups of five, four groups of four, and five different groups of three strings. There are no known terms corresponding to a single note, or to intervals of a [[Interval (music)|seventh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, ""Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 6–8. M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The names of these fourteen pairs of strings form the basis of the theoretical system and are arranged by twos in the ancient sources (string-number pairs first, then the regularized Old Babylonian names and translations):&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

::1–5 ''nīš gab(a)rîm'' (raising of the counterpart)
:::7–5 ''šērum'' (song?)
::2–6 ''išartum'' (straight/in proper condition)
:::1–6 ''šalšatum'' (third)
::3–7 ''embūbum'' (reed-pipe)
:::2–7 ''rebûttum'' (fourth)
::4–1 ''nīd qablim'' (casting down of the middle)

:::4–6 ''ṣ/zerdum'' (?)

The name of the first item of each pair is also used as the name of a tuning. These are all fifths (''nīš gab(a)rîm'', ''išartum', ''embūbum') or fourths (''nīd qablim'', ''qablītum'', ''kitmum'', and ''pītum''), and have been called by one modern scholar the "primary" intervals—the other seven (which are not used as names of tunings) being the "secondary" intervals: thirds and sixths.&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, "The Tuning of the Babylonian Harp", ''Iraq'' 30 (1968): 215–28. Citation on pp. 216 n. 3 and 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

A transcription of the first two lines of the notation on h.6 reads:
:''qáb-li-te 3 [[ir (cuneiform)|ir]]-bu-[[te (cuneiform)|te]] 1 qáb-li-te 3 ša-aḫ-ri 1 i-šar-te 10 uš-ta-ma-a-ri''
:''ti-ti-mi-šar-te 2 zi-ir-te 1 ša-[a]ḫ-ri 2 ša-aš-ša-te 2 ir-bu-te 2''.&lt;ref&gt;Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz, "Kollationen zum Musiktext aus Ugarit", ''Ugarit-Forschungen'' 7 (1975): 521–22. Citation on p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the unsystematic succession of the interval names, their location below apparently lyric texts, and the regular interpolation of numerals that led to the conclusion that these were notated musical compositions. Some of the terms differ to varying degrees from the Akkadian forms found in the older theoretical text, which is not surprising since they were foreign terms. For example, ''irbute'' in the hymn notation corresponds to ''rebûttum'' in the theory text, ''šaḫri'' = ''šērum'', ''zirte'' = ''ṣ/zerdum'', ''šaššate'' = ''šalšatum'', and ''titim išarte'' = ''titur išartim''. There are also a few rarer, additional words, some of them apparently Hurrian rather than Akkadian. Because these interrupt the interval-numeral pattern, they may be modifiers of the preceding or following named interval. The first line of h.6, for example, ends with ''ušta mari'', and this word-pair is also found on several of the other, fragmentary hymn tablets, usually following but not preceding a numeral.&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, "The Earliest Musical Notation", ''Music and Letters'' 52 (1971): 365–82. Citations on pp. 371 and 373–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The text of h.6 is difficult, in part because the Hurrian language itself is imperfectly understood, and in part because of small [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] due to missing flakes of the clay tablet. In addition, however, it appears that the language is a local Ugarit dialect, which differs significantly from the dialects known from other sources. It is also possible that the pronunciation of some words was altered from normal speech because of the music.&lt;ref&gt;Theo J. H. Krispijn, "Musik in Keilschrift: Beiträge zur altorientalischen Musikforschung 2", in ''Archäologie früher Klangerzeugung und Tonordnung: Musikarchäologie in der Ägäis und Anatolien''/''The Archaeology of Sound Origin and Organization: Music Archaeology in the Aegean and Anatolia'', edited by Ellen Hickmann, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and Ricardo Eichmann, 465–79 (Orient-Archäologie 10; Studien zur Musikarchäologie 3) (Rahden: Leidorf, 2001) {{ISBN|3-89646-640-2}}. Citation on p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the many difficulties, it is clearly a religious text concerning offerings to the goddess Nikkal, wife of the moon god. The text is presented in four lines, with the peculiarity that the seven final syllables of each of the first three lines on the verso of the tablet are repeated at the beginning of the next line on the recto. While Laroche saw in this a procedure similar to one employed by Babylonian scribes in longer texts to provide continuity at the transition from one tablet to another, Güterbock and Kilmer took the position that this device is never found within the text on a single tablet, and so these repeated syllables must constitute [[refrain]]s dividing the text into regular sections. To this, Duchesne-Guillemin retorts that the recto-verso-recto spiral path of the text—an arrangement unknown in Babylon—is ample reason for the use of such guides.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, "Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 13, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published attempt to interpret the text of h.6 was made in 1977 by Hans-Jochen Thiel,&lt;ref&gt;"Der Text und die Notenfolgen des Musiktextes aus Ugarit", ''Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici'' 18 (=''Incunabula Graeca'' 67) (1977): 109–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work formed the basis for a new but still very provisional attempt made 24 years later by Theo J. H. Krispijn, after Hurritology had made significant progress thanks to archaeological discoveries made in the meantime at a site near [[Boğazkale]].&lt;ref&gt;Theo J. H.

'''The Institute for Cognitive Science Studies (ICSS)''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: پژوهشکده علوم شناختی)  is a non-governmental institution in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], committed to providing a [[research]] and educational environment that brings together the various disciplines that contribute to  [[cognitive sciences]].

In the process of studying [[cognition]], ICSS pursues the following major objectives:
Discovery of important, unknown facts about key issues in [[cognitive science]] through quality experiments; understanding unresolved issues in [[cognitive science]] through provision of new, effective, analytical theories; identifying means of employing achievements in cognitive science to improve the quality of individual and social wellbeing

The prime interest of ICSS is to conduct research studies that enhance our knowledge and understanding of [[cognitive science]]. That objective requires the kind of theoretical, experimental, and applied studies, which would be beneficial not only in terms of employing these achievements in various aspects of life, but also in terms of advancing our scientific knowledge. The institute also adheres to the principle that research findings should be shared with other scientific communities through their publication in respectable peer-reviewed [[Academic journal|journals]] and [[books]]. To these ends, ICSS engages in a host of other activities.  They include:
* Offering graduate studies programs
* Providing short-term training programs and [[workshops]]
* Organizing and supporting scientific [[Academic conference|conferences]] and discussion meetings
* Participating in international collaborations
* Publishing (or supporting the publication of) specialized [[books]] and journals
* Providing an effective research environment by means of modernizing and equipping its [[laboratories]], and maintaining a resourceful [[library]]

The institute currently offers [[PhD]] and [[Master's degrees]] in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]].

Currently, Dr Reza Zamani, a [[psychologist]] and previous [[associate professor]] of [[psychology]] in [[Tehran University]], is the director of the institute.

The '''International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis''' ('''IIASA''') is an international research organization located in [[Laxenburg]], near [[Vienna]], in [[Austria]]. IIASA conducts [[interdisciplinary]] scientific studies on [[natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]], [[technological]] and [[social issues]] in the context of human dimensions of [[global change]]. IIASA’s mission is "to provide insights and guidance to policymakers worldwide by finding solutions to global and universal problems through applied systems analysis in order to improve human and social wellbeing and to protect the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA%20Strategic%20Plan%202011-20201.pdf IIASA's New Strategic Plan 2011-2020], retrieved 2 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IIASA brings its experience of managing international tensions through science to today's [[global issue]]s. Its multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers have a growing membership, now including the world's four largest economies.

The institute is currently directed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175200/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/director.html?sb=1 Pavel Kabat]. [[Nebojsa Nakicenovic]] is the current Deputy Director General/ Deputy CEO.  Past directors have included  [[Howard Raiffa]], professor at [[Harvard]]'s [[Harvard Business School|Business School]] and [[Kennedy School of Government]], Roger Levien, former Vice President for Strategy at [[Xerox]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123131844/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/fileadmin/H00/hordijk_CV-IES.pdf Leen Hordijk], former Director at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100414042251/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php Institute for Environment and Sustainability], Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Ispra, Italy, and Detlof von Winterfeldt, professor at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/docs/MC/2012/CongresoBP/leviening.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA is a non-governmental institution funded by scientific organizations in its member countries, which currently include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html IIASA's National Member Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050627082900/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html |date=27 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the Institute also comes from contracts, grants, and donations from governments, international organizations, academia, business, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/funding/funding.html IIASA Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 4{{nbsp}}October 1972 representatives of the [[Soviet Union]], [[United States]], and 10 other countries from the Eastern and Western blocs met at [[The Royal Society]] in [[London]] to sign the charter establishing IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;Profile of IISA appended to summary of "Energy in a Finite World" (1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt; It was the culmination of six years’ effort driven forward by both the US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the USSR Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]]. For IIASA it was the beginning of a remarkable project to use scientific cooperation to build bridges across the [[Cold War]] divide and to confront growing global problems on a truly international scale.&lt;ref&gt;McDONALD, A. (1998), Scientific Cooperation as a Bridge Across the Cold War Divide: The Case of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) . Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 866: 55–83. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09147.x&lt;/ref&gt; The first scientist had arrived at IIASA in June, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jermen Gvishiani and Roger E. Lewis in Foreword to "Energy in a Finite World"(1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, success at bridge building and successful science would go hand in hand. But neither was a foregone conclusion. This was the 1970s, and most research organizations focused on national issues. Few encouraged researchers from different countries or disciplines to work together for the greater good.

To achieve its ambitious research vision, IIASA would have to break down the barriers between nations and disciplines. This it did, building international multidisciplinary teams to confront innumerable global challenges, both long-standing and emerging.   For example, a study on water pollution carried out in the 1980s by a team of IIASA chemists, biologists, and economists still forms the basis of modern water policy design in Japan, USA, and the former USSR.

When the [[Cold War]] ended (in 1991), IIASA’s sponsoring countries could have said “mission accomplished” and disbanded the Institute. IIASA had certainly helped foster mutual understanding among scientists from East and West. But it had also done more than this. IIASA had shown the scientific benefits of bringing together different nationalities and disciplines to work toward common goals.  Indeed, this approach has been widely imitated, for example, in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]].

So instead of closing in the 1990s the Institute broadened its mandate from the East and West to a truly global focus.  Today IIASA brings together a wide range of scientific skills to provide science-based insights into critical policy issues in international and national debates on global change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/docs/history_short.html?sb=3 A Brief History of IIASA], retrieved 2 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==
IIASA research focuses on complex problems that extend beyond a single country or a single discipline.

In 2010, IIASA launched a new strategic plan for the next ten years, which focuses on three general problem areas: Energy and Climate Change, Food and Water, and Poverty and Equity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Research.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year approximately 200 researchers from over 35 countries research at IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/informationkit/flyer-iiasa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They work on these broader topics within and across 9 research programs: Advanced Systems Analysis, Ecosystems Services and Management, Energy, Evolution and Ecology, Mitigation of Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases, Risk, Policy and Vulnerability, Transitions to New Technologies, Water, and World Population.

'''Major Projects'''

Ten IIASA scientists were among the authors of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000256/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Energy Assessment, released in 2012.  The report was a result of collaborative and integrated work of over 500 authors, analysts and reviewers worldwide who contributed independent, scientifically based and policy-relevant analysis of current and emerging energy issues and options. The assessment provides a thorough assessment of energy-related issues including sustainable development, including poverty eradication, climate change mitigation, health, energy security and energy access.&lt;ref&gt;GEA, 2012: [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Flagship-Projects/Global-Energy-Assessment/Home-GEA.en.html Global Energy Assessment] - Toward a Sustainable Future, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire assessment is available online as a PDF.

The Water Futures and Solutions: World Water Scenarios initiative, launched in 2012, aims to provide a similarly broad assessment of global water challenges, in much the same scope as the Global Energy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115120757/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |archivedate=15 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA researchers are major contributors to Working Groups II and III of the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/ResearchPartners/Climate-Change---IPCC-Fifth-Assessment-Report-.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, IIASA is also one of the three ''"pillar institutions"'' of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31 January 2011: “Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaacson was most noted for his own Colortone musical notation and his early works within this system. His association with the [[Fluxus]] movement was played down by Isaacson, who held European classical tradition in high regard, although his experimental and [[minimalist]] compositions drew inevitable comparison.

==Life==
Isaacson was born on May 5, 1911 in [[Midlothian, Virginia]] to Alfred and Martha Isaacson who relocated to nearby Chesterfield four years later. Isaacson developed a keen interest in music and a   proficiency at a number of instruments. He attended [[James River High School (Chesterfield County, Virginia)|James River High School]] in Chesterfield and returned in 1937 to teach Art and Music there.&lt;br&gt;
It was at James River High that Isaacson began a study of his [[synesthesia]], a mild case of which he had correctly diagnosed, and his own emotional response to color. His private, experimental, compositions, "doodled" pieces consisting of finely inked lines on a conventional stave, took on a more powerful and expressive form and, in 1950, by now a lecturer at [[Virginia State University]], he produced the first of his "Colortone" series.&lt;br&gt;
----
Isaacson's Colortone notation, in its purest form, demanded nothing more from the musician than an emotional, response to color and shape. Ability and proficiency were secondary to sensitivity and subtlety in "reading" both the score and one's musical partners. These compositions quickly became part of his classes at Virginia State.
----
A move to [[Mannes College]], New York, in 1951 encouraged fresh creativity, and by 1958 Isaacson had produced a further 8 Colortone pieces, the first of his four "Abstractions", and "For [[Diego Rivera]]", a tribute to the Mexican artist, who had died in November the previous year. Isaacson had put aside sheet music, favoring  slides, projections and abstract painting, and would not use printed scores again until his "Chromatics No. 1" in 1965.

==List of significant works==
The "Colortone" and "Abstractions" series can be performed by as many or as few musicians as conditions for performance allow and Isaacson refused to prescribe personnel for these pieces.

*''Colortone''  series 1 to 9 (1950–1957)
*''Abstractions''  series 1 to 4 (1955–1963)
*''For Diego Rivera''  (1958)  piano, brass septet, string quartet, orchestra.
*''Chromatics''  series 1 to 4 (1965–1974)  piano, 4 brass, recorder, violin, viola, cello, contrabass, orchestra, percussion,
*''Lucent Harmonic Color''  (1975)  magnetic tape, atlas marimba, percussion

==List of microorganisms used in food and beverage preparation==
&lt;!-- Note to editors: Do not include species which are only involved in food spoilage. For the first column, always use the most up-to-date name for the microorganism (e.g. "''Propionibacterium freudenreichii'' ssp. ''shermanii''", not the older name "''Propionibacterium shermanii''"). For the food column, be as specific as possible (e.g. "cheese" or "yogurt" instead of "dairy" or "Emmental cheese" instead of "cheese"). Also, for each food create a new row so that the food column can be fully sortable. Whenever possible, cite your sources.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6514">[[Image:Load line diode.png|thumb|300px|Diode load line. The curve shows the diode response (I vs V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) while the straight line shows the behaviour of the linear part of the circuit: I=(V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;)/R. The point of intersection gives the actual current and voltage.]]

In graphical analysis of [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] [[electronic circuit]]s, a '''load line''' is a line drawn on the [[current-voltage characteristic|characteristic curve]], a graph of the [[electric current|current]] vs the [[voltage]] in a nonlinear device like a [[diode]] or [[transistor]].  It represents the constraint put on the voltage and current in the nonlinear device by the external circuit.  The load line, usually a straight line, represents the response of the [[linear circuit|linear]] part of the circuit, connected to the nonlinear device in question.  The points where the characteristic curve and the load line intersect are the possible operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) of the circuit; at these points the current and voltage parameters of both parts of the circuit match.&lt;ref&gt;Adel Sedra, Kenneth Smith. Microelectronic Circuits, 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The example at right shows how a load line is used to determine the current and voltage in a simple [[diode]] circuit.  The diode, a nonlinear device, is in series with a linear circuit consisting of a [[resistor]], R and a [[voltage]] source, V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;.  The characteristic curve ''(curved line)'', representing the current ''I'' through the diode for any given voltage across the diode ''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, is an exponential curve.   The load line ''(diagonal line)'' represents the relationship between current and voltage due to [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to the resistor and voltage source, is
:&lt;math&gt;V_D = V_{DD} - I R \,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the current going through the three elements in series must be the same, and the voltage at the terminals of the diode must be the same,  the operating point of the circuit will be at the intersection of the curve with the load line.

In a [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] circuit, the BJT has a different current-voltage (I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;) characteristic depending on the base current. Placing a series of these curves on the graph shows how the base current will affect the operating point of the circuit.

==DC and AC load lines==
[[Semiconductor]] circuits typically have both [[direct current|DC]] and [[alternating current|AC]] currents in them, with a source of DC current to [[biasing|bias]] the nonlinear semiconductor to the correct operating point, and the AC signal superimposed on the DC.  Load lines can be used separately for both DC and AC analysis.  The DC load line is the load line of the DC [[equivalent circuit]],  defined by reducing the reactive components to zero (replacing capacitors by open circuits and inductors by short circuits).  It is used to determine the correct DC operating point, often called the  [[biasing|Q point]].

Once a DC operating point is defined by the DC load line, an AC load line can be drawn through the Q point.  The AC load line is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance.  The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line.    Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the  AC load line depends on the frequency of the applied signal.  So there are many AC load lines, that vary from the DC load line (at low frequency)  to a limiting AC load line,  all having a common intersection at the DC operating point. This limiting load line, generally referred to as the ''AC load line'', is the load line of the circuit at "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.

== Load lines for common configurations ==

=== Transistor load line  ===
[[File:BJT CE load line.svg|right|400px|Illustration of load line for a common emitter bipolar junction transistor amplifier.  ]]

The load line diagram at right is for a resistive load in a [[common emitter]] circuit.  The load line shows how the collector load resistor (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) constrains the circuit voltage and current.  The diagram also plots the transistor's collector current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; versus collector voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; for different values of base current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;.  The intersections of the load line with the transistor characteristic curves represent the circuit-constrained values of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; at different base currents. &lt;ref name=MY73&gt; Maurice Yunik, ''Design of Modern Transistor Circuits'', Prentice-Hall Inc., 1973 {{ISBN|0-13-201285-5}} section 4.6 "Load Line Analysis" pp. 68-73 &lt;/ref&gt;

If the transistor could pass all the current available, with no voltage dropped across it, the collector current would be the supply voltage V &lt;sub&gt;CC &lt;/sub&gt;over R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. This is the point where the load line crosses the vertical axis. Even at saturation, however, there will always be some voltage from collector to emitter. 

Where the load line crosses the horizontal axis, the transistor current is minimum (approximately zero). The transistor is said to be cut off, passing only a very small leakage current, and so very nearly the entire supply voltage appears as V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ''operating point'' of the circuit in this configuration (labelled Q) is generally designed to be in the ''active region'', approximately in the middle of the load line for [[amplifier]] applications. Adjusting the base current so that the circuit is at this operating point with no signal applied  is called [[Bipolar transistor biasing|biasing the transistor]]. Several techniques are used to stabilize the operating point against minor changes in temperature or transistor operating characteristics. When a signal is applied, the base current varies, and the collector-emitter voltage in turn varies, following the load line - the result is an amplifier stage with gain. 

A load line is normally drawn on I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; characteristics curves for the transistor used in an amplifier circuit. The same technique is applied to other types of non-linear elements such as [[vacuum tube]]s or [[field effect transistor]]s.

'''Message-oriented middleware''' ('''MOM''') is software or hardware infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between [[distributed system]]s. MOM allows [[modular programming|application modules]] to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple [[operating system]]s and [[network protocol]]s. The [[middleware]] creates a distributed communications layer that insulates the [[application developer]] from the details of the various operating systems and network interfaces. [[API]]s that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2004. [http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/1652511/4338215212/cce0f06f047faa57879a1fc36a8e8d6d754d2f6a/dl.pdf "Message-Oriented Middleware"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. {{doi|10.1002/0470862084.ch1}}. {{ISBN|978-0-470-86206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This middleware layer allows software components (applications, Enterprise JavaBeans, servlets, and other components) that have been developed independently and that run on different networked platforms to interact with one another. Applications distributed on different network nodes use the application interface to communicate. In addition, by providing an administrative interface, this new, virtual system of interconnected applications can be made reliable and secure.&lt;ref name="oracle"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Message Oriented Middleware |url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19340-01/820-6424/aeraq/index.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOM provides software elements that reside in all communicating components of a client/server architecture and typically support asynchronous calls between the client and server applications.  MOM reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master-slave nature of the client/server mechanism.

==Middleware categories==

*[[Remote Procedure Call]] or RPC-based middleware
*[[Object Request Broker]] or ORB-based middleware
*Message Oriented Middleware or MOM-based middleware

All these models make it possible for one software component to affect the behavior of another component over a network. They are different in that RPC- and ORB-based middleware create systems of tightly coupled components, whereas MOM-based systems allow for a [[loose coupling|looser coupling]] of components. In an RPC- or ORB-based system, when one procedure calls another, it must wait for the called procedure to return before it can do anything else. In these [[synchronous messaging]] models, the middleware functions partly as a super-linker, locating the called procedure on a network and using network services to pass function or method parameters to the procedure and then to return results.&lt;ref name=oracle/&gt;

==Advantages==

Central reasons for using a message-based communications [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] include its ability to store (buffer), route, or transform [[message]]s while conveying them from senders to receivers.

Another advantage of messaging provider mediated messaging between clients is that by adding an administrative interface, you can monitor and tune performance. Client applications are thus effectively relieved of every problem except that of sending, receiving, and processing messages. It is up to the code that implements the MOM system and up to the administrator to resolve issues like interoperability, reliability, security, scalability, and performance.

===Asynchronicity===
Using a MOM system, a client makes an API call to send a message to a destination managed by the provider. The call invokes provider services to route and deliver the message. Once it has sent the message, the client can continue to do other work, confident that the provider retains the message until a receiving client retrieves it. The message-based model, coupled with the mediation of the provider, makes it possible to create a system of loosely coupled components.

MOM comprises a category of inter-[[application software|application]] [[communication software]] that generally relies on [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] [[message passing|message-passing]], as opposed to a [[request-response]] architecture.  In asynchronous systems, [[message queue]]s provide temporary storage when the destination program is busy or not connected.  In addition, most asynchronous MOM systems provide [[persistent storage]] to [[backup|back up]] the message queue.  This means that the sender and receiver do not need to connect to the network at the same time ([[asynchrony (computing)|asynchronous delivery]]), and problems with intermittent connectivity are solved.  It also means that should the receiver application fail for any reason, the senders can continue unaffected, as the messages they send will simply accumulate in the [[message queue]] for later processing when the receiver restarts.

===Routing===
Many message-oriented middleware implementations depend on a [[message queue]] system.  Some implementations permit routing logic to be provided by the messaging layer itself, while others depend on client applications to provide routing information or allow for a mix of both paradigms.  Some implementations make use of [[Broadcasting (networks)|broadcast]] or [[multicast]] distribution paradigms.

===Transformation===
In a message-based middleware system, the message received at the destination need not be identical to the message originally sent. A MOM system with built-in intelligence can [[Data transformation|transform]] messages en route to match the requirements of the sender or of the recipient.&lt;ref name="MOM"&gt;[http://www.edwardcurry.org/web_publications/curry_DEBS_04.pdf E. Curry, D. Chambers, and G. Lyons, "Extending Message-Oriented Middleware using Interception", presented at Third International Workshop on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS '04), ICSE '04, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the routing and broadcast/[[multicast]] facilities, one application can send a message in its own native format, and two or more other applications may each receive a copy of the message in their own native format. Many modern MOM systems provide sophisticated message transformation (or mapping) tools which allow [[software developer|programmer]]s to specify transformation rules applicable to a simple [[graphical user interface|GUI]] [[drag-and-drop]] operation.

==Disadvantages==

The primary disadvantage of many message-oriented middleware systems is that they require an extra component in the [[software architecture|architecture]], the message transfer agent ([[message broker]]).  As with any [[system]], adding another component can lead to reductions in [[computer performance|performance]] and reliability, and can also make the system as a whole more difficult and expensive to [[software maintenance|maintain]].

In addition, many inter-application communications have an intrinsically [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]] aspect, with the sender specifically wanting to wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see [[real-time computing]] and [[near real time|near-real-time]] for extreme cases). Because message-based [[data communication|communication]] inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations.  That said, most MOM systems have facilities to group a request and a response as a single pseudo-synchronous transaction.

With a synchronous messaging system, the calling function does not return until the called function has finished its task. In a [[loose coupling|loosely coupled]] asynchronous system, the calling client can continue to load work upon the recipient until the resources needed to handle this work are depleted and the called component fails. Of course, these conditions can be minimized or avoided by monitoring performance and adjusting message flow, but this is work that is not needed with a synchronous messaging system. The important thing is to understand the advantages and liabilities of each kind of system. Each system is appropriate for different kinds of tasks. Sometimes, a combination of the two kinds of systems is required to obtain the desired behavior.

==Standards==
Historically, there was a lack of [[standardization|standards]] governing the use of message-oriented middleware that has caused problems.  Most of the major vendors have their own implementations, each with its own [[application programming interface]] (API) and management tools.

One of the long-standing standards for message oriented middleware is X/Open group's XATMI specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XATMI Specification) which standardizes API for [[interprocess communication]]s. Known implementations for this API is ATR Baltic's [[Enduro/X]] middleware and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s [[Tuxedo (software)|Tuxedo]].

The [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol]] (AMQP) is an approved [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amqp.org/node/102 1.0 Becomes OASIS Standard]. AMQP (2012-10-31). Retrieved on 2014-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=64955 ISO/IEC 19464:2014]&lt;/ref&gt; standard that defines the protocol and formats used between participating application components, so implementations are interoperable.  AMQP may be used with flexible routing schemes, including common [[Messaging pattern|messaging paradigms]] like [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]], [[Fan-out (software)|fan-out]], [[publish/subscribe]], and [[request-response]] (note that these are intentionally omitted from v1.0 of the protocol standard itself, but rely on the particular implementation and/or underlying network protocol for routing). It also supports transaction management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous multi-platform support. Java applications that use AMQP are typically written in Java JMS. Other implementations provide APIs for C#, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other languages.

The [[High-level architecture|High-Level Architecture]] (HLA IEEE 1516) is an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization|SISO]] standard for simulation interoperability. It defines a set of services, provided through an API in C++ or Java. The services offer publish/subscribe based information exchange, based on a modular Federation Object Model. There are also services for coordinated data exchange and time advance, based on logical simulation time, as well as synchronization points. Additional services provide transfer of ownership, data distribution optimizations and monitoring and management of participating Federates (systems).

The [[MQ Telemetry Transport]] (MQTT) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) supported by the OASIS organization. It provides a lightweight publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport protocol on top of TCP/IP suitable for communication in M2M/IoT contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

The [[Object Management Group]]'s [[Data Distribution Service| Data Distribution Service (DDS)]] provides message-oriented [[Publish–subscribe pattern|Publish/Subscribe (P/S)]] middleware standard that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high performance and interoperable data exchanges between publishers and subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems (DDS), Object Management Group, version 1.2, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The standard provides interfaces to C++, C++11, C, Ada, Java and Ruby.

The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ([[XMPP]]) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.  Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license; although many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.  XMPP-based software is deployed widely across the Internet, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation, and forms the basis for the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Capabilities Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/UCCO/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR2013/01_Framework_2013.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040719/http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/UCCO/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR2013/01_Framework_2013.pdf|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Java EE]] programming environment provides a standard API called [[Java Message Service|JMS]] (Java Message Service), which is implemented by most MOM vendors and aims to hide the particular MOM API implementations; however, JMS does not define the format of the messages that are exchanged, so JMS systems are not interoperable.

A similar effort is with the actively evolving [[OpenMAMA]] project, which aims to provide a common API, particularly to C clients. However, at the moment (August 2012) it is primarily appropriate for distributing market-oriented data (e.g. stock quotes) over pub-sub middleware.

==Message queuing==
{{see also|Message queuing service}}
[[Message queue]]s allow the exchange of information between distributed applications. A message queue can reside in memory or disk storage. Messages stay in the queue until the time they are processed by a service consumer. Through the message queue, the application can be implemented independently - they do not need to know each other's position, or continue to implement procedures to remove the need for waiting to receive this message.&lt;ref name=tutorialsto&gt;http://www.tutorialsto.com/software/engineering/middleware/message-oriented-middleware-and-the-websphere-mq-introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Mom's Having a Baby''''' is an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on February 16, 1977. The program would be historic as it was the first television program of its kind in the [[United States]] to showcase the pregnancy process and conception to young people, using a combination of animation and live action. The program was a co-production between [[Dick Clark Productions]] and [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]].

==Premise==
Upon learning that his mother is pregnant with what will be his brother, 10-year-old Petey Evans begins to wonder (through animated fantasies and flashbacks) about how babies are born, only to realize that those theories are not delivered by storks or popping out of a stomach. So, with help from his friends Oskar and Kelly, they go to a real expert who will be performing the delivery, Dr. [[Lendon Smith]], who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narration) of how a pregnancy begins and how the child is conceived.

The remaining portion of this program features an actual live birth being performed in front of the cameras, which was taken from a 1974 [[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]] special called ''[[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]]: Birth &amp; Babies''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Ledger]] (Lakeland, Florida): "Actual Birth of Baby to be Televised", February 13, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/arts/television-the-quiet-life-as-pursued-by-david-hartman.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Television — The Quiet Life as Pursued by David Hartman"] From New York Times (August 20, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Actress Candace Farrell, who played the mother in this program, was pregnant at the time of filming the 1974 special, which resulted in the producers hiring her for this program.

==Awards==
*This program won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 1977 for Outstanding Children's Informational Special.

==Cast==
*Shane Sinutko as Petey Evans
*Jarred Johnson as Oskar
*Rachael Longaker as Kelly
*Lendon Smith as himself
*Candace Farrell as Anne Evans

'''Oliver Krüger''' (born 1973) is a German professor in [[Religious studies]] at the [[University of Fribourg]] (Switzerland). In his Ph.D. thesis on "Virtuality and Immortality" he analyzed the religious and philosophical context of [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]]. 2004 the thesis was awarded by the German Association for the History of Religion. After his Ph.D. he worked on the significance of the Internet for the Wicca movement in a research project at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. From 2005-2007 Krüger served as visiting lecturer and visiting research fellow at the Center for the Study of Religion at [[Princeton University]] while exploring the alternative funeral culture in the United States, especially the [[Funeral Consumer's Alliance]]. In 2007 he was appointed to the chair for Religious Studies (Religionswissenschaft) at Fribourg University, from 2011-2014 he was president of the Swiss Association for the Study of Religion. In 2012/13 he was invited as fellow to the International Centre for Advanced Studies Morphomata at the University of Cologne (Germany). His research is focused mainly on religion and media / religion and science.

'''''Print Quarterly''''' is an international [[academic journal]] devoted to the history and art of [[printmaking]], from its origins to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is published in [[London]] four times a year, in March, June, September, and December. It was founded in 1984 by the scholar, patron of the arts and business man [[David Landau (venture capitalist)|David Landau]], who served as editor for twenty-eight years. The current editor [[Rhoda Eitel-Porter]] joined the staff of the periodical in September 2010. The journal’s editorial board comprises notable academics and curators working in prints history and the [[graphic arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printquarterly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal publishes recent scholarship on all things related to prints. It covers the [[old master print|Western tradition]] in the graphic arts as well as Asian, Latin-American and African printmaking. Articles consider the role and import of the print from a number of perspectives including those of social and cultural history, iconography, biography, and collecting. Reviews of recent books related to the graphic arts and of catalogues of exhibitions of works on paper are also included.

Recent contributions have treated such diverse subjects as [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]], the influence of a seventeenth-century fencing manual, [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]], a quiz on an unidentified etching, the collector [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], Soviet and Vietnamese posters, [[Jim Dine]], comic strips, [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[William Kentridge]] and digital prints.

The content lists for each volume from 1984 to 2009 are published online and can be searched at the journal’s website, http://www.printquarterly.com, and through the [[Getty Research Institute]]'s Bibliography for the History of Art.&lt;ref&gt;For content through 2007, see http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/bha/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Galileo''' is an educational astronomy project, based at [[Clifton College]] in [[Bristol]], in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

[[File:Robodome.jpg|thumb|Robodome]]

==History==
Project Galileo started in December 2000, as a result of a [[telescope]] being donated to a [[Bristol]] school, with the overall aim of making the system available for other schools in the area to use. The system became operational in July 2005, and is expected to have full on-line capability by the autumn of 2008.

==Aims==
Project Galileo aims to provide a curriculum resource for Science and Technology at Key Stages 3 &amp; 4 and AS/A2 levels, including [[ICT (education)|ICT]] &amp; Design &amp; Technology courses at post-16 level,  to inspire teenagers to "learn the art as well as science of research and research teams, how scientific research is practiced, how physical ideas become mainstream, how collaboration between scientific disciplines fosters greater understanding, and to encourage links and collaboration between schools of different age-ranges and traditions in the city of Bristol." (Project FAQ)

The project focuses on the issues surrounding the maintenance and successful operation of a remote-controlled [[observatory]].  It is built around a remote-controlled telescope with a 1.3 metre dome and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera located in Bristol, which enables imaging and searches of [[comets]], [[asteroids]], [[supernovae]], deep-sky and planetary objects.

==How it works==
Schools will be able to register via the main Project Galileo website (see [[#External links]] below), and then login to the telescope to order images, much in the same way as is done with other [[#Other online observatories|online school observatories]]. One important feature of the software being developed for the project is that it comes under the [[GPL]], so other schools or institutions who want to develop similar systems will be able to modify the code rather than having to spend vital educational budgets for proprietary software.  The code being used for the project can be found via the [[#External links]].

Other institutions using similar code are the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091001170011/http://www.dur.ac.uk/physics.astrolab/draco/roboscope.html DRACO project at Durham University] and [https://archive.is/20070520191007/http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj4/ROY.htm R.O.Y.] (the Robotic Observatory at York), based at [[University of York|York University]].  Project Galileo uses code developed by [http://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?id=542  Dr John Lucey] at [[Durham University]], and ROY is in the process of migrating from Windows-based software to code used by Project Galileo.  All the code being developed is the work of volunteer efforts - if you wish to contribute, please [[#External links| visit the external links]] section below for more details.

Here is a simplified diagram of how the system works:
[[File:How-it-works.jpg|400px|none]]

''In reality, the backend database and control software consist of several systems, including an [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929042024/http://www.opensourcecommunity.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=2 image processing cluster] which is responsible for creating the final processed versions of the raw images that are taken by the telescope.''

'''Social philosophy''' is the study of questions about [[social behavior]] and interpretations of [[society]] and social [[institutions]] in terms of [[Value (ethics)|ethical values]] rather than empirical relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/social%20philosophy | title=Definition of SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social philosophers place new emphasis on understanding the social contexts for political, legal, moral, and cultural questions, and to the development of novel theoretical frameworks, from social ontology to care ethics to cosmopolitan theories of democracy, human rights, gender equity and global justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9833/homepage/ProductInformation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==
There is often a considerable overlap between the questions addressed by social philosophy and [[ethics]] or [[value theory]].  Other forms of social philosophy include [[political philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], which are largely concerned with the societies of [[State (polity)|state]] and [[government]] and their functioning.

Social philosophy, ethics, and political philosophy all share intimate connections with other disciplines in the [[social sciences]].  In turn, the social sciences themselves are of focal interest to the [[philosophy of social science]].

The [[philosophy of language]] and [[social epistemology]] are subfields which overlap in significant ways with social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialphilosophy.yolasite.com/|title=Social Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Cavite State University Main Campus|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22078">In biology, a '''substitution model''' describes the process from which a [[sequence of symbols]] changes into another set of traits. For example, in [[cladistics]], each position in the sequence might correspond to a property of a [[species]] which can either be present or absent. The [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] could then consist of "0" for absence and "1" for presence. Then the sequence 00110 could mean, for example, that a species does not have feathers or lay eggs, does have fur, is warm-blooded, and cannot breathe underwater. Another sequence 11010 would mean that a species has feathers, lays eggs, does not have fur, is warm-blooded, and cannot breathe underwater. In [[phylogenetics]], sequences are often obtained by firstly obtaining a [[nucleotide sequence|nucleotide]] or [[protein sequence]] [[sequence alignment|alignment]], and then taking the [[nucleotide|bases]] or [[amino acid]]s at corresponding positions in the alignment as the characters. Sequences achieved by this might look like AGCGGAGCTTA and GCCGTAGACGC.

Substitution models are used for a number of things:
# Constructing [[evolutionary tree]]s in phylogenetics or cladistics.
# Simulating sequences to test other methods and algorithms.

== Neutral, independent, finite sites models ==
Most substitution models used to date are neutral, independent, finite sites models.
; [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|Neutral]] : [[Natural selection|Selection]] does not operate on the substitutions, and so they are unconstrained.
; [[Statistical independence|Independent]] : Changes in one site do not affect the probability of changes in another site.
; Finite Sites : There are finitely many sites, and so over evolution, a single site can be changed multiple times. This means that, for example, if a character has value 0 at time 0 and at time ''t'', it could be that no changes occurred, or that it changed to a 1 and back to a 0, or that it changed to a 1 and back to a 0 and then to a 1 and then back to a 0, and so on.

== The molecular clock and the units of time ==
Typically, a branch length of a phylogenetic tree is expressed as the expected number of substitutions per site; if the evolutionary model indicates that each site within an ancestral sequence will typically experience ''x'' substitutions by the time it evolves to a particular descendant's sequence then the ancestor and descendant are considered to be separated by branch length ''x''.

Sometimes a branch length is measured in terms of geological years.  For example, a fossil record may make it possible to determine the number of years between an ancestral species and a descendant species.  Because some species evolve at faster rates than others, these two measures of branch length are not always in direct proportion.  The expected number of substitutions per site per year is often indicated with the Greek letter mu (μ).

A model is said to have a strict [[molecular clock]] if the expected number of substitutions per year μ is constant regardless of which species' evolution is being examined.  An important implication of a strict molecular clock is that the number of expected substitutions between an ancestral species and any of its present-day descendants must be independent of which descendant species is examined.

Note that the assumption of a strict molecular clock is often unrealistic, especially across long periods of evolution. For example, even though [[rodent]]s are genetically very similar to [[primate]]s, they have undergone a much higher number of substitutions in the estimated time since divergence in some regions of the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gu X, Li WH |title=Higher rates of amino acid substitution in rodents than in humans |journal=Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=211–4 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1342937 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/1055-7903(92)90017-B |doi=10.1016/1055-7903(92)90017-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be due to their shorter [[generation time]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li WH, Ellsworth DL, Krushkal J, Chang BH, Hewett-Emmett D |title=Rates of nucleotide substitution in primates and rodents and the generation-time effect hypothesis |journal=Mol.

There has been some work on models allowing variable rate of evolution (see for example &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kishino H, Thorne JL, Bruno WJ |title=Performance of a divergence time estimation method under a probabilistic model of rate evolution |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=352–61 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11230536 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11230536 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003811}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thorne JL, Kishino H, Painter IS |title=Estimating the rate of evolution of the rate of molecular evolution |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1647–57 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9866200 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9866200 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025892}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Models that can take into account variability of the rate of the molecular clock between different evolutionary lineages in the phylogeny are called “relaxed” in opposition to “strict”. In such models the rate can be assumed to be correlated or not between ancestors and descendants and rate variation among lineages can be drawn from many distributions but usually exponential and lognormal distributions are applied. There is a special case, called “local molecular clock” when a phylogeny is divided into at least two partitions (sets of lineages) and a strict molecular clock is applied in each, but with different rates.

== Time-reversible and stationary models ==
Many useful substitution models are [[time reversibility|time-reversible]]; in terms of the mathematics, the model does not care which sequence is the ancestor and which is the descendant so long as all other parameters (such as the number of substitutions per site that is expected between the two sequences) are held constant.

When an analysis of real biological data is performed, there is generally no access to the sequences of ancestral species, only to the present-day species.  However, when a model is time-reversible, which species was the ancestral species is irrelevant. Instead, the phylogenetic tree can be rooted using any of the species, re-rooted later based on new knowledge, or left unrooted. This is because there is no 'special' species, all species will eventually derive from one another with the same probability.

A model is time reversible if and only if it satisfies the property (the notation is explained below)
:&lt;math&gt; \pi_iQ_{ij} = \pi_jQ_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;
or, equivalently, the [[detailed balance]] property,
:&lt;math&gt; \pi_iP(t)_{ij} = \pi_jP(t)_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;
for every ''i'', ''j'', and ''t''.

Time-reversibility should not be confused with stationarity.  A model is '''stationary''' if ''Q'' does not change with time.  The analysis below assumes a stationary model.

== The mathematics of substitution models ==
Stationary, neutral, independent, finite sites models (assuming a constant rate of evolution) have two parameters, ''π'', an '''equilibrium vector''' of base (or character) frequencies and a '''rate matrix''', ''Q'', which describes the rate at which bases of one type change into bases of another type; element &lt;math&gt;Q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''j'' is the rate at which base ''i'' goes to base ''j''.  The diagonals of the ''Q'' matrix are chosen so that the rows sum to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{ii} = - {\sum_{\lbrace j \mid j\ne i\rbrace} Q_{ij}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
The equilibrium row vector ''π'' must be annihilated by the rate matrix ''Q'':
:&lt;math&gt;\pi \, Q = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The transition matrix function is a function from the branch lengths (in some units of time, possibly in substitutions), to a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of conditional probabilities. It is denoted &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The entry in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column and the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row, &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is the probability, after time ''t'', that there is a base ''j'' at a given position, conditional on there being a base ''i'' in that position at time 0. When the model is time reversible, this can be performed between any two sequences, even if one is not the ancestor of the other, if you know the total branch length between them.

The asymptotic properties of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(t) are such that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, where δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] function.  That is, there is no change in base composition between a sequence and itself.  At the other extreme, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} P_{ij}(t) = \pi_{j}\,,&lt;/math&gt; or, in other words, as time goes to infinity the probability of finding base ''j'' at a position given there was a base ''i'' at that position originally goes to the equilibrium probability that there is base ''j'' at that position, regardless of the original base.  Furthermore, it follows that &lt;math&gt; \pi P(t) = \pi &lt;/math&gt; for all ''t''.

The transition matrix can be computed from the rate matrix via [[matrix exponential|matrix exponentiation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = e^{Qt} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty Q^n\frac{t^n}{n!}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the matrix ''Q'' multiplied by itself enough times to give its ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power.

If ''Q'' is [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]], the matrix exponential can be [[Matrix exponential#Diagonalizable case|computed]] directly: let ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Λ&amp;nbsp;''U'' be a diagonalization of ''Q'', with
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda_1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \ldots &amp; \lambda_4
\end{pmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
where Λ is a diagonal matrix and where &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \lambda_i \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of ''Q'', each repeated according to its multiplicity.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = e^{Qt} = e^{U^{-1} (\Lambda t) U} = U^{-1} e^{\Lambda t}\,U\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the diagonal matrix ''e''&lt;sup&gt;Λt&lt;/sup&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\Lambda t} = \begin{pmatrix}
e^{\lambda_1 t} &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \ldots &amp; e^{\lambda_4 t}
\end{pmatrix}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

== GTR: Generalised time reversible ==
GTR is the most general neutral, independent, finite-sites, time-reversible model possible. It was first described in a general form by [[Simon Tavaré]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Tavare1986"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tavaré S |title=Some Probabilistic and Statistical Problems in the Analysis of DNA Sequences |journal=Lectures on Mathematics in the Life Sciences |volume=17 |pages=57–86 |url=http://www.cmb.usc.edu/people/stavare/STpapers-pdf/T86.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTR parameters for nucleotides consist of an equilibrium base frequency vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec{\pi} = (\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3, \pi_4)&lt;/math&gt;, giving the frequency at which each base occurs at each site, and the rate matrix

: &lt;math&gt;Q = \begin{pmatrix} {-(x_1+x_2+x_3)} &amp; x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_3 \\ {\pi_1 x_1 \over \pi_2} &amp; {-({\pi_1 x_1 \over \pi_2} + x_4 + x_5)} &amp; x_4 &amp; x_5 \\ {\pi_1 x_2 \over \pi_3} &amp; {\pi_2 x_4 \over \pi_3} &amp; {-({\pi_1 x_2 \over \pi_3} + {\pi_2 x_4 \over \pi_3} + x_6)} &amp; x_6 \\  {\pi_1 x_3 \over \pi_4} &amp; {\pi_2 x_5 \over \pi_4} &amp; {\pi_3 x_6 \over \pi_4} &amp; {-({\pi_1 x_3 \over \pi_4} + {\pi_2 x_5 \over \pi_4} + {\pi_3 x_6 \over \pi_4})} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Because the model must be time reversible and must approach the equilibrium nucleotide (base) frequencies at long times, each rate below the diagonal equals the reciprocal rate above the diagonal multiplied by the equilibrium ratio of the two bases. As such, the nucleotide GTR requires 6 substitution rate parameters and 4 equilibrium base frequency parameters. Since the 4 frequency parameters must sum to 1, there are only 3 free frequency parameters. The total of 9 free parameters is often further reduced to 8 parameters plus &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the overall number of substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;=1) only 8 free parameters remain.

In general, to compute the number of parameters, you count the number of entries above the diagonal in the matrix, i.e. for n trait values per site &lt;math&gt;{{n^2-n} \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;, and then add ''n-1'' for the equilibrium frequencies, and subtract 1 because &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is fixed. You get

: &lt;math&gt;{{n^2-n} \over 2} + (n - 1) - 1 = {1 \over 2}n^2 + {1 \over 2}n - 2.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, for an amino acid sequence (there are 20 "standard" amino acids that make up [[proteins]]), you would find there are 208 parameters. However, when studying coding regions of the genome, it is more common to work with a [[codon]] substitution model (a codon is three bases and codes for one amino acid in a protein). There are &lt;math&gt;4^3 = 64&lt;/math&gt; codons, resulting in 2078 free parameters, but when the rates for transitions between codons which differ by more than one base are assumed to be zero, then there are only &lt;math&gt;{{20 \times 19 \times 3} \over 2} + 63 - 1 = 632&lt;/math&gt; parameters.

== Mechanistic vs. empirical models ==

A main difference in evolutionary models is how many parameters are estimated every time for the data set under
consideration and how many of them are estimated once on a large data set. 
Mechanistic models describe all substitutions as a function of a number of parameters which are estimated for every 
data set analyzed, preferably using [[maximum likelihood]]. This has the advantage that the model can be adjusted to the particularities of a specific data set (e.g. different composition biases in DNA). Problems can arise when too many
parameters are used, particularly if they can compensate for each other. Then it is often the case that the data set is too small to yield enough information to estimate all parameters accurately.

Empirical models are created by estimating many parameters (typically all entries of the rate matrix and the character frequencies, see the GTR model above) from a large data set. These parameters are then fixed and will be
reused for every data set. This has the advantage that those parameters can be estimated more accurately. Normally, it
is not possible to estimate all entries of the substitution matrix from the current data set only. On the downside,
the estimated parameters might be too generic and do not fit a particular data set well enough.

With the large-scale genome sequencing still producing very large amounts of DNA and protein sequences, there is
enough data available to create empirical models with any number of parameters. Because of the problems mentioned above, the two approaches are often combined, by estimating most of the parameters once on large-scale data, while a few remaining parameters are then adjusted to the data set under consideration. The following sections give an overview of the different approaches taken for DNA, protein or codon-based models.

== Models of DNA substitution ==

See main article: '''[[Models of DNA evolution]]''' for more formal descriptions of the DNA models.

Models of DNA evolution were first proposed in 1969 by Jukes and Cantor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jukes, T.H., Cantor, C.R. |chapter=Evolution of protein molecules |editor=Munro, H.N. |title=Mammalian protein metabolism |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1969 |pages=21–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assuming equal transition rates as well as equal equilibrium frequencies for all bases. In 1980 [[Motoo Kimura|Kimura]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kimura M |title=A simple method for estimating evolutionary rates of base substitutions through comparative studies of nucleotide sequences |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=111–20 |date=December 1980 |pmid=7463489 |doi=10.1007/BF01731581}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a model with two parameters: one for the transition and one for the transversion rate and in 1981, Felsenstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein J |title=Evolutionary trees from DNA sequences: a maximum likelihood approach |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=368–76 |year=1981 |pmid=7288891  |doi=10.1007/BF01734359}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a four-parameter model in which the substitution rate corresponds to the equilibrium frequency of the target nucleotide. Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano (HKY)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasegawa M, Kishino H, Yano T |title=Dating of the human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=160–74 |year=1985 |pmid=3934395 |doi=10.1007/BF02101694}}&lt;/ref&gt; unified the two last models to a five-parameter model. In the 1990s, models similar to HKY were developed and refined by several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tamura K |title=Estimation of the number of nucleotide substitutions when there are strong transition-transversion and G+C-content biases |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=678–87 |date=July 1992 |pmid=1630306 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1630306|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tamura K, Nei M |title=Estimation of the number of nucleotide substitutions in the control region of mitochondrial DNA in humans and chimpanzees |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=512–26 |date=May 1993 |pmid=8336541 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8336541|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halpern |first1=AL |last2=Bruno |first2=WJ |title=Evolutionary distances for protein-coding sequences: modeling site-specific residue frequencies |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=910–7 |date=July 1998 | pmid=9656490 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For DNA substitution models, mainly mechanistic models (as described above) are employed. The small number of parameters
to estimate makes this feasible, but also DNA is often highly optimized for specific purposes (e.g. fast [[Gene expression|expression]] or stability) depending on the organism and the type of gene, making it necessary to adjust the model to these circumstances.

== Models of amino acid substitutions ==

For many analyses, particularly for longer evolutionary distances, the evolution is modeled on the amino acid level. Since not
all DNA substitution also alter the encoded amino acid, information is lost when looking at amino acids instead of nucleotide
bases. However, several advantages speak in favor of using the amino acid information: DNA is much more inclined to show 
[[compositional bias]] than amino acids, not all positions in the DNA evolve at the same speed ([[Missense mutation|non-synonymous]] mutations
are less likely to become fixed in the population than synonymous ones), but probably most important, because of those
fast evolving positions and the limited alphabet size (only four possible states), the DNA suffers much more from back 
substitutions, making it difficult to accurately estimate longer distances.

Unlike the DNA models, amino acid models traditionally are empirical models. They were pioneered in the 1970s by Dayhoff and co-workers
,&lt;ref name="Dayhoff1978"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dayhoff MO, Schwartz RM, Orcutt BC |title=A model for evolutionary change in proteins |journal=Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure |volume=5 |pages=345–352 |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; by estimating replacement rates from protein alignments with at least 85% identity. This minimized the chances of observing multiple substitutions at a site. From the estimated rate matrix, a series of replacement probability matrices were derived, known under names such as [[Point accepted mutation|PAM]]250. The Dayhoff model was used to assess the significance of homology search results, but also for phylogenetic analyses. The Dayhoff PAM matrices were based on relatively few alignments (since more were not available at that time), but in the 1990s, new matrices were estimated using almost the same methodology, but based on the large protein databases available then (,&lt;ref name="Gonnet1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gonnet GH, Cohen MA, Benner SA |title=Exhaustive matching of the entire protein sequence database |journal=Science |volume=256 |pages=1443–5 |year=1992 |doi=10.1126/science.1604319 |pmid=1604319 |issue=5062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones DT, Taylor WR, Thornton JM |title=The rapid generation of mutation data matrices from protein sequences |journal=Comput Appl Biosci |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=275–282 |year=1992 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/8.3.275}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being known as "JTT" matrices).

'''Trial by ordeal''' was an ancient judicial practice by which the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by subjecting them to a painful, or at least an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. The test was one of life or death, and the proof of innocence was survival. In some cases, the accused was considered innocent if they escaped injury or if their injuries healed.

In [[medieval Europe]], like [[trial by combat]], trial by ordeal was considered a "judgement of God" ({{lang-la|judicium Dei}}): a procedure based on the premise that [[God]] would help the innocent by performing a miracle on his behalf. The practice has much earlier roots, attested to as far back as the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].

In pre-modern society, the ordeal typically ranked along with the [[oath]] and [[witness]] accounts as the central means by which to reach a judicial verdict. Indeed, the term ''ordeal'', [[Old English]] ''ordǣl'', has the meaning of "judgment, verdict" (German ''Urteil'', Dutch ''oordeel''), from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*uzdailjam'' "that which is dealt out".

Priestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by [[Pope Innocent III]] at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215 and replaced by [[compurgation]]. Trials by ordeal became rarer over the [[Late Middle Ages]], but the practice was not discontinued until the 16th century. Certain trials by ordeal would continue to be used into the 17th century in [[witch-hunt]]s.&lt;ref name="CathEnc" /&gt;

==Types of ordeals==

===By combat===
{{main|Trial by combat}}
Ordeal by combat took place between two people in a dispute. They, or, under certain conditions, a designated "champion" acting on their behalf, would fight, and the loser of the fight or the party represented by the losing champion was deemed guilty or liable.

A notable case was that of [[Gero, Count of Alsleben]], whose daughter married [[Siegfried II, Count of Stade]].

===By fire===
[[File:Ordeal by red-hot iron.jpg|thumb|200px|After being accused of adultery [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] proved her innocence by walking over red-hot [[ploughshare]]s.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}Ordeal by fire was one form of torture. Ordeal of fire typically required that the accused walk a certain distance, usually {{convert|9|ft|abbr=off}} or a certain number of paces, usually three, over [[Incandescence|red-hot]] [[ploughshare]]s or holding a red-hot [[iron]]. Innocence was sometimes established by a complete lack of injury, but it was more common for the wound to be bandaged and re-examined three days later by a priest, who would pronounce that God had intervened to heal it, or that it was merely festering&amp;mdash;in which case the suspect would be [[exile]]d or put to death. One famous story about the ordeal of ploughshares concerns [[Edward the Confessor]]'s mother, [[Emma of Normandy]]. According to legend, she was accused of [[adultery]] with Bishop [[Ælfwine of Winchester]], but proved her innocence by walking barefoot unharmed over burning ploughshares.

[[File:Gustave dore crusades barthelemi undergoing the ordeal of fire.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Bartholomew]] undergoing the ordeal of fire, by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

During the [[First Crusade]], the mystic [[Peter Bartholomew]] allegedly went through the ordeal by fire in 1099 by his own choice to disprove a charge that his claimed discovery of the [[Holy Lance]] was fraudulent. He died as a result of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades: Volume 1, The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Trial by ordeal was adopted in the 13th century by the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]; Michael Angold speculates this legal innovation was most likely through "the numerous western mercenaries in Byzantine service both before and after 1204."&lt;ref&gt;Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'', (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to prove the innocence of the accused in cases of treason and use of magic to affect the health of the emperor. The most famous case where this employed was when [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] was accused of treason: he avoided enduring the red-iron by saying he would only hold it if the [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] could take the iron from the altar with his own hands and hand it to him.&lt;ref&gt;Denno J. Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West'' (Harvard University Press, 1959), pp. 23f&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Byzantines viewed trial of ordeal with disgust and considered it a barbarian innovation at odds with [[Byzantine law]] and ecclesiastical canons. Angold notes, "Its abolition by Michael Palaiologos was universally acclaimed."&lt;ref&gt;Angold, ''Byzantine Government'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]], the leader of a reform movement in Florence who claimed apocalyptic prophetic visions, attempted to prove the divine sanction of his mission by undergoing a trial by fire. The first of its kind for over 400 years, the trial was a fiasco for Savonarola, since a sudden rain doused the flames, canceling the event, and was taken by onlookers as a sign from God against him. The Holy Inquisition arrested him shortly thereafter, with Savonarola convicted of heresy and hanged at the Piazza della Signoria in Florence.

Ordeal by fire ([[Persian language|Persian]]:'''ور''' ) was also used for judiciary purposes in [[ancient Iran]]. Persons accused of cheating in contracts or lying might be asked to prove their innocence by ordeal of fire as an ultimate test. Two examples of such an ordeal include the accused having to pass through fire, or having molten metal poured on his chest. There were about 30 of these kinds of fiery tests in all. If the accused died, he was held to have been guilty; if survived, he was innocent, having been protected by [[Mithra]] and the other gods. The most simple form of such ordeals required the accused to take an oath, then drink a potion of [[sulphur]] ([[Avestan language]] ''saokant'', [[Middle Persian]] ''sōgand'', [[Modern Persian]] ''sowgand''). They thought fire has an association with truth, and hence with [[asha]].&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire | title=Ātaš | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation | accessdate=24 September 2013 | last=Boyce | first=Mary | year=2001 | volume=3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014545/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient India, the trial by fire was known as ''agnipariksha'', in which [[Agni]], the Fire God, would be invoked by a priest using mantras. After the invocation, a [[pyre]] is built and lit, and the accused would be asked to sit on it. According to Hindu Mythology, the Fire God would preserve the accused if he was innocent, if not, he would be burned to ashes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===By water===
====Hot water====
First mentioned in the 6th-century ''[[Lex Salica]]'', the ordeal of hot water required the accused to dip his hand in a kettle or pot of boiling water (sometimes oil or lead was used instead) and retrieve a stone. The assessment of the injury and the consequences of a miracle or lack of one, followed a similar procedure to that described above. An early (non-judicial) example of the test was described by [[Gregory of Tours]] in the late 6th century. He describes how a Catholic saint, Hyacinth, bested an [[Arianism|Arian]] rival by plucking a stone from a boiling [[cauldron]]. Gregory said that it took Hyacinth about an hour to complete the task (because the waters were bubbling so ferociously), but he was pleased to record that when the [[heresy|heretic]] tried, he had the skin boiled off up to his elbow.

Legal texts from reign of [[King Athelstan]] provide some of the most elaborate royal regulations for the use of the ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England, though the period's fullest account of ordeal practices is found in an anonymous legal text written some time in the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, ''The Making of English Law: King Alfred to the Twelfth Century, Vol I: Legislation and its Limits'' (Oxford, 1999), pp.373-4&lt;/ref&gt; According to this text, usually given the title ''Ordal'', the water had to be close to boiling temperature, and the depth from which the stone had to be retrieved was up to the wrist for a 'one-fold' ordeal and up to the elbow for a 'three-fold' ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;F. Liebermann, ''Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen vol. I: Text und Übersetzung'' (Halle, 1903), p.386&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between the one-fold and three-fold ordeal appears to be based on the severity of the crime, with the three-fold ordeal being prescribed for more severe offences such as treachery or for notorious criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, ''Papers Preparatory to the Making of English Law, vol. II: From God's Law to Common Law'', ed. Stephen Baxter and John Hudson (2014), pp.78-9 at {{cite web |url=http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141001090436/http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/ |archivedate=2014-10-01 |df= }}. See for example, II As 4, 5, 6.1, I Atr 1.1, III Atr 3.4, V Atr 30, VI Atr 37, II Cn 30 all in Liebermann, ''Gesetze vol 1''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal would take place in the church, with several in attendance, purified and praying God to reveal the truth. Afterwards, the hand was bound and examined after three days to see whether it was healing or [[festering]].&lt;ref name="KingAthelstan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp#The%20Laws%20of%20King%20Athelstan | title=The Laws of King Athelstan 924-939 A.D. | publisher=Fordham University | work=Internet Medieval Sourcebook | date=21 June 1998 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | editor-first1=Paul | editor-last1=Halsall | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006150341/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp#The%20Laws%20of%20King%20Athelstan | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was still a practice of 12th-century Catholic churches. A suspect would place his hand in the boiling water. If after three days God had not healed his wounds, the suspect was guilty of the crime.&lt;ref name="WaterOrdeal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/water-ordeal.html | title=Ordeal of Boiling Water, 12th or 13th Century | publisher=Fordham University | work=Internet Medieval Sourcebook | date=January 1996 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | editor-first1=Paul | editor-last1=Halsall | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108084524/http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/water-ordeal.html | archivedate=8 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ordeal of water.jpg|thumb|Water-ordeal. Engraving, 17th century.]]
Trial by ordeal mostly took place in a church because it was believed that God could watch over and decide if they were innocent.

====Cold water====
The ordeal of cold water has a precedent in the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] and the [[Code of Hammurabi]], under which a man accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] was to be submerged in a stream and acquitted if he survived. The practice was also set out in Frankish law but was abolished by [[Louis the Pious]] in 829. The practice reappeared in the [[Late Middle Ages]]: in the ''[[Dreieicher Wildbann]]'' of 1338, a man accused of [[poaching]] was to be submerged in a [[barrel]] three times and to be considered innocent if he sank, and guilty if he floated.

====Witch-hunts====
Ordeal by water was later associated with the [[witch-hunt]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, although in this scenario the outcome was an accused who sank was considered innocent, while floating indicated [[witchcraft]]. [[Demonologists]] developed inventive new theories about how it worked. The ordeal would normally be conducted with a rope holding the subject connected to assistants sitting in a boat or the like, so that the person being tested could be pulled in if he/she did not float; the notion that the ordeal was flatly devised as a situation without any possibility of live acquittal, even if the outcome was 'innocent', is a modern exaggeration{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Some argued that witches floated because they had renounced [[baptism]] when entering the [[Devil]]'s service. Jacob Rickius claimed that they were supernaturally light and recommended weighing them as an alternative to dunking them; this procedure and its status as an alternative to dunking were parodied in the 1975 British film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.&lt;ref name="źaJermaine1866"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/superstitionand05leagoog | title=Superstition and Force | publisher=Collins, Printer | author=Lea, Henry C. | authorlink=Henry Charles Lea | year=1866 | location=Philadelphia | oclc=18128359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James I of England|King James VI of Scotland]] (later also James I of England) claimed in his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty. A witch trial including this ordeal took place in [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]] as late as 1728.&lt;!--Original reference text: Böhmer, ''ius eccles.'' -- If someone can find the actual page, then please add it--&gt;&lt;ref name="Boehmer"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3BMAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Jus ecclesiasticum protestantium | publisher=Impensis Orphanotrophei | last=Böhmer | first=Justus Henning | authorlink=Justus Henning Böhmer | language=Latin | ol=17577078M | year=1744 | location=Halle-Magdeburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal of water is also contemplated by the [[Vishnu Smrti]],&lt;ref name="Jolly1880" /&gt; which is one of the texts of the [[Dharmaśāstra]].&lt;ref name="Jolly1880"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=XII | chapterurl=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe07/sbe07014.htm | editor1-first=F.

===By cross===
The ordeal of the cross was apparently introduced in the [[Early Middle Ages]] in an attempt to discourage [[judicial duels]] among [[Germanic peoples]]. As with judicial duels, and unlike most other ordeals, the accuser had to undergo the ordeal together with the accused. They stood on either side of a cross and stretched out their hands horizontally. The one to first lower his arms lost. This ordeal was prescribed by [[Charlemagne]] in 779 and again in 806. A capitulary of [[Louis the Pious]] in 819&lt;ref name="MGH"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=VII. Hludowici Pii Capitularia 814-837 | editor1-first=Alfredus | editor1-last=Boretius | editor1-link=:de:Alfred Boretius | title=[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Capitularia regum Francorum I | publisher=Societas Aperiendis Fontibus Rerum Germa | year=1883 | location=Hannover | page=279 | language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decree of [[Lothar I]], recorded in 876, abolished the ordeal so as to avoid the mockery of Christ.

===By ingestion===
{{Main|Corsned}}
[[Franconia]]n law prescribed that an accused was to be given dry bread and cheese blessed by a priest. If he choked on the food, he was considered guilty. This was transformed into the ordeal of the [[Eucharist]] (trial by sacrament) mentioned by [[Regino of Prüm]] ca. 900:AD; the accused was to take the oath of innocence. It was believed that if the oath had been false, the person would die within the same year.

Both versions are essentially the opposite of ordeals, as they rely on the guilty parties' self-incrimination, while providing what amounts to a presumption of innocence. They are designed to be harmless and merciful. For how it was used in [[Anglo-Saxon]] England, see [[Corsned]].

[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 5:12&amp;ndash;27 prescribes that a woman suspected of adultery—one called a ''[[Sotah]]'' in later commentaries—should be made to swallow "[[Ordeal of the bitter water|the bitter water that causeth the curse]]" by the priest in order to determine her guilt. The accused would be condemned only if 'her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot'. One writer has recently argued that the procedure has a rational basis, envisioning punishment only upon clear proof of [[pregnancy]] (a swelling belly) or [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] (a rotting thigh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Trial: A History from Socrates to O.J.

===By poison===
[[File:Tangena trial by ordeal Madagascar.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=in an ominous and dark tropical forest, a person lays on the ground, surrounded by men with spears, as a crowd looks on|A 19th-century artist's depiction of the ''[[tangena]]'' ordeal in Madagascar]]
Some cultures, such as the [[Efik people|Efik Uburutu]] people of present-day [[Nigeria]], would administer the poisonous [[Calabar bean]] (''Physostigma venenosum''; known as ''esere'' in  [[Ibibio language|Efik]]) in an attempt to detect guilt. A defendant who vomited up the bean was innocent. A defendant who became ill or died was considered guilty.&lt;ref name=FloraDelaterre&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delaterre|first1=Flora|title=Calabar Bean|url=http://www.floradelaterre.com/?id=19|website=Flora Delaterre The Plant Detective|accessdate=10 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512223614/http://www.floradelaterre.com/?id=19|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of [[Madagascar]] could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity, and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of ''[[tangena]]'' was routinely obligatory. In the 1820s, ingestion of the poisonous nut caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861.&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar | date=October 1991 | last=Campbell | first=Gwyn | journal=Journal of African History | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=415&amp;ndash;445 | jstor=182662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early modern Europe, the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] was unofficially used as a form of poison ordeal: a suspected party was forced to take the [[Eucharist]] on the grounds that, if he was guilty, he would be eternally damned, and hence his willingness to take the test would give an indication of his guilt.&lt;ref name="Thomas1971"&gt;{{cite book | title=Religion and the Decline of Magic | publisher=Folio Society | authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) | year=2012 | location=London | origyear=1st pub. 1971 | page=42 | oclc=805007047 | first1=Keith | last1=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By boiling oil===
Trial by boiling oil has been practiced in villages in certain parts of [[West Africa]], such as [[Togo]].&lt;ref name="Togo_oil"&gt;{{cite episode | url=http://www.tv.com/taboo/justice/episode/931067/summary.html | title=Justice | series=[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]] | network=National Geographic | airdate=6 October 2003 | season=2 | number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main alternatives of this trial. In one version, the accused parties are ordered to retrieve an item from a container of boiling oil, with those who refuse the task being found guilty.&lt;ref name="India_oil"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/men-undergo-trial-by-boiling-oil-over-stolen-food-78929.html | title=Men undergo trial by boiling water over stolen food | work=The Irish Independent | date=19 September 2006 | location=Dublin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015023315/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/men-undergo-trial-by-boiling-oil-over-stolen-food-78929.html | archivedate=15 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other version of the trial, both the accused and the accuser have to retrieve an item from boiling oil, with the person or persons whose hand remains unscathed being declared innocent.&lt;ref name="Togo_oil"/&gt;

===By turf===
An [[Iceland]]ic ordeal tradition involves the accused walking under a piece of turf. If the turf falls on the accused's head, the accused person is pronounced guilty.&lt;ref name="Miller1988"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ordeal in Iceland | journal=Scandinavian Studies | year=1988 | volume=60 | issue=2 | pages=189–218 | jstor=40918943 | first1=William Ian | last1=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English common law==
The ordeals of fire and water in England likely have their origin in Frankish tradition, as the earliest mention of the ordeal of the cauldron is in the first [[recension]] of the [[Salic Law]] in 510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial by cauldron was an ancient Frankish custom used against both freedmen and slaves in cases of theft, false witness and contempt of court, where the accused was made to plunge his right hand into a boiling cauldron and pull out a ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=4, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Frankish influence spread throughout Europe, ordeal by cauldron spread to neighboring societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references of ordeal by cauldron in the British Isles occurs in Irish law in the seventh century, but it is unlikely that this tradition shares roots with the Frankish tradition that is likely the source of trial by fire and water among the Anglo-Saxons and later the Normans in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], king of the West Saxons, produced around 690, contains the earliest reference to ordeal in Anglo-Saxon law; however, this is the last and only mention of ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England until the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest of 1066]], the Old English customs of proof were repeated anew and in more detailed fashion by the Normans, but the only notable innovation of the ordeal by the conquerors was the introduction of the trial by battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, minor conflicts between the customs of the Anglo-Saxons and the customs Normans that were typically resolved in ways that favored the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous story from [[Eadmer]]'s ''Historia novorum in Anglia'', [[William Rufus]] expresses skepticism about the ordeal after fifty men accused of forest offenses were exonerated by the ordeal of hot iron. In this story, Rufus states that he will take judgment from God's hands into his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this skepticism was not universally shared by the intellectuals of the day, and [[Eadmer]] depicts Rufus as irreligious for rejecting the legitimacy of the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the ordeal in medieval England was very sensitive to status and reputation in the community. The laws of [[Canute]] distinguish between "men of good repute" who were able to clear themselves by their own oath, "untrustworthy men" who required [[compurgation|compurgators]], and untrustworthy men who cannot find compurgators who must go to the ordeal. One of the laws of [[Ethelred the Unready]] declared that untrustworthy men were to be sent to the triple ordeal, that is, an ordeal of hot iron where the iron is three times heavier than that used in the simple ordeal, unless his lord and two other knights swear that he has not been accused of a crime recently, in which case he would be sent to an ordinary ordeal of hot iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other European societies, the English rarely employed the ordeal in non-criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandatory use of the ordeal in certain criminal proceedings appears to date from the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Richard D.|last3=Plyley|first3=Michael J.|title=Cold Water and Hot Iron: Trial by Ordeal in England|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=1992|volume=22|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.2307/205237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to then, compurgation was the most usual method of proof, and the ordeal was used in cases where there was some presumption of guilt against the accused or when the accused was bound to fail in compurgation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Richard D.|last3=Plyley|first3=Michael J.|title=Cold Water and Hot Iron: Trial by Ordeal in England|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=1992|volume=22|issue=4|page=3|doi=10.2307/205237}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction was made between those accused ''fama publica'' (by public outcry) and those accused on the basis of specific facts. Those accused ''fama publica'' were able to exculpate themselves by means of compurgation, whereas those accused on the basis of specific facts and those who were thought to have bad character were made to undergo the ordeal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groot|first1=Roger D.|title=The Jury of Presentment Before 1215|journal=The American Journal of Legal History|date=1982|volume=26|issue=1|page=23|doi=10.2307/844604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assize of Clarendon declared that all those said by a jury of presentment to be "accused or notoriously suspect" of robbery, thievery, or murder or of receiving anyone who had committed such a wrong were to be put to the ordeal of water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These juries of presentment were the [[Hundred (county division)#Hundred courts|hundred juries]] and [[vill]]s, and these groups, in effect, made the intermediate decision of whether an accused person would face the more final judgment of the ordeal. These bodies rendered "verdicts" of either suspected or not suspected. In cases where the defendant was accused on the basis of one or more specific facts, the defendant was sent to the ordeal upon the verdict of the hundred jury alone. In cases where the defendant was accused ''fama publica'', the agreement of the hundred jurors and the vills as to the defendant's suspicion was required to send him to the ordeal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, the intermediate accusation of the juries could still be considered final in some sense as any person who was accused of murder by the juries was required to leave the realm even if he was exonerated by the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215, clergy were forbidden to participate in ordeals by the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. The English plea rolls contain no cases of trial by ordeal after 1219, when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] recognized its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suppression ==

[[Pope]]s were generally opposed to ordeals, although there are some apocryphal accounts describing their cooperation with the practice.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ordeals}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first there was no general decree against ordeals, and they were only declared unlawful in individual cases.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; Eventually [[Pope Innocent III]] in [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) promulgated a canon forbidding blessing of participants before ordeals.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; This decision was followed by further prohibitions by [[synod]]s in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (1194-1250AD) was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered ''irrational'' ([[Constitutions of Melfi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore?|url=http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053347/http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stupormundi.it/it/ma-limperatore-svevo-fu-conservatore-o-innovatore|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore? - Stupor Mundi|author=|date=|website=www.stupormundi.it|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202422/http://www.stupormundi.it/it/ma-limperatore-svevo-fu-conservatore-o-innovatore|archivedate=26 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, things started to change with [[Henry III of England]] (1220).

From the twelfth century, the ordeals started to be generally disapproved and they were discontinued during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. However, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries some kinds of ordeals were once again used in [[witch-hunt]]s.&lt;ref name="CathEnc" /&gt;

==Theoretical approaches==

According to a theory put forward by economics professor [[Peter Leeson]], trial by ordeal may have been effective at sorting the guilty from the innocent.&lt;ref name="Leeson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Peter T. | last1=Leeson | url=http://www.peterleeson.com/Ordeals.pdf | title=Ordeals | accessdate=3 October 2014 | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | date=August 2012 | volume=55 | issue=3 | pages=691–714 | jstor=10.1086/664010 | author-link1=Peter Leeson | doi=10.1086/664010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117110839/http://www.peterleeson.com/Ordeals.pdf | archivedate=17 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the assumption that defendants were believers in divine intervention for the innocent, then only the truly innocent would choose to endure a trial; guilty defendants would confess or settle cases instead. Therefore, the theory goes, church and judicial authorities could routinely rig ordeals so that the participants—presumably innocent—could pass them.&lt;ref name="Leeson2010"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/01/31/justice_medieval_style/ | title=Justice, medieval style | work=Boston Sunday Globe | date=31 January 2010 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | first1=Peter | last1=Leeson | location=Boston, Massachusetts | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114539/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/01/31/justice_medieval_style/ | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To support this theory, Leeson points to the great latitude given to the priests in administering the ordeal and interpreting the results of the ordeal. He also points to the overall high exoneration rate of accused persons undergoing the ordeal, when intuitively one would expect a very high proportion of people carrying a red hot iron to be badly burned and thus fail the ordeal.&lt;ref name="Leeson2012"/&gt; 
[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] explains the persistence and eventual withering of the ordeal by stating that it helped promote consensus in a society where people lived in close quarters and there was little centralized power. In a world where "the sacred penetrated into the chinks of the profane and vice-versa" the ordeal was a "controlled miracle" that served as a point of consensus when one of the greatest dangers to the community was feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change|journal=Daedalus|date=Spring 1975|volume=104|issue=2|pages=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this analysis, Brown argues that the increasing authoritativeness of the state lessened the need and desire for the ordeal as an instrument of consensus, which ultimately led to its disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change|journal=Daedalus|date=Spring 1975|volume=104|issue=2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Very-large-scale integration''' ('''VLSI''') is the process of creating an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) by combining hundreds of thousands of [[transistors]] or devices into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex [[semiconductor]] and [[communication]] technologies were being developed. The [[microprocessor]] is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An [[electronic circuit]] might consist of a [[central processing unit|CPU]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and other [[glue logic]]. VLSI lets IC designers add all of these [[system on chip|into one chip]].

== History ==

The [[history of the transistor]] dates to the 1920s when several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid-state diodes and convert them into triodes.  Success came after World War II, when the use of silicon and germanium crystals as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and theory.  Scientists who had worked on radar returned to solid-state device development.  With the invention of transistors at Bell Labs in 1947, the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solid-state device.

With the small transistor at their hands, electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits.  However, as the complexity of circuits grew, problems arose.&lt;ref name="The History of the Integrated Circuit" /&gt;
 
One problem was the size of the circuit. A complex circuit like a computer was dependent on speed.  If the components were large, the wires interconnecting them must be long.  The electric signals took time to go through the circuit, thus slowing the computer.&lt;ref name="The History of the Integrated Circuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Integrated Circuit|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/integrated_circuit/history/|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=21 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[invention of the integrated circuit]] by [[Jack Kilby]] and [[Robert Noyce]] solved this problem by making all the components and the chip out of the same block (monolith) of semiconductor material.  The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated.  This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single-crystal silicon wafer, which led to small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s, and then large-scale integration (LSI) as well as VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, with tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;)).

==Developments==
The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, and as a consequence, more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, perhaps as many as ten [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s, making it possible to fabricate one or more [[logic gate]]s on a single device. Now known retrospectively as ''[[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|small-scale integration]]'' (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as ''[[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|medium-scale integration]]'' (MSI). Further improvements led to ''[[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|large-scale integration]]'' (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today's [[microprocessor]]s have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors.

At one time, there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI. Terms like ''[[Integrated circuit#ULSI, WSI, SOC and 3D-IC|ultra-large-scale integration]]'' (ULSI) were used. But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot. Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use.

In 2008, billion-transistor processors became commercially available. This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the then-current generation of [[65 nanometer|65&amp;nbsp;nm]] processes. Current designs, unlike the earliest devices, use extensive [[Electronic Design Automation|design automation]] and automated [[logic synthesis]] to [[integrated circuit layout|lay out]] the transistors, enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality. Certain high-performance logic blocks like the SRAM ([[static random-access memory]]) cell, are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency.

== Structured design ==
Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by [[Carver Mead]] and [[Lynn Conway]] for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using [[wiring by abutment]]. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells. In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting.&lt;ref name="Digital Electronics - A Modern Approach by B K Jain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Electronics - A Modern Approach by B K Jain|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=R5XBozPiTHAC&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;ots=fY1kD_pDL-&amp;dq=structured%20vlsi%20design%20hierarchical%20nesting&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s, but lost its popularity later because of the advent of [[Place and route|placement and routing]] tools wasting a lot of area by [[Routing (electronic design automation)|routing]], which is tolerated because of the progress of [[Moore's Law]]. When introducing the [[hardware description language]] KARL in the mid' 1970s, [[Reiner Hartenstein]] coined the term "structured VLSI design" (originally as "structured LSI design"), echoing [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s [[structured programming]] approach by procedure nesting to avoid chaotic ''spaghetti-structured'' program

== Difficulties ==
As microprocessors become more complex due to [[Moore's law|technology scaling]], microprocessor designers have encountered several challenges which force them to think beyond the design plane, and look ahead to post-silicon:

* '''Process variation''' – As [[photolithography]] techniques get closer to the fundamental laws of optics, achieving high accuracy in [[dopant|doping]] concentrations and etched wires is becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation. Designers now must simulate across multiple fabrication [[process corners]] before a chip is certified ready for production, or use system-level techniques for dealing with effects of variation.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285926063_A_Survey_Of_Architectural_Techniques_for_Managing_Process_Variation A Survey Of Architectural Techniques for Managing Process Variation]", ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stricter design rules''' – Due to lithography and etch issues with scaling, [[design rule checking|design rules]] for [[Integrated circuit layout|layout]] have become increasingly stringent. Designers must keep in mind an ever increasing list of rules when laying out custom circuits. The overhead for custom design is now reaching a tipping point, with many design houses opting to switch to [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) tools to automate their design process.
* '''[[Design closure|Timing/design closure]]''' – As [[clock frequency|clock frequencies]] tend to scale up, designers are finding it more difficult to distribute and maintain low [[clock skew]] between these high frequency clocks across the entire chip. This has led to a rising interest in [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] and [[multiprocessor]] architectures, since an [[Amdahl's law|overall speedup]] can be obtained even with lower clock frequency by using the computational power of all the cores.
* '''First-pass success''' – As [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] sizes shrink (due to scaling), and [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] sizes go up (due to lower manufacturing costs), the number of dies per wafer increases, and the complexity of making suitable [[photomask]]s goes up rapidly.  A [[mask set]] for a modern technology can cost several million dollars. This non-recurring expense deters the old iterative philosophy involving several "spin-cycles" to find errors in silicon, and encourages first-pass silicon success. Several design philosophies have been developed to aid this new design flow, including design for manufacturing ([[Design for manufacturability (IC)|DFM]]), design for test ([[Design for Test|DFT]]), and [[Design for X]].

'''Xylem''' is one of the two types of transport [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in [[vascular plant]]s, [[phloem]] being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport [[water]] from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports  [[plant nutrition|nutrients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purcell|first1=Adam|title=Xylem and phloem|url=https://www.basicbiology.net/plants/physiology/xylem-phloem/|website=Basic Biology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504195130/https://www.basicbiology.net/plants/physiology/xylem-phloem/|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Plant Science |volume= 1 |editor= Keith Roberts |edition= illustrated |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2007 |isbn= 9780470057230 |page= 185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "xylem" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ξύλον}} (''xylon''), meaning "wood"; the best-known xylem tissue is [[wood]], though it is found throughout the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Providing for Energy: Report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on United States Energy Policy |author= Richard B.

== Structure ==
{{plain image with caption|Xylem cells.svg|Cross section of some xylem cells|400px|right}}
The most distinctive xylem [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are the long tracheary elements that transport water. [[Tracheid]]s and [[vessel element]]s are distinguished by their shape;  vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called ''vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raven, Peter A. |author2=Evert, Ray F. |author3=Eichhorn, Susan E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999|title=Biology of Plants|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|pages=576–577|isbn=978-1-57259-611-5|nopp= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xylem also contains two other cell types: [[parenchyma]] and [[ground tissue#Fibres|fibers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650951/xylem Xylem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916145301/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650951/xylem |date=2011-09-16 }}. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

Xylem can be found:
* in [[vascular bundle]]s, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants
* in secondary xylem, laid down by a [[meristem]] called the [[vascular cambium]] in woody plants
* as part of a [[stele (biology)|stelar arrangement]] not divided into bundles, as in many [[fern]]s.

In transitional stages of plants with [[secondary growth]], the first two categories are not mutually exclusive, although usually a vascular bundle will contain ''primary xylem'' only.

The branching pattern exhibited by xylem follows [[Murray's law]].&lt;ref name="mcculloh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCulloh|first=Katherine A.|author2=John S. Sperry|author3=Frederick R. Adler|title=Water transport in plants obeys Murray's law|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature01444|volume=421|pages=939–942|year=2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6926/full/nature01444.html|pmid=12607000|issue=6926|bibcode=2003Natur.421..939M|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106040520/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6926/full/nature01444.html|archivedate=2009-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary and secondary xylem ==
'''Primary xylem''' is formed during primary growth from [[procambium]]. It includes protoxylem and metaxylem. Metaxylem develops after the protoxylem but before secondary xylem. Metaxylem has wider vessels and tracheids than protoxylem.

'''Secondary xylem''' is formed during secondary growth from [[vascular cambium]]. Although secondary xylem is also found in members of the [[gymnosperm]] groups [[Gnetophyta]] and [[Ginkgophyta]] and to a lesser extent in members of the [[Cycadophyta]], the two main groups in which secondary xylem can be found are:
#[[conifers]] (''Coniferae''): there are some six hundred species of conifers. All species have secondary xylem, which is relatively uniform in structure throughout this group. Many conifers become tall trees: the secondary xylem of such trees is used and marketed as [[softwood]].
#[[angiosperms]] (''Angiospermae''): there are some quarter of a million to four hundred thousand species of angiosperms. Within this group secondary xylem is rare in the [[monocots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dickison, W.C.|year=2000|title=Integrative Plant Anatomy (page 196)|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080508917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-os1kvkFbS0C|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106151303/https://books.google.com/books?id=-os1kvkFbS0C|archivedate=2017-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-monocot angiosperms become trees, and the secondary xylem of these is used and marketed as [[hardwood]].

== Main function – upwards water transport ==
The xylem, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous system of water conducting channels reaching all parts of the plants. It transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from the roots throughout the plant. It is also used to replace water lost during [[transpiration]] and photosynthesis. Xylem [[plant sap|sap]] consists mainly of water and inorganic ions, although it can also contain a number of organic chemicals as well. The transport is passive, not powered by energy spent by the [[Vessel elements|tracheary]] elements themselves, which are dead by maturity and no longer have living contents. Transporting sap upwards becomes more difficult as the height of a plant increases and upwards transport of water by xylem is considered to limit the maximum height of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=George W.|last2=Sillett|first2=Stephen C.|last3=Jennings|first3=Gregory M.|last4=Davis|first4=Stephen D.|title=The limits to tree height|journal=Nature|date=2004|volume=428|issue=6985|pages=851–854|doi=10.1038/nature02417|pmid=15103376|bibcode=2004Natur.428..851K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three phenomena cause xylem sap to flow:

Selective inter-connection between these systems allows this high solute concentration in the phloem to draw xylem fluid upwards by negative pressure.
* {{anchor|Transpirational pull}}'''[[Transpirational pull]]''': Similarly, the [[evaporation]] of [[water]] from the surfaces of [[Mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells to the atmosphere also creates a negative pressure at the top of a plant. This causes millions of minute [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]] to form in the mesophyll cell wall. The resulting [[surface tension]] causes a negative pressure or [[tension (physics)|tension]] in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil.
* '''[[Root pressure]]''': If the [[water potential]] of the root cells is more negative than that of the [[soil]], usually due to high concentrations of [[Solution|solute]], water can move by [[osmosis]] into the root from the soil. This causes a positive pressure that forces sap up the xylem towards the leaves. In some circumstances, the sap will be forced from the leaf through a [[hydathode]] in a phenomenon known as [[guttation]]. Root pressure is highest in the morning before the stomata open and allow transpiration to begin.  Different plant species can have different root pressures even in a similar environment; examples include up to 145 kPa in ''[[Vitis riparia]]'' but around zero in ''[[Celastrus orbiculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2000|volume=87|pages=1272–78|title=Root pressure and specific conductivity in temperate lianas: exotic ''Celastrus orbiculatus'' (Celastraceae) vs. Native ''Vitis riparia'' (Vitaceae)|author=Tim J.

The primary force that creates the [[capillary action]] movement of water upwards in plants is the adhesion between the water and the surface of the xylem conduits.&lt;ref&gt;Cruiziat, Pierre and Richter, Hanno. [http://4e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=&amp;id=99 Plant Physiology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228144231/http://4e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=&amp;id=99 |date=2008-12-28 }}.

When transpiration removes water at the top, the flow is needed to return to the equilibrium.

Transpirational pull results from the evaporation of water from the surfaces of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the [[leaf|leaves]]. This evaporation causes the surface of the water to recess into the [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s of the [[cell wall]]. By [[capillary action]], the water forms concave [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]] inside the pores. The high surface tension of water pulls the [[wiktionary:Concavity|concavity]] outwards, generating enough [[force]] to lift water as high as a hundred meters from ground level to a [[tree]]'s highest branches.

Transpirational pull requires that the vessels transporting the water be very small in diameter; otherwise, [[cavitation]] would break the water column. And as water [[evaporates]] from leaves, more is drawn up through the plant to replace it. When the water pressure within the xylem reaches extreme levels due to low water input from the roots (if, for example, the soil is dry), then the gases come out of solution and form a bubble&amp;nbsp;– an [[embolism]] forms, which will spread quickly to other adjacent cells, unless [[pit (botany)|bordered pits]] are present (these have a plug-like structure called a torus, that seals off the opening between adjacent cells and stops the embolism from spreading).

=== Cohesion-tension theory ===
The ''cohesion-tension theory'' is a [[theory]] of [[intermolecular attraction]] that explains the process of [[water]] flow upwards (against the force of [[gravity]]) through the xylem of [[plant]]s. It was proposed in 1894 by [[John Joly]] and [[Henry Horatio Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Henry H. |last2=Joly |first2=J. |title=On the ascent of sap |journal=Annals of Botany |date=1894 |volume=8 |pages=468–470 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001235830;view=1up;seq=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Henry H. |last2=Joly |first2=J. |title=On the ascent of sap |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B |date=1895 |volume=186 |pages=563–576 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x001659730;view=1up;seq=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite numerous objections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tyree, M.T.|year=1997|title=The Cohesion-Tension theory of sap ascent: current controversies|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=48|issue=10|pages=1753–1765|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/10/1753.abstract|doi=10.1093/jxb/48.10.1753|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220004428/http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/10/1753.abstract|archivedate=2015-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, Z. |author2=Chang, C.-C. |author3=Hong, S.-J. |author4=Sheng, Y.-J. |author5=Tsao, H.-K. |year=2012|title=Capillary Rise in a Microchannel of Arbitrary Shape and Wettability: Hysteresis Loop|journal=Langmuir|volume=28|issue=49|pages=16917–16926|doi=10.1021/la3036242|pmid=23171321}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is the most widely accepted theory for the transport of water through a plant's vascular system based on the classical research of Dixon-Joly (1894),  Eugen Askenasy (1845–1903) (1895),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Askenasy|first=E.|title=Ueber das Saftsteigen|trans-title=On the ascent of sap|journal=Botanisches Centralblatt|year=1895|volume=62|pages=237–238|language=German|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c079536710;view=1up;seq=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Askenasy |first1=E. |title=Ueber das Saftsteigen |journal=Verhandlungen des Naturhistorisch-medizinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg (Proceedings of the Natural History-Medical Society at Heidelberg) |date=1895 |volume=5 |pages=325–345 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43534#page/349/mode/1up |series=2nd series |trans-title=On the ascent of sap |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dixon (1914,1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=H|title=Transpiration and the ascent of sap in plants|year=1914|publisher= Macmillan and Co.|location=London, England, UK|url=https://archive.org/stream/transpirationasc00dixo#page/n5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=H|title=The transpiration stream|year= 1924|publisher=University of London Press, Ltd|location=London|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is a [[polar molecule]]. When two water molecules approach one another, the slightly negatively charged [[oxygen]] atom of one forms a [[hydrogen bond]] with a slightly positively charged [[hydrogen]] atom in the other. This attractive force, along with other [[intermolecular force]]s, is one of the principal factors responsible for the occurrence of [[surface tension]] in liquid water. It also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf.

Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension. Transpiration pull, utilizing [[capillary action]] and the inherent surface tension of water, is the primary mechanism of water movement in plants. However, it is not the only mechanism involved. Any use of water in leaves forces water to move into them.

[[Transpiration]] in leaves creates tension (differential pressure) in the cell walls of [[Mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells. Because of this tension, water is being pulled up from the roots into the leaves, helped by [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] (the pull between individual water molecules, due to [[hydrogen bonds]]) and [[adhesion]] (the stickiness between water molecules and the [[hydrophilic]] cell walls of plants). This mechanism of water flow works because of [[water potential]] (water flows from high to low potential), and the rules of simple [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology|year=2002|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2|pages=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past century, there has been a great deal of research regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today, most plant scientists continue to agree that the ''cohesion-tension theory'' best explains this process, but multiforce theories that hypothesize several alternative mechanisms have been suggested, including longitudinal cellular and xylem [[osmotic pressure]] [[gradient]]s, axial potential gradients in the vessels, and gel- and gas-bubble-supported interfacial gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Ulrich|title=What are the driving forces for water lifting in the xylem conduit?|journal=Physiologia|year=2002|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.2002.1140301.x|pmid=12060254|volume=114|issue=3|pages=327–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tyree1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyree|first=Melvin T.|title=The cohesion-tension theory of sap ascent: current controversies|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=48|issue=10|pages=1753–1765|year=1997|doi=10.1093/jxb/48.10.1753|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/10/1753.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement of pressure ===
[[Image:Pressurebomb.svg|right|thumb|300px|A diagram showing the setup of a [[pressure bomb]]]]
Until recently, the differential pressure (suction) of transpirational pull could only be measured indirectly, by applying external pressure with a [[pressure bomb]] to counteract it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090918110039/http://bugs.bio.usyd.edu.au/learning/resources/plant_form_function/external_sites/PAP/Lab08_WaterPot/08Lab_14.html The pressure of the water potential of the xylem in your plant's stem can be determined with the Scholander bomb.] bio.usyd.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt; When the technology to perform direct measurements with a pressure probe was developed, there was initially some doubt about whether the classic theory was correct, because some workers were unable to demonstrate negative pressures. More recent measurements do tend to validate the classic theory, for the most part. Xylem transport is driven by a combination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/water-uptake-and-transport-in-vascular-plants-103016037|title=Water Uptake and Transport in Vascular Plants|last=Andrew J. McElrone, Brendan Choat, Greg A. Gambetta, Craig R. Brodersen|date=2013|website=The Nature Education Knowledge Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of transpirational pull from above and [[root pressure]] from below, which makes the interpretation of measurements more complicated.

== Evolution ==
Xylem appeared early in the history of terrestrial plant life. Fossil plants with anatomically preserved xylem are known from the [[Silurian]] (more than 400 million years ago), and trace fossils resembling individual xylem cells may be found in earlier [[Ordovician]] rocks. The earliest true and recognizable xylem consists of [[tracheids]] with a helical-annular reinforcing layer added to the [[cell wall]]. This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues to be found in the ''protoxylem'' (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of plants. Several groups of plants later developed [[pit (botany)|pitted]] tracheid cells, it seems, through [[convergent evolution]]. In living plants, pitted tracheids do not appear in development until the maturation of the ''metaxylem'' (following the ''protoxylem'').

In most plants, pitted [[tracheid]]s function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the [[vessel element]]. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by ''bulk flow'', as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes. The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the [[angiosperms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carlquist, S.|author2=E.L. Schneider |year=2002|title=The tracheid–vessel element transition in angiosperms involves multiple independent features: cladistic consequences|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=89|issue=2|pages=185–195|doi= 10.3732/ajb.89.2.185|pmid=21669726}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or "basal" lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., [[Amborellaceae]], [[Tetracentraceae]], [[Trochodendraceae]], and [[Winteraceae]]), and their secondary xylem is described by [[Arthur Cronquist]] as "primitively vesselless". Cronquist considered the vessels of ''[[Gnetum]]'' to be convergent with those of angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cronquist, A.|date=August 1988|title=The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants|location=New York, New York|publisher=New York Botanical Garden Press|isbn=978-0-89327-332-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a [[cladistics#Definitions|primitive]] condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost.

To photosynthesize, plants must absorb {{co2}} from the atmosphere. However, this comes at a price: while stomata are open to allow {{co2}} to enter, water can evaporate.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Sperry | first1 = J. S.| title = Evolution of Water Transport and Xylem Structure| jstor = 3691719| journal = International Journal of Plant Sciences| volume = 164| issue = 3| pages = S115–S127| year = 2003| doi = 10.1086/368398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is lost much faster than {{co2}} is absorbed, so plants need to replace it, and have developed systems to transport water from the moist soil to the site of photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Early plants sucked water between the walls of their cells, then evolved the ability to control water loss (and {{co2}} acquisition) through the use of stomata. Specialized water transport tissues soon evolved in the form of hydroids, tracheids, then secondary xylem, followed by an endodermis and ultimately vessels.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

The high {{co2}} levels of Silurian-Devonian times, when plants were first colonizing land, meant that the need for water was relatively low. As {{co2}} was withdrawn from the atmosphere by plants, more water was lost in its capture, and more elegant transport mechanisms evolved.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; As water transport mechanisms, and waterproof cuticles, evolved, plants could survive without being continually covered by a film of water. This transition from [[poikilohydry]] to [[homoiohydry]] opened up new potential for colonization.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Plants then needed a robust internal structure that held long narrow channels for transporting water from the soil to all the different parts of the above-soil plant, especially to the parts where photosynthesis occurred.

During the Silurian, {{co2}} was readily available, so little water needed expending to acquire it. By the end of the Carboniferous, when {{co2}} levels had lowered to something approaching today's, around 17 times more water was lost per unit of {{co2}} uptake.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; However, even in these "easy" early days, water was at a premium, and had to be transported to parts of the plant from the wet soil to avoid [[desiccation]]. This early water transport took advantage of the ''cohesion-tension'' mechanism inherent in water. Water has a tendency to diffuse to areas that are drier, and this process is accelerated when water can be [[capillary action|wick]]ed along a fabric with small spaces. In small passages, such as that between the plant cell walls (or in tracheids), a column of water behaves like rubber&amp;nbsp;– when molecules evaporate from one end, they pull the molecules behind them along the channels. Therefore, transpiration alone provided the driving force for water transport in early plants.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; However, without dedicated transport vessels, the cohesion-tension mechanism cannot transport water more than about 2&amp;nbsp;cm, severely limiting the size of the earliest plants.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; This process demands a steady supply of water from one end, to maintain the chains; to avoid exhausting it, plants developed a waterproof [[plant cuticle|cuticle]]. Early cuticle may not have had pores but did not cover the entire plant surface, so that gas exchange could continue.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; However, dehydration at times was inevitable; early plants cope with this by having a lot of water stored between their cell walls, and when it comes to it sticking out the tough times by putting life "on hold" until more water is supplied.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

To be free from the constraints of small size and constant moisture that the parenchymatic transport system inflicted, plants needed a more efficient water transport system. During the early Silurian, they developed specialized cells, which were [[lignin|lignified]] (or bore similar chemical compounds)&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; to avoid implosion; this process coincided with cell death, allowing their innards to be emptied and water to be passed through them.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; These wider, dead, empty cells were a million times more conductive than the inter-cell method, giving the potential for transport over longer distances, and higher {{co2}} diffusion rates.

The earliest macrofossils to bear water-transport tubes are Silurian plants placed in the genus ''[[Cooksonia (plant)|Cooksonia]]''.&lt;ref name=Edwards1992&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Edwards |first=D. |last2=Davies |first2=K.L. |last3=Axe |first3=L. |year=1992 |title=A vascular conducting strand in the early land plant ''Cooksonia'' |journal=Nature |volume=357 |issue=6380 |pages=683–685 |doi=10.1038/357683a0 |bibcode=1992Natur.357..683E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Devonian pretracheophytes ''[[Aglaophyton]]'' and ''[[Horneophyton]]'' have structures very similar to the [[Hydroid (botany)|hydroids]] of modern mosses.

By adjusting the amount of gas exchange, they can restrict the amount of water lost through transpiration. This is an important role where water supply is not constant, and indeed stomata appear to have evolved before tracheids, being present in the non-vascular hornworts.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

An [[endodermis]] probably evolved during the Silu-Devonian, but the first fossil evidence for such a structure is Carboniferous.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; This structure in the roots covers the water transport tissue and regulates ion exchange (and prevents unwanted pathogens etc. from entering the water transport system). The endodermis can also provide an upwards pressure, forcing water out of the roots when transpiration is not enough of a driver.

Once plants had evolved this level of controlled water transport, they were truly homoiohydric, able to extract water from their environment through root-like organs rather than relying on a film of surface moisture, enabling them to grow to much greater size.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; As a result of their independence from their surroundings, they lost their ability to survive desiccation&amp;nbsp;– a costly trait to retain.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

While wider tracheids with robust walls make it possible to achieve higher water transport pressures, this increases the problem of cavitation.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Cavitation occurs when a bubble of air forms within a vessel, breaking the bonds between chains of water molecules and preventing them from pulling more water up with their cohesive tension. A tracheid, once cavitated, cannot have its embolism removed and return to service (except in a few advanced angiosperms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/plants/cavitation-and-embolism-in-vascular-plants-with-diagram/22732|title=Cavitation and Embolism in Vascular Plants (With Diagram)|last=Koratkar|first=Sanjay|date=2016-02-24|website=Biology Discussion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/journals/pnw_2012_johnson002.pdf|title=Hydraulic safety margins and embolism reversal in stems and leaves: Why are conifers and angiosperms so different?|last=Daniel M.

Therefore, it is well worth plants' while to avoid cavitation occurring. For this reason, [[pit (botany)|pits]] in tracheid walls have very small diameters, to prevent air entering and allowing bubbles to nucleate. Freeze-thaw cycles are a major cause of cavitation. Damage to a tracheid's wall almost inevitably leads to air leaking in and cavitation, hence the importance of many tracheids working in parallel.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

Cavitation is hard to avoid, but once it has occurred plants have a range of mechanisms to contain the damage.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Small pits link adjacent conduits to allow fluid to flow between them, but not air&amp;nbsp;– although ironically these pits, which prevent the spread of embolisms, are also a major cause of them.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; These pitted surfaces further reduce the flow of water through the xylem by as much as 30%.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Conifers, by the Jurassic, developed an ingenious improvement, using valve-like structures to isolate cavitated elements. These torus-margo structures have a blob floating in the middle of a donut; when one side depressurizes the blob is sucked into the torus and blocks further flow.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Other plants simply accept cavitation; for instance, oaks grow a ring of wide vessels at the start of each spring, none of which survive the winter frosts. Maples use root pressure each spring to force sap upwards from the roots, squeezing out any air bubbles.

Growing to height also employed another trait of tracheids&amp;nbsp;– the support offered by their lignified walls. Defunct tracheids were retained to form a strong, woody stem, produced in most instances by a secondary xylem. However, in early plants, tracheids were too mechanically vulnerable, and retained a central position, with a layer of tough [[sclerenchyma]] on the outer rim of the stems.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Even when tracheids do take a structural role, they are supported by sclerenchymatic tissue.

Tracheids end with walls, which impose a great deal of resistance on flow;&lt;ref name=Niklas1985/&gt; vessel members have perforated end walls, and are arranged in series to operate as if they were one continuous vessel.&lt;ref name=Niklas1985/&gt; The function of end walls, which were the default state in the Devonian, was probably to avoid [[embolism]]s. An embolism is where an air bubble is created in a tracheid. This may happen as a result of freezing, or by gases dissolving out of solution. Once an embolism is formed, it usually cannot be removed (but see later); the affected cell cannot pull water up, and is rendered useless.

End walls excluded, the tracheids of prevascular plants were able to operate under the same hydraulic conductivity as those of the first vascular plant, ''Cooksonia''.&lt;ref name=Niklas1985/&gt;

The size of tracheids is limited as they comprise a single cell; this limits their length, which in turn limits their maximum useful diameter to 80&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Conductivity grows with the fourth power of diameter, so increased diameter has huge rewards; ''vessel elements'', consisting of a number of cells, joined at their ends, overcame this limit and allowed larger tubes to form, reaching diameters of up to 500&amp;nbsp;μm, and lengths of up to 10&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

Vessels first evolved during the dry, low {{co2}} periods of the late Permian, in the horsetails, ferns and [[Selaginellales]] independently, and later appeared in the mid Cretaceous in angiosperms and gnetophytes.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;
Vessels allow the same cross-sectional area of wood to transport around a hundred times more water than tracheids!&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; This allowed plants to fill more of their stems with structural fibers, and also opened a new niche to [[vine]]s, which could transport water without being as thick as the tree they grew on.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Despite these advantages, tracheid-based wood is a lot lighter, thus cheaper to make, as vessels need to be much more reinforced to avoid cavitation.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

[[File:Xylem Development.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns of xylem development: xylem in brown; arrows show direction of development from protoxylem to metaxylem.]]
Xylem development can be described by four terms: ''centrarch, exarch, endarch'' and ''mesarch''.  As it develops in young plants, its nature changes from ''protoxylem'' to ''metaxylem'' (i.e. from ''first xylem'' to ''after xylem''). The patterns in which protoxylem and metaxylem are arranged is important in the study of plant morphology.

=== Protoxylem and metaxylem ===
As a young [[vascular plant]] grows, one or more strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings in the form of rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (scalariform) or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, metaxylem completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Foster|first=A.S.|last2=Gifford|first2=E.M.|year=1974|title=Comparative Morphology of Vascular Plants|edition=2nd|location=San Francisco|publisher=W.H.

=== Patterns of protoxylem and metaxylem ===
There are four main patterns to the arrangement of protoxylem and metaxylem in stems and roots.

* ''Centrarch'' refers to the case in which the primary xylem forms a single cylinder in the center of the stem and develops from the center outwards. The protoxylem is thus found in the central core and the metaxylem in a cylinder around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=White |first=A. Toby |last2=Kazlev |first2=M. Alan |title=Glossary |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Plants/Lists/Glossary/GlossaryA.html |work=palaeos.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220181617/http://palaeos.com/Plants/Lists/Glossary/GlossaryA.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern was common in early land plants, such as "[[rhyniophyte]]s", but is not present in any living plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The other three terms are used where there is more than one strand of primary xylem.

* ''Exarch'' is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the outside inwards towards the center, i.e. centripetally. The metaxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the protoxylem closest to the periphery. The roots of [[vascular plant]]s are normally considered to have exarch development.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"/&gt;
* ''Endarch'' is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e. centrifugally. The protoxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the metaxylem closest to the periphery. The stems of [[seed plant]]s typically have endarch development.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"/&gt;
* ''Mesarch'' is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the middle of a strand in both directions. The metaxylem is thus on both the peripheral and central sides of the strand with the protoxylem between the metaxylem (possibly surrounded by it). The leaves and stems of many [[fern]]s have mesarch development.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"/&gt;

== History ==

In his book ''De plantis libri XVI'' (On Plants, in 16 books) (1583), the Italian physician and botanist [[Andrea Cesalpino]] proposed that plants draw water from soil not by magnetism (''ut magnes ferrum trahit'', as magnetic iron attracts) nor by suction (''vacuum''), but by absorption, as occurs in the case of linen, sponges, or powders.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Available at:  [https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/327/1/Lazenby95v.1.pdf University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Malpighi first described xylem vessels and named tracheid cells.  From p. 8 of (Malpighi, 1675): ''" … haec tubulosa sunt &amp; subrotunda, identidem tamen angustantur, &amp; perpetuo patent, nullumque, ut observare potui, effundunt humorem: Argentea lamina L, in spiram contorta, componuntur, ut facile laceratione, (velut in bombycinis tracheis expertus sum,) in hanc oblongam &amp; continuatam fasciam resolvantur. Lamina haec, si ulterius microscopio lustretur, particulis squamatim componitur; quod etiam in tracheis insectorum deprehenditur. Spiralibus hisce vasculis, seu ut verius loquar, tracheis, ligneae fibrae M adstant, quae secundum longitudinem productae, ad majorem firmitudinem &amp; robur, transversalium utriculorum ordines N superequitant, ita ut fiat veluti storea."'' ( … these [vessels] are tubular and somewhat round, yet often become narrow, and they are always open, and none, as [far as] I could perceive, exude a liquid: they are composed of silvery sheets ''L'', twisted into a helix, although they can easily be unbound, by tearing, into this somewhat long and connected strip (just as I have done in silkworm treacheas).  This sheet, if it be examined further with a microscope, is composed of scale-like particles; which likewise is observed in the tracheas of insects.  On these helical vessels, or as I will more rightly say, "tracheas", there stand woody filaments ''M'', which being extended in length straddle – for greater strength and hardness – lines of transverse cells ''N'', so that it is constructed like a mat.)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malpighi believed that xylem contained only air, the British physician and botanist [[Nehemiah Grew]], who was Malpighi's contemporary, believed that sap ascended both through the bark and through the xylem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grew |first1=Nehemiah |title=The Anatomy of Plants … |date=1682 |publisher=W. Rawlins |location=London, England |pages=124–125 |url=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000008869#page/123/}} From pp. 124–125: "For the great part of the year, it [i.e., the sap] riseth in the ''Barque'' [i.e., bark], sc. in the inner ''Margin'' adjacent to the ''Wood'', and in the ''spring'', in or through the ''Wood'' it self, and there only."&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Grew, [[capillary action]] in the xylem would raise the sap by only a few inches; in order to raise the sap to the top of a tree, Grew proposed that the parenchymal cells become turgid and thereby not only squeeze the sap in the tracheids but force some sap from the parenchyma into the tracheids.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* (Grew, 1682), p. 126.  Grew recognized the limits of capillary action (from p. 126): " … small ''Glass-Pipes'' [i.e., capillary tubes] immersed in Water, will give it [i.e., the water] an ascent for some inches; yet there is a certain ''period'', according to the ''bore'' of the ''Pipe'', beyond which it will not rise."  Grew proposed the following mechanism for the ascent of sap in plants (from p. 126): "But the ''Bladders'' [i.e., parenchymal cells]  DP, which surround it [i.e., the column of tracheids], being swelled up and turgid with ''Sap'', do hereby press upon it; and so not only a little contract its bore, but also transfuse or strain some ''Portion'' of their ''Sap'' thereinto: by both which means, the ''Sap'' will be forced to rise higher therein."

From (Hales, 1727), p. 100: "And by the same [capillary] principle it is, that we see in the preceding Experiments plants imbibe moisture so vigorously up their fine capillary vessels; which moisture, as it is carried off in perspiration [i.e., transpiration], (by the action of warmth), thereby gives the sap vessels liberty to be almost continually attracting fresh supplies, which they could
not do, if they were fully saturate with moisture: For without perspiration the sap must necessarily stagnate, not withstanding the sap vessels are so curiously adapted by their exceeding fineness, to raise the sap to great heights, in reciprocal proportion to their very minute diameters."&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1891, the Polish-German botanist [[Eduard Strasburger]] had shown that the transport of water in plants did not require the xylem cells to be alive.&lt;ref&gt;See:
