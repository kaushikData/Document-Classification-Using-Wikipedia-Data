'''Azerti Motorsport''' (also known as '''Racing for Belgium''') is a Belgian motorsport team founded by former racer [[Wim Coekelbergs]].

==History==
Racing for Belgium started racing in Belgian [[Clio Cup]] in 2003, but graduated to the [[Renault Eurocup|Eurocup Mégane Trophy]] in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://mediaguide.worldseries.fr/team.php?champ=34&amp;id=32&lt;/ref&gt; taking the driver and teams titles with [[Jan Heylen]]. They also won the 2005 and 2006 [[SEAT Leon Supercopa]] in Spain with [[Oscar Nogues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autosport.be/news/2007/10/30/EurocupMganeTrophyReviewRacingForBelgium{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the team entered an [[Alfa Romeo 156]] in the [[World Touring Car Championship]] for [[Miguel Freitas]] and an [[Aston Martin DBRS9]] in the [[Belcar]] series for Wim Coekelbergs and Ron Marchal. For 2008, the team regrouped their activities and planned to move to the [[SEAT Eurocup]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automobilsport.com/megane-trophy-eurocup-racing-for-belgium-seat-cup-eurocup-2008-new-era-wim-coekelbergs-michael-rossi-jan-heylen-photos---29690.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astonmartins.com/aston_martin_racing/dbrs9_racing_for_belgium.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but retreated back to the Belgian Clio Cup.

Operating under the name Azerti Motorsport, the team moved to [[Superleague Formula]] in 2008, where they have operated several cars, including [[PSV Eindhoven (Superleague Formula team)|PSV Eindhoven]], [[Al Ain (Superleague Formula team)|Al Ain]], [[A.C. Milan (Superleague Formula team)|A.C. Milan]] and [[A.S. Roma (Superleague Formula team)|A.S. Roma]]. They have won several races in the series in 2008 (vice-champion with Yelmer Buurman) and 2009.

In 2010 the team ran 2 cars, the Corinthians car for [[Robert Doornbos]] and the RSC Anderlecht car for [[Davide Rigon]]. Rigon won the first Superleague Formula title for the Belgian squad. The last race weekends of the 2010 SF season [[Franck Perera]] joined the team with the Bordeaux car and showed as from the first run that he and the car were up to speed, taking P2 in qualifying and winning the prize-money race in Ordos (China).

In 2011 Azerti participated on the two final rounds of the Superleague Championship with [[Neel Jani]] in the RSC Anderlecht car, [[Yelmer Buurman]] in the Dutch (holland) car and [[Tristan Gommendy]] in the France car.

After 2 years of silence, 2014 marked the team's return, participating the Acceleration14 (FA1 ex A1GP cars)  championship. With [[Nigel Melker]] as Azerti/Team Holland driver, the team took the championship ship crown home.
In the seasons final Azerti scored an impressive double win in Assen. Leading both races from start to finish they clinched both driver and team title and are the first ever FA1 champions.

[[File:Leonardo Nascimento de Araújo 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]], former Director of Football at [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].]]

A '''director of football''' is a senior management figure at a [[football (soccer)|football]] (soccer) club, most commonly in [[Europe]]. The exact nature of the role is often unclear and causes much debate in the [[sports]] [[Mass media|media]].

The presence of a director of football acts as an intermediary between the [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and the board and may relieve pressure on a manager by handling aspects away from day-to-day coaching, allowing a manager to focus on on-pitch performance. The director may also help to stabilise the club – many examples exist of director stepping in as a [[caretaker manager]] on the departure of the manager. The director – often an experienced football figure – may also positively advise a less experienced manager or the board of a less well developed club.

In contrast, there are many examples of tensions arising between director and manager, often due to questions over the remit and powers of the two positions; particularly with regard to control over transfer policy. This had led to many well publicised and often, highly damaging disputes within clubs.

In general, directors of football are not shareholders in the club, or hold a nominal stake. This is opposed to other members of the board with whom the director of football will sit.

While most common in [[association football]] (soccer), [[professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[gridiron football]] teams often have a similar '''director of football operations''' or '''vice president of football operations''' position, who serves as the second in command to the [[general manager#Sports teams|general manager]] or team president.

==As a figurehead==
The level of power and influence in the day-to-day and transfer operations of the club held by a director of football may vary considerably. In some cases, the position may be as a figurehead or as a club ambassador, with transfer dealings, team affairs, squad selection and day-to-day operations handled exclusively by the manager and his staff. Often, the position in this case is filled by a former famous player. [[Bobby Charlton]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] is such an example. In such a case, the role of the director of football is more one of club promotion and marketing than that of actual control over footballing operations. Employing a well-known football personality in such a position may also be used to enhance the perceived prestige of the club, improving the club's position in the transfer market.

Tension may arise even in this role between manager and director, even if the director is merely a figurehead – should the role be filled by a former (often successful) manager, the presence of that individual within the club may act to undermine the authority of the present manager and act to add pressure during periods of poor performance (for example, from the fans wishing the return of the director to managerial duties).

The presence of [[Matt Busby|Sir Matt Busby]] at Manchester United as general manager after retirement is generally considered to have undermined his immediate successors in the 1970s, despite his retirement from day-to-day club affairs (although he did return to the manager's seat on an interim basis 18 months after his original "retirement".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/ambassador-ferguson-wins-united-battle-of-wills-677657.html 'Ambassador' Ferguson wins United battle of wills] The Independent, 14 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well known managers have been promoted to director of football or similar roles, including [[Ron Greenwood]] at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1974, when first team duties were handed over to coach [[John Lyall]]. However, Greenwood returned to frontline management three years later with the [[England national football team]]. In January 1994, [[Lawrie McMenemy]] returned to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] nearly a decade after resigning as manager to become the club's first director of football, a role which he held for more than three years, although the actual management of the team was left to [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Dave Merrington]] and finally [[Graeme Souness]]. In March 2002, [[Harry Redknapp]] stepped down as director of football at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] after a year in the role to succeed [[Graham Rix]] as manager.

Appointments in this case are often long-term, likely due to the negative reaction of fans to the removal of a former club legend. On occasion, the role has been filled until the death of the director – such as the aforementioned Busby, who remained as a director of Manchester United until his death in January 1994 at the age of 84. Others remain in the role until their health restricts their activities. A notable case is [[Bob Paisley]] at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who after his retirement as manager in 1983 he was given a seat on the board of directors and held this role until 1992, when at the age of 73 he resigned from the club due to the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]], four years before his death.

==As a technical director==
In this case, the director of football may be sought by a board – or even manager – in order to provide advice or technical assistance on footballing or other aspects that are perceived as lacking or desired by the club. This may be the case where the manager is inexperienced or perceived as naive in a particular aspect, allowing the director to advise against potentially costly errors. This may also be the case where a club in a lesser league or lower division with ambitions to develop further and improve their league position seeks an experienced former manager or director from a more prominent league or club in order to use their experience to further the club. Such an example is that of [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] at [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] or [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].

In this case, however, the tag "director of football" may be dropped in order to prevent the "director" from undermining the present manager by his presence at the club with the person taking up a position such as with the youth academy perceived as subordinate to the manager.

Appointments in this case are often short term – for between 1/2 seasons – with the director imparting their advice and departing to another club.

==As a go-between==
In other cases, the role of the director of football may include control over transfer dealings and targets and aspects outside coaching and squad selection, which are handled by the manager. The director may oversee all levels of the club – youth to first team – with the manager dedicated to first team affairs. Often, a director in this case is a former manager or experienced former coach, often a predecessor of the present manager. This type of director is often installed at the behest of the owners of a club to oversee the manager and act as a go-between of the board and managerial team, or if required help select a new manager. However, such an arrangement has led to controversy in English football due to issues over roles and responsibilities of manager and director – either perceived excessive interference of the director in affairs (such as squad selection) beyond his remit or by attempting to control and criticise aspects of management. A notable recent example of such tension is that of manager [[Kevin Keegan]] and director of football [[Dennis Wise]] at [[Newcastle United]].

An example of the description of the role in this case as from the perspective of the manager is given by [[Dave Bassett]] as:

:" ..... a buffer. The director of football is answerable to the board but there to assist the manager. He's experienced in football and there to help the board members who don't have that experience."

Length of appointments in this case are often linked to the fortunes and tastes of the manager and board – directors often departing after the sacking of a manager (for example, [[Damien Comolli]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]) or on appointment of his replacement. On occasion, the director may remain through a number of managers, such as [[David Pleat]].

==As a general manager==
In the most extreme case, the director of football may act in a role similar to the continental club 'sporting director' or general manager; holding control over transfer policy and targets, team affairs, stadium and training affairs, travel, fixture selection and having input into squad selection and day-to-day club affairs. This is generally confined to the 'sporting' side of the club, with marketing and financial aspects handled by another director or executive. However, rarely is such a position referred to as 'director of football', with 'sporting director' or akin preferred.

The director of football's job is sometimes compared to that of a [[general manager#Sports teams|general manager]] in a [[Major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|North American]] professional sports organisation, and often referred to as 'sporting director' or some equivalent in [[continental Europe]]. In a structure with a powerful director of football, the position of manager may be officially called 'head coach' or 'head of 1st team affairs' in order to more clearly define the remit of the traditional 'manager' and 'director of football'.

In this case the length of appointment is intrinsically linked to on-pitch performance, in the same way as a manager.

'''Kinaesthetics''' (or '''kinesthetics''', in American English) is the study of body motion, and of the perception (both conscious and unconscious) of one's own body motions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch; Maietta 2003, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinesthesis is the learning of movements that an individual commonly performs (Edwards, 2011). The individual must repeat the motions that they are trying to learn and perfect many times for this to happen. Many people say that kinesthesis is muscle memory but it is not true because your muscles can’t actually remember anything, it is the proprioceptors giving the information from your muscles to your brain (Edwards, 2011). To do this, the individual must have a sense of the position of their body and how that changes throughout the motor skill they are trying to perform. While performing the motion the body will use receptors in the muscles to transfer information to the brain to tell the brain about what the body is doing. Then after completing the same motor skill numerous times, the brain will begin to remember the motion based on the position of the body at a given time. Then after learning the motion the body will be able perform the motor skill even when usual senses are inhibited, such as the person closing their eyes. The body will perform the motion based on the information that is stored in the brain from previous attempts at the same movement (Sahyouni, 2013). This is possible because the brain has formed connections between the location of body parts in space (the body uses perception to learn where their body is in space [Freeman, 2008])and the subsequent movements that commonly follow these positions (Sahyouni, 2013). It becomes almost an instinct. The person does not need to even think about what they are doing to perfect the skill, they have done it so many times that it feels natural and requires little to no thought. When the kinesthetic system has learned a motor skill proficiently, it will be able to work even when ones vision is limited (Pinzon, Vega, Sanchez, &amp; Zheng 2017). The perception of continuous movement ([[kinesthesia]]) is largely unconscious. A conscious [[proprioception]] is achieved through increased [[awareness]]. Kinaesthetics involves the teaching and personal development of such awareness.

==Therapeutic applications==
[[Occupational therapy]] and [[physical therapy]] based on movement-associated awareness has been applied in the [[Western world]] since the mid-1980s, especially in Central European care facilities. It makes use of the [[psychophysiological]] finding that greater [[muscle tone]] reduces proprioceptive sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Roier (2013) p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kinaesthetics may benefit patients who need:
*Assistance in [[activities of daily living]] (ADL)
*Somatic feedback
*To reduce the physical effort required to move

==Daily Life applications==
The kinesthetic system is important with performing many motor skills, one being driving a car. If the body could not instantly remember what to do, driving would be very dangerous. When first starting to drive, all new drivers lack this ability to quickly respond because they have never been in situations like this before (Bates, Davey, Watson, King, &amp; Armstrong, 2014). The more they drive and are faced with similar situations, the more they get used to how to react and the more it becomes an instinct. By everyone knowing what they are doing when it comes to turning and stopping, it makes driving on the road safer. People can focus on what is in front of them incase their environment suddenly changes instead of focusing on how to turn the wheel or press on the breaks.



==History==
[[File:Die Kinaesthetics-Begründer Lenny Maietta und Frank Hatch.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Kinaesthetics-founders Lenny Maietta and Frank Hatch (2011)]]Kinaesthetics was developed in the early 1970s by Frank White Hatch, who was a choreographer and dancer. Hatch studied behavioral cybernetics at Madison/Wisconsin and developed academic programs for movement and dance called ''Kinaesthetics'' in three American universities.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch 1972&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned to working with disabled children as well as the field of rehabilitation. Psychologist Lenny Maietta (1950-2018) developed a handling-training program for young parents that was also based on behavioral cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;Maietta 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Hatch &amp; Maietta taught and worked together in German-speaking countries beginning in 1974. With the dancer John Graham, they held workshops under the name of Gentle Dance.

Maietta &amp; Hatch used Kinaesthetics-seminars the first time as therapy in the Ernest-Holmes Fachklinik in Germany 1974-77. Together with registered nurse Suzanne Bernard Schmidt, Maietta &amp; Hatch developed a job-specific program "Kinaesthetics in Nursing." They were in dialogue and exchange with Gregory Bateson, Moshe Feldenkrais, [[Berta Bobath|Berta]] and Karel Bobath, Liliane Juchli, and Nancy Roper. In addition to behavioral cybernetics and [[contact improvisation|dance]], movement therapy and [[humanistic psychology]] were named as key sources of kinaesthetics.

Maietta &amp; Hatch are still actively involved in the development of Kinaesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinaesthetics.com/index.php?s=content&amp;t=46#ebene4 MH-Kinaesthetics (= Maietta-Hatch Kinaesthetics)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the last years, programs for caregivers, for workplace health and for older people especially were developed. Currently there are four organizations in which [http://www.kinaesthetics.com/Kinaesthetik_Kinaesthetics_Anwendung_z_B_Infant-Handling_Pflege Kinaesthetics-programs] are developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kinaesthetics.pro/Anbieter.html Kinaesthetics-Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liberty Bell Classic''' was a 1980 [[track and field athletics]] event organized by [[The Athletics Congress]] as part of the [[1980 Olympic boycott]] and held at [[Franklin Field]] in [[Philadelphia]] on July 16 and 17, 1980.&lt;ref name="Marshall1980"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1980/07/28/824835/and-meanwhile-in-philadelphia-half-a-world-from-lenin-stadium-boycotting-athletes-some-of-whom-gave-olympian-performances-proved-theres-no-alternative-to-the-games|title=...and meanwhile in Philadelphia|last=Marshall|first=Joe|date=28 July 1980|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after Philadelphia's [[Liberty Bell]].

The [[U.S. Congress]] voted $10 million to fund alternative tournaments in several [[Olympic sports]], to which athletes from boycotting countries would be invited.&lt;ref name="Marshall1980"/&gt; Besides the Liberty Bell Classic, the [[U.S. Gymnastics Federation]] held an [[USGF International Invitational 1980|International Invitational tournament]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Earlier in the year, the United States had considered holding other games in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[West Germany]] or [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1470489/Secret-US-plot-to-steal-Moscows-Olympic-flame.html Secret US plot to steal Moscow's Olympic flame, Daily Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IAAF]] prohibited any official track and field meets that would clash with the Olympic meet, and so the Liberty Bell began three days before the Moscow Games opened (ten days before the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics events]] began).&lt;ref name="Marshall1980"/&gt; The Liberty Bell came the day after the prestigious [[Bislett Games]] in Oslo and many eligible athletes declined to compete, including 17 of the 34 champions at the [[1980 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|US Olympic Trials]].&lt;ref name="Marshall1980"/&gt; The winning performances in two events, men's [[110 metres hurdles|110 m hurdles]] and [[400 metres hurdles|400 m hurdles]], were better than those in Moscow.

==Participants==
Athletes from 29 countries participated in the event, many of which had taken part in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics, including:

This is a '''list of family relations in the National Hockey League'''. Since the creation of the [[National Hockey League]] in [[1917–18 NHL season|1917]], family members have been involved in all aspects of the league. Although most connections are among players, there have been family members involved in coaching and managing as well.

Since 1917, 47 pairs of brothers have played together on the same team; among them, ten have won the [[Stanley Cup]] together. Brothers have also squared off against each other five times in the Stanley Cup finals, most recently in [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]]. Twenty-six sons have followed in their fathers' footsteps and played for his team. Only once has a father played ''with'' his sons, when [[Gordie Howe]] played with [[Mark Howe|Mark]] and [[Marty Howe|Marty]] for [[1979–80 NHL season|one season]] with the [[Hartford Whalers]].

The [[Chicago Blackhawks]] have seen the most familial connections with 31: twenty sets of brothers, five father-son combinations, three uncle-nephew combinations, and three sets of cousins.

The [[Sutter family]] has had the largest number of family members &amp;ndash; nine &amp;ndash; play, coach and manage in the NHL.  The original six brothers ([[Brent Sutter|Brent]], [[Brian Sutter|Brian]], [[Darryl Sutter|Darryl]], [[Duane Sutter|Duane]], [[Rich Sutter|Rich]], and [[Ron Sutter|Ron]]) and three of their sons (cousins [[Brandon Sutter|Brandon]], [[Brett Sutter|Brett]], and [[Brody Sutter|Brody]]) result in multiple brother/father-son/uncle-nephew/cousin combinations.

The longest multi-generational family is the direct line of four generations starting with [[Howie Morenz]], father-in-law of [[Bernie Geoffrion]], who fathered [[Dan Geoffrion]], who fathered [[Blake Geoffrion]].  All four generations have played for the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. Howie's brother-in-law was Montreal and Boston player [[Billy Coutu]].

Below is a list of family relations throughout the NHL as players, head coaches, general managers, and officials. Owners are not included, as inheritance makes these relations more routine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2070">{{ref improve|date=October 2017}}'''Louisville Motor Speedway''' was a 3/8-mile [[race track]] located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. It was opened in 1988 and hosted [[NASCAR]] [[Craftsman Truck Series]] races from 1995 to 1999. Also hosted [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT Motorsports]] RedMan Monster Truck Challenge from 1988 to 1990 and [[United States Hot Rod Association]] Super Bowl of Motorsport in 1992 and 1993.

On Friday nights, the track hosted a Sportsman division which were similar to camaros and they had Figure-8s.

Saturday night, LMS hosted Mini-Trucks, Street Stocks and Late Models.

Keith Gardner was a 4-time champion in the Late Models from 1991 to 1994, and Bill Kimmel Jr. was Late Model champion from 1995 to 1998. 
Bill Kimmel Jr. is the brother of 9-time ARCA Champion [[Frank Kimmel]]. He was Franks's crew chief in the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] division. He is now the sole owner of Kimmel Racing in which his son, Will Kimmel, is the #1 driver.

The track was closed and demolished shortly after [[Kentucky Speedway]] opened. The site is now home to an industrial park.

'''Madison Square Garden Bowl''' was the name of an outdoor [[arena]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]]. Built in 1932, the arena hosted circuses and [[boxing]] matches. Its [[seating capacity]] was 72,000 spectators on wood bleachers.

It was located at 48th Street and [[New York State Route 25A|Northern Boulevard]] in [[Long Island City]]. This was the site where [[James J. Braddock]] defeated [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] for the World Heavyweight title on June 13, 1935 that was dramatized in the film ''[[Cinderella Man]]''. Braddock's first comeback fight against [[John Griffin (boxer)|John "Corn" Griffin]] was also in the venue. [[Jack Sharkey]] and [[Primo Carnera]] also captured the heavyweight crown in the 1930s at the Madison Square Garden Bowl. It was known as the "Jinx Bowl" because no titleholder ever successfully defended his title there.

The bowl was torn down during [[World War II]] to make way for a US Army Mail Depot. It, in turn, was torn down and the area is now home to a Major World used car dealership and strip mall.

The '''Ministry of Youth and Sports of Turkish Republic''' ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Gençlik ve Spor Bakanlığı}}) is a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Turkey]] in charge of regulating [[Sport in Turkey|activities related to sports]] and youth development in [[Turkish Republic]]. The ministry is headed by [[Akif Çağatay Kılıç]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-t/turkey.html |title=CIA.

==History==
On June 29, 1938, the Directoriate of Physical Education was established. Following the [[Turkish general election, 1969|1969 general election]], in the [[31st government of Turkey|Cabinet Süleyman Demirel II]], the Ministry of Youth and Sports was formed on November 3 for the first time, and [[İsmet Sezgin]] was appointed as its first minister. After the [[Turkish general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the ministry was renamed National Education, Youth and Sports on December 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ankara.gsb.gov.tr/Sayfalar/tarihce.aspx |publisher=Ankara Gençlik Hizmetleri Spor İl Müdürlüğü |title=Tarihçe |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Youth and Sports was re-established as an independent ministry on June 29, 2011 after the forming of [[Cabinet Erdoğan III]]. In the past, the governmental activities on youth and sports affairs were carried out by different governmental agencies subordinated to a state minister, who had also other responsibilities. Those organizations were brought together under the umbrella of the newly established ministry while the status of the provincial organizations were redifened in accordance with the alignment of the [[Community acquis|acquis]] for [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union]].&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/printnews.aspx?DocID=18522058 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Gençlik ve Spor Bakanlığı'na bir müdürlük daha  |date=2011-08-18 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2017, the Ministry has used a picture of [[United States]] gold medalist swimmer [[Dana Vollmer]] in one of its posters but digitally changed the U.S. flag on her cap with a Turkish one. The poster also had “Powerful Turkey” written above the swimmer’s image. Ministry's choice was criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/sports-ministry-uses-us-swimmer-vollmers-picture-in-poster-with-photoshopped-turkish-flag.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=115194&amp;NewsCatID=341 Sports Ministry uses US swimmer Vollmer’s picture in poster with ‘photoshopped’ Turkish flag]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza''' (originally '''Northeastern Pennsylvania Civic Arena and Convention Center''', formerly '''First Union Arena at Casey Plaza''' and '''Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza''') is an 8,050-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Wilkes-Barre Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]], just south of the city of [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], managed by [[SMG (property management)|SMG]].

==History==
Built in 1998 due to the instrumental work of [[Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Robert P. Casey, Sr.]] and his successor, [[Tom Ridge]], due to the dedication and support of [[State Representative]] [[Kevin Blaum]], and built on land given by the [[Greater Wilkes-Barre Chamber]], the arena was originally named the Northeastern Pennsylvania Civic Arena and Convention Center. In 2000, the naming rights were sold to First Union Bank, becoming First Union Arena, until the summer of 2003, when [[First Union Bank]] merged into [[Wachovia]], at which point it became Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza. On January 20, 2010, the arena became Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, as part of a 10-year naming rights contract with the [[Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs]] racetrack and casino.&lt;ref name="timestrib"&gt;{{cite news |first=Coulter|last=Jones|title=Mohegan Sun Receives Naming Rights to the Arena at Casey Plaza|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/mohegan-sun-receives-naming-rights-to-the-arena-at-casey-plaza-1.410411|newspaper=[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)]]|date=December 28, 2009|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been home to the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]], of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] since 1999, and the former home of the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers]], of the [[AF2]] League. In January 2012 it was planned to be the home to the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Shamrocks]] of the [[North American Lacrosse League]], but the league had folded.

==Recognition and events==
The Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza has been recognized by many entertainment magazines as one of the best in the country for arenas under 10,000 in capacity, especially for its attendance and ease of show setup and teardown.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Penguins hold the [[American Hockey League]] record for most sellouts in a season, selling out all 40 home games in 2002–2003 and 2003–2004, and ran a streak of 90 consecutive sellouts between March 2002 and October 2004, and 54 from December 2000 to February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Icecaps Reach Attendance Milestone|url=http://theahl.com/icecaps-reach-attendance-milestone-p175394|publisher=American Hockey League|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pamaramic of Arena.jpg|thumb|left|420px| Panoramic View]]
Other than [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]] hockey games, other events that occur at the arena include [[circus]] performances, an annual [[Christmas]]-time [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]] performance, professional [[ice skating|ice-skating]] shows, [[Harlem Globetrotters]], and the annual graduation ceremonies for nearby Crestwood High School, [[King's College, Pennsylvania|King's College]], [[University of Scranton]], Luzerne County Community College, and [[Marywood University]].

The arena has regularly hosted professional wrestling since 2000. The first event was [[WCW Monday Nitro]] on January 31, 2000. The first [[WWE]] live event was on July 16, 2000 and headlined by [[The Undertaker]] vs. [[Kurt Angle]]. The arena also hosted the [[2007 WWE Draft]] on June 11, 2007 which was the final [[WWE Monday Night Raw]] appearance for the late [[Chris Benoit]]. On November 15, 2016, the arena hosted the 900th episode of [[WWE Smackdown]] which saw the return of The Undertaker.

'''Segelclub Rhe''' (''Sailing Club Rhe'') is the oldest [[yacht club]] in [[Germany]]. It was established in 1855 in [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]].

[[File:SY Rhe 2002 HT.jpg|thumb|right|One of the club's yachts]]
==History==
Segelclub RHE began when Ernst Burow, then a high school student, got a fishing boat as a present and needed a few friends to sail it. The club quickly became very successful and organized not only sailing events in the [[Baltic Sea]] and nearby lakes in the summer, but also [[ice sailing]] competitions in the winter. Segelclub RHE contributed to the foundation of the [[Deutscher Segler-Verband]] (German Sailing Association) in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsv.org/ German Sailing Association]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The club moved from [[Fort Friedrichsburg|Friedrichsburg]] to [[Contienen]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Gause]], ''Die Geschichte der Stadt Königsberg II''&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], following [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation and the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion of Germans from East Prussia]], the yacht club moved to [[Blankenese]], a suburb of [[Hamburg]].
==Description==
Segelclub RHE has a fleet of [[Optimist dinghy|Optimist]]s sailing in the [[Alster]], a quiet tributary of the [[Elbe]], on which many of the present day skippers learned. Segelclub RHE's fleet includes also different types of large sailboats, so that there is room for everyone to learn and participate at every level. Segelclub RHE supports the first German team in [[America's Cup]] through the '''United Internet Team Germany'''. In 2007 this yacht club was a member of the [[International Council of Yacht Clubs]], though it was no longer a member as of June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icoyc.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=313682&amp;ssid=203559&amp;vnf=1 |title=ICOYC MEMBER CLUBS: Club Representatives &amp; Alternates |work=[[International Council of Yacht Clubs]] |date=2017-06-12 |accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club promotes good comradeship "which goes further than the sailing itself" as its core value. Therefore, it favours socialising as much as sailing and it regularly organizes social events at its club house by the river Elbe.

[[Image:Tyson_Chandler.jpg|thumb|right|A "slam dunk"]]

A '''slam dunk''', also simply '''dunk,''' is a type of [[basketball]] shot that is performed when a player jumps in the air, controls the ball above the horizontal plane of the rim, and scores by putting the ball directly through the basket with one or both hands.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]] refers the term [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slam%20dunk "slam dunk"] to the term [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dunk%20shot "dunk shot"], which is defined as "a shot in basketball made by jumping high into the air and throwing the ball down through the basket". M-W dates "slam dunk" at 1972, and "dunk shot" as "circa 1961".&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a type of [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]]; if successful, it is worth two points. Such a shot was known as a "dunk shot"&lt;ref name="definition" /&gt; until the term "slam dunk" was coined by former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] announcer [[Chick Hearn]].&lt;ref&gt;sportsillustrated.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/news/2002/08/05/hearn_monday_ap/ Lakers announcer Hearn dead at 85]. Retrieved 15 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slam dunk is usually the highest percentage shot and a crowd-pleaser. Thus, the maneuver is often extracted from the basketball game and showcased in [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contests]] such as the [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]] held during the annual [[NBA All-Star Weekend]]. The first incarnation of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest was held during the half-time of the 1976 [[American Basketball Association]] All-Star Game.


Dunking was banned in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] from 1967 to 1976. Many people have attributed this to the dominance of the then-college phenomenon Lew Alcindor (now known as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]); the no-dunking rule is sometimes referred to as the "Lew Alcindor rule."&lt;ref&gt;time.com, [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,836963,00.html Lew's Still Loose]. Retrieved 15 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Caponi | first = Gena | title = Signifyin(G), Sanctifyin', &amp; Slam Dunking | publisher = [[University of Massachusetts Press]] | location = Amherst | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-1-55849-183-0 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many others have also attributed the ban as having racial motivations, as at the time most of the prominent dunkers in college basketball were African-American, and the ban took place less than a year after a [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners basketball team|Texas Western team with an all-black starting lineup]] [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game|beat]] [[1965–66 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|an all-white Kentucky team]] to win the national championship.

The phrase "slam dunk" has entered popular usage in American English outside of its basketball meaning, to refer to a "sure thing": an action with a guaranteed outcome, or a similarly impressive achievement. This is related to the high probability of success for a slam dunk versus other types of shots. Additionally, to "be dunked on" is sometimes popularly used to indicate that a person has been easily embarrassed by another, in reference to the embarrassment associated with unsuccessfully trying to prevent an opponent from making a dunk. This ascension to popular usage is reminiscent of, for example, the way that the baseball-inspired phrases "step up to the plate" and "he hit it out of the park," or American football-inspired phrases such as "victory formation" or "hail Mary" have entered popular North American vernacular.

==Introduction==

During the 1940s and '50s, 7-foot center and Olympic Gold Medalist [[Bob Kurland]] was dunking regularly during games.&lt;ref name=sportingnews1996&gt;{{Citation|last=Jackie |first=Krentzman |title=Jam boree - basketball's dunk shot; includes related articles |publisher=[[The Sporting News]] |date=February 12, 1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n7_v220/ai_17932941 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629234506/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n7_v220/ai_17932941 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet defenders viewed the execution of a slam dunk as a personal affront that deserved retribution; thus defenders often intimidated offensive players and thwarted the move. [[Satch Sanders]], a career Boston Celtic from 1960 to 1973, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...in the old days, [defenders] would run under you when you were in the air... ...trying to take people out of games so they couldn't play. It was an unwritten rule..."&lt;ref&gt;NBA Jam Session: A Photo Salute to the NBA Dunk. History. Page 22. 1993, NBA Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Still, by the late 1950s and early '60's players such as [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] had incorporated the move into their offensive arsenal.  The dunk became a fan-favorite, as offensive players began to aggressively intimidate defenders with the threat of vicious slams. Through the 1970s, the slam dunk was standard fare; [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]], [[Julius Erving]], [[Darryl Dawkins]], and others wowed crowds with high-flying moves.

==Dunk types==

Dunk types reflect the various motions performed on the way to the basket. They start with the basic one- or two-hand forward-facing dunk and go on through various levels of athleticism and intricacy. Discrete dunk types can be modified by appending other moves; for example, a player who passes the ball off the backboard, catches it in the air, and executes a ''double-pump dunk'' would be said to have completed a "self-pass off the backboard, double pump".

===Double Clutch===
At the onset of the jump, the ball is controlled by either one or both hands and once in the air is typically brought to chest level. The player will then quickly thrust the ball downwards and fully extend their arms, bringing the ball below the waist. Finally the ball is brought above the head and dunked with one or both hands; and the double clutch appears as one fluid motion. As a demonstration of athletic prowess, the ball may be held in the below-the-waist position for milliseconds longer, thus showcasing the player's hang time (jumping ability).

Whether the result of a 180° spin or body angle at takeoff, the double clutch is generally performed with the player's back toward the rim. While this orientation is rather conducive to the double clutch motion, [[Spud Webb]] was known to perform the dunk while facing the basket. Additionally, [[Kenny "Sky" Walker]], [[Tracy McGrady]]—in the 1989 and 2000 NBA Contests, respectively—and others, have performed 360° variation of the double clutch (McGrady completed a lob self-pass before the dunk). Circa 2007, independent slam dunker T-Dub performed the double clutch with a 540° spin which he concluded by hanging on the rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube: T-Dub Dunks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPFfSO8xozI|accessdate=22 May 2012}} Fast-forward to 00:09 in the video.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomahawk===
[[File:JuliusErvingSlamDunk1981.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julius Erving]] performing a "backscratcher" tomahawk dunk in 1981]]

A Tomahawk dunk can be performed with one or two hands, and when two hands are used, it is called a backscratcher. During the jump, the ball is raised above, and often behind the player's head for a wind-up before slamming the ball down into the net at the apex of the jump. Due to the undemanding body mechanics involved in execution, the tomahawk is employed by players of all sizes and jumping abilities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Because of the ball-security provided by the use of both hands, the two-handed tomahawk is a staple of game situations—frequently employed in alley-oops and in offense-rebound put-back dunks.

In one common variation, a 360° spin may be completed prior to or simultaneously with the tomahawk. Circa 2009, independent slam dunker [[Troy McCray]] pioneered an especially complex variant of the dunk: once the tomahawk motion is complete, instead of slamming the ball in the rim, a windmill dunk (see below) is then performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=101Retro - Troy McCray|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSkQptkSysc&amp;t=1m20s|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-hand backscratcher finish can exert tremendous force on the basket. In 1979, [[Darryl Dawkins]] twice [[Backboard shattering|shattered NBA backboards]] with tomahawk dunks leading to a quickly-enacted rule making it an offence to break the backboard.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Technology has evolved to adapt to the increased strength and weight of players to withstand the force of such dunks, such as the [[breakaway rim]] (introduced to the NBA in 1981) changes to the material used for the backboards, and strengthening of the goal standards themselves.

===Windmill===
Before takeoff, or at the onset of the jump, the ball is brought to the abdomen and then the windmill motion is started by moving the ball below the waist according to the length of the player's fully extended arm. Then following the rotation of the outstretch arm, the ball is moved in a circular motion, typically moving from the front towards the back, and then slammed through the rim (from the profile view of a player facing the basket, the windmill motion most generally appears clockwise). Although, due to momentum, many players are unable to palm the ball through the entire windmill motion, the dunk is often completed with one-hand as [[centripetal force]] allows the player to guide the ball with only their dunking hand. In some instances sticky resins or powders may be applied to the palm, these are thought to improve grip and prevent loss of possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JUMPUSA.com: Stickum Grip Powder|url=http://www.jumpusa.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=STICKUM2|accessdate=21 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606224255/http://www.jumpusa.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=STICKUM2|archivedate=6 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst players, subtle variations in the direction of the windmill depend on bodily orientation at takeoff and also jumping style (one-foot or two-feet) in relation to dominant hand.

There are a number of variations on the windmill, the most common being the aforementioned one- or two-hand variants. In these cases, the windmill motion may be performed with the previously discussed one-arm technique and finished with one- or two-hands, or the player may control the ball with two hands, with both arms performing the windmill motion, finishing with one or both hands. Additionally, the ball may be ''cuffed'' between the hand and the forearm—generally with the dominant hand. The cuff technique provides better ball security, allowing for a faster windmill motion and increased force exerted on the basket at finish, with either one or both hands. Using the cuffing method, players are also afforded the opportunity of performing the windmill motion towards the front (counterclockwise), a technique exploited by French athlete [[Kadour Ziani]] when he pioneered his trademark double-windmill.

Occasionally in the game setting, the windmill is performed via alley-oop but is rarely seen in offense-rebound putback dunks due to the airtime required. [[Dominique Wilkins]] popularized powerful windmills—in games as well as in contests—including two-handed, self-pass, 360°, rim-hang, and combined variants thereof.

===Between the Legs===

For one-footed jumpers, the ball is generally transferred to the non-dominant hand just before or upon take-off; for two-footers, this transfer is often delayed for milliseconds as both hands control the ball to prevent dropping it. Once airborne, the dunker generally transfers the ball from non-dominant to dominant hand beneath a raised leg. Finally, the ball is brought upwards by the dominant hand and slammed through the rim.

The between-the-legs dunk was popularized by [[Isaiah Rider]] in the 1994 NBA slam dunk contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isiah Rider's Between-the-Legs Dunk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEhVqvi7V2w|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that the dunk is often colloquially referred to as a "Rider dunk" — notwithstanding [[Orlando Woolridge]]'s own such dunk in the NBA contest a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orlando Woolride :: 1984 between-the-legs dunk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnWfCOpkAKw|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the under-the-leg has been attempted in the NBA contest by a number of participants, and has been a staple of other contests as well. Its difficulty — due to the required hand-eye coordination, flexibility, and hang-time — keeps it generally reserved for exhibitions and contests, not competitive games. [[Ricky Davis]] has managed to complete the dunk in an NBA game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rick Davis between the legs|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TE9Xv7zSig|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but both he&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Davis failed dunk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3lwssbS3Io|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josh Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh Smith misses between the legs dunk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EprveDGVBA|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have botched at least one in-game attempt as well.

Because of the possible combinations of starting and finishing hands, and raised-legs, there are many variations on the basic under-the-legs dunk—more so than any other.&lt;ref&gt;For both one- and two-footed jumper there are four possible between-the-legs and finishing-hand combinations.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a 1997 French Dunk contest, [[Dali Taamallah]] leapt with his right leg while controlling the ball with his left hand, and once airborne he transferred the ball from his left hand, underneath his right leg to his right hand before completing the dunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying 101 :: Dunk Encyclopedia -- Taamallah|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08uOXR302RU|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBA star [[Jason Richardson]] has also pioneered several notable variations of the between-the-legs including a lob-pass to himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Richardson Lob reverse BTL|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PejeH1uzDJs|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pass off of the backboard to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Richardson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSS9RJnZ4Ok|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent athlete [[Shane Wise|Shane 'Slam' Wise]] introduced a cuffed-cradle of the ball prior to initiating the under the leg transfer and finishing with two-hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying 101 :: Dunk Encyclopedia :: Cradle BTL|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW9W7nshA3s|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a number of players have finished the dunk using one- or two-hands with their backs to the rim, perhaps the most renowned variant of the dunk is the combination with a 360°, or simply stated: a 360-between-the-legs. Due to the athleticism and hang-time required, the dunk is a crowd favorite and is heralded by players as the preeminent of all dunks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Elbow Hang===

The player approaches the basket and leaps as they would for a generic dunk. Instead of simply dunking the ball with one or two hands, the player allows their forearm(s) to pass through the basket, hooking their [[elbow pit]] on the rim before hanging for a short period of time. Although the dunk was introduced by Vince Carter in the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk contest, [[Kobe Bryant]] was filmed performing the dunk two years earlier at an exhibition in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kobe Bryant Elbow hang dunk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLK0rz9pqDc|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially, the dunk has a variety of names including 'honey dip', 'cookie jar', and 'elbow hook'.

In the 2011 NBA contest, [[Los Angeles Clippers]] power-forward [[Blake Griffin]] completed a self-pass off of the backboard prior to elbow-hanging on the rim. A number of other variants of the elbow hang have been executed, including a lob self-pass, hanging by the [[arm pit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armpit hanging on the rim dunk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0qCTrqVScY|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a windmill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haneef Munir Windmill Elbow hang|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsRyCtzGD18|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenny Dobbs Slam Interview (half way down page)|url=http://ballislifeent.com/2011/08/12/slam-magazine-interviews-kenny-dobbs-aka-the-dunk-inventor/|accessdate=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009020307/http://ballislifeent.com/2011/08/12/slam-magazine-interviews-kenny-dobbs-aka-the-dunk-inventor/|archive-date=9 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable are two variations which as of July 2012, have yet to be duplicated. In 2008, Canadian athlete [[Justin Darlington]] introduced an iteration aptly entitled a 'double-elbow hang', in which the player inserts both forearms through the rim and subsequently hangs on both elbows pits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 City Slam High lights @ 04:24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBOv-UTlDA|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 2009, French athlete [[Guy Dupuy]] demonstrated the ability to perform a between-the-legs elbow hang; however, Guy opted not to hang on the rim by his elbow, likely because the downward moment could have resulted in injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TFB :: Guy Dupuy dunks (@ 02:00)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=673NlDNQcBE|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dunk modifiers==
Discussed in this module are activities which when applied, modify a given dunk type. Modifier-activities occur prior to leaping or while airborne. Modifiers performed prior to leaping pertain to the manner of approach (e.g., locomotion or standstill), angle of approach (e.g., from the baseline), distance of leap from the basket, the addition of a pass (e.g., alley-oop), or some combination thereof. Modifiers performed while airborne pertain to bodily rotation (e.g., 360°), obstruction of own vision (e.g., arm-over-the-eyes), other bodily movements superfluous of dunk type (e.g., voluntary kicking of the legs), or some combination thereof. Dunk types can also be modified with obstructions (e.g., leaping over a car or person) which influence activities both prior to leaping and while airborne.

Modifiers are inherent to in-game dunking and conduce toward successful dunking as a means to score points. Modifiers are important in the grading of slam dunk contests because dunk types are made more difficult when modified (i.e., successfully executed modified-dunks ostensibly yield high scores in contests).

For taxonomic purposes it is an important distinction, but the modifiers discussed below are often considered dunk types in common parlance. This misconception is perhaps attributable to the modifier being the most salient component of the dunk from the perspective of the observer. However, each dunk modifier requires a dunk type to be a successful dunk—albeit the most-basic dunk type.

An [[alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oop]] dunk, as it is colloquially known, is performed when a pass is caught in the air and then dunked. The application of an alley-oop to a slam dunk occurs in both games and contests. In games, when only fractions of a second remain on the game or [[shot clock]], an alley-oop may be attempted on in-bound pass because neither clock resumes counting down until an in-bounds player touches the ball. The images to the right depict an interval spanning 1/5 of a second.

The baseline dunk is an approach-modifier of any dunk type in which the player approaches the basket along the court-boundary (baseline) which runs parallel with the backboard. In the game setting, the dunk often comes as the result of a pass, creating an [[Assist (basketball)|assist]] opportunity for a teammate. In the contest, the baseline approach may be used as a means of convenience, facilitating a particular dunk type (e.g., passes bounced off the side of the backboard or its padding) or to increase the difficulty of a dunk type in hopes of meriting higher scores.

===From a distance===
This is a dunk where the player takes off from a distance which is significantly further away from the basket than is considered typical. The free-throw line is most commonly constituted as the take-off point, an effect likely attributed to the easily observable span between the line and the basket in the view of the TV audience. In order to achieve the hang-time and altitude necessary, players will generally leap from one-foot to maximize the momentum generated from the half-court running start often required to complete the dunk. A cornerstone of dunk contests, dunks from a distance are also performed in games, most often on the fast break.

====Free throw line====
In the 1950s, [[Jim Pollard]]&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite book | title = The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia, | publisher = Villard Books | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-43293-0 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilt Chamberlain]]&lt;ref name=ostler/&gt; had both dunked from the free throw line—15 feet from the basket. Chamberlain was able to dunk from the free-throw line without a running start, beginning his forward movement from within the top half of the free-throw circle.&lt;ref name="ostler"/&gt; This was the catalyst for the 1956 NCAA rule change which requires that a shooter maintain both feet behind the line during a free-throw attempt.&lt;ref name=toledo&gt;{{citation |title=That Stilt, Wilt, Responsible For 2 Rule Changes; Kansas' Chamberlain Even Dunked His Foul Shots | newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=November 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1976 [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] Slam Dunk Contest, [[Julius Erving]] dunked after leaping from the free-throw line, with his heel on the line, and has since been credited with introducing the free-throw line dunk to the general public.

In the 1988 [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Slam Dunk Contest]], [[Michael Jordan]] dunked from the free-throw line, in the same manner as [[Julius Erving]], but parted his legs making his dunk more revolutionary than [[Julius Erving|Erving's]].

In the 1990 [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Slam Dunk Contest]], [[Scottie Pippen]] dunked from the free throw line. This was in the first round and Pippen received a score of 47 out of 50 for his dunk. Pippen however didn't proceed to the next round and the contest was won by [[Dominique Wilkins]].

In the 1996 [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Slam Dunk Contest]], winner [[Brent Barry]] dunked from the free-throw line. Barry received 49 (out of 50) for the dunk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3toFlRh0_J8 1996 Brent Barry Dunk From The Freethrow Line]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Slam Dunk Contest|Sprite Slam Dunk Contest]], [[Serge Ibaka]] dunked from behind the free-throw line, getting a score of 45 for the dunk, and finishing 4th.

In the [[2016–17 NBL season|2016 NBL Pre-Season Challenge]] [[Slam Dunk Contest]] in [[Australia]]'s [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]], [[Adelaide 36ers]] 18 year old American import player [[Terrance Ferguson]] dunked from just in front of the free-throw-line.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgoSxvLE3Lw Terrance Ferguson WOWs Australian NBL fans in the 2016 Dunk Comp]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, [[Zach LaVine]] dunked from the free throw line on three occasions: One Hand, Windmill, and Between the Legs. All of the Dunks received a score of 50 for the dunk and won the Dunk contest.

====Other====
Other instances of dunks from a distance abound. [[James White (basketball)|James White]] in the 2006 NCAA Slam Dunk Contest successfully performed tomahawk and windmill variations of the foul-line dunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James White 06 NCAA Slam Dunk Contest|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZtyZWmOLOQ|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was unable to complete a between-the-legs from the foul line at that contest, he has been known to execute it on other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James White free-throw line between the legs @ 04:50|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR2XFpaoOxo|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, [[Jamario Moon]] leaped from the foul-line then, using his non-dominant hand, caught and dunked a bounce-pass from teammate [[Jason Kapono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamario Moon @ 03:01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrp-VRA6Cpo|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent 6'2" North American athlete Eric Bishop introduced a dunk entitled the 'Paint Job'. The title is in reference to the [[key (basketball)|key]] on a basketball court, often known as 'paint' in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dunk Encyclopedia :: Paint Job|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjPnd5Uzgyk|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching along the baseline with a running dribble, Bishop jumped with one-foot at the border of the key, dunked with one-hand while gliding over the key and landed just beyond the border on the side opposite his take-off—a 16-foot flight.

===Obstructions===

The player approaches the basket and obstruction, and then leaps. During flight, some portion of the player's body is elevated above the obstruction. This may entail raising the legs or some portion thereof in-air to soar over the obstruction. In other instances, the trunk-moves over an obstruction as the legs pass around it. Common obstructions include: motor vehicles; crouched, seated or standing person(s); ball rack; or other available objects.

Perhaps the most popular obstruction-modified dunk is the Dubble-Up. Aptly eponymous of the its pioneer—[[T-Dub]], an American dunker hailing from Minnesota—the Dubble-Up starts with a person standing before the basket, holding the ball above their head. The dunker approaches and leaps as though their groin would soar above just above the head and their legs around the stationary person. Just prior to clearing the person, the dunker will assume control of the ball with one or both hands, guide it under a raised leg, transferring it to the appropriate hand, clearing the ball-holder, raising the ball above the horizontal plane of the rim, and finally guiding it downward through the basket.  While the Dubble-Up mimics a between-the-legs dunk, [[Kenny Dobbs]] and [[Justin Darlington]] have both performed an under-both-legs variant.

Other obstruction-dunks are worth noting: [[Haneef Munir]] performed a Dubble-Up, dunking with his right-hand and then caught and dunked a second ball with his left hand—a yet to be duplicated dunk pioneered by [[Jordan Kilganon]] on a lower, non-regulation rim. Jordan Kilganon, a Canadian athlete, approached from the baseline a person standing, holding the ball above their head. Kilganon leaped, controlled the ball in front of his torso and raised it above the horizontal plane of the rim before bringing the ball downward into the hoop and hooking both elbows on and hanging from the rim.

==Effectiveness==
A study was carried out in 2015 to show the effectiveness of different shot types, including slam dunks. The study was carried out across five different levels of basketball (NBA, EuroBasket, the Slovenian 1st Division, and two minor leagues). Overall the study showed that slam dunks were a very effective way of scoring in the game of basketball, particularly in the NBA, which had the highest dunk percentage in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Erčulj, F. (2015). Basketball Shot Types and Shot Success in Different Levels of Competitive Basketball . PLOS One , e0128885.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable dunks==
[[Wilt Chamberlain]] was known to have dunked on an experimental 12-foot basket set up by [[Phog Allen]] at the [[University of Kansas]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=ostler&gt;{{cite news | last = Ostler | first = Scott | title = The Leaping Legends of Basketball | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date = February 12, 1989 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Wilson (basketball)|Michael Wilson]], a former [[Harlem Globetrotters|Harlem Globetrotter]] and [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|University of Memphis]] basketball player, matched this feat on April 1, 2000 albeit with an [[alley-oop]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[Vince Carter]] dunked while leaping over 7-foot-2 (2.18 m) French center [[Frédéric Weis]] in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. The French media dubbed it "''[[le dunk de la mort]]''" — "the dunk of death."

At least one player has performed a 720 degree dunk (that is, two full turns in the air): [[Taurian Fontenette]] also known as Air Up There during a [[Streetball]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Video|first=Dunk|title=720 Dunk by "The Air Up There"|url=http://dunkvideo.com/streetball/720-dunk-by-the-air-up-there|work=Notable Dunks|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the NBA Slam Dunk Contest===
{{main|NBA Slam Dunk Contest}}
Several notable and remarkable dunks have been performed by participants in the annual NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

[[Spud Webb]] at {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}} defeated {{convert|6|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}} [[Dominique Wilkins]] in the 1986 contest.

[[Michael Jordan]] popularized a dunk referred to by some fans as the "Leaner". This dunk was so called because Jordan's body was not perpendicular to the ground while performing the dunk. TNT viewers rated it "the best dunk of all time" over Vince Carter's between-the-legs slam.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest Carter used an elbow hang along with his reverse 360 windmill dunk and between-the-legs dunk. When performed, much of the audience was speechless, including the judges, because none had seen these types of dunks before (Carter's first round 360 windmill dunk is reminiscent of Kenny Walker's 360 windmill dunk in 1989 except that Carter spins clockwise, whereas Walker spins counter-clockwise).

In the 2008 Sprite Rising Star's Slam Dunk Contest [[Dwight Howard]] performed the "Superman" dunk. He donned a [[Superman]] outfit as [[Orlando Magic]] guard [[Jameer Nelson]] tied a cape around his shoulders. Nelson [[alley-oop]]ed the [[basketball]] as Howard jumped from within the [[Key (basketball)|key]] side of the free throw circle line, caught the ball, and threw it through the rim. This dunk is somewhat controversial, as his hand was not over as well as on a vertical plane to the rim. Some insist that it should in fact be considered a dunk because the ball was thrust downward into the basket, meeting the basic definition of the dunk.

During the 2009 NBA dunk contest, Howard had a separate goal brought onto the court, and the rim was noticeably significantly higher than a standard goal. Howard, after going into a 1950s-era telephone booth and again fashioning the Superman attire, caught a pass from Nelson and easily completed a two-handed dunk on the higher goal. While this was not performed for record-setting purposes, the dunk received a perfect score and a warm response from the crowd, in part because of its theatrics. Also in this contest, 5'9" guard [[Nate Robinson]] wore a green [[New York Knicks]] jersey and green sneakers to represent [[Kryptonite]], playing on Howard's Superman theme. He used a green "Kryptonite" ball, and jumped over the 6'11" Howard prior to dunking. This dunk and the theatrics could have won the competition for Robinson, who was voted the winner by the NBA fans. Robinson then thanked Howard for graciously allowing him to dunk over him, asking the crowd to also give Howard a round of applause.

[[JaVale McGee]] currently holds the world record for Most Basketball Dunks in a Single Jump: three. While competing in the 2011 NBA Sprite Slam Dunk Contest, McGee jumped with two balls in his possession and dunked each prior to receiving and slamming an alley-oop pass from then teammate [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/10000/most-basketball-dunks-in-a-single-jump|title=Most basketball dunks in a single jump|publisher=|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broken backboards===
{{main|Backboard shattering}}
In the past, it has been possible for players to dunk a basketball and pull the rim down so hard that the glass backboard shatters, either around the rim itself or, at times, shattering the entire backboard, or the entire goal standard fails. Reinforced backboards and [[breakaway rim]]s have minimized this at the college and professional levels, but it still happens at lower levels.

All-star power forward [[Gus Johnson (basketball)|Gus Johnson]] of the Baltimore Bullets was the first of the famous backboard breakers in the NBA, shattering three during his career in the 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="goldaper"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Goldaper | first = Sam |title =Gus Johnson, Ex-N.B.A. Star with Baltimore, is Dead at 48 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 30, 1987 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D6153FF933A05757C0A961948260 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucious Jackson|Luke Jackson]] also shattered a backboard in 1968: {{quote |text=The game was delayed for nearly half an hour when Philadelphia's burly Luke Jackson shattered the glass backboard when he came down on the basket, ripping it from its moorings, on a driving stuff shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]] |date = November 12, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Darryl Dawkins]] of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] was notorious for two glass-shattering dunks in 1979 resulting in the league threatening to fine him and eventually installing [[breakaway rim]]s.&lt;ref name="bierman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bierman | first = Fred | title =In the Distance, the Sound of 'Chocolate Thunder' | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = February 4, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/sports/basketball/04glass.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice in his rookie season ({{nbay|1992}}) during games, center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] dunked so hard that he broke the hydraulic support of one goal standard (against the [[Phoenix Suns]]) and broke the welds holding up another goal standard, causing the basket to break off and fall to the floor (against the [[New Jersey Nets]]), although in neither case did the glass break. This resulted in reinforced backboard supports as well. During that same season, New Jersey's [[Chris Morris (basketball)|Chris Morris]] shattered a backboard in a game against the [[Chicago Bulls]] (the most recent shattered-backboard incident in the NBA to date). The NBA has made shattering the backboard a [[technical foul]], although it will not count towards a player's count of seven that can draw a suspension, or two towards ejection from a game, and it counts towards a player's count of six personal fouls. This has assisted in deterring this action, as it can cost the team points.

In the ABA, [[Charlie Hentz]] broke two backboards in the same game on November 6, 1970 resulting in the game being called.&lt;ref name=sivault&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Roundup Of The Sports Information Of The Week |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=November 16, 1970 |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084305/index.htm |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006235133/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084305/index.htm |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the NCAA, [[Jerome Lane]] shattered a backboard while playing for [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pitt]] in a 1988 regular-season game against [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]], and [[Darvin Ham]] did the same while playing for [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Texas Tech]] in a [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|tournament]] game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in 1996.

The [[Premier Basketball League]] has had two slam-dunks that have resulted in broken backboards. Both came consecutively in the 2008 and 2009 PBL Finals, and both were achieved by Sammy Monroe of the [[Rochester Razorsharks]].

==Dunking in women's play==
[[File:Sylvia-Fowles-2008-NCAA-Final-Four.jpg|thumb|upright|Sylvia Fowles is one of five players to dunk during a WNBA game.]]
Dunking is much less common in [[women's basketball]] than in men's play. Dunking is slightly more common during practice sessions, but many coaches advise against it in competitive play because of the risks of injury or failing to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=Below the Rim: Why are there so few dunks in women's basketball?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/explainer/2012/03/brittney_griner_dunk_why_are_there_so_few_jams_in_women_s_basketball_.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Cardte Hicks]] became the first woman to dunk in a professional game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/basketball/aces-wnba/pioneers-cardte-hicks-musiette-mckinney-embrace-las-vegas-aces/|title=Pioneers Cardte Hicks, Musiette McKinney embrace Las Vegas Aces|publisher=[[Las Vegas Review Journal]]|accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a men's professional game in [[Holland]].

In 1984, [[Georgeann Wells]], a 6'7" (201&amp;nbsp;cm) junior playing for [[West Virginia Mountaineers|West Virginia University]], became the first woman to score a slam dunk in women's collegiate play, in a game against the [[University of Charleston]] on December 21.&lt;ref&gt;wsj.com, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123750766297390343 The First Dunk: A Sports Milestone in Women's Basketball]. Retrieved 9 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, 11 dunks have been scored in [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] play. The first and second were scored by [[Lisa Leslie]] of the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], on July 30, 2002 (against the [[Miami Sol]]), and July 9, 2005. Other WNBA dunks have been scored by [[Michelle Snow]], [[Candace Parker]] (twice), and [[Sylvia Fowles]].

The record for the most WNBA dunks belongs to [[Brittney Griner]]. As a high school senior, she dunked 52 times in 32 games and set a single-game record of seven dunks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baylor.edu/lariat/news.php?action=story&amp;story=64166{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a standout at [[Baylor Lady Bears basketball|Baylor University]], Griner became the seventh player to dunk during a women's college basketball game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/w-baskbl/recaps/010210aac.html |title=Griner Dunks Twice in WBB's 99-18 Win|publisher=Baylorbears.com |date= 2010-01-02|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second woman to dunk twice in a single college game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interbasket.net/news/2010/01/03/video-brittney-griner-dunks-twice-baylor-wins-by-81/ Brittney Griner dunks twice, Baylor wins by 81 (video)].&lt;/ref&gt; In her WNBA debut on May 27, 2013, Griner dunked twice, and as of 2014, has five WNBA dunks, including the first in a playoff game (August 25, 2014).

At the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|2012 London Olympics]], [[Liz Cambage]] of the [[Australia women's national basketball team|Australian Opals]] became the first woman to dunk in the Olympics, scoring against [[Russia women's national basketball team|Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/basketball/highlights-aussie-liz-cambage-dunks-against-russia.html|title=Page not found - NBC Olympics|publisher=|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in dunk contests===

In 2004, as a high school senior, Candace Parker was invited to participate in the [[McDonald's All-American Game]] and accompanying festivities where she competed in and won the slam dunk contest.&lt;ref&gt;[[McDonald's All-American Game#Dunk Contest]] McDonald's All-American Game :: Past Slam Dunk Contest winners at Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years other women have entered the contest; though [[Kelley Cain]], [[Krystal Thomas]], and [[Maya Moore]] were denied entry into the same contest in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://girlshoops.scout.com/2/630414.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520122207/http://girlshoops.scout.com/2/630414.html |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df= }} Article at GirlsHoops.com about the Ladies being denied participation in the '07 Contest.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittney Griner intended to participate in the 2009 McDonald's Dunk Contest but was unable to attend the event due to the attendance policy of her high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/high-school/girls-basketball/story/_/id/3946509/griner-attend-mcdonald-game] ESPN.com article about Britney Griner missing '09 Contest&lt;/ref&gt; [[Breanna Stewart]], at 6'3" (191&amp;nbsp;cm), [[Alexis Prince]] (6'2"; 188&amp;nbsp;cm), and [[Brittney Sykes]] (5'9"; 175&amp;nbsp;cm) competed in the 2012 contest; Prince and Sykes failed to complete their dunks, while Stewart landed two in the first round but missed her second two attempts in the final round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcdonaldsallamerican.com/2012JamFestResults.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Results of 2012 Contest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013220229/http://lovewomensbasketball.com/2012/03/27/video-breanna-stewart-dunks-twice-during-powerade-jam-fest-dunk-championship/] Review of 2012 Contest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as a phrase==
One of many [[List of sports idioms|sports idioms]], the phrase "slam dunk" is often used outside of basketball to refer [[colloquial]]ly to something that has a certain outcome or guaranteed success (a "sure thing").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.voanews.com/learningenglish/home/a-23-2007-03-14-voa1-83135287.html?refresh=1 "He Shoots, He Scores; She Shoots, She Scores.

'''Stadio San Paolo''' ({{lang-en|Saint Paul Stadium}}) is a stadium in the western suburb of [[Fuorigrotta]] in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], and is the third largest football stadium in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/5957cb44-65fe-43d2-bbf5-48e336f48b23 |title=Some of the world's scariest places to play or watch football |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[San Siro]] and [[Stadio Olimpico]]. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]], it hosted the [[Football at the 1960 Summer Olympics|football]] preliminaries. It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home of [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. The stadium was built in 1959 and underwent extensive renovations in 1989 for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. The present capacity of the San Paolo is 60,240.

The stadium is probably most famous for hosting the 1990 World Cup semi-final between [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. Considered to be the most intriguing match of that World Cup, [[Diego Maradona]], who played for Naples's Italian 1st division team, asked for the Napoli fans to cheer for Argentina.  The Napoli [[tifosi]] responded by hanging a flag in their "[[Curva (stadia)|curva]]" of the stadium saying "Maradona, Naples loves you, but Italy is our homeland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Diego|last=Maradona|title=El Diego, pg. 166|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was touching for Maradona as Napoli was the only stadium during that World Cup that the Argentinian national anthem was not jeered. The match finished 1–1 after extra time. A penalty shoot out ensued with Maradona fittingly scoring the winning penalty for Argentina.

==Recent times==
Even with [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|Serie C1]] during the 2005–06 season, Napoli achieved the feat of having the 3rd highest average home attendance in Italy for the season with only two [[Serie A]] clubs, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] having higher attendances. Napoli's final game of the season drew a crowd of 51,000 which now stands as a Serie C record.

San Paolo also hosted Italy's [[2008 European Football Championship|Euro 2008 Qualifier]] vs [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] on 2 September 2006 with the possibility of other qualifiers to be played there in the future.

==Renaming==
The Naples city council asked the Italian government for permission to rename the stadium after [[Diego Maradona]]. The Argentine legend helped Napoli to win Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990, and he remains a popular figure in the city.

The council voted to ask for the renaming of the San Paolo stadium, but one stumbling block is an Italian law prohibiting public buildings to be named after any person who has not been dead for at least 10 years.

==1990 FIFA World Cup==
The stadium was one of the venues of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], and held five matches The first two were [[Argentina national football team|Argentina’s]] Group B matches. The first was against [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] on June 13 winning 2-0 and the second was against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on June 18 ending in a 1-1 draw. The next two were [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] matches. The first was a Round of 16 match against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] on June 23 winning 2-1 after extra time and the second was a Quarter-finals match against [[England national football team|England]] on July 1 losing 3-2 after extra time. The fifth and last was the Semi-final between Argentina and hosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on July 3 with Argentina winning 4-3 on penalties after drawing 1-1 in the extra time.

==2018-2019 Renovation==
The Stadium will be undergoing renovation in preparation for the [[2019 Summer Universiade|2019 Universiade]], this includes replacing fencing with glass railings and replacing seats. This means the stadium's capacity will be reduced from 60,240 to 55,000. &lt;ref&gt;http://stadiumdb.com/news/2018/07/naples_the_great_no_its_just_repairs_for_san_paolo&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2974">The '''Swedish bandy league system''' is a series of [[League system|interconnected leagues]] for club [[bandy]] in [[Sweden]].

== Current system ==
The table below shows how the system works as of the [[2014–15 in Swedish bandy|2014–2015 season]]. For each division, its Swedish name and number of clubs is given.

This present system was introduced for the [[2007–08 in Swedish bandy|2007–2008 season]]. The changes are a top division with fewer teams which has also changed its name, it is now called Elitserien ("the Elite League"). 

It is not guaranteed that each division is a feeder of teams to the division that lies directly above it and relegates teams to the divisions that lie directly below it, even though this usually is the case. Some years, all the teams which are facing the risk of relegation get to play a qualification round in the end of the season against the best teams from the division below. Other years, the last teams in the leagues have been automatically relegated.

==Previous systems==

===1981/82 – 2006/07===

During the seasons 1981/82 – 2006/07, [[Allsvenskan and Elitserien (bandy)|Allsvenskan and Elitserien]] was the combined top-tier. The top-tier had the name Allsvenskan in the beginning of the season (in the autumn). Allsvenskan had two groups, one northern group and one southern group. After Christmas the best of the teams from the two groups of Allsvenskan played in Elitserien (which always premiered on [[Boxing Day]], 26 December) while the rest of the teams played in Superallsvenskan. The teams in Superallsvenskan faced the risk of being relegated to the second level league.

The second level was called Division 1.

===1931/32 – 1981/82===

The top-tier Swedish bandy league which was instated in 1931 was called Division 1. The second level was called Division 2.

== History ==
''The Ringer'' was launched in 2016 by Simmons, who brought along several editors who had previously worked with him on ''[[Grantland]]'', an [[ESPN]]-owned blog he operated from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At launch, the Ringer had a staff of 43 and focused primarily on sports and pop culture as content areas, with a few writers also working on technology and politics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[HBO]], the network on which Simmons hosted his weekly television program ''[[Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons|Any Given Wednesday]]'' one season in 2016, was an initial investor in the website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The website was previously published on the [[Medium (website)|Medium]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medium: Home of The Ringer|url = https://medium.com/@el/medium-home-of-the-ringer-829dd263f955#.ngt4txhz0|website = Medium|date = 2016-02-23|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = Edward|last = Lichty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, ''The Ringer'' entered into an advertising and technology partnership with [[Vox Media]], under which Vox would handle advertising sales for ''The Ringer'' under a revenue sharing arrangement, and the site would also have access to Vox's internal publishing platform Chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/bill-simmons-vox-media-advertising-technology-1202447469/|title=Bill Simmons’ The Ringer Inks Advertising, Tech Pact With Vox Media|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2017-05-30|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Grantland writers who have since written for or worked for ''The Ringer'' include [[Mark Titus]], [[Shea Serrano]], Ben Lindbergh, Robert Mays, Sean Fennessey, Chris Ryan, Mallory Rubin, [[Juliet Litman]], Craig Gaines, Bryan Curtis, Ryan O'Hanlon, Danny Chau, Jason Concepcion, Riley McAtee, Joe Fuentes, and Tate Frazier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadspin.com/bill-simmonss-new-site-has-a-name-and-some-new-hires-1759630024|title=Bill Simmons's New Site Has A Name And Some New Hires|last=Kalaf|first=Samer|work=Deadspin|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Like the content on the website, the Ringer's podcast network covers both sports and pop culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theringer.com/the-ringer-podcast-network-78792908eaff|title=The Ringer Podcast Network – The Ringer|date=2016-05-02|work=The Ringer|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flagship podcast, the ''Bill Simmons Podcast'', is an interview show hosted by Simmons, featuring other Ringer writers and podcast hosts as well as athletes, filmmakers, comedians, and pop culture figures. Popular podcast hosts include former ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' correspondent [[Larry Wilmore]] (host of ''Black on Air'') and [[James Beard Foundation Award|James Beard Award]]-winning chef [[David Chang]] (''The David Chang Show'').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Former podcasts include ''[[Keepin' it 1600]]'', a politics podcast featuring former Obama speechwriters [[Jon Favreau (speechwriter)|Jon Favreau]], [[Daniel Pfeiffer|Dan Pfeiffer]], and others. After leaving the Ringer, the hosts of ''Keepin' it 1600'' created a new podcast called ''[[Pod Save America]]'' as part of their own new media company, [[Crooked Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/keeping-1600-podcasts-obama-alums-launch-new-show-crooked-media-company-961556|title='Keeping It 1600' Podcast's Obama Alums Launch New Show and 'Crooked Media' Company|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''The Ringer'' began the video podcast series ''Talk the Thrones'', an [[aftershow]] for ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' hosted by Ringer staff writers and [[live-streamed]] on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21727094-tech-firms-are-splashing-out-new-series-facebook-twitter-and-apple-get-television|title=Facebook, Twitter and Apple get into the television business|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Talk the Thrones'' is a continuation of ''[[After the Thrones]]'', which aired on HBO&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-talk-the-thrones-twitter-periscope-the-ringer-free-a7789306.html|title=Game of Thrones aftershow 'Talk the Thrones' picked up by Twitter|date=2017-06-14|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As of April 30, 2018, The Ringer's world-wide Alexa ranking is 2,077 with over 15 million views per month. Of those, 6,150,000 are unique visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hypestat.com/info/theringer.com|title=theringer.com info|date=2018-04-30|work=HypeStat|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bryan Colangelo story===
In May 2018, The Ringer published a story by Ben Detrick about [[Bryan Colangelo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz|title=The Curious Case of Bryan Colangelo and the Secret Twitter Account|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then the GM of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and his apparent use of various [[Twitter]] accounts to criticize players and/or defend himself. This led to Colangelo's resignation on June 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23723964/bryan-colangelo-resigns-president-philadelphia-76ers|title=Bryan Colangelo resigns as president of 76ers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">'''Westgate Park''' is a former [[baseball]] stadium located in [[San Diego, California]]. The ballpark was home to the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] from 1958 to 1967.

The ballpark was located in the largely undeveloped [[Mission Valley]] region of San Diego. The location was on Friars Road at State Route 395 (now [[California State Route 163|State Route 163]]), in the northeast corner of what is now the [[Fashion Valley Mall]].&lt;ref name="UT 2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040404/news_mz1x4previou.html|title=Previous Homes of the San Diego Padres|date=April 4, 2004|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Westgate was built to replace the deteriorating [[Lane Field (baseball)|Lane Field]], where the minor-league Padres had played since 1936. Constructed for $1 million in private funds by Padres owner [[C. Arnholt Smith]], Westgate was a modern stadium with a capacity of 8,268 fans, with an eye to be expanded to major league size (up to 40,000) if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/apr/09/1cz9history191218-westgate-park-major-marvel-home-/|title=Westgate Park a major marvel as home for minor-league Padres|last=Crawford|first=Richard|date=April 9, 2009|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 when it opened, "Not even Yankee Stadium or Boston's Fenway Park can surpass the comforts and conveniences of the Padres' new home. ... This is a real ballpark, built for the game of baseball, a ballpark in which the city of San Diego can take great pride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sabr.org/node/27047 |title=Westgate Park (San Diego) |date= |website=sabr.org |publisher= |accessdate=August 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for the Westgate-California Tuna Packing Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fetzer |first=Leland |date=2005 |title=San Diego County Place Names A to Z |location=San Diego |publisher=Sunbelt Publications |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Padres games played in Westgate were on April 28, 1958, a day-night doubleheader versus the [[Phoenix Firebirds|Phoenix Giants]]. The afternoon game attracted 4,619 fans, while the nightcap attracted 7,129 fans.

However, the [[American Football League]]'s [[San Diego Chargers]] were demanding a new stadium to replace [[Balboa Stadium]], a structure dating from about 1915. With major league baseball soon to arrive, the city decided to build a single, [[multi-purpose stadium]] for both baseball and football. The new facility was initially called [[SDCCU Stadium|San Diego Stadium]]. 
This ended the possibility of expansion for Westgate. The minor league Padres played the 1968 season in the cavernous (by PCL standards) new stadium, knowing they were a lame duck, with the major league [[San Diego Padres]] set to begin play the next year. Plans for Fashion Valley Mall were unveiled in December 1967, and Westgate was razed by 1969 to make room.

'''Whataburger Field''' is the [[minor league baseball]] [[stadium]] located in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], United States. It is currently home to the [[Corpus Christi Hooks]], the double-A affiliate of the [[Houston Astros]].  Along with on-campus [[Chapman Field (baseball)|Chapman Field]], the stadium also serves as one of the homes to the [[Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi]] Islanders [[college baseball]] team.&lt;ref name="facil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi Athletic Facilities|url=http://goislanders.com/information/facilities/index|publisher=Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi Athletics|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of an international governing body for Obstacle Racing was originally proposed by [[Joe Desena|Joe DeSenna]], the founder and owner of [[Spartan Race]]. This was announced in May, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spartan-race-announces-appointment-of-ian-adamson-to-lead-launch-of-independent-international-obstacle-racing-federation-257538181.html|title=Spartan Race Announces Appointment Of Ian Adamson To Lead Launch Of Independent International Obstacle Racing Federation|last=|first=|date=May 1, 2014|work=PR Newswire|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when world champion adventure athlete [[Ian Adamson (adventure racer)|Ian Adamson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_29988562/boulders-own-extreme-athletes|title=Boulders own extreme atheltes|last=Heckle|first=Aimee|date=August 6, 2016|work=Daily Camera|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ianadamson.com/|title=Ian Adamson website|last=|first=|date=|website=Ian Adamson|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepted the job of leading the federation and sport, originally called the International Obstacle Racing Federation.

The organization filed as a Colorado non-profit sporting organization in early 2016 under the name the ''International Obstacle Sports Federation (IOSF).''
