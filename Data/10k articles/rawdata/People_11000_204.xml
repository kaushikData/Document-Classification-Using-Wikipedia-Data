&lt;!--READ FIRST: General consensus holds that Afrikaners should be described first and foremost as a Southern African ethnic group. Terms such as "European", "Eurocentric", and "Germanic" may be considered pejorative in the lead (i.e. "European ethnic group in Africa") and should not be added without a broad change in consensus. Please raise this issue first on the talk page, even if sources are cited. Thank you.--&gt;

'''Afrikaners''' ({{lang-af|Afrikaners}}, {{IPA-af|afrəˈkɑːnərs, afri-|pron}}) are a [[Southern Africa]]n [[ethnic group]] descended from predominantly [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[settler]]s first arriving in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"&gt;Entry: Cape Colony. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Volume 4 Part 2: Brain to Casting''. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. 1933. James Louis Garvin, editor.&lt;/ref&gt; They traditionally dominated [[South Africa]]'s agriculture and politics prior to 1994.&lt;ref name="zastudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Irving|title=Area Handbook for the Republic of South Africa|pages=46–771|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED056947.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Afrikaans]], South Africa's fifth-most widely spoken home language, is the [[First language|mother tongue]] of Afrikaners and most [[Cape Coloureds]].&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; It evolved from the [[Dutch language|Dutch vernacular]]&lt;ref&gt;K.

Moletsane, Making Connections: Self-Study &amp; Social Action, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heese1971 /&gt; of [[South Holland]], incorporating words brought from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and [[Madagascar]] by slaves.&lt;ref name="Malay"&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Wouden|first=Ton|title=Roots of Afrikaans: Selected writings of Hans den Besten|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaners make up approximately 5.2% of the total South African population based on the number of [[white South African]]s who speak Afrikaans as a first language in the [[South African National Census of 2011]].&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt;

The arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] at [[Calicut]] in 1498 opened a gateway of free access to Asia from [[Western Europe]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]; however, it also necessitated the founding and safeguarding of trade stations in the East.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; Very rapidly one European power followed another, all eager to trade along this route. The Portuguese landed in [[Mossel Bay]] in 1500, explored [[Table Bay]] two years later, and by 1510 had started raiding inland.&lt;ref name="Kaap"&gt;{{cite book | last = Alexander Wilmot &amp; John Centlivres Chase| authorlink = | title = History of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope: From Its Discovery to the Year 1819 |edition= 2010 |pages= 1–548 | publisher = Claremont: David Philip (Pty) Ltd| isbn= 978-1144830159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards the [[Dutch Republic]] sent merchant vessels to India, and in 1602 founded the [[Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie]] (''Dutch East India Company''; VOC).&lt;ref name="VanGoor"&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Goor, Jurrien| authorlink = | title = Prelude to Colonialism: The Dutch in Asia|edition= 2005|pages= 9–83 | publisher = Verloren B.V., Uitgeverij| isbn = 978-9065508065}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the volume of traffic rounding the Cape increased, the Company recognised its natural harbour as an ideal watering point for the long voyage around Africa to the Orient and established a victualling station there in 1652.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; VOC officials did not favour the [[Settler colonialism|permanent settlement]] of Europeans in their trading empire, although during the 140 years of Dutch rule many VOC servants retired or were discharged and remained as private citizens.&lt;ref name="VanGoor"/&gt; Furthermore, the exigencies of supplying local garrisons and passing fleets compelled the administration to confer free status upon employees and oblige them to become independent farmers.&lt;ref name="Keegan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Keegan| first = Timothy| authorlink = | title = Colonial South Africa and the Origins of the Racial Order|edition= 1996|pages= 15–37 | publisher = David Philip Publishers (Pty) Ltd| isbn = 978-0813917351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the success of this experiment, the Company extended free passage from 1685 to 1707 for Hollanders wishing to settle at the Cape.&lt;ref name="Keegan"/&gt; In 1688 it sponsored the immigration of 200 [[French people|French]] [[Huguenot]] refugees forced into exile by the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref name="Greaves"&gt;{{cite book|last= Greaves|first=Adrian|title=The Tribe that Washed its Spears: The Zulus at War|location=Barnsley|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military|edition=2013|pages= 36–55|isbn=978-1629145136|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms under which the Huguenots agreed to immigrate were the same offered to other VOC subjects, including free passage and requisite farm equipment on credit. Prior attempts at cultivating vineyards or exploiting olive groves for fruit had been unsuccessful, and it was hoped that Huguenot colonists accustomed to Mediterranean agriculture could succeed where the Dutch had failed.&lt;ref name="Theale"&gt;Theale, George McCall (4 May 1882).

[[Afrikaner nationalism]] has taken the form of political parties and secret societies such as the [[Afrikaner Broederbond|Broederbond]] in the twentieth century. In 1914 the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] was formed to promote Afrikaner economic interests and sever South Africa's ties to the [[United Kingdom]]. Rising to prominence by winning the 1948 general elections, it has also been noted for enforcing a harsh policy of racial segregation (''[[apartheid]]'') while simultaneously declaring South Africa a republic and withdrawing from the [[British Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The term "Afrikaner" presently denotes the politically, culturally and socially dominant group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |authorlink= |title=One Europe, many nations: a historical dictionary of European national groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC |accessdate=25 May 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |isbn=0313309841 |page=769}}&lt;/ref&gt; among white South Africans, or the [[Afrikaans]]-speaking population of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] origin&amp;mdash;although their original progenitors also included smaller numbers of [[Flemish people|Flemish]], [[Huguenot|French Huguenot]], and [[Germans|German]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; Historically, the terms "[[Burgher (Boer republics)|burgher]]" and "Boer" have both been used to describe white Afrikaans speakers as a group; neither is particularly objectionable but Afrikaner has been considered a more appropriate term.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; The term was in common usage in both the [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] and the [[Cape Colony]] by the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;S. W. Martin, ''Faith Negotiating Loyalties: An Exploration of South African Christianity Through a Reading of the Theology of H. Richard Niebuhr'' (University Press of America, 2008), {{ISBN|0761841113}}, pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, ''burghers'' merely denoted ''[[Cape Dutch]]'', settlers who were influential in the administration, able to participate in urban affairs, and did so regularly. ''[[Boers]]'' often referred to the settled European farmers or nomadic cattle herders. During the [[Batavian Republic]], "burgher" was popularised among Dutch communities both at home and abroad as a popular revolutionary form of address, or ''citizen''.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; In South Africa, it remained in use as late as the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name="Conspiracy"&gt;{{cite book | last = CH Thomas| authorlink = | title = Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed: The Conspiracy of the 19th Century Unmasked|edition= 1900|pages= 144–146 | publisher = Hodder and Stoughton| isbn= 9781437510454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded instance of a colonist identifying as an "Afrikaner" occurred in March 1707, during a disturbance in [[Stellenbosch]].&lt;ref name="Lion"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rian Malan| authorlink = | title = The Lion Sleeps Tonight|edition= 2012|pages= 144–146 | publisher = Grove Press UK| isbn= 978-1-61185-994-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[magistrate]], Johannes Starrenburg, ordered an unruly crowd to desist, a white teenager named Hendrik Biebouw retorted, "''Ik ben een Afrikaander - al slaat de landdrost mij dood, of al zetten hij mij in de tronk, ik zal, nog wil niet zwijgen!''" ("I am an African - even if the magistrate were to beat me to death, or put me in jail, I shall not be, nor will I stay, silent!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2012/06/06/letter-i-too-am-an-african|title=LETTER: I, too, am an African|work=Business Day Live|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biebouw was flogged for his insolence and later banished to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Jakarta]].&lt;ref name=gilomafrikaners /&gt;{{rp|22}} It is believed that "Afrikaner" in question initially indicated [[Cape Coloured]]s or other groups claiming mixed ancestry. Biebouw himself had numerous half-caste siblings and may have identified with Coloureds socially.&lt;ref name="Lion"/&gt; However, this defiant secession from Dutch law and sovereignty was a leap towards defining another consciousness for white South Africa, suggesting for the first time a group identification with the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] rather than any ancestral homeland in Europe.&lt;ref name="Middle"&gt;{{cite book | last = Breyten Breytenbach| authorlink = | title = Notes from the Middle World|edition= 2009 |page= 74  | publisher = Haymarket Books| isbn= 978-1-61185-994-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) initially had no intention of planting a permanent European settlement at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]; until 1657 it devoted as little attention as possible to the development or administration of the [[Dutch Cape Colony]].&lt;ref name=Hunt1&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=John|editor-last=Campbell|editor-first=Heather-Ann|title=Dutch South Africa: Early Settlers at the Cape, 1652-1708|date=2005|pages=13–35|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1904744955}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the VOC's perspective, there was little financial incentive to regard the region as anything more than the site of a strategic victualing centre.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Furthermore, the Cape was unpopular among VOC employees, who regarded it as a barren and insignificant outpost with little opportunity for advancement.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt;

A small number of longtime VOC employees who had been instrumental in the colony's founding and its first five years of existence, however, expressed interest in applying for grants of land, with the objective of retiring at the Cape as farmers.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; In time they came to form a class of ''"vrijlieden"'', also known as ''"vrijburgers"'' (free citizens), former VOC employees who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts.&lt;ref name=Parthesius&gt;{{cite book|last=Parthesius|first=Robert|title=Dutch Ships in Tropical Waters: The Development of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) Shipping Network in Asia 1595-1660|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9053565179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''"vrijburgers"'' were to be of Dutch birth (although exceptions were made for some Germans), married, 'of good character', and had to undertake to spend at least twenty years in Southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; In March 1657, when the first ''"vrijburgers"'' started receiving their farms, the white population of the Cape was only about 134.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Although the soil and climate in [[Cape Town]] were suitable for farming, willing immigrants remained in short supply and included a number of orphans, refugees, and foreigners accordingly.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; From 1688 onward the Cape attracted some French [[Huguenot]]s, most of them refugees from the protracted conflict between Protestants and Catholics in France.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt;

===1754 estimates===
In 1754, Cape governor [[Ryk Tulbagh]] conducted a census of his non-indigenous subjects. White ''vrijburgers'', now outnumbered by slaves imported from [[West Africa]], [[Mozambique]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]], only totaled about 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhope.nl/slavery.html|title=Slavery|website=Goodhope.nl|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1806 estimates===
Following the defeat and collapse of the Dutch Republic during [[Joseph Souham]]'s [[Flanders Campaign]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]] escaped to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and appealed to the British to occupy his colonial possessions until he was restored. Holland's administration was never effectively reestablished; upon a new outbreak of hostilities with France expeditionary forces led by [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet]] finally imposed British rule for good when they defeated Cape governor [[Jan Willem Janssens]] in 1806.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt;

At the onset of [[Cape Town]]'s annexation to the [[British Empire]], the original Afrikaners numbered 26,720 - or 36% of the colony's population.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt;

===1960 Census===
The South African census of 1960 was the final census undertaken in the [[Union of South Africa]]. Ethno-linguistic status of some 15,994,181 South African citizens was projected by various sources through sampling language, religion and race. At least 1.6 million South Africans represented white Afrikaans speakers, or 10% of the total population. They also constituted 9.3% of the population in neighbouring [[South West Africa]].&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt;

===1985 Census===
According to the South African census of 1985, there were 2,581,080 white Afrikaans speakers then residing in the country, or about 9.4% of the total population.&lt;ref name=Afrikaans1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kriger|first1=Robert|last2=Kriger|first2=Ethel|title=Afrikaans Literature: Recollection, Redefinition, Restitution|date=1997|pages=75–78|publisher=Rodopi BV|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9042000513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001 Census===
The [[South African National Census of 2001]] was the first census conducted in post-[[apartheid]] South Africa. It was calculated on 9 October and reported a population of 2,576,184 white Afrikaans speakers. The census noted that Afrikaners represented the eighth largest ethnic group in the country, or 5.7% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census01/html/CInBrief/CIB2001.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505140723/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census01/HTML/CInBrief/CIB2001.pdf|archivedate=5 May 2005 |title=Statistics South Africa - CENSUS 2001 - Census in brief |publisher=StatsSA |year=2003 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early settlement and colonisation===

[[File:Charles Bell - Jan van Riebeeck se aankoms aan die Kaap.jpg|left|thumb|Painting of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]]]]

The earliest Afrikaner communities in South Africa were formed at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], mainly through the introduction of Dutch colonists, French [[Huguenot]] refugees and erstwhile servants of the [[Dutch East India Company]].&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; During the early colonial period, Afrikaners were generally known as "Christians", "colonists", "emigrants", or ''ingezeetenen'' ("inhabitants").&lt;ref name="Afstudy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Andre du Toit &amp; Hermann Giliomee| authorlink = | title = Afrikaner Political Thought: Analysis and Documents, Volume One (1780 - 1850). |edition= 1983 |pages= 1–305  | publisher = Claremont: David Philip (Pty) Ltd| isbn= 0908396716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their concept of being rooted in Africa&amp;mdash;as opposed to the Company's expatriate officialdom&amp;mdash;did not find widespread expression until the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Afstudy"/&gt;

It is to the ambitions of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry the Navigator]] that historians attribute the discovery of the Cape as a settling ground for Europeans.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; In 1424 Henry and [[Fernando de Castro]] besieged the [[Canary Islands]], under the impression that they might be of use to further Portuguese expeditions around Africa's coast.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt; Although this attempt was unsuccessful, Portugal's continued interest in the continent made possible the later voyages of [[Bartholomew Diaz]] in 1487 and [[Vasco de Gama]] ten years later. Diaz made known to the world a "Cape of Storms", rechristened "Good Hope" by [[John II of Portugal|John II]].&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; As it was desirable to take formal possession of this territory the Portuguese erected a stone cross in [[Algoa Bay]]. Da Gama and his successors, however, did not take kindly to the notion, especially following a skirmish with the [[Khoikhoi]] in 1497, when one of his admirals was wounded.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt;

After the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] was founded in 1599, London merchants began to take advantage of the route to India by the Cape. [[James Lancaster]], who had visited [[Robben Island]] some years earlier, anchored in [[Table Bay]] in 1601.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt; By 1614 the British had planted a penal colony on the site, and in 1621 two Englishmen claimed Table Bay on behalf of King [[James VI and I|James I]], but this action was not ratified.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt; They eventually settled on [[Saint Helena]] as an alternative port of refuge.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt;

Due to the value of the spice trade between Europe and their outposts in the [[Dutch East India Company in Indonesia|East Indies]], Dutch ships began to call sporadically at the Cape in search of provisions after 1598.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; In 1601 a Captain Paul van Corniden came ashore at [[St. Sebastion's Bay]] near [[Overberg]].&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt; He discovered a small inlet which he named ''Vleesch Bay'', after the cattle trade, and another ''Visch Bay'' after the abundance of fish.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt; Not long afterwards, Admiral [[Joris van Spilbergen]] reported catching penguins and sheep on Robben Island.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt;

In 1648, Dutch sailors Leendert Jansz and Nicholas Proot had been shipwrecked in Table Bay and marooned for five months until picked up by a returning ship.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; During this period they established friendly relations with the locals, who sold them sheep, cattle, and vegetables. Both men presented a report advocating the Table valley as a fort and garden for the East India fleets.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt;

{{cquote|''We say, therefore, that the Honourable Company, by the formation of a fort or redoubt, and also of a garden of such size as may be practicable or necessary at the above-mentioned Cabo de Boa Esperanza, upon a suitable spot in Table Valley, stationing there according to your pleasure sixty to seventy as well soldiers as sailors, and a few persons acquainted with gardening and horticulture, could raise, as well for the ships and people bound to India as for those returning thence, many kinds of fruit, as will hereafter be more particularly demonstrated.''}}

:Excerpt from Jansz and Proot's report.&lt;ref name="Kaap"/&gt;

Under recommendation from [[Jan van Riebeeck]], the [[Heeren XVII]] authorised the establishment of a fort at the Cape, and this the more hurriedly to preempt any further imperial maneuvers by Britain, France or Portugal.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Van Riebeeck, his family and seventy to eighty VOC personnel arrived there on 6 April 1652 after a journey of three and a half months.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Their immediate task was the establishment of some gardens, "taking for this purpose all the best and richest ground"; following this they were instructed to conduct a survey to determine the best pastureland for the grazing of cattle.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; By 15 May they had nearly completed construction on the [[Castle of Good Hope]], which was to be an easily defensible victualing station serving Dutch ships plying the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Dutch sailors appreciated the mild climate at the Cape, which allowed them to recuperate from their protracted periods of service in the tropical humidity of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Blok&gt;{{cite book|last=Blok|first=Petrus Johannes|title=History of the People of the Netherlands, Volume Four|date=1970|page=526|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-330-44171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; VOC fleets bearing cargo from the Orient anchored in the Cape for a month, usually from March or April, when they were resupplied with water and provisions prior to completing their return voyage to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Blok/&gt;

In extent the new refreshment post was to be kept as confined as possible to reduce administrative expense.&lt;ref name="Afstudy"/&gt; Residents would associate amiably with the natives for the sake of livestock trade, but otherwise keep to themselves and their task of becoming self-sufficient.&lt;ref name="Afstudy"/&gt; As the VOC's primary goal was merchant enterprise, particularly its shipping network traversing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans between the Netherlands and various ports in Asia, most of its territories consisted of coastal forts, factories, and isolated trading posts dependent entirely on indigenous host states.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Kerry|title=Networks of Empire: Forced Migration in the Dutch East India Company|date=2009|pages=322–342|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-88586-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise of Dutch sovereignty, as well the large scale settlement of Dutch colonists, was therefore extremely limited at these sites.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; During the VOC's history only two primary exceptions to the rule emerged: the [[Dutch East Indies]] and the Cape of Good Hope, through the formation of a large class of ''"vrijlieden"'', or ''"vrijburgers"'' (free citizens).&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;

The VOC operated under a strict corporate hierarchy which allowed it to formally assign classifications to those whom it determined fell within its legal purview.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; Most Europeans within the VOC's registration and identification system were denoted either as Company employees or vrijburgers.&lt;ref name=Parthesius/&gt; The legal classifications imposed upon every individual in the Company possessions determined their position in society and conferred restraints upon their actions.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; VOC ordinances made a clear distinction between the "bonded" period of service, and the period of "freedom" that began once an employment contract ended.&lt;ref name=Deserter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Rossum|first1=Matthias|last2=Kamp|first2=Jeannette|title=Desertion in the Early Modern World: A Comparative History|date=2016|pages=188–197|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|location=London|isbn=978-1474215992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure former employees could be distinguished from workers still in the service of the Company, it was decided to provide them a "letter of freedom", a licence known as a ''vrijbrief''.&lt;ref name=Deserter/&gt; European employees were repatriated to the Netherlands upon the termination of their contract, unless they successfully applied for a vrijbrief, in which they were charged a small fee and registered as vrijburgers in a Company record known collectively as the ''vrijboeken''.&lt;ref name=Deserter/&gt; Fairly strict conditions were levied on those who aspired to become vrijburgers at the Cape of Good Hope. They had to be married Dutch citizens who were regarded as being "of good character" by the VOC and committed to at least twenty years' residence in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Reflecting the multi-national nature of the workforce of the early modern trading companies, some foreigners, particularly Germans, were open to consideration as well.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; If their application for vrijburger status was successful, the Company granted them plots of farmland of thirteen and a half [[morgen]], which were tax exempt for twelve years.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; They were also loaned tools and seeds.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|title=An Archaeology of Colonial Identity: Power and Material Culture in the Dwars Valley, South Africa|date=2004|pages=29–33|publisher=Springer, Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0306485381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of their farming activities, however, remained heavily regulated: for example, the vrijburgers were ordered to focus on the cultivation of grain.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Each year their harvest was to be sold exclusively to the VOC at fixed prices.&lt;ref name=Lucas/&gt; They were forbidden from growing tobacco, producing vegetables for any purpose other than personal consumption, or purchasing cattle from the native [[Khoikhoi]] at rates which differed from those set by the VOC.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; With time, these restrictions and other attempts by the VOC to control the settlers resulted in successive generations of vrijburgers and their descendants becoming increasingly localised in their loyalties and national identity and hostile towards the colonial government.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;

Around March 1657, [[Rijcklof van Goens]], a senior VOC officer appointed as commissioner to the fledgling [[Dutch Cape Colony]], ordered Jan van Riebeeck to help more employees succeed as vriburgers so the Company could save on their wages.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; Although an overwhelming majority of the vrijburgers were farmers, some also stated their intention to seek employment as farm managers, fishermen, wagon-makers, tailors, or hunters.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; A ship's carpenter was granted a tract of forest, from which he was permitted to sell timber, and one miller from Holland opened his own water-operated corn mill, the first of its kind in Southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Hunt1/&gt; The colony initially did not do well, and many of the discouraged vrijburgers returned to VOC service or sought passage back to the Netherlands to pursue other opportunities.&lt;ref name=Geyl&gt;{{cite book|last=Geyl|first=Pieter|title=The Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century, Part Two|date=1964|pages=66–67, 356–364|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-0510269319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetable gardens were frequently destroyed by storms, and cattle lost in raids by the Khoikhoi, who were known to the Dutch as ''Hottentots''.&lt;ref name=Geyl/&gt; There was also an unskilled labour shortage, which the VOC later resolved by importing slaves from Angola, Madagascar, and the East Indies.&lt;ref name=Geyl/&gt;

In 1662 van Riebeeck was succeeded by [[Zacharias Wagenaer]] as governor of the Cape. Wagenaer was somewhat aloof towards the vrijburgers, whom he dismissed as "sodden, lazy, clumsy louts...since they do not pay proper attention to the [slaves] lent to them, or to their work in the fields, nor to their animals, for that reason seem wedded to the low level and cannot rid themselves of their debts".&lt;ref name=Geyl/&gt; When Wagenaer arrived, he observed that many of the unmarried vrijburgers were beginning to cohabit with their slaves, with the result that 75% of children born to Cape slaves at the time had a Dutch father.&lt;ref name="Linguistic"&gt;{{Citation | last =Thomason | first =Sarah Grey | author-link = | last2 =Kaufman | first2 =Terrence | author2-link = | publication-date =1991 | year =1988 | title =Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics | publisher =University of California Press | ISBN =0-520-07893-4 | pages =252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Michael and Linnegar, John with the South Africa Ministry of Education, Human Sciences Research Council, Social Cohesion &amp; Integration Research Programme. 2004.

=== The British occupation of the Cape ===
[[File:Daniell Trekboer.jpg|thumb|''Trekboers making camp'', an 1804 painting by [[Samuel Daniell]].]]
Long before the British annexed the Cape Colony, there were already large Dutch-speaking European settlements in the [[Cape Peninsula]] and beyond; by the time British rule became permanent in 1806 these had a population of over 26,000.&lt;ref name="Boeren"/&gt; There were, however, two distinct subgroups in the vrijburger population settled under the VOC.&lt;ref name=SSA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Robert|last2=Burns|first2=James|title=A History of Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2007|pages=288–293|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107628519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first were itinerant farmers who began to progressively settle further and further inland, seeking better pastures for their livestock and freedom from the VOC's petty regulations.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; This community of settlers collectively identified themselves as [[Boers]] to describe their agricultural way of life.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; Their farms were enormous by European standards, as the land was free and relatively underpopulated; they merely had to register them with the VOC, a process that was little more than a formality and became more irrelevant the further the Boers moved inland.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; A few Boers adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle permanently and became known as [[trekboers]].&lt;ref name=Kaap1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=John|last2=Bradley|first2=Liz|last3=Vidar|first3=Jon|last4=Fine|first4=Victoria|title=Cape Town: Winelands &amp; the Garden Route|date=2011|pages=13–19|publisher=Modern Overland, LLC|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1609871222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boers were deeply suspicious of the centralised government and increasing complexities of administration at the Cape; they constantly migrated further from the reaches of the colonial officialdom whenever it attempted to regulate their activities.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Shiela|title=The Last Trek: A Study of the Boer People and the Afrikaner Nation|date=2004|pages=6–16|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-0415329996}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid eighteenth century the Boers had penetrated almost a thousand kilometres into South Africa's interior beyond the Cape of Good Hope, at which point they encountered the [[Xhosa people]], who were migrating southwards from the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; Competition between the two communities over resources on the frontier sparked the [[Xhosa Wars]].&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; Harsh Boer attitudes towards black Africans were permanently shaped by their contact with the Xhosa, which bred insecurity and fear on the frontier.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

The second subgroup of the vrijburger population became known as the [[Cape Dutch]] and remained concentrated in the southwestern Cape and especially the areas closer to Cape Town.&lt;ref name=Tribalism&gt;{{cite book|last=Giliomee|first=Hermann|title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|date=1991|pages=21–28|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520074200}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were likelier to be urban dwellers, more educated, and typically maintained greater cultural ties to the Netherlands than the Boers.&lt;ref name=Manners&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Robert|title=Status and Respectability in the Cape Colony, 1750–1870: A Tragedy of Manners|date=1999|pages=47–58|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0521621229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape Dutch formed the backbone of the colony's market economy and included the small entrepreneurial class.&lt;ref name="Tamarkin"/&gt; These colonists had vested economic interests in the Cape peninsula and were not inclined to venture inland because of the great difficulties in maintaining contact with a viable market.&lt;ref name="Tamarkin"/&gt; This was in sharp contrast with the Boers on the frontier, who lived on the margins of the market economy.&lt;ref name="Tamarkin"/&gt; For this reason the Cape Dutch could not easily participate in migrations to escape the colonial system, and the Boer strategy of social and economic withdrawal was not viable for them.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Their response to grievances with the Cape government was to demand political reform and greater representation, a practice that became commonplace under Dutch and subsequently British rule.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; In 1779, for example, hundreds of Cape burghers smuggled a petition to Amsterdam demanding an end to VOC corruption and contradictory laws.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Unlike the Boers, the contact most Cape Dutch had with black Africans were predominantly peaceful, and their racial attitudes were more paternal than outright hostile.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

Relations between some of the colonists and the new British administration quickly soured.&lt;ref name=Arquilla&gt;{{cite book|last=Arquilla|first=John|title=Insurgents, Raiders, and Bandits: How Masters of Irregular Warfare Have Shaped Our World|date=2011|pages=130–142|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group|location=Lanham|isbn=978-1566638326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British brought liberal attitudes towards slavery and treatment of the indigenous peoples to the Cape, which were utterly alien to the colonists.&lt;ref name=Arquilla/&gt; Furthermore, they insisted that the Cape Colony finance its own affairs by taxes levied on the white population, an unpopular measure which bred resentment.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; By 1812 new attorneys-general and judges had been imported from England and many of the preexisting VOC era institutions abolished, namely the Dutch magistrate system and the only vestige of representative government at the Cape, the burgher senate.&lt;ref name="Tamarkin"/&gt; The new judiciary then established circuit courts, which brought colonial authority directly to the frontier.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; These circuit courts were permitted to try colonists for any alleged abuses of their slaves or indentured servants.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Most of those tried for these offences were frontier Boers; the charges were usually brought by British missionaries and the courts themselves staffed by unsympathetic and liberal Cape Dutch.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; The Boers, who  perceived most of the charges levelled against them to be flimsy or exaggerated, often refused to answer their court summons.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; 

In 1815, a Cape police unit was dispatched to arrest a Boer for failure to appear in court on charges of cruelty towards his Khoisan servants; the colonist fired on the troopers when they entered his property and was killed.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; The controversy which surrounded the incident led to the abortive [[Slachter's Nek Rebellion]], in which a number of Boers took up arms against the British.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; British officials retaliated by hanging five Boers for insurrection.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1/&gt; In 1828 the Cape governor declared that all native inhabitants but slaves were to have the rights of citizens, in respect of security and property ownership, on parity with whites.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1/&gt; This had the effect of further alienating the Boers.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1/&gt; Boer resentment of successive British administrators continued to grow throughout the late 1820s and early 1830s, especially with the official imposition of the English language.&lt;ref name=Kaap1/&gt; This replaced Dutch with English as the language used in the Cape's judicial system, putting the Boers at a disadvantage, as most spoke little or no English at all.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1/&gt; 

Bridling at what they considered an unwarranted intrusion into their way of life, some in the Boer community began to consider selling their farms and venturing deep into South Africa's unmapped interior to preempt further disputes and live completely independent from British rule.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; From their perspective, the Slachter's Nek Rebellion had demonstrated the futility of an armed uprising against the new order the British had entrenched at the Cape; one result was that the Boers who might have otherwise been inclined to take up arms began preparing for a mass emigration from the colony instead.&lt;ref name="Tamarkin"/&gt;

=== The Great Trek ===
{{main article|Great Trek}}

In the 1830s and 1840s, an organised migration of an estimated 14,000 Boers, known as ''[[voortrekkers]]'', across the Cape Colony's frontier began.&lt;ref name=Laband&gt;{{cite book|last=Laband|first=John|title=The Transvaal Rebellion: The First Boer War, 1880-1881|date=2005|pages=10–13|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-0582772618}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voortrekkers departed the colony in a series of parties, taking with them all their livestock and potable property, as well as their dependents and slaves.&lt;ref name=Laband/&gt; They had the skills to maintain their own wagons and firearms, but remained dependent on equally mobile traders for vital commodities such as gunpowder and sugar.&lt;ref name=Laband/&gt; Nevertheless, one of their goals was to sever their ties with the Cape's commercial network by gaining access to foreign traders and ports in east Africa, well beyond the British sphere of influence.&lt;ref name=Laband/&gt;

Many of the Boers who participated in the Great Trek had varying motives. While most were driven by some form of disenchantment with British policies, their secondary objectives ranged from seeking more desirable grazing land for their cattle to a desire to retain their slaves after the abolition of slavery at the Cape.&lt;ref name=Laband/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stapleton1"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Military History of Africa|last=Stapleton|first=Timothy|year=2013|location=Santa Barbara|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]
|isbn=978-0313395703|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Trek also split the Afrikaner community along social and geographical lines, driving a wedge between the voortrekkers and those who remained in the Cape Colony.&lt;ref name="Mortality"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abulof|first=Uriel|title=The Mortality and Morality of Nations: Jews, Afrikaners, and French-Canadians|year=2015|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=234-235|isbn=978-1107097070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about a fifth of the colony's Dutch-speaking white population at the time participated in the Great Trek.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; The [[Dutch Reformed Church]], to which most of the Boers belonged, condemned the migration.&lt;ref name="Greaves"/&gt; Despite their hostility towards the British, there were also Boers who chose to remain in the Cape of their own accord.&lt;ref name=Arquilla/&gt; For its part, the distinct Cape Dutch community remained loyal to the British Crown and focused its efforts on building political organisations seeking representative government; its lobbying efforts were partly responsible for the establishment of the [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] in 1853.&lt;ref name="Mortality"/&gt;

As important as the Trek was to the formation of Boer ethnic identity, so were the running conflicts with various indigenous groups along the way. One conflict central to the construction of Boer identity occurred with the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] in the area of present-day [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

The Boers who entered Natal discovered that the land they wanted came under the authority of the Zulu King ''[[Dingane]] ka Senzangakhona'', who ruled that part of what subsequently became KwaZulu-Natal. The British had a small port colony (the future Durban) there but were unable to seize the whole of area from the war-ready Zulus, and only kept to the Port of Natal. The Boers found the land safe from the British and sent an un-armed Boer land treaty delegation under [[Piet Retief]] on 6 February 1838, to negotiate with the Zulu King. The negotiations went well and a contract between Retief and Dingane was signed.

After the signing, however, Dingane's forces surprised and killed the members of the delegation; a large-scale massacre of the Boers followed. Zulu ''[[impi]]s'' (regiments) attacked Boer encampments in the [[Drakensberg]] foothills at what was later called [[Blaauwkrans]] and [[Weenen]], killing women and children along with men. (By contrast, in earlier conflicts the trekkers had experienced along the eastern Cape frontier, the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] had refrained from harming women and children.)

A commando of 470 men arrived to help the settlers. On 16 December 1838, the Voortrekkers under the command of [[Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius|Andries Pretorius]] confronted about 10,000 Zulus at the prepared positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Blood-River|title=Battle of Blood River|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boers suffered three injuries without any fatalities. Due to the blood of 3,000 slain Zulus that stained the [[Ncome River]], the conflict afterwards became known as the [[Battle of Blood River]].

In present-day South Africa, 16 December remains a celebrated public holiday, initially called "Dingane's Day". After 1952, the holiday was officially named Day of the Covenant, changed to [[Day of the Vow]] in 1980 (Mackenzie 1999:69){{clarify|date=February 2014}} &lt;!-- Please insert a com[lete reference here, there is no "MacKenzie 1999" source listed in the footnotes --&gt; and to [[Day of Reconciliation]] in 1994. The Boers saw their victory at the Battle of Blood River as evidence that they had found divine favour for their [[Emigration|exodus]] from British rule.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==== Boer republics ====
{{Main article|Boer Republics}}
[[File:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|[[Boer]] guerrillas during the Second Boer War]]
After defeating the Zulu and the recovery of the treaty between Dingane and Retief, the Voortrekkers proclaimed the [[Natalia Republic]]. In 1843, Britain annexed Natal and many Boers trekked inwards again.

Due to the return of British rule, Boers fled to the frontiers to the north-west of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains, and onto the [[highveld]] of the ''[[South African Republic|Transvaal]]'' and ''Transoranje''. These areas were mostly unoccupied due to conflicts in the course of the genocide [[Mfecane]] wars of the Zulus on the local Basuthu population who used it as summer grazing for their cattle. Some Boers ventured far beyond the present-day borders of South Africa, north as far as present-day Zambia and Angola. Others reached the Portuguese colony of [[Delagoa Bay]], later called ''Lourenço Marques'' and subsequently ''[[Maputo]]'' – the capital of Mozambique.

[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lizzie van Zyl]], visited by [[Emily Hobhouse]] in a British [[concentration camp]]]]

The Boers created sovereign states in what is now South Africa: ''de Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek'' (the [[South African Republic]]) and the Orange Free State were the most prominent and lasted the longest.

The discovery of goldfields awakened British interest in the Boer republics, and the two Boer Wars resulted: The [[First Boer War]] (1880–1881) and the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902). The Boers won the first war and retained their independence. The second ended with British victory and annexation of the Boer areas into the British colonies. The British employed [[scorched earth|scorched-earth]] tactics and held many Boers in [[concentration camps]] as a means to separate commandos from their source of shelter, food and supply. The strategy was employed effectively but an estimated 27,000 Boers (mainly women and children under sixteen) died in these camps from [[starvation|hunger]] and [[infectious diseases|disease]].

Another group emigrated to British-ruled Kenya, from where most returned to South Africa during the 1930s as a result of warfare there amongst indigenous people. A third group, under the leadership of General [[Ben Viljoen]], emigrated to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in northern Mexico and to states of [[Arizona]], California, [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]] in the south-western USA. Others migrated to other parts of Africa, including German East Africa (present day Tanzania, mostly near Arusha).&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt;

A significant number of Afrikaners also went as "[[Dorsland Trek]]kers" to [[Angola]], where a large group settled on the [[Huíla Province|Huíla Plateau]], in [[Humpata]], and smaller communities on the [[Bihe Plateau|Central Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/4032/1/W_G_Clarence-Smith_-_The_thirstland_trekkers_in_Angola_-_Some_reflections_on_a_frontier_society.pdf |title=The thirstland trekkers in Angola – Some reflections on a frontier society |publisher=University of London |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They constituted a closed community which rejected integration as well as innovation, became impoverished in the course of several decades, and returned to [[South West Africa]] and South Africa in waves.&lt;ref&gt;

A relatively large group of Boers settled in Kenya. The first wave of migrants consisted of individual families, followed by larger multiple-family treks.&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt;  Some had arrived by 1904, as documented by the caption of a newspaper photograph noting a tent town for "some of the early settlers from South Africa" on what became the campus of the [[University of Nairobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title Unknown &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1266/historical-kenya-photocamp.jpg |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmCzJrjV?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1266/historical-kenya-photocamp.jpg |archivedate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the first to arrive was W.J. Van Breda (1903), followed by John de Waal and Frans Arnoldi at Nakuru (1906).  Jannie De Beer's family resided at [[Athi River]], while Ignatius Gouws resided at Solai.&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt;

The second wave of migrants is exemplified by [[Jan Janse van Rensburg]]'s trek. Janse van Rensburg left the Transvaal on an exploratory trip to [[British East Africa]] in 1906 from Lourenço Marques (then [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]]), Mozambique. Janse van Rensburg was inspired by an earlier Boer migrant, Abraham Joubert, who had moved to Nairobi from Arusha in 1906, along with others. When Joubert visited the Transvaal that year, Janse van Rensburg met with him.&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt; Sources disagree about whether Janse van Rensburg received guarantees for land from the Governor of the [[East Africa Protectorate]], Sir [[James Hayes Sadler]].&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt;

On his return to the Transvaal, van Rensburg recruited about 280 Afrikaners (comprising either 47 or 60 families) to accompany him to British East Africa. On 9 July 1908 his party sailed in the chartered ship ''SS Windhuk'' from Lourenço Marques to Mombasa, from where they boarded a train for Nairobi. The party travelled by five trains to Nakuru.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In 1911 the last of the large trek groups departed for Kenya, when some 60 families from the Orange Free State boarded the ''SS Skramstad'' in Durban under leadership of C.J. Cloete.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; But migration dwindled, partly due to the British secretary of state's (then Lord Crewe) cash requirements for immigrants. When the British granted self-government to the former Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in 1906 and 1907, respectively, the pressure for emigration decreased. A trickle of individual trekker families continued to migrate into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt;

A combination of factors spurred on Boer migration. Some, like Janse van Rensburg and Cloete, had collaborated with the British, or had surrendered during the Boer War.&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt; These ''joiners'' and ''hensoppers'' ("hands-uppers") subsequently experienced hostility from other Afrikaners. Many migrants were extremely poor and had subsisted on others' property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Collaborators tended to move to British East Africa, while those who had fought to the end (called ''[[bittereinder]]s'') initially preferred [[German South West Africa]].&lt;ref name="DuToit1998" /&gt;

One of the best known Boer settlements in the British East Africa Protectorate became established at [[Eldoret]], in the south west of what became known as Kenya in 1920. By 1934 some 700 Boers lived here, near the Uganda border.&lt;ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[First World War]] in 1914, the Allies asked the Union of South Africa to attack the German territory of South West Africa, resulting in the [[South West Africa Campaign]] (1914–1915). Armed forces under the leadership of General Louis Botha defeated the German forces, who were unable to put up much resistance to the overwhelming South African forces.

Many Boers, who had little love or respect for Britain, objected to the use of the "[[List of concentration and internment camps#South Africa|children from the concentration camps]]" to attack the anti-British Germans, resulting in the [[Maritz Rebellion]] of 1914, which was quickly quelled by the government forces.

Some Boers subsequently moved to South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa until its independence in 1990, after which the country adopted the name Namibia.

== Genealogy ==
Scholars have traditionally considered Afrikaners to be a homogeneous population of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry, subject to a significant [[founder effect]].&lt;ref name="Jaco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greeff|first=Jaco Maree|title=Deconstructing Jaco: Genetic Heritage of an Afrikaner|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|year=2007|volume=71|issue=5|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2007.00363.x|url=http://www.africandna.com/ScienPapers/Deconstructing_Jaco_Genetic_Heritage_of_an_Afrikaner.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305051928/http://www.africandna.com/ScienPapers/Deconstructing_Jaco_Genetic_Heritage_of_an_Afrikaner.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2012|pages=674–688|pmid=17521310}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simplistic viewpoint has been challenged by recent studies suggesting multiple uncertainties regarding the genetic composition of white South Africans at large and Afrikaners in particular.&lt;ref name="Jaco"/&gt;

Krotoa and Peder's descendants are the Pelzer, Kruger, Steenkamp and other Afrikaner families.&lt;ref&gt;Geslagsregister van die familie PELSER, PELSTER, PELSZER, PELTSER, PELTZER en PELZER in Suid-Afrika sedert 1708 deur R. DE V. PIENAAR, Stellenbosch, 2004.

Their numbers can be easily reconstructed from censuses of the Cape rather than passenger lists, taking into account VOC employees who later returned to Europe.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; Some Europeans also arrived from elsewhere in Holland's sphere, especially German soldiers being discharged from colonial service.&lt;ref name="Indisch"/&gt; As a result, by 1691 over a quarter of the white population of South Africa was not ethnically Dutch.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; The number of permanent settlers of both sexes and all ages, according to figures available at the onset of British rule, numbered 26,720,&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"/&gt; of whom 50% were Dutch, 27% German, 17% French and 5.5% other blood.&lt;ref name="Boeren"/&gt; This demographic breakdown of the community just prior to the end of the Dutch administration has been used in many subsequent studies to represent the ethnic makeup of modern Afrikaners, a practise criticised by some academics such as Dr. Johannes Heese.&lt;ref name=Heese1971/&gt;

Based on his genealogical research of the period from 1657 to 1867, Dr. Johannes Heese in his study ''Die Herkoms van die Afrikaners'' estimated an average ethnic admixture for Afrikaners of 35.5% Dutch, 34.4% German, 13.9% French, 7.2% non-European, 2.6% English, 2.8% other European and 3.6% unknown.&lt;ref name=Heese1971/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilomafrikaners/&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannes August Heese (1907–1990)|url=http://www.stellenboschwriters.com/heeseja.html|publisher=Stellenbosch Writers.com|accessdate=12 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020235245/http://www.stellenboschwriters.com/heeseja.html|archivedate=2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heese achieved this conclusion by recording all the wedding dates and number of children of each immigrant. He then divided the period between 1657 and 1867 into six thirty-year blocs, and working under the assumption that earlier colonists contributed more to the gene pool, multiplied each child's bloodline by 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1 according to respective period.&lt;ref name="Jaco"/&gt; Heese argued that previous studies wrongly classified some German progenitors as Dutch, although for the purposes of his own study he also reclassified a number of Scandinavian (especially Danish) progenitors as "German".&lt;ref name="February"/&gt; Drawing heavily on Christoffel Coetzee de Villiers's ''Geslacht Register der Oude Kaapsche Familien'', British historian [[George McCall Theal]] estimated an admixture of 67% Dutch, with a nearly equal contribution of roughly 17% from the Huguenots and Germans.&lt;ref name="February"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aswegen"&gt;{{cite book | first = HJ | last = van Aswegen| authorlink = | title = History of South Africa to 1854|edition= 1993|page= 79 | publisher = Van Schaik Publishers| isbn=  978-0627019524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theal argued that most studies suggesting a higher percentage of German ancestry among Afrikaners wrongly counted as "German" all those who came from German-speaking Swiss cantons and ignored the VOC's policy of recruiting settlers among the Dutch diaspora living in the border regions of several German states.&lt;ref name=Walker1/&gt; He also pointed out the longstanding preponderance of Dutch women in the colony, and the fact that most of the German vrijburgers took Dutch wives.&lt;ref name=Walker1/&gt;

The degree of intermixing among Afrikaners may be attributed to the unbalanced sex ratio which existed under Dutch governance.&lt;ref name="Shell"&gt;Shell, Robert (1992) Tender Ties: Women and the slave household, 1652-1834. Collected Seminar Papers. Institute of Commonwealth Studies, 42. pp. 1-33. ISSN 0076-0773.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of VOC employees who sailed from the Netherlands were allowed to bring their families with them, and the Dutch never employed European women in a full-time capacity. Between 1657 and 1806 no more than 454 women arrived at the Cape, as compared to the 1,590 male colonists.&lt;ref name="Indisch"/&gt; One of the most fundamental demographic consequences was that white South African women, much like their counterparts in colonial [[North America]], began to marry much younger and consequently bear more children than Western Europeans.&lt;ref name="Shell"/&gt; Another was the astonishingly high occurrence of inter-family marriages from the matrilineal aspect. These were reinforced by the familial interdependence of the Cape's credit and mortgage obligations.&lt;ref name="Shell"/&gt; Afrikaner families thus became larger in size, more interconnected, and clannish than those of any other colonial establishment in the world.&lt;ref name="Shell"/&gt; Some of the more common Afrikaner surnames include [[Botha]], [[Pretorius (disambiguation)|Pretorius]] and [[van der Merwe]].&lt;ref name="Voters' Roll 1988"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTH-AFRICA/2000-02/0950470830 |title=RootsWeb: SOUTH-AFRICA-L RE: SA's most popular surnames |publisher=Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other cases where large population groups have been propagated by a relatively small pool of progenitors, Afrikaners have also experienced a dramatic increase in the frequency of some otherwise rare deleterious ailments, including ''[[Variegate porphyria]]''.&lt;ref name="Jaco"/&gt;

== Modern history ==
=== Apartheid era ===
{{Apartheid}}
{{Main article|South Africa under apartheid}}

In South Africa, an Afrikaner minority party, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], came to power in 1948 and enacted a series of segregationist laws favouring whites known as ''apartheid''. These laws allowed for the systematic persecution of opposition leaders and attempted to enforce general [[white supremacy]] by classifying all South African inhabitants into racial groups. Non-white political participation was outlawed, black citizenship revoked, and the entire public sphere, including education, residential areas, medical care and common areas such as public transportation, beaches and amenities, was segregated.

Apartheid was officially ended in 1990 after widespread unrest, led by supporters of the United Democratic Front, Pan-African Congress, South African Communist Party and African National Congress and a long embargo against South Africa.&lt;ref name="Lodge 1983" /&gt; The factual end to apartheid, however, is widely regarded as the election of 1994. After a long [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|series of negotiations]] involving the apartheid government under President [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] the ANC under [[Nelson Mandela]], and other parties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Post-apartheid era ===
[[File:Frederik de Klerk with Nelson Mandela - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 1992.jpg|thumb|200px|[[F. W. de Klerk]] and Nelson Mandela shake hands in January 1992]]
Efforts are being made by some Afrikaners to secure [[minority rights]] even though protection of minority rights is fundamental to the new 1996 post-apartheid [[Constitution of South Africa]]. These efforts include the [[Volkstaat]] movement. In contrast, a handful of Afrikaners have joined the ruling African National Congress party, which is overwhelmingly supported by South Africa's black majority.

[[Employment Equity]] legislation favours employment of black (African, Indian, Chinese and Coloured population groups, white women, disabled people) South Africans over white men. Black Economic Empowerment legislation further favours blacks as the government considers ownership, employment, training and social responsibility initiatives which empower black South Africans as important criteria when awarding tenders. However, private enterprise adheres to this legislation voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70714|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810232559/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70714|archivedate=10 August 2010|title=Redirecting old link|website=Info.gov.za|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports indicate a growing number of whites suffering poverty compared to the pre-apartheid years and attribute this to such laws&amp;nbsp;— over 350,000 Afrikaners may be classified as poor, with some research claiming that up to 150,000 are struggling for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/22/southafrica.features|title=Simon Wood meets the people who lost most when Mandela won in South Africa|work=the Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2006/s1655159.htm|title=Foreign Correspondent - 30/05/2006: South Africa - Poor Whites|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205033500/http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2006/s1655159.htm|archive-date=5 December 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combined with a wave of violent crime has led to vast numbers of Afrikaners and English-speaking South Africans leaving the country.

[[Genocide Watch]] has theorised that farm attacks constitute early warning signs of genocide against Afrikaners and has criticised the South African government for its inaction on the issue, pointing out that the murder rate for them ("ethno-European farmers" in their report, which also included non-Afrikaner farmers of European race) is four times that of the general South African population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/BoersSlain01.htm |title=Over 1000 Boer Farmers in South Africa Have Been Murdered Since 1991 |publisher=Genocide Watch |accessdate=31 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230121634/http://www.genocidewatch.org/BoersSlain01.htm |archivedate=30 December 2005 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 40,000 white farmers in South Africa{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}.

[[File:South African farmer in Georgia.jpg|thumb|Afrikaner farmer in [[Agriculture in Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Caucasus]] region, 2011]]
Since 1994, there has been significant emigration of white people from South Africa. There are thus currently large Afrikaner and English-speaking South African communities in the UK and other developed countries. Between 1995-2005, more than one million South Africans have emigrated overseas, citing violent and racially motivated black on white crime as the main reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Million whites leave SA - study|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-25_2003186|publisher=24.com|accessdate=5 June 2013|author=Peet van Aardt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416135445/http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-25_2003186|archivedate=16 April 2008|date=24 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers have emigrated to other parts of Africa (e.g. North Eastern Congo) to develop efficient commercial farming there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-03-boers-are-moving-north |title=Boers are moving north&amp;nbsp;— News&amp;nbsp;— Mail &amp; Guardian Online |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
=== Namibia ===

There were 133,324 speakers of Afrikaans in Namibia, forming 9.5% of the total national population, according to the 1991 census. However the majority of these speakers come from the Coloured and Baster communities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Afrikaners are mostly found in [[Windhoek]] and in the Southern provinces and have a population of around 100,000 in Namibia.&lt;ref name="NAcensus" /&gt;

=== Global presence ===
A significant number of Afrikaners have migrated to [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations such as [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Other popular destinations include the [[Netherlands]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Hong Kong]], as well as [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]] and [[Qatar]].

A large number of young Afrikaners are taking advantage of [[working holiday visa]]s made available by the United Kingdom, as well as the Netherlands and [[Belgium]], to gain work experience. The scheme under which UK working holiday visas were issued ended on 27 November 2008 and has been replaced by the Tier 5 (Youth Mobility) visa. South Africa has been excluded from the working holiday visa programme in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands and the rest of the EU.

As of 2011, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] is encouraging Afrikaner immigration to assist in reviving the country's agriculture industry, which has fallen on hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Brooke | url=http://www.voanews.com/content/afrikaner-farmers-migrating-to-georgia-129900258/145298.html |title=Afrikaner Farmers Migrating to Georgia &amp;#124; Africa &amp;#124; English |publisher=Voanews.com |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Afrikaner Calvinism}}
Traditionally Christian, [[Calvinism]] of Boers in South Africa developed in much the same way as the New England colonies in North America.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The original South African Boer republics were founded on the principles of the Dutch Reformed Church.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
In 1985, 92% of Afrikaners were members of [[Reformed churches]]. Various national Christian events are widely attended, the most recent was held by Angus Buchan in Bloemfontein with over a million people, mostly Afrikaners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/business/bloemfontein-prayer-gathering/|title=South Africa on its knees: over a million people are descending on Bloemfontein for massive prayer gathering|date=21 April 2017|website=Goodthingsguy.com|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{Main article|Afrikaans}}
The Afrikaans language changed over time from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spoken by the first white settlers at [[Cape of Good Hope|the Cape]]. From the late 17th century, the form of Dutch spoken at the Cape developed differences, mostly in morphology but also in pronunciation and accent and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from that of the Netherlands, although the languages are still similar enough to be mutually intelligible. Settlers who arrived speaking German and French soon shifted to using Dutch and later Afrikaans. The process of [[language change]] was influenced by the languages spoken by slaves, [[Khoikhoi]] and people of mixed descent, as well as by [[Cape Malay]], [[Zulu people|Zulu]], British and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. While the Dutch of the Netherlands remained the official language, the new dialect, often known as Cape Dutch, African Dutch, "kitchen Dutch", or ''taal'' (meaning "language" in Afrikaans) developed into a separate language by the 19th century, with much work done by the [[Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners]] and other writers such as [[Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven]]. In a 1925 act of Parliament, Afrikaans was given equal status with Dutch as one of the two official languages (English being the second) of the [[Union of South Africa]]. There was much objection to the attempt to legislate the creation of Afrikaans as a new language.  [[Marthinus Steyn]], a prominent jurist and politician, and others were vocal in their opposition.  Today, Afrikaans is recognised as one of the eleven official [[languages of South Africa|languages of the new South Africa]], and is the third largest mother tongue spoken in South Africa. In June 2013, the Department of Basic Education included Afrikaans as an African language to be compulsory for all pupils, according to a new policy.

Afrikaans is offered at many universities outside of South Africa including in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Russia and America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrikaans.com/news-headlines/het-jy.../afrikaans-floreer-in-die-buiteland ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{see also|South African literature}}
Afrikaners have a long literary tradition, and have produced a number of notable novelists and poets, including Nobel Prize winner [[J.M. Coetzee]], [[Eugene Marais]], [[Uys Krige]], [[Elisabeth Eybers]], [[Breyten Breytenbach]], [[André Brink]], [[C. J. Langenhoven]] and [[Etienne Leroux]].

=== Arts ===
{{See also|Protest_music#South_Africa|l1=South African protest music}}
Music is probably the most popular art form among Afrikaners. While the traditional ''[[Boeremusiek]]'' ("Boer music") and ''[[Volkspele]]'' ("people games") folk dancing enjoyed popularity in the past, most Afrikaners today favour a variety of international genres and light popular Afrikaans music. American country and western music has enjoyed great popularity and has a strong following among many South Africans. Some also enjoy a social dance event called a ''[[sokkie]]''. The South African rock band [[Seether]] has a hidden track on their album ''[[Karma and Effect]]'' titled ''Kom Saam Met My'' ("Come With Me"), sung in Afrikaans. There is also an underground rock music movement and bands like the controversial [[Fokofpolisiekar]] have a large following. The television Channel [[MK (channel)]] also supports local Afrikaans music and mainly screens videos from the Afrikaans Rock genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.mnet.co.za/MK/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327165316/http://beta.mnet.co.za/mk/|archivedate=27 March 2011 |title=M-Net&amp;nbsp;— Mk |publisher=Beta.mnet.co.za |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport ===
[[Rugby union in South Africa|Rugby]], [[cricket in South Africa|cricket]] and [[golf in South Africa|golf]] are generally considered to be the most popular sports among Afrikaners. Rugby in particular is considered one of the central pillars of the Afrikaner community. The national rugby team, the [[Springboks]], did not compete in the first two rugby world cups in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] because of [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid]] [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|sporting boycotts]] of South Africa but later on the Springboks won the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]] and [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] Rugby World Cups.

''Boere-sport'' also played a big role in the Afrikaner history. It consisted of a variety of sports like [[tug of war]], three-legged races, [[jukskei]], skilpadloop (tortoise walk) and other games.

=== Numismatics ===
The world's first ounce-denominated gold coin, the [[Krugerrand]], was struck at the [[South African Mint]] on 3 July 1967. The name Krugerrand was derived from ''Kruger'' (after President [[Paul Kruger]]) and the ''[[South African rand|rand]]'' monetary unit of South Africa.

In April 2007, the [[South African Mint]] coined a collectors R1 gold coin commemorating the Afrikaner people as part of its cultural series, depicting the [[Great Trek]] across the [[Drakensberg]] mountains.

== Institutions ==
=== Cultural ===
The ''[[Afrikaanse Taal en Kultuurvereniging]]'' (ATKV) ("Afrikaans Language and Culture Association") is responsible for promoting the Afrikaans language and culture.

''[[Voortrekkers (youth organisation)|Die Voortrekkers]]'' is a youth movement for Afrikaners in South Africa and Namibia with a membership of over 10 000 active members to promote cultural values, maintaining norms and standards as Christians, and being accountable members of public society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voortrekkers.org.za/|title=Die Voortrekkers se Amptelike Afrikaanse|website=Voortrekkers.org.za|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
{{outdated section|date=June 2014}}
An estimated 88% of Afrikaners supported the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the official opposition party, in the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Elections/News/X-still-drawn-along-racial-lines-20140511|title=X still drawn along racial lines|website=News24.com|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Alliance is a Liberal Party and a [[Liberal International#Full member|full member of Liberal International]].

Smaller numbers are involved in nationalist or separatist political organisations.

'''Amaryllis Collymore''' (1745–1828) was an [[Afro-Barbadian]] slave who gained her freedom from her relationship with a white man. The couple had eleven children and she successfully ran a plantation allowing her to acquire numerous other properties, to become the wealthiest free black woman in the colony at the time of her death.

==Early life==
Amaryllis Renn Phillips was born into slavery in 1745{{#tag:ref|If her tombstone is correct that she was 78 years old at her death, she may have been born in 1750; however, as the date of 1745 is given by Dr. Karl Watson, the president of the Barbados National Trust, that date was used.{{sfn|Watson|2014|pp=244, 249}}|group="Notes"}} on [[Barbados]], during British colonial rule{{sfn|Gafoor|2010}} where records indicate she was a mulatto.{{sfn|Sanders|1984|p=240}}{{sfn|Watson|2014|p=249}} She was purchased by Robert Collmore in 1780, from Rebecca Phillips, a free coloured hotelier,{{sfn|Watson|2014|p=249}}{{sfn|Paugh|2017|p=271}} along with her five mulatto children,{{sfn|Paugh|2017|p=271}} four of whom were Robert's children.{{sfn|Welch|1999}} In 1784, Robert arranged their manumission by selling her and the children to a friend, James Scuffield.{{sfn|Watson|2014|p=249}}{{sfn|Welch|1999}} Selling a slave to a trusted third-party to avoid high manumission fees was a common practice during the period in Barbados.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=43}}

Robert acquired ''Lightfoots'', a 42-acre sugar plantation with its 44 slaves, to provide for her and the children.{{sfn|Watson|2014|p=249}} Collymore expanded the estate to over a hundred acres{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=39}} and was able to buy seven properties throughout [[Bridgetown]], on Canary Street, High Street and James Street, which she rented out.{{sfn|Watson|2014|p=249}}{{sfn|''Nation News''|2015}} She also ran a successful shop.{{sfn|Watson|2014|p=249}} By 1805, Collymore owned another property, on Roebuck Street, which she sold for £800.{{sfn|Welch|1999}} She and her daughter, Katherine Anne Collymore, were the recipients of a bequest from Renn Phillips in his 1809 will.{{sfn|''The Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society''|2000|p=54-55}} 

In 1824, when Robert died, he bequeathed she and her eleven children, full title to ''Lightfoots'' and the slaves working on the plantation.{{sfn|Welch|1999}} Among her children, besides Katherine were Frances Lasley, Margaret Jane, and Robert (baptized 18 February 1792),{{sfn|Sanders|1984|p=217}} Thomazin Ashby (baptized 6 June 1795),{{sfn|Sanders|1984|p=228}}, Elizabeth Clarke (baptized 13 June  1798),{{sfn|Sanders|1984|p=240}}, Samuel Francis Collymore, Jackson Brown Collymore{{sfn|Handler|2009|p=121}} and Renn Phillips Collymore, who would become the great-great grandfather of [[Frank Collymore]].{{sfn|Gafoor|2010}} Collymore's will, dated 1826{{sfn|Welch|1999}} (or 1829 but which was probably the date the estate was probated),{{sfn|Handler|2009|p=121}} left her estate, worth over £10,000 to relatives. She devised a home in Bridgetown and a plantation known as Haggat Hall, and 67 slaves, as well as silver and personal property.{{sfn|Welch|1999}} At the time of her death she was "the richest free woman of color in pre-emancipation Barbados".{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=39}}

'''Amenhotep, son of Hapu''' (transcribed ''jmn-ḥtp zꜣ ḥꜣp.w'';{{dubious|date=June 2018}} {{fl.}} early-mid 14th century BC) was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[architect]], a [[priest]], a [[scribe]], and a [[public official]], who held a number of offices under [[Amenhotep III]] of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]].

== Life ==
He is said to have been born at the end of [[Thutmose III]]'s reign, in the town of [[Athribis]] (modern [[Banha]] in the north of [[Cairo]]). His father was Hapu, and his mother Itu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wildung|first1=Dietrich|title=Egyptian Saints: Deification in Pharaonic Egypt|date=1977|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0814791697|page=76|url=https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Egyptian_Saints.html?id=nvhfQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though little about Amenhotep's early life is known prior to his entering civil service, it is believed that he learnt to read and write at the local library and scriptorium. He was a priest and a Scribe of Recruits (organizing the labour and supplying the manpower for the Pharaoh's projects, both civilian and military). He was also an architect and supervised several building projects, among them [[Amenhotep III]]'s mortuary temple at western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], of which only two statues remain nowadays, known as the [[Colossi of Memnon]], and the creation of the quarry of [[El-Gabal el-Ahmar]], nearby [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], from which the blocks used to create the Colossi were probably taken. Other plans, such as the portico of the [[Temple of Karnak]], completed under [[Ramesses II]], and those for the [[Luxor Temple]] are also attributed to Amenhotep. He may also have been the architect of the Temple of [[Soleb]] in [[Nubia]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard H.|title=The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eWNQgAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-05120-7|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amenhotep is noted to have participated in Amenhotep III's first [[Sed festival]], in the 30th year of the king's rule. After this, he is believed to have retired from civil service and become the steward of Princess [[Sitamun]]'s properties (similar to an asset manager today), and received honours such as the designation of [[Fan-bearer on the Right Side of the King]], among other things. According to some reliefs in the tomb of [[Ramose]], he may have died in the 31st year of Amenhotep III, which would correspond to either 1360 BC or 1357 BC, depending on the [[Egyptian chronology|chronology]] used. His death has also been dated to the 35th year of the king.

== Legacy ==
After his death, his reputation grew and he was revered for his teachings and as a philosopher. He was also revered as a healer and eventually worshipped as a god of healing, like his predecessor [[Imhotep]] (the latter and Amenhotep being the only two commoners ever deified in the history of ancient Egypt). There are several surviving statues of him as a scribe, portraying him as a young man and as an older man. He was a deified human and thus was depicted only in human form. His cult was initially limited to the Thebes area, with a funerary temple constructed to him during his lifetime next to that of Amenhotep III. This was clearly an exceptional privilege, as it was the only private cult temple to be built among the royal monuments in the area. He continued to be worshipped for at least three centuries after his death, and evidence of this worship persists in a [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]] votary inscription on a statue dedicated to Amenhotep by a daughter of the pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathstat.slu.edu/~bart/egyptianhtml/kings%20and%20Queens/Amenhotep-Hapu.html|title=Amenhotep son of Hapu |last=Bart |first=Anneke |date=September 2008 |website=slu.edu|publisher=Saint Louis University |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], his worship saw a resurgence which led to chapels being dedicated to him in the Temple of [[Hathor]] at [[Deir el-Medina]] and the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]]. Statues were erected to him in the [[Temple of Amun]] at [[Karnak]] and he was treated as an intermediary with the god [[Amun]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2003" /&gt; Amenhotep also utilised his influence with the king to secure royal patronage for the town of Athribis, for the local god, and the temple dedicated to that god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/amenhotep.htm |title=Inscriptions of Amenhotep, son of Hapu |last=Doffinger |first=André |date= |website=reshafim.org.il |publisher= |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manetho]] gives a legendary account of how Amenhotep advised a king named Amenophis, who was "desirous to become a spectator of the gods, as had Orus, one of his predecessors in that kingdom, desired the same before him". This Amenophis is commonly identified with [[Akhenaton]] also known as Amenhotep IV, while Orus fits with the latter's father, Amenhotep III. Manetho relates that the wise man counseled that the king should "clear the whole country of the lepers and of the other impure people" and that the King then sent 80,000 lepers to the quarries. After this the wise man foresaw that the lepers would ally themselves with people coming to their help and subdue Egypt. He put the prophecy into letter to the King and then killed himself. Manetho associates this event with the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, but Josephus strongly rejects this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann J. (1997). ''Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism''. Harvard University Press. Cambridge. p. 30ff. {{ISBN|978-0674587397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortuary temple===
Amenhotep was allowed to build his mortuary temple adjacent to that of the pharaoh. This honour is quite rare and indicates that Amenhotep was highly respected by the time of his death, despite the fact that he was a commoner and had only entered civil service at an advanced age, in his late forties. Excavated in 1934 or 1935, it measures 45 × 110 metres and is surrounded by three shrines. His first courtyard contained a 25 x 26 m water basin of considerable depth, fed by groundwater from the [[River Nile|Nile]]. Twenty trees were planted in pits around the basin. The temple at the end of the courtyard was adorned with a pillared [[portico]], and the temple was slightly elevated on a terrace.

'''Arnaldo Pagliarini "Arnie" Lerma''' (November 18, 1950 – March 16, 2018) was an American writer and [[activist]], a former Scientologist, and a critic of [[Scientology]] who appeared in television, media and radio interviews. Lerma was the first person to post the court document known as the [[Fishman Affidavit]], including the [[Xenu]] story, to the Internet via the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]].

==Biography==
Lerma was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1950.

==Time in Scientology==
Lerma started in Scientology at the age of 16 at the urging of his mother, an executive director for the Washington, DC church. He was impressed by [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s exaggerated account of his military career and scientific credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|first=Arnaldo|last=Lerma|title=How I Got Fooled|location=Washington, DC|date=2008-03-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGBepC3StII|accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerma joined Scientology's [[Sea Org]] and was assigned in 1976 to a post working alongside Hubbard's daughter Suzette. He later claimed that they became romantically involved and planned to [[elope]], though others{{who|date=March 2017}} have disputed this. Lerma alleged that other Sea Org officers discovered their plans and threatened to mutilate him if he did not cancel the marriage. Lerma quit Scientology soon afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Yonke|date=2005-07-02|title=Scientology Story Sparks Heated Response|work=Toledo Blade|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050702/NEWS10/507020356/-1/ARCHIVES30|accessdate=2008-05-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627170746/http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050702%2FNEWS10%2F507020356%2F-1%2FARCHIVES30|archivedate=June 27, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''RTC v. Lerma''==
After Lerma posted the Fishman Affidavit in August 1995, his home was raided by [[federal marshal]]s and lawyers from the [[Church of Scientology]], alleging he was in possession of copyrighted documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Ryan|title=The gospel of the web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/mar/23/religion.internet|work=Technology|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2000-03-23|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Lerma|title=Scientology and the Lerma Raid|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was filed against Lerma and his Internet service provider by the church's [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), claiming [[copyright infringement]] and [[trade secret]] misappropriation.&lt;ref name="Raid"/&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' and two investigative reporters were added to the lawsuit, as an article written about the raid contained three brief quotes from Scientology "Advanced Technology" documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church in Cyberspace - Its Sacred Writ Is on the Net. Its Lawyers Are on the Case.|last=Fisher|first=Marc|date=1995-08-19|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/washingtonpost/lermaraid091995.html|title=Washington post article Church in Cyberspace;|website=www.lermanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Post'', et al., were released from the suit when United States District Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] ruled in a memorandum on November 28, 1995

{{quote|When the RTC first approached the Court with its ex parte request for the seizure warrant and [[temporary restraining order]], the dispute was presented as a straightforward one under copyright and trade secret law. However, the Court is now convinced that the primary motivation of RTC in suing Lerma, DGS and The Post is to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics. As the increasingly vitriolic rhetoric of its briefs and oral argument now demonstrates, the RTC appears far more concerned about criticism of Scientology than vindication of its secrets.|Memorandum opinion of November 28, 1995, by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema; Religious Technology Center v. Arnaldo Lerma, Washington Post, Mark Fisher, and Richard Leiby &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/908/1353/1457462/|title=Religious Technology Center v.

The [[memorandum opinion]] acknowledges what Scientology practices to this day: the [[Fair Game (Scientology)|"Fair Game"]] policy, a written directive by L.

==Lermanet==
Lerma started a website called ''Lermanet'', which concentrates on news about Scientology and on documenting lawsuits by Scientology. He was also noted for discovering an altered picture on a Scientology website on New Year's Eve in 1999, one that appeared to inflate the number of members attending a millennial event at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in California. He posted the pictures to his website identifying the alterations, with the most prominent feature being the "man with no head". The story appeared on national television and in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-01/04/059r-010400-idx.html|title=The Reliable Source: Scientology's Funny Photos|accessdate = 2007-08-10|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|author2=Berselli, Beth|date=2000-01-04|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lerma committed suicide by gunshot at his home in [[Sylvania, Georgia]], on March 16, 2018, after shooting his wife, Ginger Sugerman, in the face. Sugarman survived.&lt;ref name="SylvPhone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OrtegaDeath"/&gt;

'''Bambang Pamungkas''' (born 10 June 1980), also known as '''Bepe''', is an Indonesian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Persija Jakarta]] in the [[Liga 1 (Indonesia)|Liga 1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.goal.com/kr/people/indonesia/25838/bambang-pamungkas| title= Bambang Pamungkas| publisher= Goal.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and previously the [[Indonesia national football team]]. His natural position is [[Forward (association football)|striker]]. Bambang made his name in South East Asian football when he scored the only goal for Indonesia at the 2002 [[Tiger Cup]] semifinal against [[Malaysia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2002/December/27/thailand-indonesia-advance-to-tiger-cup-final/ |title=Thailand, Indonesia advance to Tiger Cup final |publisher=Soccerway |date=27 December 2002 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the tournament's top scorer with eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/asean02.html |title=ASEAN ("Tiger") Cup 2002 (Indonesia and Singapore) |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bambang is considered to be an outstanding header of the ball, and has a reputation for sharpness in the penalty box. He is Indonesia's record holder in terms of both appearances and goalscoring, earning 86 caps and 38 goals&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/indo-recintlp.html Indonesia&amp;nbsp;– Record International Players] (RSSSF)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Indonesia national team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/pamungkas-intl.html |title=Bambang Pamungkas&amp;nbsp;– Goals in International Matches |author1=Mamrud, Robert |author2=Widigdo, Novianto |publisher=RSSSF |accessdate=15 June 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204702/http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/pamungkas-intl.html| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is perhaps the team's most popular player among its supporters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1287232.html |title=Bambang, Indonesia's goalscoring pin-up |publisher=FIFA.com |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered one of top ten Asian players of 2012 by [[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story/_/id/1277602/top-ten-asian-football-players-of-2012?cc=4716| title= Top ten Asian players of 2012| publisher= [[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|accessdate=28 December 2012| date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Bambang played for several clubs around his hometown as a youth, before beginning his senior career with [[Persija Jakarta]]. He was the club's top goalscorer in 1999–2000 [[Liga Indonesia Premier Division|Liga Indonesia]] with 24 goals. In 2000, he joined [[EHC Hoensbroek|EHC Norad]] in the Dutch Third Division. But after only 4 months he returned to Persija, the only Indonesian club he ever played for.

Bambang helped his club to win the Liga Indonesia in [[2001 Liga Indonesia Premier Division|2001]], and he was awarded the accolade of that season's best player. Persija Jakarta narrowly missed out on winning the championship again in [[2004 Liga Indonesia Premier Division|2004]] by one point. The following season Persija reached the [[2005 Liga Indonesia Premier Division|2005 final]], but lost 2–3 to [[Persipura Jayapura]].

Shortly afterwards Bambang accepted an offer to play in the Malaysian Football League with [[Selangor FA]], along with national teammate [[Elie Aiboy]]. In his first season in Malaysia he won the [[Premier League Malaysia]], [[FA Cup Malaysia]], and [[Malaysia Cup]], and became the league's top-scorer with 23 goals in 24 matches. During two seasons in Malaysia he scored 63 goals in four competitions: [[Malaysia Premier League]], [[Malaysia Super League]], [[FA Cup Malaysia]], [[Malaysia Cup]], [[AFC Cup]]. Despite having scored a total of 178 goals in [[Liga Indonesia]], like Singaporean forward [[Indra Sahdan Daud]], Bambang lost his place in the nation team to foreign-born talent.

In 2008, despite interests from English club [[Derby County]], he opted to stay in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyefootball.com/mobile/4572/Derby-Indonesian-star.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he had a trial at [[FC Ingolstadt 04]], but failed to secure a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2010/July/29/phoenix-sign-argentine-midfielder-cornejo/ |title=Phoenix sign Argentine midfielder Cornejo |publisher=Soccerway |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2013, he signed a one-year contract with Pelita Bandung Raya.

On 3 December 2014, he moved back to [[Persija Jakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESMI: Bambang Pamungkas Pulang Ke Persija Jakarta|url=http://www.goal.com/id-ID/news/1391/indonesia-super-league/2014/12/03/6722242/resmi-bambang-pamungkas-pulang-ke-persija-jakarta|accessdate=4 December 2014|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/football-asia/153/post/2190363/bambangs-return-to-persija-turns-the-clock-back-for-indonesian-fans |title=Bambang's return to Persija turns the clock back for Indonesian fans |publisher=[[ESPN]].com |author=Jason Dasey |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In 1998 Bambang's international career began when he was selected to play for the Indonesian youth team; his tally of seven goals in the Asian Cup U-19 Group V made him the competition's top scorer. He made his senior international debut the following year in a friendly match against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], in which he scored one goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bambangpamungkas20.com/bepe/karir/timnas |title=Bambang Pamungkas :[Official Website&amp;#93;: |publisher=Bambangpamungkas20.com |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His total of 38 goals for his country make him the national team's highest-ever goalscorer.

Bambang has taken part in four [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaigns (2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014), playing in 14 matches and scoring 3 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=182474/index.html |title=FIFA Player Statistics: Bambang PAMUNGKAS |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bambang has also been involved in three [[AFC Asian Cup]]s: 2000, 2004 and 2007. He scored a goal against [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] in the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]], in a match Indonesia won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2007/July/10/indonesia-off-to-dream-start-at-asian-cup-after-beating-bahrain/ |title=Indonesia off to dream start at Asian Cup after beating Bahrain |publisher=Soccerway |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2002 Tiger Cup]], Bambang was the top scorer with 8 goals, but an injury ruled him out of the Indonesian squad for the [[2004 Tiger Cup|2004 event]]. He scored twice in the [[2008 AFF Suzuki Cup]], once against [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] and once against [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]]. In [[2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]] Bambang scored two goals in a match against Thailand, both from penalty kicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_739698/Indonesia_2_Thailand_1_-_Bambang_double_ends_Thai_hopes |title=Indonesia 2 Thailand 1&amp;nbsp;– Bambang double ends Thai hopes |publisher=Affsuzukicup.com |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303213002/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_739698/Indonesia_2_Thailand_1_-_Bambang_double_ends_Thai_hopes |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has scored a total of 12 goals in the [[AFF Championship|ASEAN Football Championship]], making him the 5th-highest goalscorer in [[AFF Championship|ASEAN Football Championship]] history.

==Controversy==
On 18 December 2011, following the match between [[Sriwijaya F.C.|Sriwijaya]] and [[Persija Jakarta]], Bambang, [[Ismed Sofyan]], and [[Leo Saputra]] were involved in an assault on [[Hilton Moreira]] at his hotel, allegedly provoked by Hilton's behaviour during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sindikasi.inilah.com/read/detail/1809572/bambang-pamungkas-ikut-pukuli-hilton |title=Bambang Pamungkas Ikut Pukuli Hilton |publisher=sindikasi.inilah.com |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bambang is one of the leading advocates for player welfare and rights in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianfootballfeast.com/2012/06/01/bambang-this-is-the-worst/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bambang is married to Tribuana Tungga Dewi, with whom he has three daughters: Salsa Alicia, Jane Abel, Syaura Abana. The second youngest of 7 children. he initially had no thoughts of becoming a footballer. He likes reading and cooking, and has ambitions to become a teacher or a chef once his footballing career is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bambangpamungkas20.com/bepe/profil |title=Bambang Pamungkas :[Official Website&amp;#93;: |publisher=Bambangpamungkas20.com |accessdate=26 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426054326/http://bambangpamungkas20.com/bepe/profil |archive-date=26 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bambang devotes some of his free time to charity work, promoting the Bambang Pamungkas Foundation that he set up to provide financial assistance and resources to schools in Indonesia. He is also involved in raising funds for children's cancer charities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Public figure==
As a well-known public figure, Bambang has appeared in many product endorsements, including for Biskuat, Ti Phone, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], Bodrex, and Kuku Bima.

Bambang has written a book in Bahasa Indonesia, ''Ketika Jemariku Menari'', relating his life, his career, and his teammates at club and national level, especially during the AFF 2010 campaign. Former Indonesia national team manager [[Ivan Venkov Kolev]] comments in the book that Bambang is "One striker rare in Indonesia. Commitment and professionalism are hallmarks of rare skill players in Indonesia".&lt;ref name="His book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bukabuku.com/browse/bookdetail/81528/bepe20-ketika-jemariku-menari.html |title=Toko Buku Online&amp;nbsp;– BEPE20: Ketika Jemariku Menari |publisher=BukaBuku.com |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Catton''' [[Royal Academy|RA]] (1728 in [[Norwich]] – 28 August 1798, in [[London]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXACTION_=file&amp;_IXFILE_=templates/full/person.html&amp;_IXTRAIL_=Academicians&amp;person=5564 Charles Catton, the Elder, R.A.] (Royal Academy, London).&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as '''Charles Catton the elder''', was a notable English [[coach painter]], [[Landscape painting|landscape]], animal and figure painter of the late 18th century, and one of the founder members of the [[Royal Academy]].

==Life and work==
Catton was born in [[Norwich]], Norfolk, in 1728,  and said to be one of 35 children that his father had from his two marriages.&lt;ref name=general&gt;{{cite book|page=1096|volume=3|title=A General History of the County of Norfolk|publisher=John Stacy|author=[[John Chambers (topographer)|John Chambers]]|location=Norwich|year=1829|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was apprenticed to a London coach painter,{{sfn|Stephen|1887}} or, according to some sources, a carpenter by the name of Maxwell,&lt;ref name=general/&gt; and studied drawing at the [[St. Martin's Lane Academy]]. He was mainly known as a landscape and animal painter, but also had a good knowledge of the figure, and a talent for humorous design. In 1781, he published an etching called ''The Margate Packet''.{{sfn|Stephen|1887}}

He became a member of the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]], and exhibited various pictures in its galleries in 1760–4. He was outstanding as a coach painter, producing ornamental panels for carriages, floral embellishments, and heraldic devices to the highest quality, eventually becoming coach-painter to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].{{sfn|Stephen|1887}}
[[File:Wappen Duke of Devonshire.png|thumbnail|left|Duke of Devonshire arms]]
He was a founding member of the [[Royal Academy]], and, in 1784, was master of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. He exhibited at the Academy from its foundation until the year of his death. The works he showed were usually landscapes, but occasionally subject and animal paintings, his last exhibits there being  ''Jupiter and Leda'' and ''Child at play''. He painted an [[altarpiece]], ''The Angel delivering St. Peter'', for the church of [[St Peter Mancroft]] in Norwich.{{sfn|Stephen|1887}}

He retired from painting some years before his death. He died at his house in Judd Place, [[New Road (London)|New Road]], London, on 28 August 1798, and was buried in Bloomsbury cemetery.{{sfn|Stephen|1887}}&lt;ref name="Gate"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=74268 Nos 3 and 4 Gate Street] (British History Online).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arms of the Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon.png|thumb|Arms of the Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon, 1790]]
His son, [[Charles Catton the younger]] (1756–1819), who was listed in Royal Academy catalogues as living at his father's house in Gate Street, gained a reputation as a scene-painter and topographical draughtsman.{{sfn|Stephen|1887}}&lt;ref name="Gate" /&gt; He emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=general/&gt; Among Catton's pupils was [[John Durand (painter)|John Durand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidwebbfowler.com/2012/12/an-18th-century-portrait-artist.html|title=COLONIAL AMERICAN DIGRESSIONS|author=David Webb Fowler|work=davidwebbfowler.com|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniël Hartman Craven''' (11 October 1910&amp;nbsp;– 4 January 1993) was a South African [[rugby union]] player (1931–38), national coach, national and international rugby administrator, academic, and author. Popularly known as Danie, Doc, or Mr Rugby, Craven's appointment from 1949 to 1956 as coach of the Springboks signalled "one of the most successful spells in South African rugby history" during which the national team won 74% of their matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports around the World|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|isbn=9781598843002|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYBtMajLAaAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Danie%20Craven&amp;f=false|editor=John Nauright &amp; Charles Parrish|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While as a player Craven is mostly remembered as one of rugby's greatest dive-passing [[Rugby union positions#scrumhalf|scrumhalves]] ever,&lt;ref name=IRB&gt;{{cite web |title=2007 Inductee: Dr Danie Craven |url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027696.html |work=IRB Hall of Fame |publisher=IRB.com |accessdate=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031023349/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid%3D2027696.html |archivedate=31 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; he had also on occasion been selected to play for the Springboks as a [[Rugby union positions#Centre|centre]], [[Rugby union positions#Fly-half|fly-half]], [[Rugby union positions#No.8|No.8]], and [[Rugby union positions#Full-back|full-back]]. As the longest-serving President of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (1956–93) and chairman of the [[International Rugby Board]] (1962, 1973, 1979), Craven became one of the best-known and most controversial rugby administrators.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|last=Nauright|first=John|title=Danie Craven|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/141989/Danie-Craven|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craven earned doctorates in [[ethnology]] (1935), [[psychology]] (1973) and [[physical education]] (1978). He not only created the physical training division of the [[South African Defence Force]] (1941) but became the first professor of physical education at [[Stellenbosch University]] (1949).&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;

== Early life and school years==
Danie Craven was born on 11 October 1911 to James Roos Craven (b. 28 June 1882) and Maria Susanna Hartman (d. 1958) on Steeton Farm near [[Lindley, Free State|Lindley]], a small town on the [[Vals River]] in eastern [[Free State (province)|Free State province]] of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horne|first=Becky|title=Craven &amp; Hayward Link|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTH-AFRICA-EASTERN-CAPE/2006-05/1148800986|work=Rootsweb|publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.property24.com/for-sale/lindley/lindley/free-state/9933/101383437?Branded=false |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233442/http://www.property24.com/for-sale/lindley/lindley/free-state/9933/101383437?Branded=false |archivedate=30 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven was the third of seven children. The family farm was named for [[Steeton, West Yorkshire|Steeton]] in [[West Yorkshire]], home to Craven's paternal grandfather, John Craven (1837–90), who came to South Africa as a diamond prospector.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news|last=Bale|first=Steve|title=Obituary: Danie Craven|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-danie-craven-1476626.html|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The Independent (London)|date=5 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven later also named his home in [[Stellenbosch]] Steeton.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt; His father, aged 18, fought against the British during the [[Anglo-Boer War]] and was interned in a British concentration camp, a fate that reportedly also befell his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lord|first=David|title=How ‘Doc’ Craven laid the path for South African rugby|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2011/02/24/how-doc-craven-laid-the-path-for-south-african-rugby/|work=The Roar|publisher=TheRoar.com|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=24 February 2011|quote=Comment by Spiro Zavos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prisoners of War – Craven, James|url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/database-search/result.php?section=Prisoners_of_War&amp;fldIDUnique=10585#sectionHeader|work=Anglo-Boer.co.za|publisher=Anglo-Boer War Museum|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young boy Craven played barefoot soccer, and received his first lessons at a farm school. At the age of 13 he was sent to Lindley High School, and started playing rugby with a stone in the dusty town streets.&lt;ref name=stof /&gt; At school he shone at cricket and rugby.&lt;ref name=tagtig&gt;{{cite news|last=Husselman |first=Herman |title=SA se rugbyreus word tagtig [SA rugby giant turns 80] |url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/1990/10/10/11/17.html |accessdate=31 December 2013 |newspaper=Die Burger |date=10 October 1990 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231235356/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/1990/10/10/11/17.html |archivedate=31 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following year Craven was selected to play for the town's adult team, but his principal, Tivoli van Huyssteen, prevented him from playing until he turned 15.&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;&lt;ref name=stof&gt;{{cite web|last=Le Roux |first=Herman |title=Sy eerste rugby was met 'n klip in 'n stofstraat [His first rugby was with a stone in a dirt road] |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1993/01/5/13/4.html |work=Beeld |publisher=Beeld (Johannesburg) |accessdate=28 December 2013 |date=5 January 1993 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233750/http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1993/01/5/13/4.html |archivedate=30 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his Lindley teammates was Lappies Hattingh, who would play with Craven 8 years later in the Springbok team against the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]].&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;

== Education and teaching career==
In 1929 Craven enrolled at [[Stellenbosch University]] in the [[Western Cape]]. He initially registered as a theology student,&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt; but later switched to [[Social Sciences]] and [[Social Anthropology]].&lt;ref name=stof /&gt; The switch was prompted by medical advice after his vocal chords were damaged by a kick to the throat while he tried to stop charging forwards during the 1932 test against Scotland.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;

Craven lodged in [[Stellenbosch University halls of residence#Wilgenhof men's residence|Wilgenhof Men's Residence]], following in the footsteps of his maternal grandfather, George Nathaniel Hayward (1886–1977). In 1903 Hayward had been one of Wilgenhof's first residents.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=Noorspoort Guest Farm|url=http://www.noorspoort.co.za/page16.html|work=Noorspoort.co.za|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-round athlete, Craven represented his university in rugby, swimming (captain), water polo and baseball. He also participated in track and field, and played cricket, tennis, and soccer.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;

Craven obtained his BA (1932) as well as a MA (1933) and PhD (1935) in [[Ethnology]] at Stellenbosch. His PhD dissertation was titled ''Ethnological classification of the South African Bantu''. His third doctorate was for his thesis on ''Evolution of Modern Games.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janiallan.com/facetoface/ |title=DR DANIEL HARTMAN CRAVEN : The Doctor Knows Best|first=Jani|last=Allan|authorlink=Jani Allan|work=janiallan.com|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed as Stellenbosch's first professor of Physical Education in 1949, and served in that capacity until 1975.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;

After completing his education at Stellenbosch, Craven started teaching at [[St. Andrew's College (South Africa)|St. Andrew's College]] in [[Grahamstown]], [[Eastern Cape]], in 1936.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt; He coached the school's rugby side, and while there he was selected for the 1937 Springbok tour.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Profiles – St Andrew's College|url=http://www.rugby365.com/article/38515-st-andrew-s-college|work=Rugby365.com|publisher=Rugby365.com|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craven joined the Union Defence Force in 1938 as Director of Physical Education and was sent to Europe to study physical education in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[France]], and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The imminent outbreak of war forced the Cravens to return to South Africa. Craven was appointed head of physical education at the South African military academy with the rank of Major. When his section was established as a separate Physical Training Brigade in 1947, Craven was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and Director of the brigade.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt; His military career was momentarily interrupted in 1947 as he was appointed lecturer in the Union Education Department at Stellenbosch University before returning to the brigade.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;

Due to his fame as Springbok Craven's image was used in Afrikaans language newspapers during the Second World War to encourage men to enlist. The advertisement showed Craven in uniform, looking into the distance and announcing, 'I am playing in the biggest Springbok team ever; join me and score the most important try of your life.'&lt;ref name="Grundlingh1999"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Grundlingh | first = Albert | title= The King's Afrikaners?

==Rugby playing career==
[[Image:Doc craven herdenking copy.jpg|thumb|100-year Anniversary of Doc Danie Craven at Wilgenhof men's residence in [[Stellenbosch]].]]

At university Craven found a mentor in Stellenbosch coach and national selector [[August Frederick Markötter|A.F. ("Oubaas Mark") Markötter]], in charge of the university team from 1903 to 1957.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dit is Maandag 10 Junie, die 161ste dag [It is Monday 10 June, the 161th day] |url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2002/06/10/15/10.html |accessdate=31 December 2013 |newspaper=Die Burger |date=10 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101102244/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2002/06/10/15/10.html |archivedate=1 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Markötter noticed Craven from the time he starting playing as a 19-year-old in 1929, and promoted him to the first team the following year.&lt;ref name=tagtig /&gt;

=== Provincial career ===
Craven was selected as a Springbok in 1931 before he had made his provincial debut for Western Province in 1932.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt; In a match against Free State in Bloemfontein that year he scored a hat-trick of tries in a performance regarded as one of his best.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;

In 1936 he worked in [[Grahamstown]], and so started playing for Eastern Province, alongside Flappie Lochner. At Craven's suggestion, Markötter ensured that Lochner went on the 1937 tour to New Zealand.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;

=== International career ===
Craven played his first test match on 5 December 1931 as [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|scrum half]] at the age of 21 against {{nrut|Wales}} at [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Swansea]]. His flyhalf was the captain, [[Bennie Osler]]. One of the other debutants that day was flanker André McDonald, who would later develop into the first specialist No. 8. Craven and McDonald became fast friends. His performance on a water-logged field led ''Die Burger'' to exult "Boy plays like a giant".&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Tim|title=Players: 250 Men, Women and Animals Who Created Modern Sport|year=2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780224082778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his third test, against Scotland at Murrayfield on 16 January 1932, Craven scored the winning try. The opportunity came because Craven implemented advice that he had received at Stellenbosch from coach Markötter. Markötter had said that on a muddy field a scrumhalf should either play with his forwards or kick, Craven recalled later. His advice enabled Craven to choose between captain Osler, who wanted the ball to be passed to him, and leader of the forwards [[Boy Louw]], who demanded that the ball stay with the forwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bezuidenhout|first=Kobus|title=Toe die Skotte bly was oor nul [When the Scots were happy with zero]|url=http://rugby.maroelamedia.co.za/2013/11/13/toe-die-skotte-bly-oor-nul/|work=Maroela Media|publisher=maroelamedia.co.za|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match he was knocked unconscious, sustained damage to his vocal chords, and lost a tooth.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt;

Craven's last test match was on 10 September 1938 as captain (also as [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|scrum half]]) at the age of 27 against the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] at [[Newlands Stadium|Newlands]], [[Cape Town]]. During the 1930s he was one of the world's leading scrumhalves, but the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 ended his career prematurely.

==Rugby coaching and administration==

===Coaching career===
After his rugby-playing career ended, he was a national selector from 1938 until he was appointed coach in 1949. He started his coaching career with a bang, winning 10 matches in a row, including a 4–0 whitewash of New Zealand in their 1949 tour to South Africa. Under his guidance the Springboks were undefeated from 1949 to 1952, and won 17 of 23 tests (74% success rate) – an achievement that makes Craven one of South Africa's greatest coaches. He also coached Stellenbosch University from 1949 until 1956.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;

=== Administrative career ===
Craven became the president of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB) in 1956. He was also a member of the [[International Rugby Board]] from 1957 and served as its chairman on several occasions.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;

The last part of Craven's chairmanship of the SARB occurred during the country's most tumultuous years. Rugby had become the national sport of [[white South African]]s and a symbol of [[Afrikaner]] power. In the 1970s and 1980s, the outlawed [[African National Congress]] allied with overseas [[apartheid|anti-apartheid]] movements to successfully isolate South Africa from sporting and cultural contact with the rest of the world. Of all the sanctions aimed at South Africa, none irked the Afrikaner population more than the ban on rugby internationals.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa: The New Ball Game|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968832,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=31 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craven managed to maintain links with other rugby playing nations during the years of South Africa's sporting isolation through his position with the IRB. He feared that isolation would negatively affect the standard of Springbok rugby. Consequently, he was not above "some murky business", such as the [[New Zealand Cavaliers]] tour in 1986, which Craven denied would happen. By the time South Africa returned to international competition in 1992, there had been no outgoing tours since 1981, and no incoming tours since 1984.&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;

In 1988 Craven met leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]] in a bold bid to return to global competition.&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mr&gt;{{cite web|title=Mister Rugby’s century|url=http://www.ruggaworld.com/2010/10/11/mister-rugbys-century/|work=Rugga World|publisher=RuggaWorld.com|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unprecedented deal emerged to form a single rugby association that would field integrated teams for participation in foreign tournaments. Many right-wing white South Africans attacked Craven as a traitor for meeting with the ANC, and then-president [[P.W. Botha]] denounced the move.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt; Although the deal did not lead to the immediate end of the sporting isolation, it paved the way for the formation of the unified body, the [[South African Rugby Union|South African Rugby Football Union]] (SARFU) in 1992. Craven was SARFU's first chairman until he died in 1993, having served for an unbroken 37 years at the head of South African rugby.&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;

On 30 May 1975 Craven married Martha Jacoba (Merlė) Vermeulen, the widow of Cape Town detective Dirk Vermeulen. Merlė worked in the fashion industry as a buyer for a chain of stores, and so had to attend fashion parades. After one such a parade in Pretoria, she twisted her ankle badly at her hotel. A bystander introduced her to Craven as "a doctor" who "knew a lot about ankle injuries". After Craven treated her foot, he telephoned and arranged to meet her again, and their relationship developed.&lt;ref name=stof /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Venter|first=Joe|title=Aan die sy van twee SA grótes [At the side of two of SA's great ones]|url=http://www.rapport.co.za/KaapRapport/Nuus/Aan-die-sy-van-twee-SA-grotes-20100410|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=Rapport|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craven had a dog named "Bliksem" which accompanied him everywhere, even to rugby practices. A journalist recalled how "when Doc and Bliksem&lt;ref&gt;The name of the dog is somewhat ambivalent, as it can mean "lightning" or "rascal" in Afrikaans. In honour of Bliksem's loyalty and constant companionship, the dog is included as part of Craven's statue in Stellenbosch.&lt;/ref&gt; were on the touchline at training, no one within sight would dare shirk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=Archie|title=Doc not entirely forgotten|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/rugby/2010/10/17/doc-not-entirely-forgotten|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The Times (South Africa)|date=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
There were "many contradictions and convolutions in Craven's life", wrote Paul Dobson, which made him both admired and despised:
:"His home language was [[Afrikaans]], but he would claim not to be an Afrikaner...a sportsman and yet he set higher store by academic achievement...accused of trying to hang on to an exclusively white preserve, and yet he devoted himself to breaking down racial barriers" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobson|first=Paul|title=Doc – The life of Danie Craven|year=1994|publisher=Human &amp; Rousseau|location=Cape Town|isbn=9780798133142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honours ===
Danie Craven was accepted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]] in 1997, the first of 9 South Africans to date.&lt;ref name="Crawford1996"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Crawford | first = Scott A.G.M. | title= New Zealand rugby museum | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 23 | number= 3 | pages = 338–340 | year = 1996 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1996/JSH2303/jsh2303m.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he became the third inductee into the [[IRB Hall of Fame]], only preceded by [[Rugby School]] and [[William Webb Ellis]], the alleged instigator of the game that would develop into rugby union.&lt;ref name=IRB /&gt;

The South African [[Craven Week]] schools rugby competition is named after him, as well as the [[Danie Craven Stadium]] and Danie Craven Rugby Museum in Stellenbosch. To commemorate him, Stellenbosch University commissioned sculptor Pierre Volschenk to execute a bronze sculpture of Craven and his faithful dog. The statue stands within the grounds of the Coertzenburg sports complex in Stellenbosch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Pierre Volschenk |url=http://www.ridley.co.za/2009%20invite/2009-invite.htm |work=Sheena Ridley |publisher=Ridley.co.za |accessdate=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001746/http://www.ridley.co.za/2009%20invite/2009-invite.htm |archivedate=31 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Craven received the State President's Award for Exceptional Service, as well as the honorary citizenship of the city of Stellenbosch.&lt;ref name=reus /&gt; He was made an honorary life president of the [[French Rugby Federation]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;

=== Aphorisms ===
Craven is often remembered for his quirky and controversial statements. For example, he said "When Maties and Western Province rugby are strong, then Springbok rugby is strong."

Initially he was unsure that all South Africans could play together, arguing in 1968 that the different race groups were "separate nations...[who] won't ever play in the same side. But maybe...one day, we would have such a team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McRae|first=Donald|title=Winter Colours: Changing Seasons in World Rugby|year=2013|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9781840182477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven denied that he had ever said that people of colour would be Springboks "over my dead body".&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt; His supporters could point to his liking for coloured rugby enthusiasts, and the efforts that he made over the last few years of his life to run multiracial rugby workshops in rural South Africa as signs that he had changed his views.&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;

=== Published works ===
Apart from his academic dissertations which were referred to above, Craven wrote numerous books as solo and co-author on rugby, including his autobiography (1949), rugby terms for translators (1972), and how to organize a tennis club (1951). According to ''The Independent'' of London "his coaching manual ''Rugby Handbook'' (1970) is a standard".&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;

'''Elaine Gumbs-Vlaun''' is a [[Sint Maarten|St. Maartener]] who was the first [[social worker]] on the island, and founded the Department of Social Services. She was also the first female parliamentarian, having served under the [[Netherlands Antilles]].

==Career==
Elaine Gumbs-Vlaun founded the [[Sint Maarten]] department of Social Services, while acting as the island's original social worker. She was elected to the island council in 1983,&lt;ref name=farewell/&gt; and at the time was promoted as being the first woman to achieve that role, although [[Cornelia Jones]] predated her within the [[Windward Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Cornelia Jones First Woman Member of the Island Council.|url=https://thesabaislander.com/2014/02/22/miss-cornelia-jones-first-woman-member-of-the-island-council/|publisher=The Saba Islander|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumbs-Vlaun also served as part of the Cabinet of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This made her the first Sint Maarten woman to be elected to a parliament.&lt;ref name=farewell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognition for St. Maarten’s first social worker: Elaine Gumbs-Vlaun: "Do it with your heart and soul"|url=http://www.todaysxm.com/recognition-for-st-maartens-first-social-worker-elaine-gumbs-vlaun-do-it-with-your-heart-and-soul/|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Today|date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbs-Vlaun was one of the founding members of the Mental Health Foundation in Sint Maarten in 2000, as part of a government initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Judy H.|title=A success story|url=http://thedailyherald.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=22057%3Aa-success-story-&amp;Itemid=34|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The Daily Herald|date=29 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105001753/http://thedailyherald.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=22057%3Aa-success-story-&amp;Itemid=34|archivedate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she became a member of the Social Economic Council (SER) and was reappointed in May 2014. Gumbs-Vlaun retired in 2015 upon reaching the age of 70. The chair of the SER, Oldine Bryson-Pantophlet, praised the work of Gumbs-Vlaun, saying that she kept her composure despite the sometimes heated discussions that would be held at the council.&lt;ref name=farewell&gt;{{cite news|title=SER bids farewell to member Elaine Gumbs-Vlaun.|url=http://smn-news.com/st-maarten-st-martin-news/20816-ser-bids-farewell-to-member-elaine-gumbs-vlaun.html|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Sint Maarten News|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Mattheis began her modeling career at the age of fourteen, after being a finalist of a competition held by the agency [[Elite Model Management]]. Soon after she moved to [[São Paulo]], and it was from there that her career as a model took off. From fifteen to seventeen, she lived in Japan, Hong Kong and some European countries. Her acting career started when she played Vivian in [[Malhação]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

Mattheis does not consume [[alcoholic beverage]]s.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; While she stopped eating red meat and chicken for ideological reasons two years ago, she otherwise avoids stringent dietary restrictions. Instead, she relies on an intense exercise regimen that she began as a teenager: "I run five to seven kilometers three to four times a week. Sometimes on the treadmill, sometimes outdoors." Mattheis has two [[personal trainer]]s.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diariogaucho.clicrbs.com.br/rs/entretenimento/noticia/2015/08/fiorella-mattheis-revela-como-mantem-a-forma-e-garante-odeio-ser-proibida-de-comer-4824120.html|title=Fiorella Mattheis revela como mantém a forma e garante: "Odeio ser proibida de comer"|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=13 August 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattheis attributes her successful career to achieving what could not be done with beauty alone through "hard work and dedication".&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gshow.globo.com/programas/video-show/Por-tras-das-cameras/noticia/2015/03/fiorella-mattheis-revela-sonho-e-rejeita-rotulo-de-musa-so-beleza-nao-sustenta.html|title=Fiorella Mattheis revela sonho e rejeita rótulo de musa: 'Só beleza não sustenta'|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=16 March 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2015, Mattheis was honored as the godmother of the [[non-governmental organization]] Ampara Animal in Rio de Janeiro for her activism in helping needy cats and dogs.&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portaldodog.com.br/cachorros/celebridades/fiorella-mattheis-foi-eleita-madrinha-da-ong-ampara-animal-no-rio-de-janeiro/|title=Fiorella Mattheis foi eleita madrinha da ONG Ampara Animal no Rio de Janeiro|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=2 June 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Mattheis had her hair treated by burning with a lit candle.

In August 2015, Mattheis posed in an advertisement for the clothing brand PG with actor and designer Paulo Gustavo. Gustavo described Mattheis as "the most beautiful woman I've ever seen."&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epoca.globo.com/colunas-e-blogs/bruno-astuto/noticia/2015/08/paulo-gustavo-e-fiorella-mattheis-posam-para-marca-de-roupas-do-comediante.html|title=Paulo Gustavo e Fiorella Mattheis posam para marca de roupas do comediante|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=19 August 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel '''George Vincent Fosbery''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (11 April 1832 – 8 May 1907) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. He was also a designer and inventor of firearms.

==Military background==
An [[Eton College|Old Etonian]], Fosbery was 31 years old, and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[4th Bengal European Regiment]], [[British Indian Army]] during the [[Umbeyla Campaign]] during which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He retired from the service in 1877 having achieved the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{citation | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E5DD133EE033A2575AC0A9639C946697D6CF | title=LIEUT. COL. FOSBERY DEAD | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | place=original obituary archived on website | date=9 May 1907 | format=PDF | accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Umbeyla Campaign===
{{See also|Henry William Pitcher}}
On 30 October 1863 during the Umbeyla Campaign, North-West [[India]], Lieutenant Fosbery led a party of his regiment to recapture the [[Crag Picquet]], after its garrison had been driven in by the enemy and 60 of them killed. The approach to the Crag was very narrow but the lieutenant led his party with great coolness, and was the first man to gain the top of the Crag from his side of the attack. Subsequently, when the commanding officer was wounded, Lieutenant Fosbery assembled a party and pursued the routed enemy, inflicting on them further losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22988|page=3425|date=7 July 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fosbery grave.jpg|thumb|Fosbery's grave, [[Smallcombe Cemetery]], Bath]]

==Inventions==
In 1895 he patented a design for a self-cocking revolver, which was taken up by the Webley &amp; Scott Revolver &amp; Arms Company.  The [[Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver]] was produced as a six-shot .455 caliber and an eight-shot .38 caliber.  

Sometime in the late 19th century he invented the [[Paradox gun]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; A gun made by [[Holland &amp; Holland]], so named because only the front two inches of the barrel were rifled; intended to be used as both rifle and shotgun, capable of firing both shot and conical bullets with accuracy.

==Medals==
In 1997, Fosbery's Victoria Cross was sold at an Alberta auction for $45,000. His medals are now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/vvashcr2.htm | title=Lord Ashcroft VC collection | accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guillermo Carlos Cazenave''' (born September 18, 1955 in [[Buenos Aires]]) is an Argentine musician who has been living in Europe for more than three decades. He is also known as Guill Cazenave. He is also an author and journalist, specialized in many different musical styles.

== Early years ==
Guill started making music from a very young age; when he was 7, his grandmother from the [[Isle of Skye]] gave him a bagpipe.

In 1963, his older siblings travelled to New York. A while later they returned to [[Argentina]] with the first albums by the [[Beatles]], and Guillermo, after seeing the band [[The Dave Clark Five]] on television, started playing the drums in 1965, later to study with the drummer and percussionist Sam Lerman.

In 1969, Guillermo started his first pop band with two classmates from the [[Colegio Cardenal Newman]] in Buenos Aires, making his debut with a performance at a party, in September of the same year.

At the same time, he continued his drumming studies with the recognised master [[Alberto Alcalá]], percussionist of the Orchestra of the [[Teatro Colón]], to continue experimenting with other different styles under the teachings of Droopy Gianello, drummer of [[Arco Iris (band)|Arco Iris]], a folk-rock band led by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]].

Cazenave recorded his first songs using his brother's Toshiba 2 track tape recorder. It was with it that he recorded several of his demos, using guitar, flute and his voice, in a Celtic-folk style, probably influenced by his beginnings playing the bagpipes.

In 1973, Guillermo Cazenave graduated from high school and travelled to the US where he continued composing and recording songs both in Spanish and English, thanks to his bilingual studies at the Newman College.

In 1974, back in Buenos Aires, he made his first professional recording at the ION Recording Studios, with the pianist Antonio Marzochi and the guitarist Kelo Palacios, for a play that was performed for the first time at the [[Teatro San Martín|San Martín Theatre]]. Not long after that, Guill returned to New York, and stayed there until May 1977, when he emigrated to Europe, staying for long periods of time between London and [[Sitges]], where he established contact and made friends with musicians such as [[Anthony Phillips]] and [[Miguel Abuelo]].

== From folk and pop to space music ==
In [[Sitges]] in 1983, Guill created the first Spanish [[new age]] music record label, and started selling his music on magazines like [[Integral]], Karma 7 and [[Popular 1]].

Between 1984 and 1999, Guillermo Cazenave produced more than 50 albums and sold around 300,000 copies of his work, mainly in the alternative market. It was very common to find him at congresses, symposiums and festivals. He often appeared on the Spanish media, and travelled and performed in countries such as France, England, US or [[Mexico]].

In the late 90s, he relocated to the Cathar Country in the South of France, near [[Montségur]], and began a period of temporary retirement with just the occasional appearance, and few CDs released. In 2007, after an impasse of several years, he reappeared with his album Ser, and with the novel "La Noche del Grial" ("The Night of the Grail"), with prologues by Jean-Luc Robin and [[Javier Sierra]], in which he narrates his experiences in that area.

In 2008, Cazenave started performing live again, giving talks at congresses, recording new albums, writing for magazines like Más Allá de la Ciencia (Beyond Science), where he managed the music section, or in Universo Holístico (Holistic Universe), and appearing on radio programs like Espacio en Blanco, by his friend Miguel Blanco Medrano, in the Spanish national radio ([[Radio Nacional de España]]), in a section called From the Cathar Country.

Cazenave has recorded with renowned musicians in different styles and tendencies, such as the British oboist Ronald Lloyd; the ex member of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]], the pop musician [[Jeremy Morris]], the rock pioneer in Argentina [[Litto Nebbia]], and many other skilled artists and friends.

The diversity of his work, which includes [[new age]], [[pop-rock]], [[Celtic fusion]] and even classical music, makes Guill's career and style difficult to classify. His production currently goes beyond one thousand registered pieces, and more than 80 albums in the market, as well as several books and innumerable video productions.

== The musician of the spheres ==

Cazenave's music has already travelled through space during the last trip of the [[Shuttle Endeavour|NASA Shuttle Endeavour]], on May 16, 2011. His "Fly High" was one of the pieces chosen by the astronauts and technicians.

During the last trip of the Endeavour Shuttle, with the mission of installing some equipment to receive radiation from outer space and investigate the origins of the universe; the six astronauts in the crew of the spaceship, along with numerous [[NASA]] technicians, selected 50 musical compositions to take and listen to during the trip.

The trip itself had a very special meaning, not only because it was the final flight of the emblematic shuttle, and because of the characteristics of the mission, but also because of the general idea of leaving the footprint of human expression in space through one of its most sublime arts: music.

Among greatest hits and classics of all times, like [[What a Wonderful World|Wonderful World]] by [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]] by [[John Lennon]] and unforgettable songs by [[U2]], [[Rolling Stones]] and other English-speaking countries, they selected "Fly High" (Vuela Alto) by the musician Guillermo Cazenave, composed in 1996 for his album "Here" (Aquí).

Cazenave also receive a diploma from the NASA, along with a few congratulating lines by John Shannon, Program Manager of the Space Shuttle, saying: “You are now, with your music, part of the rich history of our program since the times of the Apollo.”

== Author ==

'''Guillermo Rodriguez'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/cast/guillermo|title=Guillermo Rodriguez {{!}} Jimmy Kimmel Live!|website=ABC|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born January 27, 1971), more commonly known as '''Guillermo''', is a Mexican-American [[talk show]] personality who rose to fame while working as a parking lot [[security guard]] at the [[Hollywood Boulevard]] studios for American late night talk show ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He continues in character and title as ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!''{{'}}s security guard, but actually performs nightly as [[Jimmy Kimmel]]'s [[sidekick]].

==Life and career==
{{Original research|part=section|date=February 2018}}
Rodriguez was born in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} 

Guillermo quickly became a permanent, nightly cast-member on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' after performing in comedy bits written for the show. His broken English coupled with his affable likability and Teddy Bear-like quality have earned him a high-profile supporting role as a personality on the show. Guillermo took over main red-carpet interviewing duties in 2011 from the late [[Frank Potenza|"Uncle Frank" Potenza]], whom he was often paired with for the show's comedic skits.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Passings: Frank Potenza, John Howard Davies, Jack Layton |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/24/local/la-me-passings-20110824 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |date=2011-08-24|accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillermo's signature segment is "Guillermo's Hollywood Roundup", in which Guillermo, dressed in a cowboy outfit and pretending to twirl a special effect operated lasso, makes a mockery of entertainment news shows featured widely on television. From outside the theater and standing next to his [[West Coast Customs]]-made "Guillermobile", he answers Kimmel's questions about the latest [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] stories by taking a rack of magazines that the "Guillermobile" has been fitted with, and attempts to interpret the stories in an unintentionally amusing and mis-translated way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110303134240/http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/bio/guillermo-rodriguez/637042 Guillermo's bio] at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].com&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular and recurring bit is announcing that Guillermo has a role in a current or recent major motion picture release and showing a clip of an at-first familiar trailer for said movie with Guillermo humorously edited in, his appearance often made-up to resemble a character in the movie. One popular sketch has Guillermo impersonating [[Matt Damon]]'s character of [[Jason Bourne]] in ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film) |The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' by responding when asked to be named, "I am Yay-son... Bourne Identity." A physical fight between Guillermo and Damon's actual character ensues. Guillermo also starred alongside Kimmel in Boo!, a spoof of [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34146/watch-jimmy-kimmels-saw-vi-spoof-boo|title=More Campers Are Left 2 Die - Dread Central|date=29 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillermo often sets out to interview famous celebrities. Some of his subjects do not know who he is, which the show uses for humorous interplay. Guillermo regularly appears at the [[NBA Finals]] to interview players. At the [[2015 NBA Finals|2015 Finals]], he called out to [[LeBron James]] as James was practicing. James ignored Guillermo, who had a meter counting how many times the name "LeBron" would be called before James acknowledged Guillermo's presence.

Guillermo appeared as a special guest on the last episode of [[Univision]] [[telenovela]] [[Eva Luna (soap opera)|''Eva Luna'']] on April 11, 2011. In 2017, he had a brief uncredited role in [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]]'s ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' as a cop, which he revealed in a video on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' in April 2017.&lt;ref name="Guillermo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45TAnT9XDvk|title=Guillermo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|first=|last=Jimmy Kimmel Live|date=13 April 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptations ==
A film ''[[Chittagong (film)|Chittagong]]'' released in October 2012, directed by Dr. [[Bedabrata Pain]], shows role of Harigopal Bal (called by his nickname "Tegra" in the movie) in the Chittagong Armoury raid. [[Manoj Bajpai]] was the lead actor and played the role of [[Surja Sen|Surya Sen]].

Actor Nitin Prabhat played the Harigopal Bal with nickname 'Tegra' in the bollywood movie [[Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey]] released in 2010.

After their marriage, Lord and Lady Harewood split their time between their homes; Chesterfield House (destroyed after the Second World War) in London, [[Goldsborough Hall]],  at Harwood  Estate  and [[Harewood House]] itself, in Yorkshire, which became their family home in 1929. They had two children:
* [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|George Henry Hubert Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood]] (born at Chesterfield House 7 February 1923 – died 11 July 2011) and christened at St Mary's Church [[Goldsborough, North Yorkshire|Goldsborough]] 25 March 1923
* [[Gerald David Lascelles|The Hon. Gerald David Lascelles]] (born at [[Goldsborough Hall]] 21 August 1924 – died 27 February 1998)

Her elder son, the Earl of Harewood, wrote about his parents' marriage in his memoirs ''The Tongs and the Bones'' and says that "they got on well together and had a lot of friends and interests in common".

==Military career==
After education at [[Eton College]], Lascelles attended the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; before being commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] into the [[Grenadier Guards]] on 12 February 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27405|page=846|date=11 February 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving until 1905.&lt;ref name=kelly18&gt;{{cite book|title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, 1918|publisher=Kelly's|page=928}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an honorary attache at the British Embassy in [[Paris]] from 1905 until 1907, then served as aide-de-camp to the [[Governor General of Canada]], Earl Grey, until 1911.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

He continued his interest in the Territorial movement after the war, as Honorary Colonel of the 1st Battalion The London Regiment from 1923, the 5th Battalion [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] from 1937, and as President of the West Yorkshire Territorial Forces Association from 1928. He was also appointed in 1937 Honorary [[Air Commodore]] of the 609 (West Riding) Bomber Squadron of the [[Auxiliary Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kelly's Handbook, 1945|publisher=Kelly's|page=895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other interests==
After the war, Lascelles remained interested in local [[Yorkshire]] issues and events, often contributing to the Leeds Board of Management. He was president of the Yorkshire Rural Community Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Harewood|url=http://www.genesreunited.com.au/searchbna/results?memberlastsubclass=none&amp;searchhistorykey=0&amp;keywords=board%20management%20middleton%20harewood&amp;county=west%20yorkshire%2c%20england|date=13 March 1943 |work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |location=West Yorkshire, England|accessdate=25 September 2015|quote=...

He was President of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England]] in 1929 when that year's [[Royal Show]] was held at [[Harrogate]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Interested in equestrian sports, he served as Master of the Bramham Moor Hounds from 1921,&lt;ref name=kelly29/&gt;, was a steward of the [[Jockey Club]], and co-editor of ''Flat Racing'' (1940) for the London Library.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Lord Harewood, a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], served as [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] from 1942 to 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.london.museum/it/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Standards-and-Banners-in-Freemasonry-_2_.pdf|title=A Library and Museum of Freemasonry Information Leaflet: The Use of Standards and Banners in Freemasonry|publisher=The Library and Museum of Freemasonry|date=November 2011|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political==
As Viscount Lascelles, he attempted to enter the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] when he stood at a [[Keighley by-election, 1913|by-election]] in 1913 as [[Unionist  Party (UK)|Unionist]] candidate for [[Keighley (UK Parliament constituency)|Keighley]], held when its incumbent [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament, [[Stanley Buckmaster, 1st Viscount Buckmaster|Sir Stanley Buckmaster]] was appointed [[Solicitor General of England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. In the three-cornered fight that also included a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, he came second to Buckmaster by 878 votes.

He did not seek election again and his defeat led to a later distaste for politics. He declared in later life "every war in which Britain had been involved had been due to the inefficiency of politicians, and they began what soldiers had to end".&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

On succeeding to his father's Earldom he became a member of the [[House of Lords (UK)|House of Lords]].

==Death and legacy==
Lord Harewood died of a heart attack on 24 May 1947 at the age of 64 at his home, [[Harewood House]]. Lady Harewood, the Princess Royal, survived him by almost eighteen years and died in 1965.

It is widely understood that [[Virginia Woolf]] based the character of Archduke Henry on him in her novel [[Orlando: A Biography|''Orlando'']], a tribute to her lover [[Vita Sackville-West]]. Henry Lascelles was one of West's suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/orlando/canalysis.html|website=sparknotes.com|title=Orlando|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iris Bannochie''' (1914 – September 1988) was a [[Barbados|Barbadian]] [[horticulturalist]] who was the leading expert on [[horticulture]] on the island of [[Barbados]].

==Life==
Bannochie was born in [[Grenada]] in 1914 and, apart from her early childhood, lived all her life in Barbados. She married John Mackie Bannochie on 13 April 1964. She was a founding member of the Barbados National Trust.

[[File:Andromeda Botanical Gardens 11.jpg|thumb|left|Headstones of Iris and John Bannochie in Andromeda Gardens]]
With her second husband, John, she created and owned [[Andromeda Gardens]], a scenic park with [[flowering plant]]s and [[tropical]] [[trees]] in the village of [[Bathsheba (Barbados)|Bathsheba]], [[Saint Joseph, Barbados|Saint Joseph]] in [[Barbados]]. Bannochie founded the garden around 1954 on {{convert|8|acre|m2}} of land that had been in her family since 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Leach | first = John | title = Tourism For Survival | journal = Roots | volume = 1 | issue= 1 | date = April 2004 | url = http://www.bgci.org/education/article/0408/ | accessdate =2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Bannochie's death, Andromeda Gardens was left to the [[Barbados National Trust]].

In 1977, she was awarded [[the Veitch Memorial Medal]] by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] for her contribution to tropical horticulture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bannochie | first = Iris |author2=Marilyn Light | title = Gardening in the Caribbean | publisher = Macmillan  | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-333-56573-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bannochie suffered a [[stroke]] in the summer of 1988 and died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Deitz | first = Paula | title = A Rare Garden in Barbados | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1991-02-17 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DF133CF934A25751C0A967958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=A+Rare+garden+in+barbados&amp;st=nyt}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 73 years old.

A [[heliconia]] [[cultivar]] is named after Bannochie - ''[[Heliconia stricta]]'' 'Iris Bannochie'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Heliconia Photos | date = 2004-04-29 | url = http://andromeda.cavehill.uwi.edu/heliconia_photos.htm | accessdate =2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Bjerre Damgård''' (born 1956) is a [[Danish people|Danish]] cryptographer and currently a professor at the Department of Computer Science, [[Aarhus University]], [[Denmark]].

In 1983, he obtained a master's degree in [[mathematics]] (with minors in [[music]] and [[computer science]]) at Aarhus University. He began his PhD studies in 1985 at the same university, and was for a period a guest researcher at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]] in Amsterdam in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.win.tue.nl/wsk/eidma/courses/minicourses/damgaord/MC-00-23.html |title=MC-00-23 |work=Cryptographic Multiparty Protocols (5-day minicourse in 2001) |accessdate=2010-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607223418/http://www.win.tue.nl/wsk/eidma/courses/minicourses/damgaord/MC-00-23.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his PhD degree in May, 1988, with the thesis ''Ubetinget beskyttelse i kryptografiske protokoller'' (Unconditional protection in cryptographic protocols) and has been employed at Aarhus University ever since. Damgård was made full professor in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interntnyt.katrinebjerg.net/05/26/ivan.html|title=180705 - Ivan Damgård ny professor|work=(in Danish)|accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known among other things for the [[Merkle–Damgård construction]] used in most modern [[cryptographic hash function]]s such as [[SHA-1]] and [[MD5]]. He discovered the structure independently of [[Ralph Merkle]] and published it in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;I. Damgård. ''A Design Principle for Hash Functions''. In Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO '89 Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 435, G. Brassard, ed, Springer-Verlag, 1989, pp. 416-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivan Damgård is also one of the founders of the [[Cryptomathic]] company. In 2010, he was selected as IACR Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iacr.org/fellows/2010/ | title=2010 IACR Fellows | accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siddharta parting from Kanthaka and Chandaka BM OA1880.65.jpg|thumb|Siddhartha parting from Kanthaka, [[Gandhara]], [[British Museum]]]]
[[File:KITLV 88034 - Unknown - Relief of Chanda and Kanthaka in British India - 1897.tif|thumb|Relief of Chanda and Kanthaka in British India, 1897]]

'''Kanthaka''' (in [[Pali language|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]) (6th century BC, in [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilvastu]] and [[Tilaurakot]], [[Nepal]]) was a favourite white [[horse]] of length eighteen cubits that was a royal servant of Prince Siddhartha, who later became [[Gautama Buddha]]. Siddhartha used Kanthaka in all major events described in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts prior to his renunciation of the world. Following the departure of Siddhartha, Kanthaka died of a broken heart.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Buddhism| last = Malasekera| first = G. P. |year =1996| publisher = [[Government of Sri Lanka]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the court of King [[Suddhodarna]], Kanthaka was the most skillful and able horse, and the favourite of Crown Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]], whenever Siddhartha needed to go outside the palace. Siddhartha had been lavished and pampered in a series of purpose-built palaces by Suddhodarna in order to shield him from thoughts of pain and suffering. This was done due to a prophecy by the ascetic [[Asita]], who predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the throne to become a spiritual leader were he to contemplate human suffering. Kanthaka is first described in relation to the events leading up to the marriage of Siddhartha to [[Yasodhara]], another Sakyan princess. By the customs of the [[kshatriya]] Sakyan clan, a prince must prove his worthiness in warrior related skills such as horse-riding, mounted archery and swordplay by defeating other royals in such contests. Mounted on Kanthaka, Siddhartha defeated his cousin [[Devadatta]] in archery, another cousin [[Anuruddha]] in a horse-riding competition and then half-brother [[Nanda]] in swordplay.

After Siddhartha's marriage, Kanthaka was the horse pulling the chariot when [[Channa (Buddhist)|Channa]], the head royal servant accompanied Siddhartha around [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] to see the [[Four sights]] whilst meeting his subjects, which prompted his decision to renounce the world. During these expeditions aboard Kanthaka, Channa explained to [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] the sights of an elderly man, a sick person, a dead person whose funeral was being conducted and finally, an [[ascetic]] who had renounced worldly life for a spiritual one, as Siddhartha who had been secluded from such sights within the palace was taken aback.

Later, Kanthaka was the horse used by Siddhartha to escape from the palace to become an ascetic, whilst the remainder of the palace guards were asleep. After initially protesting and refusing to accept that Siddhartha would leave him, Channa saddled Kanthaka,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rootinstitute.com/buddhism_shakyamuni_sorrow.html&lt;/ref&gt; guiding him out of the town aboard the horse to a forest by the edge of the [[Anoma River]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.watlaori.org/who%20is%20buddha.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the texts, Kanthaka was able to jump across the river. Riding Kanthaka, Channa returned Siddhartha's accoutrements, weapons and hair to Suddhodarnha upon his return to the palace, after Siddhartha compelled him to return after Channa had refused to leave him.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt;

According to Buddhist texts, Kanthaka was reborn as a [[brahmin]] and went on to attend [[dharma]] talks by [[Gautama Buddha]] and achieve enlightenment. The death is variously described as occurring either at the banks of the Anoma or upon returning to Kapilavastu.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt;

The description of Kanthaka is also widely observed in Buddhist art, such as carvings on stupas. The depiction of Siddhartha leaving [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] aboard Kanthaka found at the main [[stupa]] in [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravathi]] is the oldest depiction currently existing. Such depictions are also displayed in museums in [[London]] and [[Calcutta]].

She assisted [[Wyatt Walker]] in planning the early portions of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|Southern Christian Leadership Conference's]] involvement in the 1963 [[Birmingham Campaign]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Marjorie Longenecker (1998) ''A Walk to Freedom: The Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, 1956-1964''.

==Early life==
On December 19th, 1932 Lola Mae Haynes, the first of two daughters, was born to Buford and Addie Hanes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpilgrim.org/wp-content/uploads/obits/lolahendricks.pdf |title=Lola Hendricks Obituary|date=May 24, 2013|website=New Pilgrim Baptist Church|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819191651/http://newpilgrim.org/wp-content/uploads/obits/lolahendricks.pdf |archivedate=August 19, 2016 |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lola Mae Haynes was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on 4th Avenue and 15th Street South on the south side of Birmingham.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/media/pdf/behindtheveil/btvct02013.pdf|title=Interview with Lola Haynes Hendricks|last=Whorley|first=Tywanna|date=June 22, 1994|website=Duke University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was employed as a coal-truck driver from [[LaGrange, Georgia]] and her mother, from [[Chambers County, Alabama]], worked as a domestic cook. Lola Mae Haynes went to school in Birmingham at Cameron Elementary School, graduated, and then went to Ullman High School for two years. In 1949, Haynes attended Parker High School for two years and graduated in January of '51.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After graduating from Parker High School, she began working as an elevator operator at Hillman Hospital, now called University Hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lola Mae Haynes saved her money from the hospital for a year, until she was able to enroll herself in beauty school in 1952 where she attended the Ruth Porter's School of Beauty Culture. 

In February 1953, Lola Mae Haynes married Joseph Hendricks. Lola then went on to study for two years at the Booker T. Washington Business College. After graduating from Booker T. Washington Business College, Lola began employment in the [[insurance industry]] at Alexander &amp; Company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The company, owned by John J. Drew and his wife Deanie, had employed Lola Mae Haynes Hendricks as a [[Clerk|clerk-typist]] and an insurance writer.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Huntley, Horace (January 19, 1995) [http://www.teachersdomain.org/asset/iml04_doc_fulllhen/ Interview with Lola Hendricks]. Birmingham Civil Rights Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Haynes began working for the Federal Government under the [[Social Security Administration]], where she became one of the first African Americans to integrate amongst the whites into the workforce. Hendricks worked in files for about two years, and then was promoted to Clerk Typing and again, to Award Typing.&lt;ref name="Interview" /&gt; 

==Civil Rights Movement==
The Hendrickses were members of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). When the group was outlawed by the State of [[Alabama]] in 1956 she became one of the early members of the [[Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights]], joining at a mass meeting at Nelson Smith's New Pilgrim Baptist Church where she was a member.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; The ACMHR, led by Shuttlesworth, organized local boycotts and demonstrations as well as coordinating legal challenges to Birmingham's [[Jim Crow laws|segregation laws]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=White /&gt; Hendricks and her husband were the named parties in ACMHR-backed lawsuits to force integration of Birmingham city parks and to desegregate the [[Birmingham Public Library]]. She also served as the organization's correspondence secretary, working from Shuttleworth's office at [[Bethel Baptist Church (Birmingham, Alabama)|Bethel Baptist Church]] from 1956 until the culmination of the [[Birmingham Campaign]].&lt;ref name=White /&gt; In December 1962 she traveled to [[New England]] as a field director for the [[Southern Conference Education Fund]], raising awareness among Northerners about the realities of Southern [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]] and soliciting donations of Christmas toys for movement members [[boycott]]ing Birmingham's [[Department store|department stores]].&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;

In the Spring of 1963, Hendricks coordinated the practical office requirements and cultivated local contacts for the combined efforts of the ACMHR and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded and which was chaired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. She worked directly with the SCLC's [[Wyatt Walker]] during the campaign, helping organize support and logistics for marches and department store boycotts.&lt;ref name=White /&gt;

It was Hendricks who applied directly to Public Safety Commissioner [[Bull Connor|Eugene "Bull" Connor]] for a parade permit for the first day of marches and was told "You will not get a permit in Birmingham, Alabama to picket. I'll picket you over to the jail."&lt;ref name=McWhorter&gt;[[Diane McWhorter|McWhorter, Diane]] (2001) ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution.'' New York, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-7432-2648-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Walker's urging she did not actively demonstrate and risk jailing, protecting her behind-the-scenes importance to the movement. Hendricks' nine-year-old daughter, Audrey Faye Hendricks (1952–2009), however, was the only child in her class to participate in the May 2, 1963 "[[Children's Crusade (civil rights)|Children's Crusade]]" that brought national attention to Connor's brutal tactics against demonstrators. She spent five nights in jail as minders got word out to her parents that she was safe.&lt;ref name=Snajderman&gt;Sznajderman, Michael (Fall 2003) "A dangerous business: Children on the front line."

==Later life==
Hendricks left her insurance company job in 1963 to join the newly integrated Birmingham office of the [[Social Security Administration]]. She was hired originally as a filer, but was promoted to unit clerk before moving to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] where she became a supervisor. She left in 1983 to care for her mother. In 1988 she rejoined the Social Security Administration where she worked until reaching retirement.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; She continued to volunteer at the [[Birmingham Civil Rights Institute]] and in the mid 1990s she assisted the Birmingham Historical Society in researching movement churches and landmarks for [[National Register of Historic Places]] status.&lt;ref name=White /&gt;

She has two sisters (one deceased), two daughters, Audrey Faye Hendricks (1952–2009) and Jan Hendricks Fuller, and one grandson, Joel A. Fuller. Audrey Faye Hendricks (1952–2009), at the age of nine, was the only child in her class to participate in the May 2, 1963 "[[Children's Crusade (civil rights)|Children's Crusade]]" that brought national attention to [[Bull Connor|Eugene "Bull" Connor]]'s brutal tactics against demonstrators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5811">'''Maleagant''' (alternately ''Malagant'', ''Meliagant'', ''Meligaunt'', ''Meliagaunt'', ''Meliaganz'', ''Meliagrance, Mellyagraunce'', ''Mellegrans'', etc.) is a villain from [[Arthurian legend]]. In a number of versions of a popular episode, Maleagant abducts [[Guinevere|Queen Guinevere]], necessitating her rescue by [[King Arthur]] and his knights. The earliest surviving version of this episode names the abductor '''Melwas'''. Maleagant debuts in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' French romance ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', where he is said to be the son of King [[Bagdemagus]], ruler of the [[otherworld]]ly land of Gorre. However, all surviving versions seem to be later adaptations of a stock narrative of significantly earlier provenance.

==Origins==
The earliest version of the popular abduction of Guinevere episode appears in the early 12th-century [[Latin]] ''[[Gildas|Life of Gildas]]'' by [[Caradoc of Llancarfan]]. In that text Melwas, king of the "Summer Country" (''regnante in aestiua regione''; a direct translation of Welsh name for [[Somerset]], ''{{lang|cy|Gwlad yr Haf}}''), carries Guinevere off to his stronghold of [[Glastonbury]]. Arthur locates her after a year of searching and prepares to storm the castle, but [[Gildas]] negotiates her safe return. Melwas also appears in a fragmentary [[Welsh language|Welsh]] dialogue, indicating that this story was widely known in [[Wales]]. A monumental carving on the [[Modena Cathedral#Porta della Pescheria|archivolt]] of [[Modena Cathedral]] in [[Italy]] contains a related scene, in which Arthur and his warriors besiege a castle where a character identified as "Mardoc" sits with "Winlogee", presumably Guinevere.&lt;ref name="NAE"&gt;{{Citation | last = Stokstad | first = Marilyn | author-link = | contribution = Modena Archivolt | editor-last = Lacy | editor-first = Norris J. | title = The New Arthurian Encyclopedia | volume = | pages = 324–326 | publisher = Garland | place = New York | year = 1991 | contribution-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Sherman Loomis]] regarded the form Maleagant or ''Meleagans'' as directly derivative of the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] Melwas. He listed a number of variants, including along with Mehaloas, Melians and Malvasius.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthurian romances==
Maleagant (spelled ''Meliagant'' or ''Meliaganz'') first appears under that name in ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]], where he brings Guinevere to his impenetrable castle. The queen is rescued by [[Lancelot]] and [[Gawain]]; this is the first major appearance of [[Lancelot]] in Arthurian legend. If he was ever more than an obscure villain, Maleagant's role seems to have diminished as [[Mordred]] became more popular; however, Maleagant appears in most accounts of Guinevere's kidnapping. He plays that part in the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.

In the romance ''Sone de Nansai'', Sone visits an island said to have been Meleagan's. Meleagan's father was [[Bagdemagus|King Baudemagus]] and his grandfather Tadus. Meleagan's island is perfectly square and its walls are made of crystal. There is a palace at each corner and at the center, a fountain wells up through a gilded copper horn. The Sword Bridge connects the island to a causeway, a bowshot away, which leads to the mainland. In Meleagan's day, many men were beheaded there.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern fiction==
Maleagant appears in modern retellings like [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' and [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' (as Sir Meliagrance).

*In the [[The Warlord Chronicles|Warlord novels]], by English author [[Bernard Cornwell]], based on the Arthurian legend, a secondary character named Melwas is mentioned many times, here as the king of the tribe of the [[Belgae]], who inhabited the region roughly corresponding to modern [[Hampshire]] with its capital at [[Venta Belgarum]] (modern [[Winchester]]). At first glance, the only similarity between the legendary character and the fictional one seems to be their common name, but, upon closer inspection, we find some clues that indicate a possible intention of the author of having his fictional Melwas to be his own peculiar version of Maleagant. A couple of similarities include the fact that, in the novels, Melwas is a vassal to King [[Uther Pendragon]] (Arthur's father) and, after his death, to his grandson, the child King [[Mordred]], to whom Arthur serves as Regent during his minority, while Maleagant himself was a vassal to King Arthur. Both became members of the Round Table in its respective versions in the novels and in the Arthurian legend, and both betrayed their sovereigns by raising arms against them.
*In the French TV series [[Kaamelott]], Meleagant is a dark and mysterious entity, either a god or a wizard, portrayed by Carlo Brandt. He seems omniscient, able to predict the future and appear in people's dreams. His goal seems to push Lancelot to explore the darkest sides of his personality. Meleagant also pushes King Arthur and the Roman Emperor to commit suicide. While Caesar dies, Arthur survives his suicide attempt. 
*He appears in the 1995 film ''[[First Knight]]'' as a murderous renegade knight of the [[Round Table]], where he is portrayed by [[Ben Cross]].

'''Malise IV of Strathearn''' (Gaelic: ''Maol Íosa''; died c. 1329) was a Scottish nobleman, the seventh known ruler of 
[[Strathearn]]. He was an ardent supporter of [[King Robert the Bruce]], in contrast to his father, [[Malise, 6th Earl of Strathearn|Malise]], who sided with [[Edward I of England]].

He is first recorded in January 1306, when he and his mother petitioned King Edward to release his father, who had been mistakenly imprisoned. In 1309 he is noted as having received gifts of money and wine from Edward; nevertheless, he joined King Robert's side, and fought with him at the siege of [[Perth Castle]] in 1312, while his father fought for the English defenders. On the fall of the castle, the elder Malise was captured by his son, who then took control of the earldom of Strathearn. 

Little more is known of him, as his name does not often appear on record. He was one of the earls who signed the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320, and married at least twice. Though the identity of his first wife is not known, we know that by her he had a son and a daughter: [[Malise, 8th Earl of Strathearn|Malise]], who succeeded his father as eighth Earl, and Mary or Maria, who married John Murray of Drumsargard. His second wife, whom he married around 1323, was Jean or Joanna, daughter of [[John de Menteith|Sir John Menteith of Ruskie]]. They had no issue. After the Earl's death around 1329, the Dowager Countess would go on to marry three more times. Her third husband, [[Maurice de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn|Maurice Murray]], was granted the earldom of Strathearn after it was lost by the eighth Earl.

Born in [[Mannheim]] and raised in [[Bürstadt]], Capristo was first exposed to singing and dancing competitions in 2001, when she won ''Kiddy Contest'', a [[reality television]] singing competition for teens in [[Austria]], with her song "Ich wünsche mir einen Bankomat". In the mid to late 2000s, Capristo rose to fame as a founding member of the  girl band [[Monrose]], the result of the fifth season of the German television talent show ''[[Popstars (Germany)|Popstars]]''. Until their disbandment in 2011, the trio released four studio albums and 11 singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neue Popstars: MONROSE sind Mandy, Bahar &amp; Senna! |url=http://www.just4fun-magazin.de/news/neue_popstars%20_monrose_sind_mandy%20_bahar_%20_senna.html|accessdate=24 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2010: Monrose and modeling===
[[File:Cover me 2007 - 0195 (Monrose).jpg|thumb|left|Monrose at the ''Cover Me'' charity concert in [[Cologne, Germany]] in 2007.]]
In 2006, Capristo decided to participate in the German television show ''[[Popstars (Germany)|Popstars]]'' on the [[ProSieben]] network. At the finale, the audience chose Capristo via [[televoting]] to become the final member of the girl band trio [[Monrose]] alongside [[Senna Guemmour]] and [[Bahar Kızıl]]. The group's debut single "[[Shame (Monrose song)|Shame]]" peaked at number one on the [[German Singles Chart]] and became one of the best-selling singles of the year, resulting in a sales total of 200,000 copies Europe-wide. The group released their debut album ''[[Temptation (Monrose album)|Temptation]]'' in December 2006, which debuted on the charts at number one and was certified two times platinum by [[Media Control Charts]] in 2007. Since 2006, the girl group released four studio albums, ''[[Temptation (Monrose album)|Temptation]]'', ''[[Strictly Physical (album)|Strictly Physical]]'', ''[[I Am (Monrose album)|I Am]]'' and ''[[Ladylike]]'' which entered the charts in the Top 10. Their singles ''[[Shame (Monrose song)|Shame]]'' and ''[[Hot Summer (song)|Hot Summer]]'' have charted at number one. Overall, they released eleven singles, which seven of eleven reached the Top 10 in the German Charts. In 2008, they won their first Comet Award for Best Single with "'Hot Summer" and in 2009 for the best band. In June 2010 she featured on the German cover of FHM Magazine and posed in the same calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unterhaltung.t-online.de/monrose-star-in-der-fhm-mandy-in-sexy-bademode/id_41860176/index|title=Mandy in sexy Bademode|last=|first=|date=2 June 2010|publisher=|access-date=|work=unterhaltung.t-online.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605032456/http://unterhaltung.t-online.de/monrose-star-in-der-fhm-mandy-in-sexy-bademode/id_41860176/index|archivedate=5 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2010 Monrose announced that the group would split and each focus on their solo projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monrose.de/news/2010-11-25/monrose-geben-trennung-bekannt |title=MONROSE geben Trennung bekannt! &amp;#124; Monrose |work=monrose.de |date=25 November 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625054556/http://www.monrose.de/news/2010-11-25/monrose-geben-trennung-bekannt |archivedate=25 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last official TV appearance Monrose had was on 27 February 2011 with their single "[[Like a Lady]]" at the finale for [[Austria's Next Topmodel (cycle 3)|cycle 3]] of [[Austria's Next Topmodel]].

===2011-2016 Solo career===
[[File:Mandy Capristo ZDF-Fernsehgarten 1.jpg|thumb|Capristo in 2012]]
After the disbanding of Monrose Capristo confirmed in an interview that she already started recording for her first album in November 2010. In May 2011 she performed two songs off her first album. One track called "Be You", it will be the B-Side of her first single and it was written for the Be-Yu Cosmetics. The other song is called "Overrated" which will also appear on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mandy-grace.com/site/index.html#/NEWS/ACTUAL_NEWS|title=mandy-grace.com|website=www.mandy-grace.com|access-date=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of a cooperation with [[Peter Maffay]] they recorded the song "Die Zeit hält nur in Träumen an" (German) and performed on 8 October at ''Wetten, dass ..?'', in October 2012 the singer went on Tabaluga-Tour with Peter Maffay. The single with Peter debuted at number 86 in the German Charts.

In March 2012, Mandy announced her first solo single "The Way I Like It" written and produced by [[David Jost]], would be released on 13 April. Her first album was to be called ''Grace''. The album was released on 27 April under her new record label [[EMI]] and Starwatch Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandy Capristo at THE DOME|url=http://www.rtl2.de/92602.html|publisher=RTL2|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandy Capristo|url=http://musikflash.square7.ch/?p=42|publisher=Musicflash|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandy Capristo setzt solo auf EMI Music und Starwatch Entertainment|url=http://www.mediabiz.de/musik/news/mandy-capristo-setzt-solo-auf-emi-music-und-starwatch-entertainment/317959|publisher=Musikwoche|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As her second single she released a song called "Closer" written by Robin Grubert and Martin Tingvall.

In 2016 she changed her artist name to Grace Capristo and released her single "One Woman Army" written by American songwriter and producer [[PJ Bianco]], P. Bentley, Aimée Proal and Caprito to moderate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gala.de/stars/news/grace-capristo-ist-ihre-single-gefloppt_1418728.html|title=Grace Capristo: Ist ihre Single gefloppt? {{!}} GALA.de|newspaper=gala.de|language=de-DE|access-date=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2016 she also released a song called "Ricorderai l'Amore (Remember The Love)" with Italian singer [[Marco Mengoni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realityshow.blogosfere.it/post/724490/marco-mengoni-grace-capristo-duetto-ricorderai-lamore-remember-the-love|title=Marco Mengoni and Grace Capristo: Ricorderai l'Amore (Remember The Love)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==

===Music and voice===
Capristo has published songs in [[English language|English]]; only for the Tabaluga project and the feature film ''Rapunzel'' has she sung in German. She also sang the song "Grace" in Italian, although she does not speak that language. A complete production of their songs was used in acoustic versions. 2016 she also released a track called "Ricorderai l'Amore (Ricorderai l'Amore)" with Italian singer [[Marco Mengoni]] where she sung an Italian part. Capristo said, "I feel most comfortable with English, because I personally think that my voice sounds at its best. Although German is my native language, I feel more comfortable in English." In addition, she added: "It is very important that I decide my projects."
In a review of the album ''Grace'' the music magazine Laut.de wrote: "''Grace'' is a nice debut-intentioned work, but which, unfortunately, proves that the chick from Monrose-targeted new style does not get paid on album length. [...] "It Don't Matter" and the acoustic session was the best, without all the trappings actually show her vocal talent." CD Bewertungen.de: "Her fans can look deep into her soul and makes clear that a lot is just smoke and mirrors as well as a "Star" has its problems, is lonely, has been violated."&lt;ref name="TAD"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/leute/peter-maffay/maffay-holt-sich-monrose-star-20337082.bild.html|title=Maffay holt sich "Monrose"-Star Mandy Capristo für Tabaluga-Musical|newspaper=BILD.de|access-date=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British magazine ''Popjustice'' wrote: "We love it in a very deep and pure way, of course, but we were hoping Mandy's album ''Grace'' would contain so many extraordinary tunes that we could make one of them a Big Song instead.

'''Quintus Labienus Parthicus''' (died 39 BC) was the son of [[Titus Labienus]]. He was a Roman general in the Late [[Roman republic|Republic]] period. He made an alliance with [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] and invaded the [[Roman province]]s in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] which were under the control of [[Mark Antony]]. He occupied the Roman province of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] together with the Parthians in 40 BC. He then pushed into southern [[Anatolia]], still with Parthian support. The main Parthian force took charge of Syria and invaded [[Judea]]. Both Labienus and the Parthians were defeated by [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]], who recovered these provinces for Mark Antony.

==Liberator's Civil War==
After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, there was a civil war between the Caesarians, the supporters of Caesar, and the Pompeians, the supporters of [[Pompey]], who had led the forces of the [[Roman senate]] against Caesar during [[Caesar's Civil War]] (49-45 BC). In this civil war, the [[Liberators' civil war|Liberators' Civil War]] (43-42 BC), the Pompeians were led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger]], the leaders of the conspiracy to murder Caesar. They fought against [[Augustus|Octavian]] and Mark Antony, two members of the [[Second Triumvirate]], an alliance between the three leaders of the Caesarians. Cassius and Brutus were defeated at the [[Battle of Phillipi]] in October 42 BC. Labienus tried to resurrect the Pompeian cause with the help of the Parthians.

==Continuing the Pompeian cause==
According to [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], Labienus fled to Persia.&lt;ref name=Festus&gt;Festus, Summary of the history of Rome, 18. [http://www.attalus.org/translate/festus.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Cassius Dio]], he was instead sent by Brutus and Cassius to [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]], the king of [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], to obtain reinforcements before the Battle of Phillipi. He was kept there for a long time as Orodes was waiting to see how things would turn out. Labienus remained in Parthia when he heard of the defeat at Phillipi for fear of reprisals by the victors. When he saw that Mark Antony misruled his provinces in the east and that he went to Egypt, he persuaded Orodes to attack the Romans. He told him that some of their armies had been destroyed or impaired in the battle and other armies were mutinous. He advised him to invade Syria while Mark Antony was in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]] and told him that many Roman provinces would welcome him as they had been alienated by Antony's mistreatment. He offered to take the command of his troops. Orodes was persuaded to wage war and entrusted a large force to Labienus and his son [[Pacorus I]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.24.4-8, 25.1 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#26]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]], instead, wrote that the Parthian generals appointed Labienus commander-in‑chief of a Parthian army which was hovering in Mesopotamia and was about to invade Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, The Live of Antony, 28.1 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], it was Pacorus who had the leadership of the invading force.&lt;ref name=Justin&gt;Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 42.4 [http://www.attalus.org/translate/justin7.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin thought the Parthians took the side of the Pompeians and allied with Labienus because they had formed a friendship with Pompey in the Third Mithridatic war (73-63 BC) and because they had defeated and killed [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], who was an ally of Caesar, at the Battle of Carrhae (53 BC). The son of Crassus was in the Caesarian party. Thus, they thought that if the Caesarians won, they would want to avenge the death of Crassus. Justin also wrote that they had already sent assistance to Cassius and Brutus, which is in contrast with Cassius Dio’s account. Appian thought that it was the actions of Mark Antony which caused this Parthian invasion. When Antony fell in love with Cleopatra, he lost his interest in public affairs and did Cleopatra’s bidding.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Antony had [[Arsinoe IV of Egypt |Arsinoe]], Cleopatra’s sister and a potential rival for the Egyptian throne, murdered, he had  [[Serapion (strategos)|Serapion]], Cleopatra's perfect in [[Cyprus]], and a man who claimed to be her brother handed over to her by the townsfolk of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]] respectively&lt;/ref&gt; After Caesar’s death on 44 BC there was civil strife in Syria and local tyrants took over the Syrian cities with the help of the Parthians. Antony expelled these tyrants, who took refuge in Parthia. He then imposed heavy tributes. He sent a cavalry force to plunder [[Palmyra]], a rich city, but this was foiled by the townsfolk. He garrisoned Syria. This was the mistreatment Cassius Dio referred to. After this Antony went to Egypt to join Cleopatra.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, 5.9-10 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/5*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Pompeian-Parthian invasion of 40BC==
{{main|Pompeian–Parthian invasion of 40 BC}}
Cassius Dio gave the details of Labienus’ campaign. He invaded [[Phoenicia]] and attacked [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], but he was repulsed. However, he won over all the Roman garrisons in Phoenicia without resistance because they were soldiers who and fought with Cassius and Brutus and were sent there when Mark Antony incorporated them in his forces. They knew Labienus. [[Lucius Decidius Saxa]], who had been put in command in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] by Antony,  was the only one who did not defect. He fled. Labienus pursued him and defeated him and his few followers. Saxa fled to [[Antioch]]. The townsfolk of Apamea surrendered because they thought that Saxa was dead. Labienus forced Antioch to surrender and Saxa fled to [[Cilicia]]. Labienus caught up with him, captured him and executed him. Meanwhile, Pacorus subjugated Syria, except for [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], whose townsfolk supported the Roman soldiers who fled there. Pacorus did not have a fleet and could not seize the city. He moved on to [[Judea]], invaded it, deposed [[Hyrcanus II]] and installed, [[Antigonus II Mattathias]] his nephew and foe.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.25.2-4-24.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] gave a detailed account of events in Judea when the Parthians invaded it.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, The Jewish War, 1.13-15.309 [http://www.attalus.org/old/bj_1c.html#248]
Jewish Antiquities, 14.330-14 [http://www.attalus.org/old/aj_14c.html#330]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Labienus occupied Cilicia and obtained the allegiance of the cities on the southern coast of Anatolia  except for three cities in [[Caria]]:  [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratonicea]], [[Mylasa]] and [[Alabanda]]. The latter two cities had accepted garrisons from him, but then murdered them and rebelled. Labienus seized Alabanda and punished its people. He destroyed Mylasa after it had been abandoned. He besieged Stratonicea for a long time but did not manage to capture it. He styled himself as Parthicus (conqueror of the Parthians), thereby taking a “title from those whom he was leading against the Romans, as if it were the Parthians and not his fellow-citizens that he was defeating.” &lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.26.3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch wrote that Mark Antony was slow to respond to Labienus' invasions because he was caught up with the charms of Cleopatra in Egypt and a luxurious lifestyle, feasting, playing sports and engaging in other youthful pursuits. He was surprised by reports that his wife [[Fulvia]] had started a war with [[Augustus|Octavian]] in Italy (the [[Perusine War]], 41-40 BC) and that Labienus “was subduing Asia from the [[Euphrates]] and Syria as far as [[Lydia]] and [[Ionia]]." &lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, The Live of Antony, 29-30.1&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio, instead, wrote that Antony kept himself informed. However, he failed to take defensive measures because now that he was in power he did not pay enough attention to his duties and enjoyed the life of luxury of the Egyptians “until he was entirely demoralised.” When he was forced to take action, he sailed to Tyre to help this city. However, when he saw that Syria had already been occupied, he abandoned it. He sailed along the coast all the way to Greece and then to Italy to support Fulvia in her war against Octavian. He seized [[Siponto|Sipontum]] and besieged [[Brundisium]]. When Fulvia died, the hostilities were terminated and there was reconciliation. Antony and Octavian signed the Treaty of Brundisium in September 40 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.27-30.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stories of Antiquity: Treaties of Brundisium &amp; Tarentum [https://storiesofantiquity.weebly.com/treaties-of-brundisium--tarentum.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Antony returned to Greece. He sent [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] to Asia against the Parthians and Labienus.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, 5.65 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/5*.html#65]&lt;/ref&gt; When Ventidius came upon Labienus, he was frightened by its suddenness. He was  without the Parthians and had only troops which had been levied locally. Ventidius pushed him out of the [[Asia (Roman province)| Roman province of Asia]] and pursued him into Syria with his lightest troops. He caught up with him near the [[Taurus Mountains]]. The two forces stayed encamped for several days. Ventidius was waiting for his heavy-armed troops and Labienus was waiting for the Parthians. Both arrived at the same time. Ventidius was worried about the large enemy cavalry and remained in his camp on a hill. The latter, confident in the strength of their numbers, rode up the hill at dawn without waiting for Labienus’ forces to join them. Ventidius did not respond and the cavalry made a charge up the slope. When they were some way up the Romans attacked and pushed the enemy downhill. Many were killed in combat and a larger number was trampled over by those who were retreating while they were still going up the hill. 

The survivors fled without joining Labienus and Ventidius pursued them up to their camp. Labienus had got there and prepared to offer battle. However, his soldiers were dejected because of the flight of the Parthians. Labienus gave up and tried to withdraw. Ventidius had learned about this from deserters and prepared some ambushes. The enemy was defeated and Labienus escaped. He spent some time in Cilicia in disguise. However, he was found out and arrested. Ventidius took charge of Cilicia and sent a cavalry force to Amanus, a mountain between Cilicia and Syria. It was nearly routed by Pharnapates, a lieutenant of Pacorus in charge of the garrison at the pass. Ventidius showed up unexpectedly, defeated the enemy and killed Pharnapates. The Parthians abandoned Syria and Ventidius seized it without a fight. He occupied Judea and left it after a frightened Antigonous fled.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.39-41&lt;/ref&gt; For the actions of Ventidius and his lieutenant, Silo, in Judea see Josephus.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, The Jewish War, 1.15.288-16-317 Jewish antiquities 14.15-394-434&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Florus]], the battle was fought between the rivers [[Euphrates]] and [[Orontes River|Orontes]], and the defeated force numbered more than 20,000. Ventidius used the stratagem of pretending to panic to get the enemy to come close to prevent them from using their arrows as they would not have room to shoot. Pacorus died in the battle. This was a compensation for the disaster of Crassus at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. His head was carried around the cities which had revolted. Syria was recovered without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 2.19.3-7 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2G*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] wrote that the battle was fought on Mount Caper. Both Labienus and Pacorus died in that battle. The latter died on the same day in which Crassus had been defeated and this avenged his death. Ventidius celebrated a triumph over the Persians.&lt;ref name="Festus" /&gt; [[Velleius Paterculus]], too, wrote that Labienus and  Pacorus died in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Roman History , 2.78 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frontinus]], like Florus, thought that Ventidius feigned fear to lure the Parthians into an unfavourable situation and then attacked them by surprise. The Parthians refused to follow Labienus and left the province. &lt;ref&gt;Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.36 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/2*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Periochae]], with his victory, Ventidius drove the Parthians out of Syria after Labienus had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;The Periochae of Livy, 127 [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae126.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plutarch, Labienus died in the battle, and so did Pharnapates, the most capable general of Orodes II. Mark Antony received the news of the victory while he was wintering in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, The Live of Antony, 33.4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Justin, Ventidius routed the Parthian army in the absence of Pacorus. Justin, too, wrote that Ventidius pretended to be afraid. He put the Parthians to flight with part of his army. Pacorus thought that the fugitive had drawn all the Romans in their pursuit and that their camp was unguarded. He attacked it, but was defeated by the rest of the Roman troops. Pacorus died. This was the biggest defeat suffered by the Parthians in any war.&lt;ref name=Justin /&gt;

'''King Rience''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|.|ɛ|n|s}}, also spelt '''Ryence''', '''Ryons''', and '''Rion''', is a character from [[Arthurian legend]], an enemy of [[King Arthur]] in the early years of his reign. His realm varies: in [[Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', he is king of [[North Wales]], [[Ireland]] and "many isles".

He is most notable for his habit of trimming his robe with the beards of eleven kings he has conquered, he wants Arthur's for a complete twelve. This identifies him with the giant Ritho mentioned in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'', who had the same [[modus operandi]] and who was also killed by Arthur.

Malory leaves Rience's fate unclear: he is kidnapped by [[Sir Balin]] and his brother [[Sir Balan]], forced to submit to Arthur, and never mentioned again. Earlier tales, such as the Prose ''[[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]'' section of the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, have him killed in battle against Arthur.

Because of the similarity of their names some writers, such as [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], identify him with King [[Urien]].

'''Robert Howe''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aʊ}}; 1732&amp;nbsp;– December 14, 1786) was a [[Continental Army]] general from the [[Province of North Carolina]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The descendant of a [[Moore family (Carolinas)|prominent family]] in North Carolina, Howe was one of five generals, and the only major general, in the Continental Army from that state.  He also played a role in the colonial and state governments of North Carolina, serving in the legislative bodies of both.

Howe served in the colonial militia during the [[French and Indian War]] and commanded [[Fort Johnston (North Carolina)|Fort Johnston]] at the mouth of the [[Cape Fear River]].  He also served as a colonel of Royal Governor [[William Tryon]]'s artillery during the [[War of the Regulation]]. Howe suffered greatly when Tryon, a personal friend, became Governor of New York, and he staunchly opposed Tryon's successor.  He became active in organizing efforts within North Carolina and among the American colonies between 1773 and 1775 and was an active member of the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]].  At the outset of the Revolutionary War, Howe was promoted to brigadier general and was heavily involved in actions in the [[Departments of the Continental Army#Southern Department|Southern Department]], commanding the Continental Army and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] militia forces in defeat in the [[Capture of Savannah|First Battle of Savannah]].

Howe's career as a military commander was contentious and consumed primarily by conflict with political and military leaders in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, he fought a duel with [[Christopher Gadsden]] of South Carolina which was spurred in part by Howe's conflict with South Carolina's state government.  Political and personal confrontations, combined with Howe's reputation as a womanizer among those who disfavored him, eventually led to the [[Continental Congress]] stripping him of his command over the Southern Department.  He was then sent to New York, where he served under General [[George Washington]] in the [[Hudson Highlands]], although Howe did not have a successful or significant career in that theater.  He sat as a senior officer on the court-martial board that sentenced to death [[John André]], a British officer accused of assisting [[Benedict Arnold]] in the latter's plot to change allegiance and deliver West Point to the British. Howe himself was accused of attempting to defect to the British, but the accusations were cast aside at the time as having been based in a British attempt to cause further discord in the Continental Army.  Howe also played a role in putting down several late-war mutinies by members of the [[Pennsylvania Line|Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey Line|New Jersey]] Lines in New Jersey and [[Philadelphia]] and returned home to North Carolina in 1783.  He again became active in state politics, but died in December 1786 while en route to a session of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives|North Carolina House of Commons]].

==Early life and family==
[[File:Collet Map excerpt showing Wilmington and Brunswick.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A map of the Cape Fear River showing Wilmington and Brunswick Town in 1770|A portion of John Collet's 1770 map of North Carolina depicting the environs of the lower Cape Fear, including Howe's plantation at top right, located near Barren Inlet]]
Howe was born in 1732 to Job Howe (also spelled "Howes"), the grandson of [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|colonial Governor]] [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]], who presided over the southern portion of the [[Province of Carolina]].  Job was also a descendant of Governor [[John Yeamans]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe's mother may have been Job's first wife Martha, who was the daughter of colonial North Carolina jurist Frederick Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5}}, cf {{harvnb|Ashe|1892|p=496}}, where Jane, Job's third wife, is attributed as his mother, and {{harvnb|Rankin|1988|p=218}}, where Howe's mother is called Sarah.&lt;/ref&gt;  Job Howe's ancestors had been planters and political figures in South Carolina during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=2–3}}  Prior to Howe's birth, his family left [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to settle on the banks of the [[Cape Fear River]] in the [[Province of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe's father was a member of the extended Moore family, formerly of South Carolina, who settled the lower Cape Fear River and collectively owned more than {{convert|80,000|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} of farmland on it by the 1730s.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=4}} Job Howe died in 1748, leaving his estate and the wealth of his parents to Robert.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=496}}  Robert had two brothers and two sisters, all of whom were mentioned in Job's will.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|p=3}}

As a young boy, Howe may have been sent to England to obtain an education,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} although several sources doubt that Howe made the journey.&lt;ref name="Marker" /&gt;{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5}}  At some point between 1751{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5}} and 1754, after completing his education, Howe married Sarah Grange,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} who was heiress to a large fortune.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=496}}  Howe had numerous affairs, fathering an unknown number of children in and out of wedlock, including a son, Robert; two daughters, Mary and Ann; and up to four additional daughters whose mothers' names are not recorded. Howe was widely considered a womanizer by contemporaries; by 1772 he became estranged from Grange, and the two separated.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  In the year of their formal separation, Howe recorded a deed for the support of his wife.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|p=4}}

[[Loyalist]] sympathizer and diarist [[Janet Schaw]] described Howe prior to the revolution:{{sfn|Schaw|1921|p=167|ps=, Schaw and Howe had a contentious relationship, which was evidenced by Howe's (perhaps unserious) threat in 1775 that he would tar and feather Schaw for her loyalty to the Crown.  See {{harvnb|Ranlet|1991|p=727}}}}

{{Quote|...&amp;nbsp;very like a Gentleman, much more so indeed than any thing I have seen in the Country. He is deemed a horrid animal, a sort of a woman-eater that devours every thing that comes in his way, and that no woman can withstand him. But be not in pain for your friend, I do assure you they overrate his merits, and as I am certain it would be in the power of mortal women to withstand him, so am I convinced he is not so voracious as he is represented.}}

Howe inherited a large amount of assets from his grandmother and, upon the death of his father, became the owner of "Howe's Point", a rice plantation near what was formerly known as Barren Inlet (now called Mason Inlet{{sfn|Powell|Hill|2010|p=334}}).  The site of the former plantation is located on the mainland directly across from [[Figure Eight Island]].  Howe also owned a plantation called "Mount Misery" in what was [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen County]].  His grandmother had provided Howe with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and money with which Howe was intended to build his fortune.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5–6}}

==Colonial political and military service==
Around 1755, Howe captained a militia company in Bladen County, and was appointed a justice of the peace for that county in 1756.  Howe was elected to the [[North Carolina General Assembly#History|colonial Assembly]] from Bladen County in 1760 and served until 1762.  In 1764, the Assembly created [[Brunswick County, North Carolina|Brunswick County]], and Howe was both appointed its justice of the peace and re-elected to the Assembly from the new county.  Howe would be re-elected six more times from Brunswick County.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  In 1765, Howe worked with other colonial leaders such as [[Hugh Waddell (general)|Hugh Waddell]], [[Abner Nash]], and [[Cornelius Harnett]] to found the Wilmington Sons of Liberty organization, which was active in protesting the [[Stamp Act 1765]] that taxed most printed materials.{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=244}}  At the time, the members of the Sons of Liberty did not consider their resistance to be rebellion, as it was based on the idea that government officials who performed acts in opposition to the will of the people were not acting with full authority.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=112}}  After the resolution of the Stamp Act Crisis, Howe was made an officer of the provincial exchequer.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  Despite the Cape Fear River area being the epicenter of Stamp Act protests in North Carolina, Howe took no substantial part in the active confrontations with [[List of colonial governors of North Carolina|Governor]] [[William Tryon]], due in large part to their personal friendship and the patronage provided by the Governor for Howe's political ambitions.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=13, 14}}

During the [[French and Indian War]], Howe served alongside provincial soldiers from [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].  In 1766, he was commissioned as a [[captain (United States O-3)|captain]] of militia and was given command of [[Fort Johnston (North Carolina)|Fort Johnston]], located at the entrance of the Cape Fear River in present-day [[Southport, North Carolina]].  Howe served in this capacity between 1766 and 1767, and again between 1769 and 1773.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=14–16}}  Although satisfied with this position, Howe ultimately desired to obtain a commission in the regular British Army, which was traditionally a prerequisite for the commander of Fort Johnston.  Howe was never granted this commission, despite Tryon's support.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=722}}  In the 1768 session of the colonial assembly, Howe played a prominent role by introducing a bill to remedy a currency shortage in the colony.  His bill would have led to the acceptance of commodities as legal tender in the province, but it was not passed.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=165}}  The Regulator movement was in part based on the grievances farmers in the North Carolina backcountry had about back taxes and pressure from private creditors, both of which Howe's 1768 bill had attempted to address.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=161}}

Despite his efforts to reform the province's policies, Howe was made a colonel of artillery by Governor Tryon and served under the Governor against armed protesters in the [[Piedmont (United States)|piedmont]] during the [[War of the Regulation]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe was among the Governor's entourage when he confronted the Regulators in [[Hillsborough, North Carolina|Hillsborough]] in 1768, and in 1771, at the [[Battle of Alamance]], Howe served in a dual role as a commander of artillery and [[quartermaster general]].{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=15–16}}  In early 1773, when [[Josiah Quincy II]] visited North Carolina to foster cooperation between Southern activists and those in Boston, he investigated the causes of the War of the Regulation to which he had been sympathetic.  Howe served as Quincy's guide and with the assistance of Cornelius Harnett and [[William Hooper]] convinced Quincy that the Regulator movement had been unjustified and wrong to take up arms against Tryon.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=209}}  Quincy found Howe to be a "most happy compound of the man of sense, the sword, the Senate, and the buck&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;a favorite of the man of sense and the female world", continuing to say that "[Howe] has faults and vice – but alas who is without them."{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=18}}  More importantly, however, Quincy's visit with Howe, Hooper, and Harnett engendered a desire among those present to open up inter-colonial lines of communication in order to coordinate responses to future impositions by the British government.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=7}}

Howe's private fortunes were never stable, and between 1766 and 1775, he was forced to mortgage land and sell slaves to generate funds.  In 1770, Howe was able to purchase Kendal Plantation on the Cape Fear River, a {{convert|400|acre|ha sqmi|lk=off|adj=on}} rice plantation, but in 1775, he mortgaged it for around ₤214.  While the causes of Howe's financial misfortunes are unknown, several contemporary critics held that the cause was Howe's need to keep up appearances among the ruling elite, while [[Josiah Martin]], Tryon's successor as Royal Governor, believed Howe's misfortunes were evidence of his potential for malfeasance with the public money.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=6–7}}  In particular, Martin believed that Howe was intentionally under-staffing Fort Johnston in order to pocket excess funds the colonial assembly had appropriated for the garrison there, which was a common form of embezzlement among previous commanders and other royal officials.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=725|ps=, expressing little doubt that Howe did engage in graft at Fort Johnston and that Tryon condoned it; but cf,{{harvnb|Lennon|1979|p=75}} noting that Howe actually added 25 soldiers to the garrison during his tenure.}}  Howe, as a legislator and public official, had a poor working relationship with Martin, and Martin deprived him of his appointed offices – the captaincy of Fort Johnston and his position with the provincial exchequer – shortly after the new governor's arrival.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=16}}  A legislative confrontation in 1770 over the Provincial Assembly's attempts to pass a law authorizing [[Attachment (law)|attachment]] of real property in North Carolina owned by persons living in England placed Howe in direct confrontation with Martin, who preferred a requirement that colonial subjects seek relief from courts in England rather than in North Carolina.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=16–17}}  Martin believed that Howe's virulent opposition to the new governor's policies was driven by Howe's anger at being deprived of his valuable appointed positions.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=726}}

==Revolutionary political and militia service==
In December 1773, the North Carolina colonial assembly created a [[committee of correspondence]], to which Howe, as well as [[Richard Caswell]], [[John Harvey (North Carolina politician)|John Harvey]], [[John Ashe (general)|John Ashe]], [[Joseph Hewes]], and [[Samuel Johnston]] were appointed.  That committee was tasked with corresponding with other colonies to coordinate plans of resistance to British attempts to tax or otherwise burden the colonists.{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|pp=257–258}}  Beginning in 1774, Howe was a member of the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and Brunswick County [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]], and in August of that year, served as a member of a committee that organized the collection of corn, flour, and pork to be sent to Boston.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  At the time, the [[Port of Boston]] had been closed by one of the [[Intolerable Acts]], specifically the [[Boston Port Act]], which was in reaction to the [[Boston Tea Party]] and other protests against the [[Tea Act]].{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|pp=258–259}}

When the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#First Provincial Congress|First Provincial Congress]] convened on August 25, 1774, Howe served as a member of that body representing Brunswick County. The First Provincial Congress quickly passed a bill banning the exportation of all pitch, tobacco, tar, and other trade goods to England and banned the importation of British tea into North Carolina.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=24}}  Also in 1774, Howe penned several documents expressing what would become known as [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] or "whig" sympathies, including an address demanding reforms from Royal Governor Josiah Martin.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  On April 7, 1775, Howe delivered an address to the colonial assembly formally rebuffing Governor Martin's demands that the extra-legal [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Second Provincial Congress|Second Provincial Congress]] be dissolved.  Howe's response as adopted by the assembly led to Martin proroguing the colonial legislative body.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=6–7}} In 1775, when Howe received news of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War, he began to drill the local militia, using the unusual combination of drums and fiddles as opposed to the standard [[Ancient Fife and Drum Corps|fifes and drums]].{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=11}}

On July 15, 1775, Howe led 500 militiamen from [[Brunswick Town, North Carolina|Brunswick Town]] on a raid on the governor's mansion with the intent of kidnapping Governor Martin.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  The plot failed when Martin made an early-morning escape from Fort Johnston, fleeing to {{HMS|Cruizer|1752|6}}{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=270}} on July 19.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe ordered the militia to put the fort's structures to the torch, starting with the home of its commanding officer and Howe's successor, Captain John Collet, who had previously been accused of corruption by the Committee of Safety.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|pp=14–15}}  After fleeing, Martin made a proclamation on August 8, 1775, that attributed the growing unrest in North Carolina to what he termed "'the basest and most scandalous Seditious and inflammatory falsehoods'" propagated by the Committee of Safety in Wilmington.{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=271}}

Howe once again represented Brunswick County in the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Third Provincial Congress|Third Provincial Congress]] in Hillsborough beginning on August 20, 1775, and was appointed to the committee charged with developing a test oath for members of the legislative body. The oath declared allegiance to the King of England but denied the power of Parliament to tax to American colonies.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=27–28}} During the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Fourth Provincial Congress|Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress]] in 1776, Howe was noted to have proclaimed that "'Independence seems to be the word.  I know not one of the dissenting voice.'"{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=280}}

On September 1, 1775, the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Third Provincial Congress|Third North Carolina Provincial Congress]] appointed Howe to lead the newly created [[Second North Carolina Regiment]] of the [[Continental Army]] as its colonel.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|pp=16–17}}  Initially, Howe headquartered his command in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] during the fall of 1775 and was charged by the Provincial Congress with protecting the northern half of North Carolina up to the border with Virginia.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=28–29}}  At the time, British forces under the command of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], the last [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Royal Governor]] of the Colony of Virginia, were ravaging the [[tidewater region]] of Virginia.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=29}}  Howe, of his own initiative, brought his North Carolina troops into Virginia, arriving shortly after the [[Battle of Great Bridge]].{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=24}}  Howe then directed the occupation of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which had recently been abandoned by Loyalist forces, and assumed command of the various North Carolina and Virginia units there.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  The region around Norfolk was being occupied by Loyalist militia units under Dunmore's command.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}

Howe, as senior officer chosen over the more junior [[William Woodford]] of Virginia,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} engaged in contentious negotiations over access to supplies with the captains of British ships anchored off Norfolk, which were by that time overcrowded with Loyalist refugees.  The situation deteriorated, and [[Burning of Norfolk|Norfolk was burned]] on January 1, 1776, in an action started by British marines and a bombardment by [[Royal Navy]] vessels and completed by Patriot forces.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|pp=25–26}}  The fire raged on for two more days, and Howe ordered most of the buildings that remained standing to be razed before he withdrew, to further render the location useless to the British.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=26}}  During Howe's time in command at Norfolk, Woodford described the North Carolinian as a "brave, prudent &amp; spirited commander".{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  On December 22, 1775, Howe was formally thanked by the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]], and on April 27, 1776, he received the same honor from the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}

===Charleston, 1776–1777===
In March 1776, Howe was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General by the [[Continental Congress#Second Continental Congress|Second Continental Congress]] along with fellow North Carolinian [[James Moore (Continental Army officer)|James Moore]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe and Moore were two of five North Carolinians to be given a general's commission in the Continental Army.{{sfn|Clark|1906|p=196}}  Initially, Howe was given command of all Continental forces in Virginia,{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=38}} but soon both he and Moore were ordered to South Carolina.  Howe arrived first as the presence of the [[British Army]] and Royal Navy under the command of General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] at the mouth of the Cape Fear River delayed Moore's descent.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  When Clinton arrived off the coast of North Carolina, he issued a proclamation offering a pardon to anyone who had taken up arms against the crown with the explicit exception of Howe and fellow revolutionary Cornelius Harnett,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} then serving as president of the North Carolina Provincial Council, the executive body in the revolutionary state.{{sfn|Whitaker|1908|pp=1–2}}  Howe's plantation, Kendal, was sacked by the British during their maneuvers around Wilmington.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=41}}

Upon arriving in Charleston, Howe acted as an [[adjutant]] to Major General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], who had been appointed Commander of the [[Departments of the Continental Army#Southern Department|Southern Department]] of the Continental Army.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=72}}  Howe directly commanded the [[South Carolina]] militia during the [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|First Siege of Charleston]] in June 1776{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} and was assigned command over the defenses of the city proper.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=43}}  Lee was recalled to the North to assist General [[George Washington]], and in his absence, James Moore was appointed Commander of the Southern Department.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe was left in command of Charleston and [[Savannah, Georgia]] in Lee's absence, and in September 1776, he became embroiled in a controversy involving the provincial assembly of South Carolina allowing its officers to recruit soldiers from North Carolina's continental line units.  Howe pleaded with the Provincial Congress of North Carolina to allow South Carolina to recruit within the former state's borders because of the greater number of white males in that state.  Eventually, North Carolina acceded to that request but only after ordering Howe to reclaim the North Carolinians who had already been lured away by the South Carolinians. The South Carolina Council took offense and demanded that Howe pay the recruitment bonuses for the men if he wished to have them back.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=80}}  With James Moore's death on April 15, 1777, Howe assumed command of the Southern Department.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=51}}

===Florida and political conflict 1777–1778===
Howe's style of command was quick to cause discontent, and on August 20, 1777, the South Carolina Assembly protested against Howe's right to command soldiers within the borders of South Carolina.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218–219}}  He was nonetheless promoted to the rank of [[major general]] on October 20, 1777,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} the only North Carolinian to reach that rank in the Continental Army.{{sfn|Clark|1906|p=196}}  Howe often deferred to the civil leadership of the various states that made up his command, often referring conflicts with state officials to the Continental Congress to resolve.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=54}}  Of particular note was an early conflict with Georgia's state government, which insisted that the governor of that state retain command of the state's militia during military engagements.  When asked for an official opinion, Congress sided with Howe, who believed that command of the militia should be relinquished to him during such engagements.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=56}}  Complicating matters, however, was the fact that Congressional funding for military expenditures was given over to the states rather than the army officers, forcing Howe to rely on state governments for funding.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=40}}

In 1778, he was ordered to act on a plan developed by General Charles Lee to assault [[British West Florida]] – a plan that Howe disfavored.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  A previous expedition in 1777, in which Howe did not directly participate, had ended quickly in failure.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=62}}  Congress overrode Howe's concerns about the expedition and directed him to proceed in conjunction with Georgia's militia into Florida.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=68}}  The combined Army's progress into Florida was made slow by a lack of provisions and particularly by a lack of slaves who Howe requested be made available to build roads and perform [[Pioneer (military)|pioneering]] functions for the march southward.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=75}}

On June 29, 1778, Howe captured [[Fort Tonyn]] on the [[St. Marys River (Florida–Georgia)|St. Marys River]], which forms a portion of the border between Georgia and Florida.  Georgia Governor [[John Houstoun]] refused to give up command of his militia to the Continental Army general and declined to participate in Howe's council.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=79–80, 83}}  To make matters worse, when South Carolina militia units arrived in Georgia under the command of Colonel Andrew Williamson, their commander also refused to allow Howe to command that state's militia units.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=80}}  Shortly after this minor incursion, the British received reinforcements and pressed toward Savannah.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  By July 14, 1778, Howe was forced to pull his units back north and returned to Charleston.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=83}}  The general received much of the blame for the expedition's failure, as Georgia officials were quick to cast aspersions on the Continental command, which was compounded by Congress' failure to understand Howe's inability to control the Georgia militia despite their prior determination of his command authority over militia units.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=87}}
[[File:Portrait of Christopher Gadsden.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white portrait of Christopher Gadsden, standing in civilian dress with a cane|Christopher Gadsden, with whom Howe dueled in 1778, depicted in a prewar painting by [[Jeremiah Theus]]]]

===Duel with Christopher Gadsden, 1778===
Howe's squabbles with local political and militia leaders were not his sole difficulties.  On August 30, 1778, Howe engaged in a [[Duelling pistol|pistol]] [[duel]] with [[Christopher Gadsden]] of South Carolina over an offense Gadsden perceived stemming from his resignation in 1777 while under Howe's command.  This controversy, like many in which Howe was involved, centered on the conflict between the Continental Army and state governments' desires to retain local control over their officers and soldiers.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=9–10}}  Gadsden responded to the perceived offense by drafting and circulating a letter attacking Howe's intelligence and ability as a commander and questioning Howe's legal authority to issue orders to South Carolina Continentals.  Howe took offense and demanded satisfaction from Gadsden on August 17, 1778.{{sfn|Godbold, Jr.|Woody|1982|pp=184–185}}

During the duel, [[Colonel Charles Pinckney]], father of South Carolina Governor [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]], served as Howe's [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|second]], while Colonel Barnard Elliot served as second to Gadsden.{{sfn|Godbold, Jr.|Woody|1982|p=186}}  Howe, shooting first, missed his shot at eight paces,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218–219}} although the [[Musket ball#Ammunition|ball]] grazed Gadsden's ear.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  Gadsden then intentionally fired above his own left shoulder and demanded Howe fire again, a demand Howe refused.{{sfn|Godbold, Jr.|Woody|1982|p=186}}  At the conclusion of the duel, the participants made amends and parted ways.  The affair did not end privately, as the ''South Carolinian and American Gazette'' published a full story covering the duel on September 3, 1778, and in the same month, the ill-fated Major [[John André]], the British officer who would later serve as a facilitator for Benedict Arnold's change of allegiance, published an 18-stanza satirical poem about the duel set to the tune of [[Yankee Doodle]].{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=10–12}}

===Removal from command and the Battle of Savannah, 1778===
[[File:SavannahCapture1778.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A map published in 1891 depicting the Battle of Savannah|An 1891 copy of a 1778 map depicting the First Battle of Savannah]]
After allegations circulated in South Carolina about Howe's dalliances with a woman, the Continental Congress finally removed him from command of the Southern Department on September 25, 1778, replacing him with Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218–219}}  Howe remained with the Southern army and commanded it from Savannah.  While awaiting Lincoln's arrival in Savannah with reinforcements, Howe set up defenses around that city, preparing for an imminent attack.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Governor Houstoun sparred again with Howe, refusing to grant him more than meager militia support.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}

During the [[Capture of Savannah|First Battle of Savannah]] on December 29, 1778, the British landed near the city, and under the command of [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]], managed to flank Howe's army, which was drawn up in the open for battle, by taking a path through a marshy area Howe believed was impassable.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=191}}  Howe had previously ordered a scout to look for any paths through the swamp, but Campbell's route, which was shown to the British commander by a slave, remained unknown to the Patriots.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=96}}  Howe's position was otherwise strong and defensible, but the appearance of the British in the Patriot rear caused a panic.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=95–96}}  The militia under Howe's command fled instantly, and more than 500 Patriots and Continental Army soldiers were killed or captured.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=191}}  The ensuing defeat gave Savannah to the British, for which Howe received much blame.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  On January 3, 1779, Howe formally relinquished his command to Lincoln.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=100}}

Howe's failure at Savannah led to criticism from Georgia state officials, who believed he had abandoned the state to the British, as well as from fellow Continental Army generals, such as [[William Moultrie]], who criticized Howe for even attempting to resist the British while being so greatly outnumbered.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=98}}  During his testimony before a later court–martial, Howe claimed that he knew about the pathway through the swamp taken by the British, but stated that he did not defend it because he believed the chance of an attack along the path was "so remote".{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=736}}  This contradicted earlier testimony from Georgia militia officer [[George Walton]], who stated that Howe did not know about the path prior to the battle and that Howe told Walton that he was mistaken in believing a path through the swamps existed.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|pp=735–736}}

===Hudson Valley and Connecticut, 1779===
[[File:The unfortunate death of Major Andre, 10-02-1780 - 10-02-1780 - NARA - 535744.tif|thumb|right|alt=A depiction of the military execution of John Andre, who is blindfolded and hanging from a gallows|The execution of John André after Howe and other senior officers found him guilty of espionage]]
After Lincoln's arrival, Howe was ordered to join the Continental Army in the North, which he rejoined on May 19, 1779.  Suffering from injuries caused by a fall, Howe was unable to undertake any duties for a month after his arrival.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  Initially, Howe was charged with defending [[Connecticut]] from British raids, such as those conducted by his former mentor, William Tryon, and Tryon's adjutant, [[Edmund Fanning (colonial administrator)|Edmund Fanning]].  Howe's headquarters were in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=103}}

On June 18, 1779, shortly after the [[Battle of Stony Point]], Howe was ordered to assist General [[Israel Putnam]] in assaulting a British fortification at Verplanck's Point, which sat across the [[Hudson River]] from Stony Point.  Howe was charged with commanding the artillery barrage and infantry assault of that position, but was given too few field pieces, entrenching tools, provisions, and little ammunition to make a serious attempt at taking the fortification. He advised Washington that an assault would be unfeasible and called off the siege with Washington's consent.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}} Historians have noted that Howe's inability to take the British fortifications damaged his career and that he was never again given a major command.{{sfn|Babits|Howard|2004|p=112}}  Contemporaries such as General [[William Irvine (general)|William Irvine]] criticized Howe as "having a ''talent''&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;of finding many supposed obstructions, and barely plausible pretences for his delay" in assaulting Verplanck's Point.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=174}}

After Stony Point, Howe was assigned first to the command of the left wing of Washington's army composed of Massachusetts brigades under Generals [[John Nixon (military)|John Nixon]] and [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]], with his command again in Ridgefield, Connecticut.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=105–106}}  While military action was infrequent in Howe's region of control, he was integral in the recruitment and cultivation of a substantial spy network which provided the Patriots with information about British positions on [[Manhattan]] and along the [[Long Island Sound]].{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=106}}

===West Point and Benedict Arnold conspiracy, 1779–1780===
As part of his command duties, Howe was chosen by Washington as president of the court–martial convened to determine the propriety of General Benedict Arnold's conduct while serving as the commandant of Philadelphia in 1778 and 1779.  During that time, Arnold was alleged to have conducted business with British merchants and to have undertaken private business transactions that were inappropriate given his position, among other improprieties.  The tribunal, which met at Howe's headquarters in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], adjourned for several months due to a threatened British attack but reconvened in December 1779 and closed in January 1780.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=112–113}}  During the interlude in the fall of 1779, Howe was ordered by Washington to move into position to attack the British in conjunction with an expected combined French naval and land-based assault, although the French assault in New York never materialized.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=109}}  The court-martial rendered its decision on January 26, 1780, finding Arnold guilty of breaching the articles of war by permitting a vessel from an enemy port into Philadelphia and recommended that he be reprimanded by Washington.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=114}}

Howe was made commandant of the Continental Army [[Fort Clinton (West Point)|fortifications at West Point]] on February 21, 1780.  He held that command immediately prior to Benedict Arnold's conspiracy to turn over control of that stronghold to the British.  Arnold and several supporters in Congress had eventually convinced Washington to give him command of the fortifications on August 3, 1780.  Howe remained active in the [[Departments of the Continental Army#Highlands Department|upper Hudson River valley]] during the remainder of the war, particularly in overseeing his network of spies in the area, including double agent Joshua Hett Smith, who would later play a key role in Arnold's treason and prosecution.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=128–129}}  During this time, evidence arose implicating Howe in discussions with the British, though the evidence was dismissed by Washington as merely rumors stirred up by British General Henry Clinton.  Howe served on the [[John André#Trial and execution|court-martial board]] that convicted of espionage and sentenced to death Major John André, the British officer tasked with facilitating Arnold's conspiracy.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=129}}

===Pennsylvania mutinies and war's end, 1781–1783===
In 1781, Howe assisted in putting down the [[Pompton Mutiny]] in New Jersey, which was inspired by the slightly earlier [[Pennsylvania Line Mutiny]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  Washington ordered Howe to surround the camp and arrange for the court-martial and execution of two of its ringleaders.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  In the fall of 1781, Howe requested permission to go with Washington to Virginia for what was anticipated to be the final campaign against the British, but Washington refused.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=139}}  Instead, Howe was required to appear before a court–martial in Philadelphia which was opened to inquire into Howe's actions in the defense of Savannah in 1778.  The tribunal, led by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], opened on December 7, 1781, and closed on January 23, 1782,{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=140–141}} acquitting Howe of any wrongdoing at Savannah with "the Highest Honor".{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=498}}  Assistant Adjutant General John Carlisle ordered Howe to convene a court–martial to investigate the conduct of General [[Alexander McDougall]] in the spring of 1782.  McDougall was a personal friend of Howe's, but the tribunal convicted him of the minor offense of releasing confidential details from a council of war meeting in 1776 to persons who were not permitted to have such information.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=142}}  Again in 1783, Howe was called on to put down the [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]], which had caused the Continental Congress to flee Philadelphia.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}

==Post-war career and death==
After putting down the second Pennsylvania mutiny in 1783, Howe participated in the establishment of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and was the second officer to sign the national charter, with his signature appearing directly below that of von Steuben.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=149}}  Howe thereafter returned to his North Carolina plantation, Kendal, which was upriver from the more famous [[Orton Plantation]] owned by Howe's distant relatives.  Also in 1783, Howe became a founding member of the North Carolina Society of the Cincinnati and was a signatory to its "Institution" or charter.{{sfn|Davis|Bellas|1896|p=81}}  During much of 1783 and 1784, Howe returned frequently to Philadelphia, New York, and other cities in the northeast in an attempt to settle accounts and obtain back payments he claimed he was owed by Congress.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=150}}  He was again forced to mortgage his plantation but eventually received a monetary settlement from Congress of $7,000 in 1785.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=151}}

During 1785, Howe was appointed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] to establish treaties with several western [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=498}} but did not actually travel with commissioners [[George Rogers Clark]], [[Richard Butler (general)|Richard Butler]], and [[Samuel Holden Parsons]], who finalized the [[Treaty of Fort Finney]] without Howe in 1786.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=151–152}}  Howe assisted [[Benjamin Smith (North Carolina)|Benjamin Smith]] in planning for the construction of [[Bald Head Light]] and actively worked to assist former Loyalists who sought to return to their prior lives in North Carolina by defending them against the judiciary of the state.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=152–153}}

In the summer of 1786, he was elected a member of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives|North Carolina House of Commons]].{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=153}}  On his way to a meeting of the legislative body, Howe fell ill, and died on December 14, 1786, in Bladen County.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218–219}}&lt;ref name="Marker" /&gt;{{sfn|Ashe|1892|pp=415–416|ps=, citing an otherwise unsupported claim that he died in November 1785}}  Howe's remains were buried on property he owned in what later became [[Columbus County, North Carolina]], although the exact location of his burial has not been discovered.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=153}}  A [[cenotaph]] was placed in Southport's Old Smithville Burying Ground honoring him and wife Sara.&lt;ref name="Southport"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Old Smithville Burying Ground: A Place of Rest and History|author=Milanese, Jennifer|url=http://southporttimes.com/featured/2007093001.html|newspaper=The Southport Times|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Howe has been remembered primarily in a negative light based on his lack of military successes and reputation, although North Carolina historian Hugh Rankin noted in a biographical sketch that "his opportunities came at times when he did not have proper field strength to gain favorable recognition."{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  During the 1903 session of the [[United States House of Representatives]], Congressman [[John Dillard Bellamy]] introduced a bill to erect an equestrian statue of Howe in Wilmington in order to commemorate the general's service; this bill was not passed.&lt;ref name="Star News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Revolutionary hero born in Brunswick County|author=|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19780702&amp;id=NtROAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KxMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7155,464678|newspaper=Wilmington Star–News|date=July 2, 1978|accessdate=March 10, 2013}} Note that the article incorrectly cites the date as 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=1–2|ps=, note the correct date of 1903}}  In 1940, the State of North Carolina cast and erected a highway [[historical marker]] to commemorate Howe's service. The marker stands on [[North Carolina Highway 133]] in [[Belville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Marker" /&gt;  The 1955 film ''[[The Scarlet Coat]]'' featured a performance by actor [[John McIntire]] as Howe during the height of the Benedict Arnold conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Scarlet Coat"&gt;{{cite news|title='Scarlet Coat': Story of the American Revolution Opens|author=H.

===Evidence of attempted treason===
Several scholars have raised questions regarding Howe's actions as the unofficial spymaster of the Hudson Valley, all of which center on evidence that suggests Howe attempted to bargain with the British in exchange for a commission as an officer in the regular British Army, similar to the bargain struck by Benedict Arnold in 1780.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|pp=740–741}}  As early as 1776, after Howe was appointed a brigadier general, a Loyalist merchant named Henry Kelly advised [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville]] that Howe could be easily tempted to join the British, and further claimed that Howe could offer a great deal to the British in their war effort.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|pp=727–728}}

In 1780, after Benedict Arnold's attempted treason had been exposed, Captain Beesly Edgar Joel, a British defector and former officer in the British Army,{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|pp=738–739}} claimed that another officer besides Arnold had attempted to defect, and after interrogation Joel named Howe as that officer.  Joel cited Edmund Fanning, William Tryon's secretary, as the source for his information.  Joel further described Howe's method of communicating with the British, which was by means of a frequently imprisoned-and-exchanged prisoner who would convey messages between the parties.  While neither Washington or the Congressional [[Board of War]] believed Joel's story due to their suspicion of Joel as a British spy, Joel was later commissioned by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the Virginia government to lead a Patriot militia unit against Loyalists in that state.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=740}}  Furthermore, [[William Smith (chief justice)|William Smith]], a New York Loyalist and the brother of Howe's agent and Arnold's co-conspirator Joshua Hett Smith, noted in his diary on April 29, 1780, that his brother, Thomas Smith, had been informed that a commissary had come over to the British with "information" from the Patriots in much the same manner as Joel had described. On September 28, 1780, William Smith told Henry Clinton that he believed "Bob" Howe would be willing to turn on the Patriots.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=741}}

Later historians, including [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], have frequently dismissed allegations that Howe attempted to defect, believing them to have been fabrications used by Joel to ingratiate himself with the Patriot government.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|pp=740–741}}  The only full-length book treatment of Howe's life discusses the allegations of attempted treason in a single page.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=129}}  On the other hand, Freeman's judgment was based primarily on Washington's assessment of the allegations, but Washington did not have access to the potentially corroborating evidence in William Smith's diary.  Another possibility is that Howe had merely attempted to spread word among the British of his possible treason in order to conceal his management of the vast spy network at his control; this tactic was utilized by other spymasters in Continental employ such as [[Philip Schuyler]].{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=741}}  Philip Ranlet, an American historian who studied Howe's career and motivations, has contrasted Schuyler's otherwise shining reputation with Howe's record of failures and draws the conclusion that Howe likely was attempting to defect.  To date, no firm evidence exists which either absolves Howe or proves him guilty of attempted treason.{{sfn|Ranlet|1991|p=742}}

[[File:Rollin White patent.jpg|thumb|Rollin White patent, Apr. 3, 1855]] 
'''Rollin White''' (June 6, 1817 – March 22, 1892) was an American gunsmith who invented a bored-through revolver cylinder that allowed [[cartridge (firearms)|metallic cartridges]] to be loaded from the rear of a revolver's cylinder.

==Early life==
White was born in [[Williamstown, Vermont]] in 1818. He learned gunsmithing from his older brother, J. D. White in 1837 and would later claim that the idea for a "rear-loading" [[Pepper-box]] revolver came to him while working in his brother's shop in 1839. In 1849 he went to work for [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company]] as a gunsmith under contract, turning revolver barrels on a lathe. During this time he procured two "junk" or scrapped revolver cylinders from Colt and placed them in his barrel lathe, cutting the front off one and the rear off the other. He assembled these parts into a single bored-through cylinder that would fit in a Colt revolver.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite book|title= Circuit court of the United States,Massachusetts district: In equity.

Curtis, Caustin Browne |first=Ethan |last=Allen| authorlink=Ethan Allen (armsmaker)|chapter= Deposition of Rollin White|pages=187–193|year=1863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until that time, revolvers were [[black powder|black-powder]] [[Caplock mechanism|percussion arms]]. The shooter had to pour powder into each of the six cylinder mouths, push a [[bullet]] over the powder, and load a [[percussion cap]] on the rear of the cylinder, making the reloading process cumbersome.

While the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] [[revolver]] was known in Europe, Rollin White's famous [[patent]] combined a cylinder and a [[box magazine]]. It was a completely unworkable design which never went into production (only one sample was built which malfunctioned dramatically),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Percussion Firearms|first=Lewis |last=Winant |authorlink=Lewis Winant |year=1959 |publisher=Herbert Jenkins Ltd |location=Great Britain |isbn=0-600-33015-X |pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was the first US patent to include a cylinder bored through so that a revolver could be loaded from the breech. White's original solution for the misfires that plagued early revolvers was to plug the rear of the chambers with pieces of leather. The patent drawings imply that a percussion cap would have had to be applied to the single nipple for each shot, so it would have been far slower than the existing cap-&amp;-ball revolvers.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

For the next three years, White worked on his idea while working at [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's]], during which Colt granted White a contract to manufacture the lockwork of revolvers.&lt;ref name="Boorman"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Boorman | first=Dean K. | title=Guns of the Old West: An Illustrated History| year=2004 | publisher=Lyons Press | isbn=978-1-59228-638-6 | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; White was granted a patent in 1855: "Improvement in Repeating Fire-arms".&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=12648 |title=Improvement in repeating fire-arms |pubdate=1855-04-03 |inventor=Rollin White |status=patent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Remington army and navy revolvers, 1861–1888 |first= Donald L.|last= Ware |publisher= UNM Press|year= 2007 |ISBN = 978-0-8263-4280-5 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, White signed an agreement granting Smith &amp; Wesson the exclusive use of his patent, at a royalty rate of 25 cents for every revolver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smith &amp; Wesson Images of America |first= Roy G.|last= Jinks|author2=Sandra C. Krein  |page=8|publisher= Arcadia Publishing|year= 2006 |isbn = 978-0-7385-4510-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1|Model 1 revolver]] came on the market, White began production of a revolver of his own in 1861 in a factory in Lowell, Massachusetts called "Rollin White Arms Company". Approximately 4300 revolvers were made under Rollin White Arms, most of which were sold to Smith &amp; Wesson to keep up with demand. White liquidated the company in 1864 and the assets were bought by Lowell Arms Company, which began manufacturing revolvers directly infringing on White's patent. White sued them, but not until after they had made 7500 revolvers.&lt;ref name="Flayderman2001"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Flayderman | first=Norm | title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms&amp;nbsp;... and their values | year=2001 | publisher=Krause Publications | location=Iola, WI | isbn=0-87349-313-3 | page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White and S&amp;W brought infringement cases against Manhattan Firearms Company, [[Ethan Allen (armsmaker)|Allen &amp; Wheelock]], [[Merwin Hulbert|Merwin &amp; Bray]], [[National Arms Company]] and others. The courts mostly sided with White, but allowed these manufacturers to continue production runs, with a royalty paid to White. In some cases, Smith &amp; Wesson bought the guns back to remark and sell; such guns are marked "APRIL 3 1855" as a patent date.&lt;ref&gt;Walter (2006)p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the matter was litigated as ''White, et al. v. Allen'' in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts; Allen acknowledged his gun infringed on the patent, but challenged the patent itself. The court sided with White.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHITE ET AL. V. ALLEN. |year=1863 |url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F.Cas/0029.f.cas/0029.f.cas.0969.2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 White offered to sell the patent to Colt's for $1 million, which Colt's declined.

===Rollin White Relief Act===
After being denied a patent extension, White lobbied Congress for relief in 1870, urging Congress to consider that he had not been fairly compensated for his invention; he made only $71,000, while Smith &amp; Wesson earned over $1 million for his idea.  Furthermore, White pointed out that the bulk of his earnings was spent on litigation as others infringed on his idea.&lt;ref&gt;Satterlee (1940) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed a bill granting White a rehearing.  The act was styled: ''An act for the relief of Rollin White'' (S.273).

The bill passed both houses of congress with no debate, but was vetoed by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], citing objections from Chief of Ordnance [[Alexander Brydie Dyer]].&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book|title =A compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents, prepared under the Joint Committee on Printing of the House and Senate, pursuant to an act of the Fifty-second Congress of the United States (with additions and encyclopedic index by private enterprise)|volume =9 |work= [[A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents, Prepared Under the Joint Committee on Printing of the House and Senate, Pursuant to an Act of the Fifty-second Congress of the United States]]|first=US|last=Grant|authorlink=Ulysses S Grant|editor= [[James Daniel Richardson]] |publisher =Bureau of National Literature|year= 1897 |pages=4034–4035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyer claimed that White's patent litigation during the [[American Civil War]] served as "an inconvenience and embarrassment" to Union forces for the "inability of manufacturers to use this patent". Dyer went on to write that "its further extension will operate prejudicially to its interests by compelling it to pay to parties already well paid a large royalty for altering its revolvers to use metallic cartridges."&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; No further votes were held and the bill died. Rollin White continued his efforts with Congress, and by 1877 he finally gave up any possibility of extension.

==Other works==
White invented the knife-edge breech block and self-cocking device for the "box-lock" Model 1851 [[Sharps rifle]].  These rifles were built by White, [[Christian Sharps]], and Richard Lawrence at Robbins &amp; Laurence in [[Windsor, Vermont]].  White later designed a self-cocking mechanism for the 1855 pattern Sharps and built 50 of these rifles for a potential US Navy contract, but the Navy only purchased 12 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=437–438|title= Rifles of the World|first= John |last=Walter |edition =3|publisher= Krause Publications|year= 2007 |ISBN =978-0-89689-241-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollin White died in Lowell, Massachusetts on March 22, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American gun makers |page=95|first= Leroy De Forest |last=Satterlee|author2=Arcadi Gluckman  |publisher=O. Ulbrich|year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Pharmutius''', according to the ''[[Prologue from Ohrid]]'', was the spiritual mentor of [[Venerable John the Hermit]] of [[Armenia]] circa the fourth century. Pharmutius' holiness was such that [[angel]]s brought him his daily bread, which in [[Eastern Christianity|Christian]] love he shared with his [[hermit]] brother John who lived in strict seclusion.

Saint Pharmutius is remembered along with John the Hermit by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on 29 March.

'''Sena and Guttika''' were two [[Tamils|Tamil]] chiefs from [[South India]] who invaded the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|kingdom of Anuradhapura]] and killed [[Suratissa of Anuradhapura|King Suratissa]]. They reigned from 237 BC to 215 BC. They were originally two traders who came to Sri Lanka to sell horses; however, they killed Surathissa, the king of Anuradhapura, and ruled the kingdom for 22 years. [[Asela of Anuradhapura|King Asela]] defeated them and re-established the kingdom as a [[Sinhalese monarchy]].

'''Sharon Helga Corr''' [[MBE]] (born 24 March 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician and television personality. She is best known as a member of the pop-rock band [[The Corrs]], which she co-founded in 1990 with her elder brother [[Jim Corr|Jim]] and younger sisters [[Caroline Corr|Caroline]] and [[Andrea Corr|Andrea]]. She plays the violin, piano and guitar, and sings backing vocals. She began learning the violin when she was six years old. She has played in national youth orchestras and is qualified to teach the violin.

The Corr siblings were awarded honorary MBEs in 2005 by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in recognition of both their musical talent and their charitable work raising money for [[Freeman Hospital]] in Newcastle upon Tyne, victims of the [[Omagh Bombing]], and other charities.

In 2012, Corr was revealed as one of the coaches on the first series of the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] talent show ''[[The Voice of Ireland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/sharon-corr-to-judge-for-the-voice-2898083.html|title=Sharon Corr to judge for The Voice|work=Herald.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===2009–2012: ''Dream of You''===
In July 2009, Corr was voted into first place in the Ms Twitter UK competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tweeterwall.mallplace.com/ukwomen07072009|title=Ms Twitter UK Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2009, Corr appeared on ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', having been booked by host [[Phillip Schofield]] via Twitter, to confirm the release of a new solo single and album. Her début single, "[[It's Not a Dream]]", was released on 29 August in Ireland and 31 August in the UK, with appearances at Isle of Wight, Glastonbury, and a number of other European music festivals. The album, ''[[Dream of You (Sharon Corr album)|Dream of You]]'', was released on 13 September 2010 and comprises a number of self-penned tracks and select covers with Corr playing violin throughout. She was joined by longtime Corrs' sidemen [[Anthony Drennan|Anthony (Anto) Drennan]] on lead guitar, Keith Duffy on bass, and Jason Duffy on drums, with orchestral arrangements by Fiachra Trench, a collaborator on four Corrs' albums.

Corr embarked on the [[Dream of You Tour]] on 19 August 2011 in [[Aberdeen]] and continued through the UK and Europe, with an Australian leg added in January 2012. While on the tour she introduced a newly written track, "Edge of Nowhere", which will be included on her second album.

===2012–present: ''The Voice of Ireland'' and ''The Same Sun''===
Corr was a coach on the first and second series of the RTÉ talent show  ''[[The Voice of Ireland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/bressies-in-the-hotseat-in-search-for-the-voice-2919863.html|title=Bressie's in the hotseat in search for the Voice|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|last=Finn|first=Melanie|work=[[Evening Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the [[Maitland Mercury]] in February 2012, Corr revealed that she is piecing together her second solo record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/sharon-corr-lives-to-make-music/2433009.aspx?storypage=0|title=Sharon Corr lives to make music|date=26 February 2012|accessdate=15 March 2012|last=Milligan|first=Nick|work=[[Maitland Mercury]]}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corr finished writing the album in March 2012 and she said it may be called ''Catch the Moon''. The title comes from the idea "of when somebody comes into your life and they utterly change yours, that you would go to any lengths for them... so you would catch the moon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/woman/life/sharon-corr-rock-chick-and-yummy-mummy-16127159.html|title=Sharon Corr: Rock chick and yummy mummy|date=6 March 2012|accessdate=15 March 2012|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 21 August 2013 it was announced that the new album would be titled ''[[The Same Sun]]''. Corr will also embark on a world tour during the promoting time of the album. She will have tour in Germany, Brazil, and Indonesia as she had announced about it on the early of September 2013. She will perform in Indonesia at Jakarta Convention Center (JCC), [[Jakarta]], Indonesia, on 24 September 2013 (WIB) as a special guest. Rick Prize was also invited to be the special guest.

[[The Same Sun]] lead single called 'Take a Minute' has peaked No. 11 on Irish Chart, and No. 20 in France Chart. Meanwhile, Yovie Widianto was invited to play at "The Same Sun Tour" in Madrid, Spain, on November 2013 as a special guest. "It was great to have you last night!" tweeted Corr on the late of November. The tour will be continued to Los Angeles, and New York which had been scheduled to be held on January until February 2014.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Corr married [[Belfast]] [[barrister]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamsinternational.com/panellist/gavin-bonnar|title=Gavin Bonnar, LLB, BL|publisher=JAMS International|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305200331/http://www.jamsinternational.com/panellist/gavin-bonnar|archivedate=5 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gavin Bonnar in [[Cratloe Church]], [[County Clare]].&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/4981/sharon|title=Sharon Corr Judges ''The Voice''|first=Maureen|last=Coleman|date=28 May 2012|publisher=Culture Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a performance for [[BBC Radio 2]], she stated, before performing the song, that she walked up the aisle to "Along with the Girls", a traditional instrumental track that featured on The Corr's first album, ''[[Forgiven, Not Forgotten]]''. The couple met when she was shooting the [[music video|video]] for "[[Runaway (The Corrs song)|Runaway]]". They had their first child, son Cathal ("Cal") Robert Gerard, on 31 March 2006, and their second child, daughter Flori Jean Elizabeth, on 18 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecorrswebsite.com/news/july07/jul26.htm|title=The Corr's Main Frame|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024654/http://www.thecorrswebsite.com/news/july07/jul26.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having children, she battled with [[social anxiety disorder]] and wrote about her anxiety problems on her solo album.&lt;ref name="goss_ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goss.ie/2014/09/sharon-corr-reveals-battle-with-anxiety-i-needed-to-break-down-and-be-vulnerable/|title=Sharon Corr reveals battle with anxiety: 'I needed to break down and be vulnerable'|date=20 Sep 2014|publisher=goss.ie|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225552/http://www.goss.ie/2014/09/sharon-corr-reveals-battle-with-anxiety-i-needed-to-break-down-and-be-vulnerable/|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being raised in a devout Catholic environment, Sharon ceased attending Mass as a teenager due to events that took place during [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/sharon-corr-growing-up-as-a-child-of-troubles-has-left-me-with-no-religion-34371775.html|title=Sharon Corr: Growing up as a child of Troubles has left me with no religion|first=Linda|last=Stewart|date=18 January 2016|publisher=Belfast Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the proximity of [[Dundalk]], [[County Louth]], a town within the [[Border Region]], to the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|Irish–Northern Irish/United Kingdom border]], Corr considers herself to be Northern Irish.&lt;ref name="Coleman"/&gt;

==Other recordings==
As well as "[[No Frontiers]]" with Caroline Corr, Sharon sings "[[Dimming of the Day]]" and the demo version of "Goodbye". In 1999 she recorded violin parts for the [[Jean Michel Jarre]] track "Rendez-vous à Paris", which was released in 2000 on the album ''Metamorphoses''.

She also recorded two tracks in 2008 with the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] operatic singer [[Bryn Terfel]], and "Amarrado a Ti" with the Spanish singer [[Alex Ubago]] in 2009.

'''Sh. Shiv Narayan Agnihotri''' (श्री शिव नारायण अग्निहोत्री) was born at Sri Akbarpur U.P. on 20 December 1850 to Sh. Rameshwar Agnihotri and Smt. Mohan Kunwar. He had his basic education at Sri Akbarpur and for further education enrolled in the  Thompson Engineering College at [[Roorkee]] (Now IITRoorkee) in 1866. On 9 July 1871, he accepted Pandit Shiv Dayal singh as his personal guru. After completing his education he took up various jobs. In 1873 he moved to Lahore. He became an active member of [[Brahmo Samaj]] in 1875 and worked tirelessly for various reformist movements started by it. On 20 December 1882, he left his job and took Jeevan Vrat जीवन व्रत (life Vow). This day he acquired a new name Sh Satyanand Agnihotri. (श्री सत्यानंद अग्निहोत्री). 

His Life Vow     

'''सत्य शिव सुंदर हि मेरा, परम लक्ष्य होवे;'''

'''जग के उपकार हि में, जीवन यह जावे |'''  

English             

'''May beautiful Truth and Goodness, My Foremost aim represent;'''

'''And in the service of the world, May My life be Fully spent.''' 

He left Brahmo Samaj in 1887. He formed Dev Samaj in February 1887. Dev Samaj or Dev Dharam holds the following 
# Dev Dharma holds it to be its glory that it permits its beliefs to be revised if scientific method so demands it. No theistic religion, traditional or modern, makes this commitment to the scientific method. Therefore, Dev Dharma avoids conflicts between science and religion for it accepts with it that scientific verification is necessary for a belief to be true. This is the first offering that Dev Dharma makes to modern man in search of a religion which does not compromise his scientific make up 
# The second offering that Dev Dharma makes to modern man is that it offers him evolutionary vision in religious life. We owe this evolutionary vision to the patient and imaginative labours of thousands of physicists, chemists, biologists, psychologists, archaeologists and historians 
# The third offering of that Dev Dharma makes to religion is that it makes moral life central to it. It is not beliefs, however noble, that can save man. It is life achieved that makes a man religious which contributes to his moksha. Dev Dharma, therefore, does not lay exclusive emphasis on faith in some deity or avtar. It awakens man to the realisation that the first condition to be religious is to build moral life. 
# Dev-Dharma teaches the scientific truth that human soul is part of Nature. It is under the law of change, of growth and decay. It grows under certain conditions, just as our body grows under certain conditions. It decays under certain conditions as body decays under certain conditions. It gains in vitality and vigour when it develops altruistic motivations. It loses in vitality and health when it develops low-loves and low-hates which make it think and do harm to others. Spiritual knowledge is knowledge of the laws of the life and death of soul. It is clear from this account that it is wrong to identify Dev-Dharma with morality only. In spite of its insistence on developing altruistic motivation towards all relations as the meaning of morality, it enlightens the soul to see its origin, its nature, and the conditions of its life and death...No other religion in the world holds that we have moral duties towards the physical and the vegetable worlds because of our intimate, inseparable, and evolutionary relationship with them. 
# A man must go beyond morality to enter the world of spirituality. What is spirituality? First, it is knowledge of soul, its origin, nature and the laws of its change, growth and development and death. Science Grounded Religion offers scientific knowledge of soul. It is wrong to identify spiritual knowledge with the super-natural beliefs about soul, as it is foolish to identify knowledge of Physics with the animistic Aristotelian Physics. Soul is part of the natural world. To think of it as having its origin outside the evolutionary process in Nature is to deny the incontrovertible facts of evolution. Man has evolved from the life-forces in the animal kingdom. Human soul is life-force like life-forces in the animal kingdom. Its distinct name is in view of certain evolved powers it has, which are different from the life-forces of the animal world ... However, we do not become religious in life when we merely know the spiritual truths about soul. This knowledge must turn into spiritual wisdom. A man is religious if he thinks and acts in terms of the good of his soul, just as a man loves health when he thinks and acts in terms of good of his body. The Founder of Dev-Dharma makes this explicit. He says : "So long a man… possesses no true desire or deep longing : 1. to get true freedom from various kinds of low-loves of sensual pleasures, egotism, wealth, property, children etc., and their resultant low-hates, false faiths, perverted vision, falsehoods and various forms of other degrading evil deeds; 2. to obtain true purification from their evil effects ; 3. to evolve unselfish and higher or altruistic forces, for the service of others ; and 4. does not get true satsang (higher environment or society) and perform true sadhanas (devotional exercises) which may help him in the attainment of the above three things . (Experts from ' What Dev Dharm Can Offer You')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4881">'''Tele Vue Optics''' is a [[Chester (town), New York|Chester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]-based [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[optics]] [[corporation|company]] known primarily for its premium brand of speciality [[eyepiece]]s and [[apochromatic]] [[refractor telescope]]s. Founded in 1977 by Al Nagler, an optical engineer from [[The Bronx]] who designed simulators used in the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] program, the company originally made projection lenses for large projection-screen [[television]]s, but is well known in the astronomy community for its products.

Prior to October 1, 2006, Tele Vue's corporate headquarters has also served as the primary distribution point for [[Vixen (telescopes)|Vixen America]], a subsidiary of the Japan-based Vixen corporation, with the two companies building equipment that are compatible with each other, especially the Tele Vue refractor with Vixen's "sphinx" [[GoTo (telescopes)|"go-to" mount]].  Although the company is no longer the principal distributor, Vixen America still maintains its address at Tele Vue's New York location.

== Refractor telescopes ==
Tele Vue once manufactured a 5" refracting telescope named the MPT, the Multi-Purpose Telescope. It had a fast f/4 ratio, and had an adjustable diaphragm that ranged from f/4 to f/20. Only a small number were made, with the last being kept by Televue to use as a final optical quality control for all eyepieces they make. Recent examples of this telescope have sold for well into 5 figures.

Today, Tele Vue's apochromatic refractor telescopes, which have reduced [[chromatic aberration]], come in diameters ranging from 60mm (2.4 inches) to 127mm (5 inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harrington | first=Phil | title=Star Ware | edition=5th | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=2007 | page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The imaging system ("is" series) telescopes are designed primarily for [[astrophotography]].

== Eyepieces ==
Tele Vue sells [[Plossl]], Radian, Panoptic, Delos, Nagler, Ethos and Nagler [[Zoom lens|Zoom]] eyepieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harrington | first=Phil | title=Star Ware | edition=5th | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=2007 | page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They made their start with a variety of Plossl eyepieces for amateur astronomers. The introduction of the original Nagler 13mm Type 1 in 1982 with its wide field of view and an equally high price soon made their mark. Using different combinations of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] of different types of high index optical glasses, the eyepieces produce, respectively, a 50°, 60°,68°, 72°, 82°, 100° and 50° apparent field-of-view.  Tele Vue calls the 82° and 100° apparent field-of-view a "spacewalk" experience.  Wider apparent fields of view are helpful in viewing [[star clusters]], [[galaxies]] and [[nebulae]], especially large emission nebulae like the [[Orion Nebula]], but the real reason for wide fields of view is to allow the same true field of view as is found in a lower power, narrower FOV eyepiece.  This increases effective contrast and aids in visibility of certain details.  Additionally, Tele Vue eyepieces are well corrected for most aberrations, providing edge to edge pinpoint stars, and are well suited to use in popular "fast" telescopes. The most expensive Tele Vue eyepiece is the Ethos line, which consists of eight eyepieces known for excellent image quality and ultra-wide 100 degree fields, which can retail for from $500 to $800 or more. At the North East Astronomy Forum 2010, they revealed the Ethos SX, a 3.7mm focal length [[eyepiece]] with an even greater 110° apparent field-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;Cloudy Nights Telescope Reviews, NEAF Part 1 by Tom Trusock, http://www.cloudynights.com/item.php?item_id=2423&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a new line of eyepieces was introduced called the Delos. These eyepieces are based on the Ethos but have a smaller field of view of 72°. Instead, they boast a comfortable 20mm eye relief. Some Tele Vue eyepieces are over half a foot long and weigh over two pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Televue NP101is and Eyepiece Review, http://www.astrokev.com/2010/11/21/lets-talk-televue/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mounts ==
Tele Vue sells several alt-azimuth mounts and tripods.&lt;ref&gt;Tele Vue Optics website, Mounts, http://www.televue.com/engine/page.asp?ID=336&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accessories ==
Tele Vue also manufactures special [[nebula]] [[filter (optics)|filters]], barlow lenses, special image amplifiers known as Powermates, the "Paracorr" coma-corrector for "fast" (f/5 and below) [[Newtonian telescope]]s, and the "Dioptrx," a special lens that fits over most Tele Vue eyepieces to correct eyesight [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]].

'''V. M. Varga''' is a fictional character in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]''. He is the main antagonist of the [[Fargo (season 3)|third season]] and is portrayed by [[David Thewlis]].

==Character overview==
Varga is a cunning and [[verbosity|verbose]] criminal mastermind who presides over a massive [[money laundering]] scheme. He is the implied boss of the criminal organization Narwhal, which employs his henchmen Yuri Gurka ([[Goran Bogdan]]), Meemo ([[Andy Yu]]) and Golem ([[DJ Qualls]]), who carry out murders and confidence tricks. Varga is of apparent English origin and suffers from [[bulimia nervosa]], which leads to his teeth deteriorating. On the character's eating disorder, Thewlis has said, "The idea is bulimia in his life. He’s a man who is so ultimately in control of seemingly everything, and it’s therefore an expression of the one part of his existence that he’s not in control of, something that at times he loses control of… vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kimberly|last=Potts|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fargo-postmortem-david-thewlis-explains-vargas-eating-issue-031308353.html|title=‘Fargo’ Postmortem: David Thewlis Explains Varga’s Eating Issue|work=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Entertainment]]|publisher=Oath Inc.|location=Sunnyvale, California|date=May 11, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his wealth, Varga shuns excess and is always seen wearing a discount suit. Throughout the season, he is seen living in the back of a [[semi-trailer]], in which he sleeps on the floor and works on a workstation connected to computer servers. According to Varga's creator, [[Noah Hawley]]: "It’s a very spartan life he lives... Obviously he’s got a lot of money, but you’ll never see him in a hotel or in a towncar."&lt;ref name="Indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|first=Liz Shannon|last=Miller|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/fargo-david-thewlis-vm-varga-emmys-1201832545/|title=‘Fargo’: David Thewlis on the Details and Delight of Playing a Bad Guy Who’s ‘Out and Out Foul’|website=[[Indiewire]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are signs of [[paranoia]] in Varga's dialogue and behavior: he expresses a belief in [[Moon landing conspiracy theories]], as well as prejudices such as [[antisemitism]], and appears to admire [[Joseph Stalin]] (a portrait of whom is seen on a wall  next to Varga's workstation).

==Storyline==
In 2010, Varga arrives at Stussy Corporation offices when Emmit Stussy seeks to repay a business loan from Varga's shady organization made two years before. However, Varga explains that the company does not want their money back, and that it was an "investment" and partnership with his organization. Concerned for his business, Emmit asks his lawyer Irv Burman to investigate Varga. A [[Google]] search causes the lawyer's computer to crash and, later, Varga's henchmen Yuri Gurka and Meemo toss him off a parking garage. Varga then takes ownership of an unused wing of Emmit's offices. Learning of a theft by Emmit's younger brother Ray, and suspecting Varga was involved in Irv's death, Emmit and Sy consider selling their company.

Things escalate when Varga shows up unannounced for dinner at Emmit's house. After dinner, Varga proposes to sign Emmit on as a business partner. Although Emmit is reluctant, Varga convinces him that signing will allow him to become much richer and ensure his wealth is protected; the former ultimately complies. When Officer Lopez, who is investigating the hit-and-run he committed, questions Sy, who acts very suspiciously, Yuri and Meemo are watching. Later, Varga takes Sy's office and punishes him for talking to law enforcement by forcing him to drink urine from his mug. Varga has a meeting with Emmit, voicing his distrust of Sy and suggests he and Emmit's ne'er-do-well brother Ray may be working together to bring Emmit down. Explaining to Emmit and Sy, he plans to expand Stussy Lots by 16 garages within three months; Sy is wary, but Emmit seems eager. When [[Gloria Burgle]] and Lopez want to question Emmit, Varga curtails the meeting and obtains Gloria's card. A distraught Emmit calls Varga to manage the cleanup of Ray's death at the former's hand. Varga concocts a story that Ray abused his girlfriend Nikki Swango, causing injuries actually inflicted by Varga's men, and she retaliated. On  Christmas, Varga asks Emmit how he feels about his murder of Ray; Emmit responds, "Free", but begins to cry. He sends uniformed assassin Golem to kill an imprisoned Nikki but, when this fails, his men plant a ramp, causing the prison bus, with Nikki and [[Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers|Mr. Wrench]] inside, to overturn. Nikki escapes with Wrench's help; Varga's men die along the chase. Varga poisons Sy, sending him into a coma.

Two-and-a-half months later, Nikki and Mr. Wrench are still at large, and Varga has expanded Emmit's business after becoming his partner.  Varga gives Emmit tranquilizers to calm him, which he feigns taking. Marvin Stussy, a dentist in St. Cloud, is killed in the same manner as Ray. George Stussy is also found murdered in the same manner as Ennis. Ex-con Donald Woo, presumably working for Varga, is picked up for the murders and deliberately takes the fall, admitting to having committed all four. Varga meets with Nikki, and in order to get out of the blackmailing he repeatedly attempts to both poison and to hire her, but she refuses. Nikki gives Varga 24 hours to pay her ransom or she'll send his and Emmit's financials to the IRS.

After returning from the police station, Emmit is forced to sign many contracts, after which he grabs Meemo's gun and attempts to force Varga to withdraw from his house and business. Varga incapacitates him, and Meemo attacks him from behind. After leaving Emmit's house, Varga, Meemo, and the crew go to meet Nikki and Mr. Wrench to pay ransom for the hard drives, but are ambushed by Wrench. Meemo and his accomplices are killed, but Varga escapes. Emmit, regaining consciousness, goes to Stussy Lots' offices to find that Ruby Goldfarb, a businesswoman who was apparently in league with Varga, has finalized her acquisition of the company for $100,000 and has begun moving her employees into the building. Goldfarb assures Emmit that he holds millions in [[offshore account]]s, but that he is liable for Stussy Lots' large debts and advises him to declare [[bankruptcy]], leaving him distraught.

Five years later, Gloria, now an agent for the [[Department of Homeland Security]], interviews Varga, who is going by the name "Daniel Rand", in a holding cell. She declares that in five minutes he will be going to jail for [[money laundering]] and six counts of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder. However, Varga asserts that in five minutes Gloria's superior will arrive and let him go free. Gloria scoffs, then starts counting down the minutes on the cell's clock while Varga hums, confident.

==Production==
Prior to his casting, Thewlis has already been a fan of the [[Fargo (film)|original 1996 film]] and had seen the previous two seasons. Upon learning that Hawley was interested in him for season 3, he jumped at the chance. Thewlis enjoyed playing the character, saying "I think I’ve had more fun playing Varga than I’ve had for quite a number of years, playing anything. It’s just so beautifully written. Every few weeks, I got a new script, I’d settle down with a cup of coffee like I was about to read ''[[Anna Karenina]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Grobar|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/fargo-david-thewlis-noah-hawley-emmys-interview-news-1202116629/|title=‘Fargo’s David Thewlis On The Season Finale &amp; Sinking His Teeth Into A Villain For All Times|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Thewlis received critical acclaim for his performance. Liz Shannon Miller of ''[[IndieWire]]'' remarked, "When 'Fargo' Year 3 announced its cast, Ewan McGregor was clearly the biggest name involved, and the fact that he would be playing brothers had everyone intrigued. But in subsequent weeks, fans aren’t clamoring for McGregor’s Ray or Emmit, but they are obsessed with the character of V.M. Varga. And that’s because David Thewlis is turning in one of the spring’s darkest, most horrifying supporting performances, one that will be hard to overlook this Emmy season."&lt;ref name="Indiewire"/&gt; Brian Tallerica of [[Vulture.com]], praising the whole cast, singled out Thewlis, saying "If I had to pick one (MVP), it might be Thewlis, who gave the season its simmering menace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Tallerica|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/fargo-season-3-finale-recap.html|title=Fargo Season-Finale Recap: The Great American Experiment|website=[[Vulture.com]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also opined "David Thewlis’ sallow, well-spoken gangster, for instance, is one of the most menacing men to ever wear a sack-like, forgettable bargain suit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/fargo-season-3-review-fx-ewan-mcgregor-carrie-coon-1202028861/|title=TV Review: ‘Fargo’ Season 3 on FX|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work on ''Fargo'', Thewlis was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie]], a [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries]], and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pete|last=Hammond|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/2017-emmy-nominations-list-all-nominees-1202127795/|title=Emmy Awards Nominations: ‘Westworld’, ‘This Is Us’, ‘Stranger Things’, ‘Atlanta’ Lead Diverse List|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=July 13, 2017|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/2017-golden-globes-nominations-list-all-nominees-1202224044/|title=Golden Globes Nominations: ‘The Shape Of Water’ &amp; ‘The Post’ Tops In Film, ‘Big Little Lies’ Leads TV|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 11, 2017|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Granville, Indiana Cemetery Marker.png|thumb|300px|"The Wea Plains," a historical marker near the [[ghost town]] of [[Granville, Indiana|Granville]] in [[Tippecanoe County, Indiana]]]]
The '''Wea''' were a [[Miami-Illinois language|Miami-Illinois]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe originally located in western Indiana, closely related to the [[Miami Tribe]]. The name ''Wea'' is used today as the a shortened version of their numerous recorded names. The Wea name for themselves (autonym) in their own language is ''waayaahtanwa'', derived from ''waayaahtanonki'', 'place of the whirlpool', where they were first recorded being seen and where they were living at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, David J. 2000. "Miami-Illinois Tribe Names", In John Nichols, ed., ''Papers of the Thirty-first Algonquian Conference'' 30-53. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba.&lt;/ref&gt;  The different spellings of their name are numerous, as they were made by different settlers from different language and educational backgrounds.  One French version is ''Ouiatenon''; another ''Ouiateno''; there were Wea villages, whose sites are now known as [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and [[Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]], respectively. In 2004 the Indiana Historical Bureau installed a marker commemorating the Wea Village in Terre Haute and its living descendants. The Wea spoke a dialect of Miami, the same language as the Miami Tribe, both from the [[Algonquian languages]].

==History==

When the Wea had increased considerably in numbers at their village of [[Ouiatenon]], near present-day Lafayette, Indiana, ''[[Piankeshaw]]'' offered to move and take part of the people with him further downriver to start a new village, which he established near the mouth of the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River tributary)|Vermilion River]]. He had tribal markings of holes or slits in his ears, and he was called Piankeshaw ("the Torn-Ears People"). The Piankeshaw were the Deer Clan of the Wea.

During the 19th century the Miami, Wea, Eel River and Piankashaw all occupied areas of Indiana.  These tribes all signed treaties separately with the United States government and were considered to be distinct polities.

The Wea also had villages in present-day Wisconsin, Illinois, and Ohio.  Their main homeland in the 18th century was in Indiana, as well as a few villages in Illinois and Ohio.  The three largest villages of the Wea were [[Ouiatenon]], west of what is now Lafayette; a location now occupied by Terre Haute, and ''Chipicokia,'' at present-day Vincennes (founded by French Canadian colonists.), [[Indiana]].

Lesser settlements included five villages on the South side of the Wabash across from Fort Ouiatenon, occupied by the Wea, Piankeshaw, Pepicokia, and Gros clans. Toward the west near present-day [[Granville, Indiana|Granville]] were villages of the [[Kickapoo people]].

With increased Euro-American settlement and [[Indian removal]]s, the United States made many treaties with these tribes. A Treaty in 1854 was made that confederated the Wea who went west, the [[Kaskaskia]], [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria]], and [[Piankeshaw]] as the [[Confederated Peoria Tribe]] of [[Kansas]], then [[Indian Territory]]. After moving West, later they were known as the Peoria Tribe of [[Oklahoma]].

Many of the Wea Tribe did not go west in the removals and remained in Indiana. They were referred to in treaties as the Wea on the Wabash, or the Wabash Wea. In historical records, they have been called the Wabash Confederacy or the Wabash Indians.

Descendants of the Wea reside today in Indiana, the United States and abroad.

The following referred to Wea who chose to stay in Indiana:
Treaty of St. Marys 1820 in Article 3: 
"As it is contemplated by the said Tribe, to remove from the Wabash, it is agreed, that the annuity secured to the Weas, by the Treaty of Saint Mary's, above mentioned, shall hereafter be paid to them at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] in the state of Illinois. "

Treaty of Castor Hill 1832 in Article 4:
"The United States will also afford some assistance to that part of the Wea tribe now residing in the State of Indiana",

==Today==

==Biography==
Born in [[Jerusalem]], Eichler worked as an author and journalist. He became editor of ''HaMahane HaHaredi'' in 1980, and in 1996 became chairman of the Centre for Jewish Publicity.

In 2003, he was [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|elected]] to the Knesset on the [[United Torah Judaism]] list, an alliance of Agudat Yisrael and [[Degel HaTorah]].

{{chinese name|[[Yuan (surname)|Yuen]]}}
'''Yuen Woo-ping''' ({{zh|c=袁和平|p=Yuán Hépíng}}; born 1945) is a [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]] [[Stage combat|martial arts choreographer]] and [[film director]], renowned as one of the most successful and influential figures in the world of [[Hong Kong action cinema]]. He is one of the inductees on the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong|Avenue of Stars]] in Hong Kong. Yuen is also a son of [[Yuen Siu-tien]], a renowned [[martial arts film]] actor.

==Life and career==
Yuen was born in [[Guangzhou, Guangdong]], [[China]]. He achieved his first directing credit in 1978 on the seminal ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'', starring [[Jackie Chan]], followed quickly by ''[[Drunken Master]]''. The films were smash hits, launching Jackie Chan as a major film star, turning [[Seasonal Films]] into a major independent production company, and starting a trend towards comedy in [[martial arts film]]s that continues to the present day.

Yuen went on to work with such figures as [[Sammo Hung]] in ''[[Magnificent Butcher]]'' (1979), [[Yuen Biao]] in ''[[Dreadnaught (film)|Dreadnaught]]'' (1981), [[Donnie Yen]] in ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'' (1993), and [[Jet Li]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]] in ''[[Tai Chi Master (1993 film)|Tai Chi Master]]'' (1993), and ''[[Wing Chun (film)|Wing Chun]]'' (1994).

Yuen's works, particularly his action choreography on ''[[Fist of Legend]]'' (1994), attracted the attention of the [[Wachowskis]], who hired him as the martial arts choreographer on ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). The success of this collaboration, plus his action choreography on the following year's hit ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', made him a highly sought after figure in [[Hollywood]]. He went on to work on the ''Matrix'' sequels and ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (2003).

More recent action choreography duties in [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong cinema]] have included ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'' (2004), starring [[Stephen Chow]], and ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), starring Jet Li.

Yuen also choreographed the action sequences in ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]'' (2008), a Hollywood martial arts–adventure film, which was the first film to star together two of the best-known names in the martial arts film genre, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. He worked as a fight choreography consultant on ''[[Ninja Assassin]]'' (2009).

In late 2010, Yuen released his first film as director since 1996, ''[[True Legend]]'', starring [[Vincent Zhao]] and [[Jay Chou]].

Yuen went on to work in two south Indian films as a stunt co-ordinator in  [[Enthiran]] (2010) and [[I (film)]] (2014) both were directed by same director [[S. Shankar]].

In 2015, Yuen directed ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny]]'',  re-creating many of his signature action choreographies.
