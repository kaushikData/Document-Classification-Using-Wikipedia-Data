'''108''' ('''one hundred [and] eight''') is the [[natural number]] following [[107 (number)|107]] and preceding [[109 (number)|109]].

== In mathematics ==
'''108''' is:

*an [[abundant number]].
*a [[semiperfect number]].
*a [[Tetranacci numbers|tetranacci number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000078|title=Sloane's A000078 : Tetranacci numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*nine [[dozen]]

There are 108 free [[polyomino]]es of order 7.

The equation &lt;math&gt;2\sin\left(\frac{108^\circ}{2}\right) = \phi &lt;/math&gt;  results in the [[golden ratio]].

== Religion and the arts ==

The number 108 is considered sacred by the [[Dharmic Religions]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]].

=== Hinduism  ===
In Hindu tradition, the [[Mukhya]] [[Gana|Shivaganas]] (attendants of Shiva) are 108 in number and hence [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] religions, particularly [[Lingayat]]s, use [[Hindu prayer beads|malas]] of 108 beads for prayer and meditation.

Similarly, in [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], Lord [[Krishna]] in [[Brindavan]] had 108 followers known as [[gopi]]s. Recital of their names, often accompanied by the counting of a 108-beaded [[Japa Mala|mala]], is often done during religious ceremonies. 
The Sri Vaishnavite Tradition has 108 [[Divya Desam]]s (temples of [[Vishnu]]) that are revered by the 12 Alvars in the ''[[Divya Prabandha]]'', a collection of 4,000 Tamil verses.

=== Jainism ===

In [[Jainism]], the total number of ways of Karma influx (Aasrav). 4 Kashays (anger, pride, conceit, greed) x 3 karanas (mind, speech, bodily action) x 3 stages of planning (planning, procurement, commencement) x 3 ways of execution (own action, getting it done, supporting or approval of action).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Buddhism ===
In [[Buddhism]], according to [[Henepola Gunaratana|Bhante Gunaratana]]&lt;ref&gt;Bhante Gunaratana, Four Foundations of Mindfulness in Plain English 2012, Wisdom Publications page 86&lt;/ref&gt; this number is reached by multiplying the senses smell, touch, taste, hearing, sight, and consciousness by whether they are painful, pleasant or neutral, and then again by whether these are internally generated or externally occurring, and yet again by past, present and future, finally we get 108 feelings. 6 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 108.

[[Tibetan Buddhist]] malas or rosaries (Tib. ཕྲེང་བ Wyl. phreng ba, "Trengwa") are usually 108 beads;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 of 'Generating the Deity' {{ISBN|1-55939-055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes 111 including the [[guru]] bead(s), reflecting the words of the [[Buddha]] called in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] the [[Kangyur]] (Wylie: Bka'-'gyur) in 108 volumes.
[[Zen]] priests wear [[juzu]] (a ring of prayer beads) around their wrists, which consists of 108 beads.&lt;ref name=Goodin/&gt;

[[File:Japa mala (prayer beads) of Tulasi wood with 108 beads - 20040101-02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Japa mala]], or ''japa beads'', made from [[tulasi]] wood, consisting of 108 beads plus the head bead.]]

The [[Lankavatara Sutra]] has a section where the Bodhisattva Mahamati asks Buddha 108 questions&lt;ref&gt;''The Lankavatara Sutra'' translated by Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Chapter Two, Section II,[http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and another section where Buddha lists 108 statements of negation in the form of "A statement concerning X is not a statement concerning X."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lankavatara Sutra'' translated by Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Chapter Two, Section III,[http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote, D.T. Suzuki explains that the Sanskrit word translated as "statement" is ''pada'' which can also mean "foot-step" or "a position." This confusion over the word "pada" explains why some have mistakenly held that the reference to 108 statements in the Lankavatara refer to the 108 steps that many temples have.&lt;ref name=Jyotpaul&gt;[http://www.tempewingchun.com/docs/108_steps.pdf 108 STEPS: The Sino-Indian Connection in the Martial Arts by Joyotpaul Chaudhuri....]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], at the end of the year, a [[Bonshō|bell]] is chimed 108 times in Buddhist temples to finish the old year and welcome the new one. Each ring represents one of 108 earthly temptations ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Bonnō]]) a person must overcome to achieve [[nirvana]].

=== Other references ===

In the neo-[[Gnostic]] teachings of [[Samael Aun Weor]], an individual has 108 chances (lifetimes) to eliminate his egos and transcend the material world before "devolving" and having the egos forcefully removed in the [[Hell|infradimensions]].&lt;ref name="psu-soter"&gt;{{cite book | author=Samael Aun Weor | title=The Pistis Sophia Unveiled | origyear=1983 | year=2005 | isbn=0-9745916-8-8 | publisher=Glorian Publishing |pages=211–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martial arts ==

Many East Asian martial arts trace their roots back to Buddhism, specifically, to the Buddhist Shaolin Temple. Because of their ties to Buddhism, 108 has become an important symbolic number in a number of martial arts styles.

*According to [[Marmam|Marma Adi]] and [[Ayurveda]], there are 108 pressure points in the body, where consciousness and flesh intersect to give life to the living being.&lt;ref name=Gautier&gt;A Western Journalist on India: The Ferengi's Columns By [[François Gautier]]. pg 158. {{ISBN|81-241-0795-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Chinese school of martial arts agrees with the [[South Indian]] school of martial arts on the principle of 108 pressure points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subramaniam Phd.|first=P., (general editors) Dr. Shu Hikosaka, Asst. Prof. Norinaga Shimizu, &amp; Dr. G. John Samuel, (translator) Dr. M.

*108 number figures prominently in the symbolism associated with [[karate]], particularly the [[Gōjū-ryū]] discipline. The ultimate Gōjū-ryū kata, ''Suparinpei'', literally translates to 108. ''Suparinpei'' is the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] pronunciation of the number 108, while ''gojūshi'' of Gojūshiho is the Japanese pronunciation of the number 54. The other Gōjū-ryū ''kata'', ''Sanseru'' (meaning "36") and ''Seipai'' ("18") are factors of the number 108.&lt;ref name=Goodin&gt;[http://www.seinenkai.com/articles/108.html Hyaku Hachi No Bonno: The Influence of The 108 Defilements and Other Buddhist Concepts on Karate Thought and Practice By Charles C.

*The 108 moves of the Yang Taijiquan long form and 108 moves in the [[Wing Chun]] wooden dummy form, taught by [[Ip Man]], are noted in this regard.&lt;ref name=Jyotpaul/&gt;
*The [[Eagle Claw]] Kung Fu style has a form known as the 108 Locking Hand Techniques.&lt;ref name="Leung 2001, p. 15"&gt;Leung, Shum and Jeanne Chin. ''The Secrets of Eagle Claw Kung Fu: Ying Jow Pai''. Tuttle martial arts. Boston: Tuttle Pub, 2001, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; This form is considered the essence of the style, consisting of an encyclopedia of [[Chin Na]] techniques, and is said to be passed down from the founder General [[Yue Fei]].&lt;ref name="Leung 2001, p. 15"/&gt;
*Paek Pal Ki Hyung, the 7th form taught in the art of [[Kuk Sool Won]], translates literally to "108 technique" form. It is also frequently referred to as the "eliminate 108 torments" form. Each motion corresponds with one of the 108 Buddhist torments or defilements.

'''135''' ('''one hundred [and] thirty-five''') is the [[natural number]] following [[134 (number)|134]] and preceding [[136 (number)|136]].

==In mathematics==
This number in [[base 10]] can be expressed in operations using its own digits in at least two different ways. One is as a [[sum-product number]],

&lt;math&gt;135 = (1 + 3 + 5)(1 \times 3 \times 5)&lt;/math&gt;

(1 and [[144 (number)|144]] share this property)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A038369|title=Sloane's A038369 : Numbers n such that n = (product of digits of n) * (sum of digits of n)|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other is as the sum of consecutive powers of its digits:

&lt;math&gt;135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3&lt;/math&gt;

([[175 (number)|175]], 518, and 598 also have this property).

135 is a [[Harshad number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[repdigit]] in bases 18 and 26.

There are a total of 135 [[prime number|primes]] between [[1000 (number)|1,000]] and [[2000 (number)|2,000]].

&lt;math&gt;135 = 11 n^2 + 11 n + 3&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n = 3&lt;/math&gt;. This polynomial plays an essential role in [[Apéry's constant|Apéry's proof]] that &lt;math&gt;\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

[[File:Ailles rectangle.png|thumb|300px|The Ailles rectangle]]
The '''Ailles rectangle''' is a [[rectangle]] constructed from four [[right-angled triangle]]s which is commonly used in geometry classes to find the values of trigonometric function of 15° and 75°.&lt;ref name="Vakil1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ravi Vakil|title=A Mathematical Mosaic: Patterns &amp; Problem Solving|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GvTHNPSkoN4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=ailles+rectangle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim5-a4qffMAhVGnpQKHd6hBVAQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ailles%20rectangle&amp;f=false|date=January 1996|publisher=Brendan Kelly Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-895997-04-0|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after high school teacher Douglas S. Ailles.&lt;ref name="McKeagueTurner2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles P. McKeague|author2=Mark D. Turner|title=Trigonometry|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xitTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=ailles+rectangle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim5-a4qffMAhVGnpQKHd6hBVAQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ailles%20rectangle&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-65222-4|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In every beginning trigonometry course, one learns of the [[Special right triangle#30°–60°–90° triangle|30°–60°–90° triangle]] with sides of length 1,&amp;nbsp;2, and&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|3}}. When two such triangles are placed in the positions shown in the illustration, the smallest rectangle that can enclose them has width&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|3}} and height&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|3}}.  Drawing a line connecting the original triangles' top corners creates a [[Special right triangle#45°–45°–90° triangle|45°–45°–90° triangle]] between the two, with sides of lengths 2,&amp;nbsp;2 and (by the [[Pythagorean theorem]]) 2{{sqrt|2}}.  The remaining space at the top of the rectangle is a right triangle with small angles of 15° and&amp;nbsp;75°. and sides of {{sqrt|3}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, {{sqrt|3}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and  2{{sqrt|2}}.

Therefore, we can conclude

: &lt;math&gt; \sin 15^\circ = \cos 75^\circ = \frac{\sqrt3 - 1}{2\sqrt2} = \frac{\sqrt6 - \sqrt2} 4, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \sin 75^\circ = \cos 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt3 + 1}{2\sqrt2} = \frac{\sqrt6 + \sqrt2} 4, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \tan 15^\circ = \cot 75^\circ = \frac{\sqrt3 - 1}{\sqrt3 + 1} = \frac{(\sqrt3 - 1)^2}{3 - 1} = 2 - \sqrt3, &lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt; \tan 75^\circ = \cot 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt3 + 1}{\sqrt3 - 1} = \frac{(\sqrt3 + 1)^2}{3 - 1} = 2 + \sqrt3. &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative construction (also by Ailles) places a 30°–60°–90° triangle in the middle, flanked by two 45°–45°–90° triangles in the lower corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 30°–60°–90° triangle is scaled up by {{sqrt|2}} from its usual dimensions, so its hypotenuse is 2{{sqrt|2}}.  The 15°–75°–90° triangle is identical.

'''Alessandro Padoa''' (14 October 1868 – 25 November 1937) was an [[Italian language|Italian]] [[mathematician]] and [[logician]], a contributor to the school of [[Giuseppe Peano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is remembered for a method for deciding whether, given some formal theory, a new [[primitive notion]] is truly independent of the other primitive notions. There is an analogous problem in axiomatic theories, namely deciding whether a given axiom is independent of the other axioms.

The following description of Padoa's career is included in a biography of Peano:
:He attended secondary school in Venice, engineering school in Padua, and the [[University of Turin]], from which he received a degree in mathematics in 1895. Although he was never a student of Peano, he was an ardent disciple and, from 1896 on, a collaborator and friend. He taught in secondary schools in Pinerolo, Rome, Cagliari, and (from 1909) at the Technical Institute in Genoa. He also held positions at the Normal School in Aquila and the Naval School in Genoa, and, beginning in 1898, he gave a series of lectures at the Universities of Brussels, Pavia, Berne, Padua, Cagliari, and Geneva. He gave papers at congresses of philosophy and mathematics in Paris, Cambridge, Livorno, Parma, Padua, and Bologna. In 1934 he was awarded the ministerial prize in mathematics by the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] (Rome).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1980), page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The congresses in [[Paris]] in 1900 were particularly notable. Padoa's addresses at these congresses have been well remembered for their clear and unconfused exposition of the modern [[axiomatic method]] in mathematics. In fact, he is said to be "the first … to get all the ideas concerning defined and undefined concepts completely straight".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional addresses==

===Philosophers' congress===
At the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] Padoa spoke on "Logical Introduction to Any Deductive Theory". He says
:during the period of ''elaboration'' of any deductive theory we choose the ''ideas'' to be represented by the undefined symbols and the ''facts'' to be stated by the unproved propositions; but, when we begin to ''formulate'' the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are ''completely devoid of meaning'' and that the unproved propositions (instead of stating ''facts'', that is, ''relations'' between the ''ideas'' represented by the undefined symbols) are simply ''conditions'' imposed upon undefined symbols.
:Then, the ''system'' of ''ideas'' that we have initially chosen is simply ''one interpretation'' of the ''system'' of ''undefined symbols''; but from the deductive point of view this interpretation can be ignored by the reader, who is free to replace it in his mind by ''another interpretation'' that satisfies the conditions stated by the ''unproved propositions''. And since the propositions, from the deductive point of view, do not state ''facts'', but ''conditions'', we cannot consider them genuine ''postulates''.
Padoa went on to say:
:...what is necessary to the logical development of a deductive theory is not ''the empirical knowledge of the properties of things'', but ''the formal knowledge of relations between symbols''.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 120,121&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematicians' congress===

Padoa spoke at the 1900 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] with his title "A New System of Definitions for Euclidean Geometry". At the outset he discusses the various selections of [[primitive notion]]s in geometry at the time:
:The meaning of any of the ''symbols'' that one encounters in ''geometry'' must be presupposed, just as one presupposes that of the symbols which appear in ''pure logic''. As there is an ''arbitrariness'' in the ''choice'' of the ''undefined symbols'', it is necessary to describe the ''chosen system''. We cite only ''three geometers'' who are concerned with this question and who have successively ''reduced'' the ''number of undefined symbols'', and through them (as well as through ''symbols'' that appear in ''pure logic'') it is possible to ''define'' all the ''other symbols''.
:First, [[Moritz Pasch]] was able to define all the other symbols through the following four:
::1. '''point''' &amp;nbsp; 2. '''segment''' (of a line)
::3. '''plane''' &amp;nbsp; 4. '''is superimposable upon'''
:Then, [[Giuseppe Peano]] was able in 1889 to define ''plane'' through ''point'' and ''segment''. In 1894 he replaced ''is superimposable upon'' with ''motion'' in the system of undefined symbols, thus reducing the system to symbols:
::1. '''point''' &amp;nbsp; 2. '''segment''' &amp;nbsp; 3. '''motion'''
:Finally, in 1899 [[Mario Pieri]] was able to define ''segment'' through ''point'' and ''motion''. Consequently, ''all the symbols that one encounters in Euclidean geometry can be defined in terms of only two of them'', namely
:: 1. '''point''' &amp;nbsp; 2. '''motion'''
Padoa completed his address by suggesting and demonstrating his own development of geometric concepts. In particular, he showed how he and Pieri define a line in terms of 
[[line_(geometry)#Collinear points|collinear points]].

{{Platonism}}

The '''Analogy of the Divided Line''' ({{lang-grc-gre|γραμμὴ δίχα τετμημένη}}) is presented by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] in the  ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (509d–511e). It is written as a dialogue between [[Glaucon]] and [[Socrates]], in which the latter further elaborates upon the immediately preceding [[Analogy of the Sun]] at the former's request. Socrates asks Glaucon to not only envision this unequally bisected line but to imagine further bisecting each of the two segments. Socrates explains that the four resulting segments represent four separate 'affections' (παθήματα) of the psyche. The lower two sections are said to represent the [[sense|visible]] while the higher two are said to represent the [[Intelligibility (philosophy)#Usage|intelligible]]. These affections are described in succession as corresponding to increasing levels of reality and truth from conjecture ([[Eikasia|εἰκασία]]) to belief ([[:Wiktionary:πίστις|πίστις]]) to thought ([[Dianoia|διάνοια]]) and finally to understanding ([[:Wiktionary:νόησις|νόησις]]). Furthermore, this analogy not only elaborates a theory of the psyche but also presents metaphysical and epistemological views.

This analogy is immediately followed by the [[Analogy of the Cave]] at 514a. Socrates returns once more to the elements of the divided line (533d-534a) as he summarizes his dialectic.

== Description ==
[[Image:DividedLine.svg|frame|left|The Divided Line – ('''AC''') is generally taken as representing the visible world and ('''CE''') as representing the intelligible world.&lt;ref name="CDP"&gt;"divided line," ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-63722-8}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear|left}}

In ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'' (509d–510a), Plato describes the Divided Line this way:

{{quotation|Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide each of them again in the same proportion,&lt;ref name="unequal"&gt;Older Greek texts do not differentiate unequal from an equal (ανίσα, αν ίσα)&lt;/ref&gt; and suppose the two main divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images. And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance, to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is made.&lt;ref name="Republic"&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', Book 6, translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]], [http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418215659/http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf |date=18 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== The visible world ==
Thus '''AB''' represents shadows and reflections of physical things, and '''BC''' the physical things themselves.  These correspond to two kinds of [[Platonic epistemology|knowledge]], the '''illusion''' (εἰκασία ''[[eikasia]]'') of our ordinary, everyday experience, and '''[[belief]]''' (πίστις ''pistis'') about discrete physical objects which cast their shadows.&lt;ref name="PenguinNotes"&gt;Desmond Lee and Rachana Kamtekar, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', Notes to Book 6, Penguin, 1987, {{ISBN|0-14-044914-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', the category of illusion includes all the "opinions of which the minds of ordinary people are full," while the natural sciences are included in the category of belief.&lt;ref name="PenguinNotes" /&gt;

== The intelligible world ==
According to some translations,&lt;ref name="unequal" /&gt; the segment '''CE''', representing the intelligible world, is divided into the same ratio as '''AC''', giving the subdivisions '''CD''' and '''DE''' (it can be readily verified that '''CD''' must have the same length as '''BC''':&lt;ref&gt;Let the length of '''AE''' be equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1&lt;/math&gt; and that of '''AC''' equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0 &lt; x &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (following Socrates, however, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0 &lt; x &lt; 1/2&lt;/math&gt;; insofar as the equality of the lengths of '''BC''' and '''CD''' is concerned, the latter restriction is of no significance). The length of '''CE''' is thus equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1-x&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the length of '''BC''' must be equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x - x \times x \equiv (1-x)\times x&lt;/math&gt;, which is seen to be equal to the length of '''CD'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves (510b).&lt;ref name="Republic" /&gt;}}

Plato describes '''CD''', the "lower" of these, as involving '''mathematical reasoning''' (διάνοια ''[[dianoia]]''),&lt;ref name="PenguinNotes" /&gt; where abstract [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|mathematical objects]] such as [[Line (geometry)|geometric lines]] are discussed.  Such objects are outside the physical world (and are not to be confused with the ''drawings'' of those lines, which fall within the physical world '''BC''').  However, they are less important to Plato than the subjects of philosophical '''understanding''' (νόησις ''[[noesis]]''), the "higher" of these two subdivisions ('''DE'''):

{{quotation|And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses — that is to say, as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole (511b).&lt;ref name="Republic" /&gt;}}

Plato here is using the familiar relationship between ordinary objects and their shadows or reflections in order to illustrate the relationship between the physical world as a whole and the world of [[Theory of Forms|Ideas (Forms)]] as a whole.  The former is made up of a series of passing reflections of the latter, which is eternal, more real and "true."  Moreover, the knowledge that we have of the Ideas – when indeed we do have it – is of a higher order than knowledge of the mere physical world.  In particular, knowledge of the forms leads to a knowledge of the [[Form of the Good|Idea (Form) of the Good]].&lt;ref name="CDP" /&gt;

== Metaphysical importance ==
The Allegory of the Divided Line is the cornerstone of Plato's metaphysical framework. This structure, well hidden in the middle of the ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'', a complex, multi-layered dialogue, illustrates the grand picture of Plato's metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, all in one. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, ''Knowledge and Belief in Republic V-VII'', in G. Fine (ed.) ''Plato I'' (1990), also in S. Everson (ed.) ''Cambridge Companions to Ancient Thought I: Epistemology'' (Cambridge University Press: New York, 1990), pp. 85-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Denyer, ''Sun and line: the role of the Good'', in G. R. F. Ferrari (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic (Cambridge University Press: New York, 2007), pp. 284–309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D520c 520c]: "For once habituated ... you will know what each of the ‘idols’ is and whereof it is a semblance, because you have seen the reality of the beautiful, the just and the good."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Republic'', the philosopher must understand the Idea of Justice to live a just life or to organize and govern a just state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachelsingpurwalla.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/platos-defense-of-justice.pdf Rachel G.K. Singpurwalla, ''Plato’s Defense of Justice in the Republic''] "justice is a virtue appropriate to both cities and individuals, and the nature or form of justice is the same in both (''Republic'', 435a)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divided Line also serves as our guide for most past and future metaphysics. The lowest level, which represents "the world of becoming and passing away" (''Republic'', 508d), is the metaphysical model for a Heraclitean philosophy of constant flux and for Protagorean philosophy of appearance and opinion. The second level, a world of fixed physical objects,&lt;ref name="Danaher"&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/lawsofthought.htm James Danaher, ''The Laws of Thought''] "The restrictions Plato places on the laws of thought (i.e., "in the same respect," and "at the same time,") are an attempt to isolate the object of thought by removing it from all other time but the present and all respects but one."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+439d&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 439d-e] "For if it is ''ever'' in the same state, then obviously ''at that time'' it is not changing (Plato's realism); and if it is ''always'' in the same state and is always the same, how can it ever change or move without relinquishing its own form (Aristotle's realism)"&lt;/ref&gt; also became Aristotle's metaphysical model. The third level might be a Pythagorean level of mathematics. The fourth level is Plato's ideal Parmenidean reality, the world of highest level Ideas.

== Epistemological meaning ==
Plato holds a very strict notion of knowledge. For example, he does not accept expertise about a subject, nor direct perception (see ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''), nor true belief about the physical world (the ''[[Meno]]'') as knowledge. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7%3Apage%3D520 520c] "For once habituated you will discern them infinitely better than the dwellers there, and you will ''know'' what each of the ‘idols’ is and whereof it is a semblance, because you have seen the reality of the beautiful, the just and the good."&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, in most of the "earlier Socratic" dialogues, Socrates denies knowledge both to himself and others.

For the first level, "the world of becoming and passing away," Plato expressly denies the possibility of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+439d&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 439d-e] "How, then, can that which is never in the same state be anything? ... nor can it be known by anyone."&lt;/ref&gt; Constant change never stays the same, therefore, properties of objects must refer to different Ideas at different times. Note that for knowledge to be possible, which Plato believed, the other three levels must be unchanging. The third and fourth level, mathematics and Ideas, are already eternal and unchanging. However, to ensure that the second level, the objective, physical world, is also unchanging, Plato, in the ''Republic'', Book 4&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D4%3Asection%3D436b 4.436b] "It is obvious that the same thing will never do or suffer opposites in the same respect in relation to the same thing and at the same time"&lt;/ref&gt; introduces empirically derived&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D4%3Asection%3D437a 4.437a] "let us proceed on the ''hypothesis'' that this is so, with the understanding that, if it ever appear otherwise, everything that results from the assumption shall be invalidated"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see the ''Timaeus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D29c 29c] on empirical "likelihood"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is interesting to note that  modern logical analysis claims to prove that the potentially falsifiable "empirical content of a theory is exactly captured by ... axiomatization ... that uses axioms which are universal negations of conjunctions of atomic formulas" [http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~fede/wp/empirical.pdf (C. Chambers, ''The Axiomatic Structure of Empirical Content'')] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627005606/http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~fede/wp/empirical.pdf |date=27 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[axiom]]atic restrictions that prohibit both motion and shifting perspectives.&lt;ref name="Danaher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato's [[Principle of Non-Contradiction]] (''Republic'', 4.436b) for the objective, physical world is presented with three ''axiomatic'' restrictions: The same thing ... cannot act or be acted upon ... in contrary ways ... (1) in the same part (2) in relation to the same thing (3) at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Raphael Blass''' (born October 27, 1947 in [[Nuremberg]]) is a mathematician, currently a professor at the [[University of Michigan]]. He specializes in [[mathematical logic]], particularly [[set theory]], and [[theoretical computer science]].

Blass graduated from the [[University of Detroit]], where he was a [[Putnam Fellow]], in 1966 with a [[B.S.]] in [[physics]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1970 from [[Harvard University]], with a thesis on ''Orderings of Ultrafilters'' written under the supervision of Frank Wattenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=7579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970 he has been employed by the University of Michigan, first as a ''T.H. Hildebrandt Research Instructor'' (1970&amp;ndash;72), then assistant professor (1972&amp;ndash;76),  associate professor (1976&amp;ndash;84) and since 1984 he has been a full professor there.

In 2014, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications and results==
In 1984 Blass proved that the existence of a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for every [[vector space]] is equivalent to the [[Axiom of choice|axiom of choice]]. He made important contributions in the development of the [[Set theory of the real line|set theory of the reals]] and [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]].

Blass was the first to point out connections between [[game semantics]] and [[linear logic]].

He has authored more than 200 research articles in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, including:

'''Andrew John Casson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born 1943) is a [[mathematician]], studying [[geometric topology]].

Casson is the Philip Schuyler Beebe Professor of Mathematics&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailybulletin.yale.edu/article.aspx?id=8635 Andrew Casson named the Beebe Professor of Mathematics], Yale Daily Bulletin,  June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Yale University]] in the [[United States]] where he served as department chair between 2004 and 2007. His Ph.D. advisor at the [[University of Liverpool]] was [[C. T. C. Wall]], but he never completed his doctorate; instead what would have been his Ph.D. thesis became his fellowship dissertation as a research fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].  He was Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] between 1981 and 1986, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1986 to 2000, and has been at Yale since 2000. 

In 1991, he was awarded the [[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]] by the [[American Mathematical Society]]. In 1998 he was elected to Fellowship of the [[Royal Society]]. 

Casson has worked in both high-dimensional manifold topology and 3- and 4-dimensional [[topology]],
using both geometric and algebraic techniques. Among other discoveries, he contributed 
to the disproof of the manifold [[Hauptvermutung]], introduced the [[Casson invariant]], a modern invariant for 3-[[manifold]]s, and [[Casson handle]]s, used in [[Michael Freedman]]'s proof of the 4-dimensional [[Poincaré conjecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">In [[mathematics]], the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] is defined in any [[commutative ring]] ''R'' that has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', where ''p'' is a [[prime number]]. Namely, the mapping φ that takes ''r'' in ''R'' to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[ring endomorphism]] of ''R''.

The image of φ is then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[subring]] of ''R'' consisting of ''p''-th powers. In some important cases, for example [[finite field]]s, φ is [[surjective]]. Otherwise φ is an endomorphism but not a ring ''automorphism''.

The terminology of '''geometric Frobenius''' arises by applying the [[spectrum of a ring]] construction to φ. This gives a mapping

:φ*: Spec(''R''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;) → Spec(''R'')

of [[affine scheme]]s. Even in cases where ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R'' this is not the identity, unless ''R'' is the [[prime field]]. 

Mappings created by [[fibre product]] with φ*, i.e. [[Grothendieck's relative point of view|base change]]s, tend in [[scheme theory]] to be called ''geometric Frobenius''. The reason for a careful terminology is that the [[Frobenius automorphism]] in [[Galois group]]s, or defined by [[transport of structure]], is often the [[inverse mapping]] of the geometric Frobenius. As in the case of a [[cyclic group]] in which a generator is also the inverse of a generator, there are in many situations two possible definitions of Frobenius, and without a consistent convention some problem of a [[minus sign]] may appear.

'''Avraham Naumovich Trahtman''' (Trakhtman) ({{lang-ru|Абрам Наумович Трахтман}}; b. 1944, [[USSR]]) is a mathematician at [[Bar-Ilan University]] ([[Israel]]).  In 2007, Trahtman solved a problem in [[combinatorics]] that had been open for 37 years, the [[Road Coloring Conjecture]] posed in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Pin. On two combinatorial problems arising  from automata theory. Annals of Discrete Math., 17, 535-548, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Road coloring problem posed and solved==
Trahtman's solution to the [[road coloring problem]] was accepted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the ''[[Israel Journal of Mathematics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Avraham N. Trahtman: The Road Coloring Problem. ''[[Israel Journal of Mathematics]]'', Vol. 172, 51&amp;ndash;60, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The problem arose in the subfield of [[symbolic dynamics]], an abstract part of the field of [[dynamical systems]]. The road coloring problem was raised by [[Roy Adler|R. L. Adler]] and L. W. Goodwyn from the United States, and the Israeli mathematician B. Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Adler, B. Weiss.

Equivalence of topological Markov shifts, Israel J. of Math. 27, 49-63, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The proof used results from earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;K. Culik II, J. Karhumaki, J. Kari.

==Černý conjecture==
The problem of estimating the length of synchronizing word has a long history and was posed independently by several authors, but it is commonly known as the [[Černý conjecture]]. In 1964 Jan Černý conjectured that &lt;math&gt;(n-1)^2&lt;/math&gt; is the upper bound for the length of the shortest synchronizing word for any n-state complete DFA (a DFA with complete state transition graph).&lt;ref&gt;J. Černý, Poznamka k homogenym eksperimentom s konechnymi automatami, Math.-Fyz. Čas., 14(1964) 208--215.
&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true, it would be tight: in his 1964 paper, Černý exhibited a class of automata (indexed by the number n of states) for which the shortest reset words have this length. In 2011 Trahtman published a proof&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Trahtman. Modifying the Upper Bound on the Length of Minimal Synchronizing Word. Lect. Notes in Comp. Sci, 6914(2011) Springer, 173-180&lt;/ref&gt; of upper bound &lt;math&gt;n (7n^2+6n-16)/48&lt;/math&gt;, but then he found an error in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1104.2409v6|last1 = Trahtman|first1 = A. N|title = Modifying the upper bound on the length of minimal synchronizing word|class = cs.DM|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture holds in many partial cases, see for instance, Kari&lt;ref&gt;J. Kari. Synchronizing finite automata on Eulerian digraphs. Springer, Lect. Notes in Comp.  Sci., 2136, 432-438, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Trahtman.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Trahtman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">In mathematics, '''Bondy's theorem''' is a bound on the number of elements needed to distinguish the sets in a [[family of sets]] from each other. It belongs to the field of [[combinatorics]], and is named after [[John Adrian Bondy]], who published it in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
The theorem is as follows:

:Let ''X'' be a set with ''n'' elements and let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be distinct subsets of ''X''. Then there exists a subset ''S'' of ''X'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements such that the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''S'' are all distinct.

In other words, if we have a 0-1 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with ''n'' rows and ''n'' columns such that each row is distinct, we can remove one column such that the rows of the resulting ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) matrix are distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}, Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider the 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1\\
    0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1\\
    0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1\\
    0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where all rows are pairwise distinct. If we delete, for example, the first column, the resulting matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    1&amp;0&amp;1\\
    1&amp;0&amp;1\\
    0&amp;1&amp;1\\
    1&amp;1&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
no longer has this property: the first row is identical to the second row. Nevertheless, by Bondy's theorem we know that we can always find a column that can be deleted without introducing any identical rows. In this case, we can delete the third column: all rows of the 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    1&amp;1&amp;1\\
    0&amp;1&amp;1\\
    0&amp;0&amp;1\\
    0&amp;1&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
are distinct. Another possibility would have been deleting the fourth column.

==Learning theory application==
From the perspective of [[computational learning theory]], Bondy's theorem can be rephrased as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Kushilevitz | first1 = Eyal
 | last2 = Linial | first2 = Nathan
 | last3 = Rabinovich | first3 = Yuri

 | pages = 376–380
 | series = Series A
 | title = Witness sets for families of binary vectors
 | volume = 73
 | year = 1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Let ''C'' be a [[concept class]] over a finite domain ''X''. Then there exists a subset ''S'' of ''X'' with the size at most |''C''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 such that ''S'' is a [[witness set]] for every concept in ''C''.

This implies that every finite concept class ''C'' has its [[teaching dimension]] bounded by |''C''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Boolean grammars''', introduced by [[Alexander Okhotin|Okhotin]], are a class of formal grammars studied in [[formal language]] theory. They extend the basic type of grammars, the [[context-free grammars]], with [[Logical_conjunction|conjunction]] and [[negation]] operations. Besides these explicit operations, Boolean grammars allow implicit [[Logical_disjunction|disjunction]] represented by multiple rules for a single nonterminal symbol, which is the only logical connective expressible in context-free grammars. Conjunction and negation can be used, in particular, to specify intersection and complement of languages. An intermediate class of grammars known as [[conjunctive grammar]]s allows conjunction and disjunction, but not negation. 

The rules of a Boolean grammar are of the form

&lt;math&gt;A \to \alpha_1 \And \ldots \And \alpha_m \And
\lnot\beta_1 \And \ldots \And \lnot\beta_n &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a nonterminal, &lt;math&gt;m+n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\beta_n&lt;/math&gt; are strings formed of symbols in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, such a rule asserts that every string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies each of the syntactical conditions represented by &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt; and none of the syntactical conditions represented by &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\beta_n&lt;/math&gt; therefore satisfies the condition defined by &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

There exist several formal definitions of the language generated by a Boolean grammar. They have one thing in common: if the grammar is represented as a system of [[language equation]]s with union, intersection, complementation and concatenation, the languages generated by the grammar must be the solution of this system. The semantics differ in details, some define the languages using language equations, some draw upon ideas from the field of [[logic programming]]. However, these nontrivial issues of formal definition are mostly irrelevant for practical considerations, and one can construct grammars according to the given informal semantics.  The practical properties of the model are similar to those of [[conjunctive grammar]]s, while the descriptional capabilities are further improved. In particular, some practically useful properties inherited from [[context-free grammars]], such as efficient parsing algorithms, are retained, see {{harvtxt|Okhotin|2010}}.

In [[mathematics]], '''Chebyshev's sum inequality''', named after [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], states that if

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \cdots \geq a_n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \cdots \geq b_n,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over n} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cdot b_k \geq \left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\right)\left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \cdots \geq b_n,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over n} \sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_k \leq \left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\right)\left({1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=0944909|last=Hardy|first=G. H.|last2=Littlewood|first2=J. E.|last3=Pólya|first3=G.|title=Inequalities|series=Cambridge Mathematical Library|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1988|isbn=0-521-35880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Consider the sum

:&lt;math&gt; S = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n (a_j - a_k) (b_j - b_k).&lt;/math&gt;

The two sequences are non-increasing, therefore {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} have the same sign for any {{math|''j'',&amp;nbsp;''k''}}. Hence {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}}.

Opening the brackets, we deduce:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq 2 n \sum_{j=1}^n a_j b_j - 2 \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \, \sum_{k=1}^n b_k,&lt;/math&gt;

whence

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j b_j \geq \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j\right) \, \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative proof is simply obtained with the [[rearrangement inequality]], writing that
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_j = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_i b_j =\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}  a_i b_{i+k~\text{mod}~n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i b_{i+k~\text{mod}~n}
\leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_ib_i = n \sum_i a_ib_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Continuous version==
There is also a continuous version of Chebyshev's sum inequality:

If ''f'' and ''g'' are real-valued, integrable functions over [0,1], both non-increasing or both non-decreasing, then

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f(x)g(x) \, dx \geq \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx \int_0^1 g(x) \, dx, &lt;/math&gt;

with the inequality reversed if one is non-increasing and the other is non-decreasing.

{{math|'''cis'''}}&lt;!-- with a lower-case "c" --&gt; is a less commonly used [[mathematical notation]] defined by {{math|cis(''x'') {{=}} cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}},&lt;ref name="Weisstein_cis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byrnes_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swokowski_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons_2014_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons_2014_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kammler_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenzo-Hartley_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pierce_2016"/&gt; where {{math|cos}} is the [[cosine]] function, {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]] and {{math|sin}} is the [[sine]]. The notation is less commonly used than [[Euler's formula]], &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}&lt;/math&gt;, which offers an even shorter and more general notation for {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}}.

==Overview==
The {{math|cis}} notation was first coined by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in ''Elements of Quaternions'' (1866)&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1866"/&gt; and subsequently used by [[Irving Stringham]] in works such as ''Uniplanar Algebra'' (1893),&lt;ref name="Stringham_1893"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cajori_1929"/&gt; or by [[James Harkness]] and [[Frank Morley]] in their ''Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions'' (1898).&lt;ref name="Cajori_1929"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harkness_Morley_1898"/&gt; It connects [[trigonometric function]]s with [[exponential function]]s in the [[complex plane]] via [[Euler's formula]].

It is mostly used as a convenient shorthand notation to simplify some expressions,&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1866"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stringham_1893"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swokowski_2011"/&gt;
for example in conjunction with [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] and [[Hartley transform]]s,&lt;ref name="Byrnes_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kammler_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenzo-Hartley_2016"/&gt; or when exponential functions shouldn't be used for some reason in math education.

In information technology, the function sees dedicated support in various high-performance math libraries (such as [[Intel]]'s [[Math Kernel Library]] (MKL)&lt;ref name="Intel_MKL"/&gt;), available for many compilers, programming languages (including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]],&lt;ref name="Intel_2007_C++"/&gt; [[Common Lisp]],&lt;ref name="Lisp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisp_2005"/&gt; [[D (programming language)|D]],&lt;ref name="D_2011"/&gt; [[Fortran]],&lt;ref name="Intel_2008_Fortran"/&gt; [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]],&lt;ref name="Haskell"/&gt; [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]]&lt;ref name="Julia"/&gt;), and operating systems (including [[Windows]], [[Linux]],&lt;ref name="Intel_2008_Fortran"/&gt; [[macOS]] and [[HP-UX]]&lt;ref name="HP_2007_UX"/&gt;). Depending on the platform the fused operation is about twice as fast as calling the sine and cosine functions individually.&lt;ref name="D_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rationale_2003_C"/&gt;

==Relation to the complex exponential function==
The [[complex exponential function]] can be expressed

:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein_cis"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-ix} = \cos(-x) + i\sin(-x) = \cos(x) - i\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi} = -1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1}}.

This can also be expressed using the following notation

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cis}(x) = \cos(x) + i\sin(x),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein_cis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons_2014_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rationale_2003_C"/&gt;

i.e.. "{{math|cis}}" abbreviates "{{math|cos + ''i'' sin}}".

Though at first glance this notation is redundant, being equivalent to {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, its use is rooted in several advantages, such as being directly tied to the polar form of a complex number (and being easier to grasp).

== Mathematical identities ==

===Derivative===

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\operatorname{cis}(z) = i\operatorname{cis}(z) = ie^{iz}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein_cis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs_2011_2"/&gt;

=== Integral ===
:&lt;math&gt;\int\operatorname{cis}(z)\,\mathrm{d}z = -i\operatorname{cis}(z) = -ie^{iz}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein_cis"/&gt;

=== Other properties ===
These follow directly from [[Euler's formula]].

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cis}(x+y) = \operatorname{cis}(x)\,\operatorname{cis}(y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs_2011_1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cis}(x-y) = {\operatorname{cis}(x) \over \operatorname{cis}(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

The identities above hold if {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are any complex numbers. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are real, then
:&lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{cis}(x) - \operatorname{cis}(y)| \le |x-y|.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs_2011_1"/&gt;

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}

This notation was more common in the post–World War II era, when typewriters were used to convey mathematical expressions.

Superscripts are both offset vertically and smaller than '{{math|cis}}' or '{{math|exp}}'; hence, they can be problematic even for hand-writing, for example, {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} versus {{math|cis(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} or {{math|exp(''ix''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. For many readers, {{math|cis(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is the clearest, easiest to read of the three.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The {{math|cis}} notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another. The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas {{math|cis(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}} notations emphasize the parts. This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a [[mnemonic]] (for {{math|cos + ''i'' sin}}).

The {{math|cis}} notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding does not yet permit the notation {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;''}}.  As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math they are not yet prepared for: the usual proof that {{math|cis(''x'') {{=}} ''e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;''}} requires [[calculus]], which the student may not have studied before they encountered the expression {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}}.

In 1942, inspired by the {{math|cis}} notation, [[Ralph V. L. Hartley]] introduced the {{math|[[cas (mathematics)|cas]]}} (for ''cosine-and-sine'') function for the real-valued [[Hartley kernel]], a meanwhile established shortcut in conjunction with [[Hartley transform]]s:&lt;ref name="Hartley_1942"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1999"/&gt;

{{math|cas(''x'') {{=}} cos(''x'') + sin(''x'')}}.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Hasse diagram]] of the [[power set]] of three elements, [[Partial order|partially ordered]] by [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]].]]

In [[mathematics]], especially [[order theory]], the '''covering relation''' of a [[partially ordered set]] is the [[binary relation]] which holds between [[comparability|comparable]] elements that are immediate neighbours. The covering relation is commonly used to graphically express the partial order by means of the [[Hasse diagram]].

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set with a partial order &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;.
As usual, let &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; be the relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x\le y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\neq y&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; '''covers''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;x\lessdot y&lt;/math&gt;,
if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y&lt;/math&gt; and there is no element &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; covers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; if the [[partially ordered set#Interval|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt; is the two-element set &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;x\lessdot y&lt;/math&gt;, it is said that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Some authors also use the term cover to denote any such pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in the covering relation.

== Examples ==

* In a finite [[linearly ordered]] set {1, 2, ..., ''n''}, ''i'' + 1 covers ''i'' for all ''i'' between 1 and ''n'' − 1 (and there are no other covering relations).
* In the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of the [[power set]] of a set ''S'', a subset ''B'' of ''S'' covers a subset ''A'' of ''S'' if and only if ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding one element not in ''A''.
* In [[Young's lattice]], formed by the [[partition (number theory)|partitions]] of all nonnegative integers, a partition ''λ'' covers a partition ''μ'' if and only if the [[Young diagram]] of ''λ'' is obtained from the Young diagram of ''μ'' by adding an extra cell.
* The Hasse diagram depicting the covering relation of a [[Tamari lattice]] is the [[n-skeleton|skeleton]] of an [[associahedron]].
* The covering relation of any finite [[distributive lattice]] forms a [[median graph]].
* On the [[real number]]s with the usual total order ≤, the cover set is empty: no number covers another.

== Properties ==
* If a partially ordered set is finite, its covering relation is the [[transitive reduction]] of the partial order relation.  Such partially ordered sets are therefore completely described by their Hasse diagrams.  On the other hand, in a [[dense order]], such as the [[rational number]]s with the standard order, no element covers another.

{{cquote|Un cristal possède deux propriétés charactéristiques: la rigidité, et la faculté de croitre,...|source = {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1966a}}|float=right|width=45%}}
In mathematics, '''crystals''' are [[cartesian section]]s of certain [[fibered categories]]. They were introduced  by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck|first=Alexander|last= Grothendieck|year=1966a}}, who named them crystals because in some sense they are "rigid" and "grow".  In particular quasicoherent crystals over the [[crystalline site]] are analogous to quasicoherent [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]. 

There are several variations of crystals, as follows:
*An '''isocrystal'''  is a crystal up to isogeny. They are [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] analogues of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;-adic étale [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]],  introduced by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1966a}} and {{harvs|txt|last1=Berthelot|last2=Ogus|year=1983}} (though the definition of isocrystal only appears in part II of this paper by {{harvtxt|Ogus|1984}}). Convergent isocrystals are a variation of isocrystals that work better over non-perfect fields, and overconvergent isocrystals are another variation related to overconvergent cohomology theories.
*A '''[[Dieudonné crystal]]''' is a crystal with Verschiebung and Frobenius maps. An [[F-crystal]] is a structure in semilinear algebra somewhat related to crystals.

==Crystals over the infinitesimal and crystalline sites==

The infinitesimal site Inf(''X''/''S'') has as objects the infinitesimal extensions of open sets of ''X''.
If ''X'' is a scheme over ''S'' then the sheaf ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by 
''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') = coordinate ring of ''T'', where we write ''T'' as an abbreviation for 
an object ''U''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''T'' of Inf(''X''/''S''). Sheaves on this site '''grow''' in the sense that they can be extended from open sets to infinitesimal extensions of open sets. 

A '''crystal''' on the site Inf(''X''/''S'') is a sheaf ''F'' of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''S''&lt;/sub&gt; modules that is '''rigid''' in the following sense:
:for any map ''f'' between objects ''T'', ''T''&amp;prime; of Inf(''X''/''S''), the natural map from ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''F''(''T'') to ''F''(''T''&amp;prime;) is an isomorphism.
This is similar to the definition of a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] of modules in the Zariski topology.

An example of a crystal is the sheaf ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Crystals on the crystalline site are defined in a similar way.

==Crystals in fibered categories==

In general, if ''E'' is a fibered category over ''F'', then a crystal is a cartesian section of the fibered category. In the special case when ''F'' is the category of infinitesimal extensions of a scheme ''X'' and ''E'' the category of quasicoherent modules over objects of ''F'', then crystals of this fibered category are the same as crystals of the infinitesimal site.

==Origins of Soviet Cybernetics==
It first made its impact in 1953 when three things happened:
* An anonymous article "Whom Does Cybernetics Serve?" appeared in [[Problems of philosophy (magazine)|''Voprosy filosofii'']] (Questions of Philosophy) in which it was denounced as a "misanthropic pseudo-theory" which "is one of those  pseudosciences which are generated by contemporary imperialism and are doomed to failure even before the downfall of imperialism."&lt;ref name="L&amp;M"/&gt;
* The [[BESM]] computer, completed in 1952, was becoming operational
*[[Stalin]] died

==Notable Soviet cyberneticists==
* [[Aksel Berg]] (1893-1979)
* [[Leonid Kraizmer]] (1912-2002)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5175">In [[differential geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]], an '''Einstein manifold''' is a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] [[differentiable manifold]] whose [[Ricci tensor]] is proportional to the [[Metric tensor|metric]]. They are named after [[Albert Einstein]] because this condition is equivalent to saying that the metric is a solution of the [[vacuum]] [[Einstein field equations]] (with [[cosmological constant]]), although both the dimension and the signature of the metric can be arbitrary, thus not being restricted to the four-dimensional [[Lorentzian manifold]]s usually studied in [[general relativity]].

If ''M'' is the underlying ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]] and ''g'' is its [[metric tensor]] the Einstein condition means that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ric} = kg&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant ''k'', where Ric denotes the [[Ricci tensor]] of ''g''. Einstein manifolds with {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 0}} are called [[Ricci-flat manifold]]s.

==The Einstein condition and Einstein's equation==

In local coordinates the condition that {{nowrap|(''M'', ''g'')}} be an Einstein manifold is simply

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ab} = kg_{ab} .&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the trace of both sides reveals that the constant of proportionality ''k'' for Einstein manifolds is related to the [[scalar curvature]] ''R'' by

:&lt;math&gt;R = nk ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the dimension of ''M''.

In [[general relativity]], [[Einstein's equation]] with a [[cosmological constant]] &amp;Lambda; is

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ab} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ab}R + g_{ab}\Lambda = 8\pi T_{ab}, &lt;/math&gt;

written in [[geometrized units]] with {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''c'' = 1}}. The [[stress–energy tensor]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; gives the matter and energy content of the underlying spacetime. In [[vacuum]] (a region of spacetime devoid of matter) {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, and Einstein's equation can be rewritten in the form (assuming that {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;gt; 2}}):
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ab} = \frac{2\Lambda}{n-2}\,g_{ab} .&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, vacuum solutions of Einstein's equation are (Lorentzian) Einstein manifolds with ''k'' proportional to the cosmological constant.

== Examples ==

Simple examples of Einstein manifolds include:

*Any manifold with [[constant sectional curvature]] is an Einstein manifold&amp;mdash;in particular:
** [[Euclidean space]], which is flat, is a simple example of Ricci-flat, hence Einstein metric.
** The [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]], &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;, with the round metric is Einstein with &lt;math&gt;k=n-1&lt;/math&gt;.
** [[Hyperbolic space]] with the canonical metric is Einstein with negative &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Complex projective space]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{CP}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[Fubini–Study metric]].
* [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s admit an Einstein metric that is also [[Kähler metric|Kähler]], with Einstein constant &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;. Such metrics are not unique, but rather come in families; there is a Calabi–Yau metric in every Kähler class, and the metric also depends on the choice of complex structure. For example, there is a 60-parameter family of such metrics on K3, 57 parameters of which give rise to Einstein metrics which are not related by isometries or rescalings.

A necessary condition for [[closed manifold|closed]], [[oriented]], [[4-manifold]]s to be Einstein is satisfying the [[Hitchin–Thorpe inequality]].

==Applications==

Four dimensional Riemannian Einstein manifolds are also important in mathematical physics as [[gravitational instantons]] in [[quantum gravity|quantum theories of gravity]]. The term "gravitational instanton" is usually used restricted to Einstein 4-manifolds whose [[Weyl tensor]] is self-dual, and it is usually assumed that the metric is asymptotic to the standard metric of Euclidean 4-space (and are therefore [[complete metric|complete]] but [[compact space|non-compact]]). In differential geometry, self-dual Einstein 4-manifolds are also known as (4-dimensional) [[hyperkähler manifold]]s in the Ricci-flat case, and [[quaternion Kähler manifold]]s otherwise.

Higher-dimensional Lorentzian Einstein manifolds are used in modern theories of gravity, such as [[string theory]], [[M-theory]] and [[supergravity]]. Hyperkähler and quaternion Kähler manifolds (which are special kinds of Einstein manifolds) also have applications in physics as target spaces for [[nonlinear σ-model]]s with [[supersymmetry]].

Compact Einstein manifolds have been much studied in differential geometry, and many examples are known, although constructing them is often challenging. Compact Ricci-flat manifolds are particularly difficult to find: in the monograph on the subject by the pseudonymous author [[Arthur Besse]], readers are offered a meal in a [[Michelin star|starred restaurant]] in exchange for a new example.

In [[statistics]], the '''empirical characteristic function''' is a numerically calculated approximation to the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]].

If &lt;math&gt;X_i, i=1,2,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt; are i.i.d. observations, then the empirical characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi_n(t)=\frac 1 n \sum_{j=1}^n \exp(it X_j).
&lt;/math&gt;

It is useful in estimation theory and hypothesis testing.

In [[geometry]], the '''Euler line''', named after [[Leonhard Euler]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔɪ|l|ər}}), is a [[line (mathematics)|line]] determined from any [[triangle]] that is not [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]]. It is a [[Central line (geometry)|central line]] of the triangle, and it
passes through several important points determined from the triangle, including the [[orthocenter]], the [[circumcenter]], the [[centroid]], the [[Exeter point]] and the center of the [[nine-point circle]] of the triangle.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite journal

The concept of a triangle's Euler line extends to the Euler line of other shapes, such as the [[quadrilateral]] and the [[tetrahedron]].

&lt;/ref&gt; This property is also true for another [[triangle center]], the [[nine-point center]], although it had not been defined in Euler's time. In equilateral triangles, these four points coincide, but in any other triangle they are all distinct from each other, and the Euler line is determined by any two of them.

Other notable points that lie on the Euler line include the [[de Longchamps point]], the [[Schiffler point]], the [[Exeter point]], and the [[Gossard perspector]].&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; However, the [[incenter]] generally does not lie on the Euler line;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lR0SDnl2bPwC&amp;pg=PA4 | title=Geometry Turned On: Dynamic Software in Learning, Teaching, and Research | publisher=The Mathematical Association of America |author1=Schattschneider, Doris |author2=King, James | year=1997 | pages=3–4 | isbn=978-0883850992}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is on the Euler line only for [[isosceles triangle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[tangential triangle]] of a reference triangle is tangent to the latter's [[circumcircle]] at the reference triangle's vertices.

===A vector proof===
Let &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt; be a triangle. A proof of the fact that the [[circumscribed circle|circumcenter]] &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, the [[centroid]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the [[altitude (triangle)|orthocenter]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are '''collinear''' relies on [[euclidean vector|free vectors]]. We start by stating the prerequisites. First, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{GA}+\vec{GB}+\vec{GC}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from the fact that the [[barycentric coordinate system|absolute barycentric coordinates]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}:\frac{1}{3}:\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Further, the [[altitude (triangle)|problem of Sylvester]]&lt;ref name=Dorrie&gt;D&amp;#246;rrie, Heinrich, "100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics. Their History and Solution". Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1965, {{ISBN|0-486-61348-8}}, pages 141 (Euler's Straight Line) and 142 (Problem of Sylvester)&lt;/ref&gt; reads as

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{OH}=\vec{OA}+\vec{OB}+\vec{OC}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, using the vector addition, we deduce that

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{GO}=\vec{GA}+\vec{AO}\,\mbox{(in triangle }AGO\mbox{)},\,\vec{GO}=\vec{GB}+\vec{BO}\,\mbox{(in triangle }BGO\mbox{)},\,\vec{GO}=\vec{GC}+\vec{CO}\,\mbox{(in triangle }CGO\mbox{)}.&lt;/math&gt;

By adding these three relations, term by term, we obtain that

:&lt;math&gt;3\cdot\vec{GO}=\left(\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle\rm cyclic}\vec{GA}\right)+\left(\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle\rm cyclic}\vec{AO}\right)=0-\left(\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle\rm cyclic}\vec{OA}\right)=-\vec{OH}.&lt;/math&gt;

In conclusion, &lt;math&gt;3\cdot\vec{OG}=\vec{OH}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the three points &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (in this order) are collinear.

In D&amp;#246;rrie's book,&lt;ref name=Dorrie /&gt; the '''Euler line''' and the '''problem of Sylvester''' are put together into a single proof. However, most of the proofs of the problem of Sylvester rely on the fundamental properties of free vectors, independently of the Euler line.

===Distances between centers===

On the Euler line the centroid ''G'' is between the circumcenter ''O'' and the orthocenter ''H'' and is twice as far from the orthocenter as it is from the circumcenter:&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover Publications, 2007 (orig. Barnes &amp; Noble 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.102}}

:&lt;math&gt;GH=2GO;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;OH=3GO.&lt;/math&gt;

The segment ''GH'' is a diameter of the [[orthocentroidal circle]].

The center ''N'' of the nine-point circle lies along the Euler line midway between the orthocenter and the circumcenter:&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ON = NH, \quad OG =2\cdot GN, \quad NH=3GN.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the Euler line could be repositioned on a number line with the circumcenter ''O'' at the location 0, the centroid ''G'' at 2''t'', the nine-point center at 3''t'', and the orthocenter ''H'' at 6''t'' for some scale factor ''t''.

Furthermore, the squared distance between the centroid and the circumcenter along the Euler line is less than the squared [[circumradius]] ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by an amount equal to one-ninth the sum of the squares of the side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'':&lt;ref name="ac"/&gt;{{rp|p.71}}

:&lt;math&gt;GO^2=R^2-\tfrac{1}{9}(a^2+b^2+c^2).&lt;/math&gt;

In addition,&lt;ref name="ac"/&gt;{{rp|p.102}}

:&lt;math&gt;OH^2=9R^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2);&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;GH^2=4R^2-\tfrac{4}{9}(a^2+b^2+c^2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Representation==

===Equation===

Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' denote the vertex angles of the reference triangle, and let ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' be a variable point in [[trilinear coordinates]]; then an equation for the Euler line is

:&lt;math&gt;\sin (2A) \sin(B - C)x + \sin (2B) \sin(C - A)y + \sin (2C) \sin(A - B)z = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

An equation for the Euler line in [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha :\beta :\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J.A., "Some examples of the use of areal coordinates in triangle geometry", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 83, November 1999, 472-477.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\tan C -\tan B)\alpha +(\tan A -\tan C)\beta + (\tan B -\tan A)\gamma =0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Parametric representation===

Another way to represent the Euler line is in terms of a parameter ''t''.  Starting with the circumcenter (with trilinear coordinates &lt;math&gt;\cos A : \cos B : \cos C&lt;/math&gt;) and the orthocenter (with trilinears &lt;math&gt;\sec A : \sec B : \sec C = \cos B \cos C : \cos C \cos A : \cos A \cos B),&lt;/math&gt;every point on the Euler line, except the orthocenter, is given by the trilinear coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\cos A + t \cos B \cos C : \cos B + t \cos C \cos A : \cos C + t \cos A \cos B&lt;/math&gt;
formed as a [[linear combination]] of the trilinears of these two points, for some ''t''.

For example:
* The [[circumcenter]] has trilinears &lt;math&gt;\cos A:\cos B:\cos C,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the parameter value &lt;math&gt;t=0.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[centroid]] has trilinears &lt;math&gt;\cos A + \cos B \cos C : \cos B + \cos C \cos A : \cos C + \cos A \cos B,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the parameter value &lt;math&gt;t=1.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[nine-point center]] has trilinears &lt;math&gt;\cos A + 2 \cos B \cos C : \cos B + 2 \cos C \cos A : \cos C + 2 \cos A \cos B,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the parameter value &lt;math&gt;t=2.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[de Longchamps point]] has trilinears &lt;math&gt;\cos A - \cos B \cos C : \cos B - \cos C \cos A : \cos C - \cos A \cos B,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the parameter value &lt;math&gt;t=-1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Slope===

In a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], denote the slopes of the sides of a triangle as &lt;math&gt;m_1,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;m_2,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_3,&lt;/math&gt; and denote the slope of its Euler line as &lt;math&gt;m_E&lt;/math&gt;.  Then these slopes are related according to&lt;ref name=BHS&gt;Wladimir G. Boskoff, Laurent¸iu Homentcovschi, and Bogdan D. Suceava, "Gossard’s Perspector and Projective Consequences", ''Forum Geometricorum'', Volume 13 (2013), 169–184. [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2013volume13/FG201318.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Lemma 1}}

:&lt;math&gt;m_1m_2 + m_1m_3 + m_1m_E + m_2m_3 + m_2m_E + m_3m_E&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; + 3m_1m_2m_3m_E + 3 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the slope of the Euler line (if finite) is expressible in terms of the slopes of the sides as

:&lt;math&gt;m_E=-\frac{m_1m_2 + m_1m_3 + m_2m_3 + 3}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + 3m_1m_2m_3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the Euler line is parallel to an acute triangle's side ''BC'' if and only if&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|p.173}} &lt;math&gt;\tan B \tan C = 3.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to inscribed equilateral triangles==

The locus of the centroids of [[equilateral triangle]]s inscribed in a given triangle is formed by two lines perpendicular to the given triangle's Euler line.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Francisco Javier Garc ́ıa Capita ́n, "Locus of Centroids of Similar Inscribed Triangles", ''[[Forum Geometricorum]]'' 16, 2016, 257–267 .http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2016volume16/FG201631.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Coro. 4}}

==In special triangles==

===Right triangle===

In a [[right triangle]], the Euler line coincides with the [[median (triangle)|median]] to the [[hypotenuse]]&amp;mdash;that is, it goes through both the right-angled vertex and the midpoint of the side opposite that vertex. This is because the right triangle's orthocenter, the intersection of its [[Altitude (triangle)|altitudes]], falls on the right-angled vertex while its circumcenter, the intersection of its [[Bisection#Perpendicular bisectors|perpendicular bisectors]] of sides, falls on the midpoint of the hypotenuse.

===Isosceles triangle===

The Euler line of an [[isosceles triangle]] coincides with the [[axis of symmetry]]. In an isosceles triangle the [[incenter]] falls on the Euler line.

===Automedian triangle===

The Euler line of an [[automedian triangle]] (one whose [[median (geometry)|medians]] are in the same proportions, though in the opposite order, as the sides) is perpendicular to one of the medians.&lt;ref name="parry"&gt;{{citation

===Systems of triangles with concurrent Euler lines===

Consider a triangle ''ABC'' with [[Fermat–Torricelli point]]s ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The Euler lines of the 10 triangles with vertices chosen from ''A, B, C, F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] at the centroid of triangle ''ABC''.&lt;ref&gt;Beluhov, Nikolai Ivanov. "Ten concurrent Euler lines", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 9, 2009, pp. 271–274. http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2009volume9/FG200924index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euler lines of the four triangles formed by an [[orthocentric system]] (a set of four points such that each is the [[orthocenter]] of the triangle with vertices at the other three points) are concurrent at the [[nine-point center]] common to all of the triangles.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;{{rp|p.111}}

==Generalizations==

===Quadrilateral===

In a [[Quadrilateral#Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral|convex quadrilateral]], the quasiorthocenter ''H'', the "area centroid" ''G'', and the [[quasicircumcenter]] ''O'' are [[collinear]] in this order on the Euler line, and ''HG'' = 2''GO''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 6
 | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tetrahedron===
{{Main article|Tetrahedron#Properties analogous to those of a triangle}}

A [[tetrahedron]] is a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] object bounded by four triangular [[face (geometry)|faces]].  Seven lines associated with a tetrahedron are concurrent at its centroid; its six midplanes intersect at its [[Monge point]]; and there is a circumsphere passing through all of the vertices, whose center is the circumcenter. These points define the "Euler line" of a tetrahedron analogous to that of a triangle. The centroid is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter along this line. The center of the [[twelve-point sphere]] also lies on the Euler line.

===Simplicial polytope===

A [[simplicial polytope]] is a polytope whose facets are all [[simplex|simplices]]. For example, every polygon is a simplicial polytope. The Euler line associated to such a polytope is the line determined by its centroid and [[circumcenter of mass]]. This definition of an Euler line generalizes the ones above.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a polygon. The Euler line &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is sensitive to the symmetries of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the following ways:

1. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has a line of reflection symmetry &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is either &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; or a point on &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

2. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has a center of rotational symmetry &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;E=C&lt;/math&gt;.

3. If all but one of the sides of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; have equal length, then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to the last side.

New possibilities opened up by the concept of [[four-dimensional space]] (and difficulties involved in trying to visualize it) helped inspire many modern artists in the first half of the twentieth century. Early [[Cubists]], [[Surrealists]], [[Futurists]], and [[Abstract art|abstract]] artists took ideas from higher-dimensional mathematics and used them to radically advance their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/fourth-dimension-and-non-euclidean-geometry-modern-art |title=Overview of ''The Fourth Dimension And Non-Euclidean Geometry In Modern Art, Revised Edition'' |first1=Linda Dalrymple|last1=Henderson |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French [[mathematician]] [[Maurice Princet]] was known as "le mathématicien du cubisme" ("the mathematician of cubism").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Décimo |first=Marc |title=Maurice Princet, Le Mathématicien du Cubisme |year=2007 |publisher=Éditions L'Echoppe |location=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-84068-191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An associate of the [[School of Paris]], a group of [[Avant-garde|avant-gardists]] including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jean Metzinger]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]], Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to the cubists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]] during the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Arthur I. |title=Einstein, Picasso: space, time, and beauty that causes havoc |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2001 |type=Print|page=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet introduced Picasso to [[Esprit Jouffret]]'s ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''Science and Hypothesis'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'' in 1910 was an important work for the artist, who spent many months shaping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |page=28 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait bears similarities to Jouffret's work and shows a distinct movement away from the [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] [[fauvism]] displayed in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', to a more considered analysis of space and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought  |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print|pages=28–30 |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cubist [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]] wrote an article entitled "In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View", for [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s July 1910 issue of ''[[Camera Work]]''. In the piece, Weber states, "In plastic art, I believe, there is a fourth dimension which may be described as the consciousness of a great and overwhelming sense of space-magnitude in all directions at one time, and is brought into existence through the three known measurements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Weber |authorlink=Max Weber |year=1910 |title=In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View |journal= [[Camera Work]]|volume= 31|issue= July 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on the School of Paris was that of [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Albert Gleizes]], both painters and theoreticians. The first major treatise written on the subject of Cubism was their 1912 collaboration ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', which says that:&lt;blockquote&gt; "If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidian mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of [[Bernhard Riemann#Euclidean geometry versus Riemannian geometry|Riemann's theorems]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Du "Cubisme" (Edition Figuière)| first1=Albert| first2= Jean| last1=Gleizes |last2=Metzinger |authorlink1=Albert Gleizes |authorlink2=Jean Metzinger |location=Paris|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American modernist painter and photographer [[Morton Livingston Schamberg]] wrote in 1910 two letters to [[Walter Pach]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Walter Pach in Paris, 29 December 1910, Pach Papers, Reel: 4216, fr. 856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Pach in Paris, 29
December 1910, fr. 857&lt;/ref&gt; parts of which were published in a review of the [[Armory Show|1913 Armory Show]] for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morton Livingston Schamberg, "Post-Impression Exhibit Awaited", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 January 1913, col. 2, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; about the influence of the fourth dimension on avant-garde painting; describing how the artists' employed "harmonic use of forms" distinguishing between the "representation or rendering of space and the designing in space":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oja|first1=Carol J.|title=Making Music Modern: New York in the 1920s|page=84|year=2000, February 2003|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA}}{{ISBN|9780195162578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we still further add to design in the third dimension, a consideration of weight, pressure, resistance, movement, as distinguished from motion, we arrive at what may legitimately be called design in the fourth dimension, or the harmonic use of what may arbitrarily be called volume. It is only at this point that we can appreciate the masterly productions of such a man as Cézanne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/33294 Jill Anderson Kyle, ''Cézanne and American Painting 1900 to 1920''], The University of Texas at Austin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired the Cubists to experiment with [[simultaneity]], complex multiple views of the same subject, as observed from differing viewpoints at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensionist manifesto==
In 1936 in Paris, [[Charles Sirato|Charles Tamkó Sirató]] published his ''Manifeste Dimensioniste'',&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artpool.hu/TamkoSirato/manifest.html |title=Dimensionist Manifesto |first1=Charles Tamkó |last1=Sirató |location=Paris |year=1936 |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described how {{quote|the Dimensionist tendency has led to: 
# Literature leaving the line and entering the plane. 
# Painting leaving the plane and entering space.
# Sculpture stepping out of closed, immobile forms.
# …The artistic conquest of four-dimensional space, which to date has been completely art-free.}}

The manifesto was signed by many prominent modern artists worldwide. [[Hans Arp]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and Marcel Duchamp amongst others added their names in Paris, then a short while later it was endorsed by artists abroad including [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Joan Miró]], [[David Kakabadze]], [[Alexander Calder]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"/&gt;

The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] describes the painting as a "new interpretation of an oft-depicted subject. ..[showing] Christ's spiritual triumph over corporeal harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/210009107 |title= ''Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)'' |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geometric magic square''', often abbreviated to '''geomagic square''', is a generalization of [[magic squares]] invented by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2001. A traditional magic square is a square array of numbers (almost always positive integers) whose sum taken in any row, any column, or in either diagonal is the same ''target number''. A geomagic square, on the other hand, is a square array of geometrical shapes in which those appearing in each row, column, or diagonal can be fitted together to create an identical shape called the ''target shape''.  As with numerical types, it is required that the entries in a geomagic square be distinct. Similarly, the eight trivial variants of any square resulting from its rotation and/or reflection, are all counted as the same square. By the ''dimension'' of a geomagic square is meant the dimension of the pieces it uses. Hitherto interest has focused mainly on 2D squares using planar pieces, but pieces of any dimension are permitted.

==Examples==
Figure 1 above shows a 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 geomagic square. The 3 pieces occupying each row, column and diagonal pave a rectangular target, as seen at left and right, and above and below. Here the 9 pieces are all [[decomino]]es, but pieces of any shape may appear, and it is not a requirement that they be of same size. In Figure 2, for instance, the pieces are polyominoes of consecutive sizes from 1 up to 9 units. The target is a 4 by 4 square with an inner square hole.

Surprisingly, computer investigations show that Figure 2 is just one among 4,370 distinct 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 geomagic squares using pieces with these same sizes and same target.  Conversely, Figure 1 is one of only two solutions using similar-sized pieces and identical target. In general, repeated piece sizes imply fewer solutions. However, at present there exists no theoretical underpinning to explain these empirical findings.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The pieces in a geomagic square may also be ''disjoint'', or composed of separated islands, as seen in Figure 3. Since they can be placed so as to mutually overlap, disjoint pieces are often able to tile areas that connected pieces cannot. The rewards of this extra pliancy are often to be seen in geomagics that possess symmetries denied to numerical specimens.&lt;ref name=mathent/&gt;

Besides squares using planar shapes, there exist 3D specimens, the cells of which contain solid pieces that will combine to form the same constant solid target. Figure 5 shows an example in which the target is a cube.

==History==
A well-known formula due to the mathematician [[Édouard Lucas]] characterizes the structure of every 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 magic square of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/28049/new_page_5.htm "Alphamagic Squares", thinkquest.org:Magic of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sallows, already the author of original work in this area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magic-squares.net/square-update.htm "New advances with 4 × 4 magic squares" by Lee Sallows]&lt;/ref&gt; had long speculated that the Lucas formula might contain hidden potential.&lt;ref&gt;Sallows, pp 3 and 91&lt;/ref&gt;  This surmise was confirmed in 1997 when he published a short paper that examined squares using complex numbers, a ploy leading to a new theorem that correlated every 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 magic square with a unique parallelogram on the complex plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multimagie.com/Sallows.pdf "The Lost Theorem" by Lee Sallows] ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' Vol 19, No. 4, pp 51-4, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing in the same vein, a decisive next step was to interpret the variables in the Lucas formula as standing for geometrical forms, an outlandish idea that led directly to the concept of a geomagic square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cp4space.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/geomagic-squares/ Complex Projective 4-Space Where exciting things happen: Geomagic squares]&lt;/ref&gt;
It turned out to be an unexpected consequence of this find that traditional magic squares now became revealed as one-dimensional geomagic squares.

Other researchers also took notice. [[Charles Ashbacher]], co-editor of the [[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]], speaks of the field of magic squares being "dramatically expanded"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/geometric-magic-squares ''Geometric Magic Squares'' reviewed by Charles Ashbacher] [[Mathematical Association of America]], September 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Peter Cameron (mathematician)|Peter Cameron]], winner of the London Mathematical Society's [[Whitehead Prize]] and joint winner of the [[Euler Medal]], called geomagic squares "a wonderful new piece of recreational maths, which will delight non-mathematicians and give mathematicians food for thought."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/03/magic-squares-geomagic-lee-sallows "Magic squares are given a whole new dimension"], by Alex Bellos, ''[[The Observer]]'', April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics writer [[Alex Bellos]] said, "To come up with this after thousands of years of study of magic squares is pretty amazing."&lt;ref name=newscientist&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20017-ancient-puzzle-gets-new-lease-of-geomagical-life.html "Ancient puzzle gets new lease of 'geomagical' life"] by Jacob Aron, ''[[New Scientist]]'', January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be asked whether geomagic squares might have applications outside the study of puzzles. Cameron is convinced of it, saying, "I can immediately see a lot of things I'd like to do with this."&lt;ref name=newscientist/&gt;

== Methods of construction ==
Trivial examples excepted, there are no known easy methods for producing geomagic squares. To date, two approaches have been explored.&lt;ref&gt;Sallows, pp 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the pieces to be used are ''[[polyform]]s'', or shapes built up from repeated units, an exhaustive search by computer becomes possible.

In the case of Figure 1, for instance, a first step would be to decide on the piece sizes to be used (in this case all the same), and the shape of the desired target. An initial program would then be able to generate a list ''L'' corresponding to every possible tiling of this target shape by 3 distinct decominoes (polyominoes of size 10). Each decomino is represented by a unique integer, so that ''L'' will consist of a list of integer triads. A subsequent routine can then run through and test every combination of three different triads in turn. The test will consist in treating the candidate triads as the row entries in a 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 square, and then checking to see whether the columns and diagonals thus formed each contain 3 integers that are also in ''L''—which is to say, are also target-tiling triads. If so, a 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 geomagic square using 9 decominoes and selected target has been identified. If this fails, alternative target shapes can be tried. An elaborated version of the same method can be used to search for larger squares, or for squares including differently-sized pieces.

An alternative method of construction begins with a trivial geomagic square showing repeated pieces, the shapes of which are then modified so as to render each distinct, but without disrupting the square's magic property. This is achieved by means of an algebraic template such as seen below, the distinct variables in which are then interpreted as different shapes to be either appended to or excised from the initial pieces, depending on their sign.
[[File:Geomagic square - Magic Jigsaw.jpg|thumb|right| text-bottom |260px|Figure 4: {{pad|.2em}}  A 'self-interlocking' geomagic square]]
Figure 4 illustrates such a geometrical interpretation of the template in which
''k'' is interpreted as a small square shape, while ''a'',''b'',''c'' and ''d'' represent the protrusions (+) and/or indentations (-) by means of which it becomes modified so as to result in 16 distinct jigsaw pieces.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 k+a+b &amp; k-a+d &amp; k-c-d &amp; k-b+c \\
\hline
 k+a-b &amp; k-a-d &amp; k-c+d &amp; k+b+c \\
\hline
 k-a-b &amp; k+a-d &amp; k+c+d &amp; k+b-c \\
\hline
 k-a+b &amp; k+a+d &amp; k+c-d &amp; k-b-c \\
\hline
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to traditional magic squares==
Contrary to the impression made at first sight, it is a misunderstanding to regard the term 'geomagic square' as referring to some category of magic square. In fact the exact opposite is the case: every (additive) magic square is a particular instance of a geomagic square, but never vice versa. The point is made clear by the example below that appears in a wide-ranging article on geomagic squares by [[Jean-Paul Delahaye]] in ''[[:fr:Pour la Science|Pour la Science]]'', the French version of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref name=PourlaScience&gt;[https://www.pourlascience.fr/sd/mathematiques/les-carres-magiques-geometriques-7372.php Les carrés magiques géométriques] by Jean-Paul Delahaye, ''Pour La Science'' No. 428, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case the target "shape" for the geomagic square at right is simply a one dimensional line segment 15 units long, the pieces again being no more than straight line segments. As such, the latter is obviously a straightforward translation into geometrical terms of the numerical magic square at left.

As Delahaye says, "This example shows that the geomagic square concept generalizes magic squares. The result here is hardly spectacular, but happily there are other geomagic squares that are not the result of such a translation."&lt;ref name=PourlaScience/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cet exemple montre que la notion de carré géomagique généralise celle de carré magique. Le résultat n’est ici guère spectaculaire, mais heureusement, il existe d’autres carrés géomagiques ne provenant pas d’une telle traduction directe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The point being that every numerical magic square can be understood as a one-dimensional geomagic square as above.  Or as Sallows himself puts it, "Traditional magic squares featuring numbers are then revealed as that particular case of 'geomagic' squares in which the elements are all one-dimensional."&lt;ref name=mathent&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00283-011-9229-0.pdf Geometric Magic Squares by Lee Sallows], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', Vol 23, No. 4 Winter 2011, pp 25-31&lt;/ref&gt;  This however does not exhaust the 1D case, because there exist 1D geomagic squares whose components are ''disconnected'' line segments, and which do not correspond to any numerical magic square.  Thus, even in dimension one, the traditional types correspond to only a tiny subset of all geometric magic squares.

==Special types==
The richer structure of geomagic squares is reflected in the existence of specimens showing a far greater degree of 'magic' than is possible with numerical types. Thus a ''[[panmagic square]]'' is one in which every diagonal, including the so-called ''[[broken diagonal]]s'', shares the same magic property as the rows and columns.  However, it is easily shown that a panmagic square of size 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 is impossible to construct with numbers, whereas a geometric example can be seen in Figure 3. No comparable example using connected pieces has yet been reported.&lt;ref name=mathent/&gt;

{{clear}}
In addition to being geomagic, there exist squares with auxiliary properties making them even more distinctive. In Figure 6, for example, which is magic on rows and columns only, the 16 pieces form a so-called ''[[Self-tiling tile set]]''. Such a set is defined as any set of ''n'' distinct shapes, each of which can be tiled by smaller replicas of the complete set of ''n'' shapes.&lt;ref&gt;On Self-Tiling Tile Sets by Lee Sallows, ''Mathematics Magazine'', December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A second example is Figure 4, which is a so-called 'self-interlocking' geomagic square. Here the 16 pieces are no longer contained within separate cells, but  define the square cell shapes themselves, so as to mesh together to complete a square-shaped jigsaw.

==Geomagic squares in popular culture==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">In [[number theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''highly cototient number''' is a positive [[integer]] ''k'' which is above 1 and has more solutions to the [[equation]] 

:''x'' − φ(''x'') = ''k'', 

than any other integer below ''k'' and above 1. Here, φ is [[Euler's totient function]]. There are infinitely many solutions to the equation for ''k'' = [[1 (number)|1]] so this value is excluded in the definition. The first few highly cototient numbers are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A100827|name=Highly cototient numbers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[23 (number)|23]], [[35 (number)|35]], [[47 (number)|47]], [[59 (number)|59]], [[63 (number)|63]], [[83 (number)|83]], [[89 (number)|89]], [[113 (number)|113]], [[119 (number)|119]], [[167 (number)|167]], [[209 (number)|209]], [[269 (number)|269]], 299, 329, 389, 419, 509, 629, 659, 779, 839, 1049, 1169, 1259, 1469, 1649, 1679, 1889, ... {{OEIS|id=A100827}}

Many of the highly cototient numbers are odd. In fact, after 8, all the numbers listed above are odd, and after 167 all the numbers listed above are congruent to 29 [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 30.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The concept is somewhat analogous to that of [[highly composite number]]s. Just as there are infinitely many highly composite numbers, there are also infinitely many highly cototient numbers. Computations become harder, since [[integer factorization]] does, as the numbers get larger.

==Example==
The '''cototient''' of ''x'' is defined as ''x'' – φ(''x''), i.e. the number of positive integers less than or equal to ''x'' that have at least one prime factor in common with ''x''. For example, the cototient of 6 is 4 since these four positive integers have a [[prime factor]] in common with 6: 2, 3, 4, 6. The cototient of 8 is also 4, this time with these integers: 2, 4, 6, 8. There are exactly two numbers, 6 and 8, which have cototient 4. There are fewer numbers which have cototient 2 and cototient 3 (one number in each case), so 4 is a highly cototient number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9891">In mathematics, '''inertial manifolds''' are concerned with the long term behavior of the solutions of [[dissipative]] [[dynamical system]]s.  Inertial manifolds are finite-dimensional, smooth, [[invariant manifold]]s that contain the global [[attractor]] and attract all solutions [[exponential growth|exponentially]] quickly.  Since an inertial manifold is [[Dimension (vector space)|finite-dimensional]] even if the original system is infinite-dimensional, and because most of the dynamics for the system takes place on the inertial manifold,  studying the dynamics on an inertial manifold produces a considerable simplification in the study of the dynamics of the original system.&lt;ref name="Temam1990"&gt;R. Temam. Inertial manifolds. ''Mathematical Intelligencer'', 12:68–74, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In many physical applications, inertial manifolds express an interaction law between the small and large wavelength structures.  Some say that the small wavelengths are enslaved by the large (e.g. [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]]).  Inertial manifolds may also appear as [[slow manifold]]s common in meteorology, or as the [[center manifold]] in any [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation]].  Computationally, numerical schemes for [[partial differential equation]]s seek to capture the long term dynamics and so such numerical schemes form an approximate inertial manifold.

==Introductory Example==

Consider the dynamical system in just two variables&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; and with parameter&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. Simple examples of the derivation of amplitude equations for systems of equations possessing bifurcations. ''J. Austral. Math. Soc. B'', 27:48--65, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt}=ap-pq\,,\qquad \frac{dq}{dt}=-q+p^2-2q^2.&lt;/math&gt;
* It possesses the one dimensional inertial manifold&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;q=p^2/(1+2a)&lt;/math&gt; (a parabola).
* This manifold is invariant under the dynamics because on the manifold&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt}
=\frac{d}{dt}\frac{p^2}{1+2a}
=\frac{2p\frac{dp}{dt}}{1+2a}
=\frac{2ap^2}{1+2a}-\frac{2p^4}{(1+2a)^2}&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as
:&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;-q+p^2-2q^2
=-\frac{p^2}{1+2a}+p^2-2\left(\frac{p^2}{1+2a}\right)^2
=\frac{2ap^2}{1+2a}-\frac{2p^4}{(1+2a)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The manifold&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; attracts all trajectories in some finite domain around the origin because near the origin&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt}\approx -q&lt;/math&gt;  (although the strict definition below requires attraction from all initial conditions).

Hence the long term behavior of the original two dimensional dynamical system is given by the 'simpler' one dimensional dynamics on the inertial manifold&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;, namely&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt}=ap-\frac1{1+2a}p^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; denote a solution of a dynamical system.  The solution&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; may be an evolving vector in &lt;math&gt;H=\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; or may be an evolving function in an infinite-dimensional [[Banach space]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

In many cases of interest the evolution of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is determined as the solution of a differential equation in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;{du}/{dt}=F(u(t))&lt;/math&gt; with initial value &lt;math&gt;u(0)=u_0&lt;/math&gt;.
In any case, we assume the solution of the dynamical system can be written in terms of a [[semigroup]] operator, or [[state transition matrix]], &lt;math&gt;S:H\to H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(t)=S(t)u_0&lt;/math&gt; for all times &lt;math&gt;t\geq0&lt;/math&gt; and all initial values&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;.
In some situations we might consider only discrete values of time as in the dynamics of a map.

An '''inertial manifold'''&lt;ref name="Temam1990"/&gt; for a dynamical semigroup&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth [[manifold]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; such that
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; is of finite dimension,
# &lt;math&gt;S(t)\mathcal M\subset\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; for all times&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t\geq0&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; attracts all solutions exponentially quickly, that is, for every initial value&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u_0\in H&lt;/math&gt; there exist constants&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c_j&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\text{dist}(S(t)u_0,\mathcal M)\leq c_1\exp(-c_2t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The restriction of the differential equation&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;du/dt=F(u)&lt;/math&gt; to the inertial manifold&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; is therefore a well defined finite-dimensional system called the '''inertial system'''.&lt;ref name="Temam1990"/&gt;
Subtly, there is a difference between a manifold being attractive, and solutions on the manifold being attractive.
Nonetheless, under appropriate conditions the inertial system possesses so-called '''asymptotic completeness''':&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Robinson. The asymptotic completeness of inertial manifolds. ''Nonlinearity'', 9:1325–1340, 1996. [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0951-7715/9/5/013]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, every solution of the differential equation has a companion solution lying in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and producing the same behavior for large time; in mathematics, for all&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; there exists&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v_0\in\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; and possibly a time shift&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\tau\geq0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\text{dist}(S(t)u_0,S(t+\tau)v_0)\to0&lt;/math&gt; as&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Researchers in the 2000s generalized such inertial manifolds to time dependent (nonautonomous) and/or stochastic dynamical systems (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;B. Schmalfuss and K. R. Schneider. Invariant manifolds for random dynamical systems with slow and fast variables. ''Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations'', 20(1):133–164, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Potzsche and M. Rasmussen. Computation of nonautonomous invariant and inertial manifolds. ''Numerische Mathematik'', 112(3):449–483, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Existence==

Existence results that have been proved address inertial manifolds that are expressible as a graph.&lt;ref name="Temam1990"/&gt;
The governing differential equation is rewritten more specifically in the form &lt;math&gt;du/dt+Au+f(u)=0&lt;/math&gt; for unbounded self-adjoint closed operator&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with domain&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D(A)\subset H&lt;/math&gt;, and nonlinear operator&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f:D(A)\to H&lt;/math&gt;.
Typically, elementary spectral theory gives an orthonormal basis of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; consisting of eigenvectors&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; v_j&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Av_j=\lambda_jv_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, for ordered eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\lambda_1\leq \lambda_2\leq\cdots&lt;/math&gt;.

For some given number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of modes, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;denotes the projection of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; onto the space spanned by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_m&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q=I-P&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;denotes the orthogonal projection onto the space spanned by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v_{m+1},v_{m+2},\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.
We look for an inertial manifold expressed as the graph&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Phi:PH\to QH&lt;/math&gt;.
For this graph to exist the most restrictive requirement is the '''spectral gap condition'''&lt;ref name="Temam1990"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{m+1}-\lambda_m \geq c(\sqrt{\lambda_{m+1}}+\sqrt{\lambda_m})&lt;/math&gt; where the constant&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; depends upon the system.
This spectral gap condition requires that the spectrum of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; must contain large gaps to be guaranteed of existence.

==Approximate inertial manifolds==
Several methods are proposed to construct approximations to
inertial manifolds,&lt;ref name="Temam1990"/&gt; including the
so-called ''intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds''.&lt;ref&gt;U.
Maas and S. B. Pope. Simplifying chemical kinetics:
intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds in composition space.
''Combustion and Flame'', 88:239–264, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bykov, I. Goldfarb, V. Goldshtein, and U. Maas. On a modified version of ILDM approach: asymptotic analysis based on integral manifolds. ''IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics'', 71:359–382, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular way to approximate follows from the
existence of a graph.
Define the&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; ''slow variables''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p(t)=Pu(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and the 'infinite'
''fast variables''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q(t)=Qu(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then project the differential equation
&lt;math&gt;du/dt+Au+f(u)=0&lt;/math&gt; onto both&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;PH&lt;/math&gt;
and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;QH&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the coupled system
&lt;math&gt;dp/dt+Ap+Pf(p+q)=0&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;dq/dt+Aq+Qf(p+q)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

For trajectories on the graph of an inertial
manifold&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the fast
variable&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q(t)=\Phi(p(t))&lt;/math&gt;.
Differentiating and using the coupled system form gives the
differential equation for the graph:
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{d\Phi}{dp}\left[Ap+Pf(p+\Phi(p))\right]
+A\Phi(p)+Qf(p+\Phi(p))=0.&lt;/math&gt;
This differential equation is typically solved approximately
in an asymptotic expansion in 'small'&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to
give an invariant manifold model,&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. The utility of
an invariant manifold description of the evolution of a

Such approaches to approximation of inertial manifolds are
very closely related to approximating [[center manifold]]s
for which a web service exists to construct approximations
for systems input by a
user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/gencm.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information flow''' in an [[information theory|information theoretical]] context is the transfer of information from a [[Random variable|variable]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to a variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in a given [[Stochastic process|process]]. Not all flows may be desirable; for example, a system should not leak any secret (partially or not) to public observers.{{Why|date=February 2018}}

== Introduction ==

Securing the data manipulated by computing systems has been a challenge in the past years. Several methods to limit the information disclosure exist today, such as [[access control list]]s, [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], and [[cryptography]]. However, although these methods do impose limits on the information that is released by a system, they provide no guarantees about information ''propagation''.&lt;ref name="sabelfeld03"&gt;Andrei Sabelfeld and Andrew C. Myers. Language-Based Information-Flow Security. IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 21(1), Jan. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, access control lists of file systems prevent unauthorized file access, but they do not control how the data is used afterwards. Similarly, cryptography provides a means to exchange information privately across a non-secure channel, but no
guarantees about the confidentiality of the data are given once it is decrypted.

In low level information flow analysis, each variable is usually assigned a security level. The basic model comprises two distinct levels: low and high, meaning, respectively, publicly observable information, and secret information. To ensure confidentiality, flowing information from high to low variables should not be allowed. On the other hand, to ensure integrity, flows to high variables should be restricted.&lt;ref name="sabelfeld03"/&gt;

More generally, the security levels can be viewed as a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] with information flowing only upwards in the lattice.&lt;ref name="denning76"&gt;Dorothy Denning. A lattice model of secure information flow. Communications of the ACM, 19(5):236-242, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, considering two security levels &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (low and high), if &lt;math&gt;L \le H&lt;/math&gt;, flows from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; would be allowed, while flows from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; would not.&lt;ref name="smith07"&gt;{{cite conference

Throughout this article, the following notation is used:
* variable &lt;math&gt;l \in L&lt;/math&gt; (low) shall denote a publicly observable variable
* variable &lt;math&gt;h \in H&lt;/math&gt; (high) shall denote a secret variable

Where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are the only two security levels in the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] being considered.

== Explicit flows and side channels ==

Information flows can be divided in two major categories. The simplest one is explicit flow, where some secret is explicitly leaked to a publicly observable variable. In the following example, the secret in the variable ''h'' flows into the publicly observable variable ''l''.

 '''var''' l, h
 l := h

The other flows fall into the [[Side channel attack|side channel]] category. For example, in the [[timing attack]] or in the [[Power analysis|power analysis attack]], the system leaks information through, respectively, the time or power it takes to perform an action depending on a secret value.

In the following example, the attacker can deduce if the value of ''h'' is one or not by the time the program takes to finish:

 '''var''' l, h
 '''if''' h = 1 '''then'''
   (* do some time-consuming work *)
 l := 0

Another side channel flow is the implicit information flow, which consists in leakage of information through the program control flow. The following program (implicitly) discloses the value of the secret variable ''h'' to the variable ''l''. In this case, since the ''h'' variable is boolean, all the bits of the variable of ''h'' is disclosed (at the end of the program, ''l'' will be 3 if ''h'' is true, and 42 otherwise).

 '''var''' l, h
 '''if''' h = true '''then'''
   l := 3
 '''else'''
   l := 42

== Non-interference ==
{{Main|Non-interference (security)}}

Non-interference is a policy that enforces that an attacker should not be able to distinguish two computations from their outputs if they only vary in their secret inputs.
However, this policy is too strict to be usable in realistic programs.&lt;ref name="sabelfeld05"/&gt; The classic example is a password checker program that, in order to be useful, needs to disclose some secret information: whether the input password is correct or not (note that the information that an attacker learns in case the program ''rejects'' the password is that the attempted password is ''not'' the valid one).

== Information flow control ==

A mechanism for ''information flow control'' is one that enforces information flow policies. Several methods to enforce information flow policies have been proposed. Run-time mechanisms that tag data with information flow labels have been employed at the operating system level and at the programming language level. Static program analyses have also been developed that ensure information flows within programs are in accordance with policies.

Both static and dynamic analysis for current programming languages have been developed. However, dynamic analysis techniques cannot observe all execution paths, and therefore cannot be both sound and precise. In order to guarantee noninterference, they either terminate executions that might release sensitive information&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Austin and Cormac Flanagan. Efficient purely-dynamic information flow analysis, Proc. of the ACM SIGPLAN Fourth Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security, ACM, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or they ignore updates that might leak information.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Fenton. Memoryless Subsystems, Comput. J. 17(2): 143-147 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent way to enforce information flow policies in a program is through a security type system: that is, a type system that enforces security properties. In such a sound type system, if a program type-checks, it meets the flow policy and therefore contains no improper information flows.

=== Security type system ===

In a programming language augmented with a security [[type system]] every expression carries both a type (such as boolean, or integer) and a security label.

Following is a simple security type system from &lt;ref name="sabelfeld03"/&gt; that enforces non-interference.
The notation &lt;math&gt;\;\vdash exp\;:\; \tau&lt;/math&gt; means that the expression &lt;math&gt;exp&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;[sc] \vdash C&lt;/math&gt; means that the command &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is typable in the security context &lt;math&gt;sc&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
[E1-2] \quad \vdash exp : high \qquad \frac{h \notin Vars(exp)}{\vdash exp \;:\; low}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
[C1-3] \quad [sc] \vdash \textbf{skip} \qquad [sc] \vdash h \;:=\; exp \qquad \frac{\vdash exp \;:\; low}{[low] \vdash l \;:=\; exp}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
[C4-5] \quad \frac{[sc] \vdash C_1 \quad [sc] \vdash C_2}{[sc] \vdash C_1\; ;\; C_2} \qquad \frac{\vdash exp \;:\; sc \quad [sc] \vdash C}{[sc] \vdash \textbf{while}\ exp\ \textbf{do}\ C}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
[C6-7] \quad \frac{\vdash exp \;:\; sc \quad [sc] \vdash C_1 \quad [sc] \vdash C_2}{[sc] \vdash \textbf{if}\ exp\ \textbf{then}\ C_1\ \textbf{else}\ C_2} \qquad \frac{[high] \vdash C}{[low] \vdash C}
&lt;/math&gt;

Well-typed commands include, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;[low] \vdash\ \textbf{if}\ l = 42\ \textbf{then}\ h\;:=\; 3\ \textbf{else}\ l\;:=\;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, the program
:&lt;math&gt;l\;:=\;0\ ;\ \textbf{while}\ l &lt; h\ \textbf{do}\ l\;:=\;l + 1&lt;/math&gt;
is ill-typed, as it will disclose the value of variable &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the rule &lt;math&gt;[C7]&lt;/math&gt; is a subsumption rule, which means that any command that is of security type &lt;math&gt;high&lt;/math&gt; can be also be &lt;math&gt;low&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;h:=1&lt;/math&gt; can be both &lt;math&gt;high&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;low&lt;/math&gt;. This is called [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in [[type theory]]. Similarly, the type of an expression &lt;math&gt;exp&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt;h \notin Vars(exp)&lt;/math&gt; can be both &lt;math&gt;high&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;low&lt;/math&gt; according to &lt;math&gt;[E1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[E2]&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

== Declassification ==

As shown previously, non-interference policy is too strict for use in most real-world applications.&lt;ref name="Zdancewic2004"&gt;S. Zdancewic. Challenges for information-flow security. In Workshop on the Programming Language Interference and Dependence (PLID’04) 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, several approaches to allow controlled releases of information have been devised. Such approaches are called information declassification.

Robust declassification requires that an active attacker may not manipulate the system in order to learn more secrets than what passive attackers already know.&lt;ref name="sabelfeld05"&gt;Andrei Sabelfeld and David Sands. Dimensions and Principles of Declassification. In Proc. of the IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information declassification constructs can be classified in four orthogonal dimensions: ''What'' information is released, ''Who'' is authorized to access the information, ''Where'' the information is released, and ''When'' is the information released.&lt;ref name="sabelfeld05"/&gt;

=== What ===

A ''what'' declassification policy controls which information (partial or not) may be released to a publicly observable variable.

The following code example shows a '''declassify''' construct from.&lt;ref name="sabelfeld04"&gt;A. Sabelfeld and A. C. Myers. A model for delimited information release. In Proc. of International Symposium on Software Security (ISSS) 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In this code, the value of the variable ''h'' is explicitly allowed by the programmer to flow into the publicly observable variable ''l''.

 '''var''' l, h
 '''if''' l = 1 '''then'''
   l := '''declassify'''(h)

=== Who ===

A ''who'' declassification policy controls which [[Security principal|principals]] (i.e., who) can access a given piece of information. This kind of policy has been implemented in the Jif compiler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif/ Jif: Java information flow]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following example allows Bob to share its secret contained in the variable ''b'' with Alice through the commonly accessible variable ''ab''.

 '''var''' ab                                ''(* {Alice, Bob} *)''
 '''var''' b                                 ''(* {Bob} *)''
 '''if''' ab = 1 '''then'''
   ab := '''declassify'''(b, {Alice, Bob})   ''(* {Alice, Bob} *)''

=== Where ===

A ''where'' declassification policy regulates where the information can be released, for example, by controlling in which lines of the source code information can be released.

The following example makes use of the '''flow''' construct proposed in.&lt;ref name="matos05"&gt;A. Almeida Matos and G. Boudol. On declassification and the non-disclosure policy. In Proc. IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This construct takes a flow policy (in this case, variables in H are allowed to flow to variables in L) and a command, which is run under the given flow policy.

 '''var''' l, h
 '''flow''' H &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; L '''in'''
   l := h

=== When ===

A ''when'' declassification policy regulates when the information can be released. Policies of this kind can be used to verify programs that implement, for example, controlled release of secret information after payment, or encrypted secrets which should not be released in a certain time given polynomial computational power.

=== Declassification approaches for implicit flows ===
An implicit flow occurs when code whose conditional execution is based on private information updates a public variable. This is especially problematic when multiple executions are considered since an attacker could leverage the public variable to infer private information by observing how its value changes over time or with the input.

==== The naïve approach ====
The naïve approach consists on enforcing the confidentiality property on all variables whose value is affected by other variables. This method leads to partially leaked information due to on some instances of the application a variable is Low and in others High.

==== No sensitive upgrade ====
No sensitive upgrade halts the program whenever a High variable affects the value of a Low variable effectively preventing information leakage. Since it simply looks for expressions where an information leakage might happen without looking at the context it may halt a program that despite having potential information leakage it never actually leaks information.

In the following example x is High and y is Low.

 '''var''' x, y
 y := false
 '''if''' h = true '''then'''
   y := true
 '''return''' true

In this case the program would be halted since it uses the value of a High variable to change a Low variable despite the program never leaking information.

==== Permissive upgrade ====
Permissive-upgrade introduces an extra security class P which will identify information leaking variables. When a High variable affects the value of a Low variable, the latter is labeled P. If a P labeled variable affects a Low variable the program would be halted. 
To prevent the halting the Low and P variables should be converted to High using a privatization function to ensure no information leakage can occur. On subsequent instances the program will run without interruption.

==== Privatization inference ====
Privatization inference extends permissive upgrade to automatically apply the privatization function to any variable that might leak information. 
This method should be used during testing where it will convert most variables. Once the program moves into production the permissive-upgrade should be used to halt the program in case of an information leakage and the privatization functions can be updated to prevent subsequent leaks.

The '''Leggett–Garg inequality''',&lt;ref name="LeggettGarg"&gt;Quantum Mechanics versus macroscopic realism: is the flux there when nobody looks? A. J. Leggett and Anupam Garg. Phys. Rev. Lett. '''54''', 857 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; named for [[Anthony James Leggett]] and [[Anupam Garg]], is a mathematical inequality fulfilled by all macrorealistic physical theories. Here, macrorealism (macroscopic realism) is a classical [[worldview]] defined by the conjunction of two postulates:&lt;ref name="LeggettGarg" /&gt;

# Macrorealism per se: "A macroscopic object, which has available to it two or more macroscopically distinct states, is at any given time in a definite one of those states."
# Noninvasive measurability: "It is possible in principle to determine which of these states the system is in without any effect on the state itself, or on the subsequent system dynamics."

==In quantum mechanics==
In [[quantum mechanics]], the Leggett–Garg inequality is violated, meaning that the time evolution of a system cannot be understood classically. The situation is similar to the violation of [[Bell's theorem|Bell's inequalities]] in [[Bell test experiments]] which plays an important role in understanding the nature of the [[EPR paradox|Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox]]. Here [[quantum entanglement]] plays the central role.

As well as Einstein's famous "God does not play dice" objection to quantum mechanics, there was Einstein's still more fundamental objection that the Moon is still there when nobody looks. If the violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality can be demonstrated on the ''macroscopic scale'', this would challenge even this notion of realism.

==Two-state example==
The simplest form of the Leggett–Garg inequality derives from examining a system that has only two possible states. These states have corresponding  measurement values &lt;math&gt;Q=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. The key here is that we have measurements at two different times, and one or more times between the first and last measurement. The simplest example is where the system is measured at three successive times &lt;math&gt;t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; t_3 &lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose, for instance, that there is a perfect correlation &lt;math&gt; C_{13} &lt;/math&gt; of 1 between times &lt;math&gt; t_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t_3 &lt;/math&gt;. That is to say, that for N realisations of the experiment, the temporal correlation reads

: &lt;math&gt;C_{13}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{r=1}^N Q_r(t_1) Q_r(t_3)=1. &lt;/math&gt;

We look at this case in some detail. What can be said about what happens at time &lt;math&gt; t_2&lt;/math&gt;? Well, it is possible   that &lt;math&gt;C_{12} =C_{23} =1&lt;/math&gt;, so that if the value at
&lt;math&gt; t_1=\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;, then it is also &lt;math&gt; \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt; for both times 
&lt;math&gt; t_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t_3 &lt;/math&gt;. It is also quite possible that &lt;math&gt; C_{12}=C_{23}=-1 &lt;/math&gt;, so that the value at &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is
flipped twice, and so has the same value at &lt;math&gt;t_3&lt;/math&gt; as it did at
&lt;math&gt; t_1 &lt;/math&gt;. So, we can have both &lt;math&gt; Q(t_1) &lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt; Q(t_2) &lt;/math&gt; anti-correlated as long as we have &lt;math&gt; Q(t_2) &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt; Q(t_3) &lt;/math&gt; anti-correlated. Yet another possibility is 
that there is no correlation between  &lt;math&gt; Q(t_1) &lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt; Q(t_2) &lt;/math&gt;. That is we could have &lt;math&gt; C_{12}=C_{23}=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
So, although it is known that if &lt;math&gt;Q=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; t_1&lt;/math&gt;
it must also be &lt;math&gt; \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; t_3 &lt;/math&gt;, the value
at &lt;math&gt; t_2 &lt;/math&gt; may as well be determined by the toss of a coin.
We define &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;K= C_{12}+C_{23}-C_{13}&lt;/math&gt;.
In these three cases, we have  
&lt;math&gt;K=1, -3,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; -1&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

All that was for 100% correlation between times &lt;math&gt;t_1 &lt;/math&gt; 
and  &lt;math&gt;t_3 &lt;/math&gt;. In fact, for any correlation between these
times  &lt;math&gt; K= C_{12}+C_{23}-C_{13} \le 1&lt;/math&gt;. To see this, we note that

: &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{r=1}^N \left ( Q(t_1)Q(t_2)+Q(t_2)Q(t_3)
-Q(t_1)Q(t_3) \right )_r. &lt;/math&gt;

It is easily seen that for every realisation &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;, the term in the
parentheses must be less than or equal to unity, so that the result for the sum is also less than (or equal to) unity. If we have four distinct times rather than three, we have &lt;math&gt; K= C_{12}+C_{23}+C_{34}-C_{14} \le 2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. These are the Leggett–Garg  inequalities. They say something definite about the relation between the temporal correlations of &lt;math&gt; \langle Q(\text{start}) Q(\text{end}) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
and the correlations between successive times in going from the start to the end.

In the derivations above, it has been assumed that the quantity Q, representing the state of the system, always has a definite value (macrorealism per se) and that its measurement at a certain time does not change this value nor its subsequent evolution (noninvasive measurability). A violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality implies that at least one of these two assumptions fails.

==Experimental violations==
One of the first proposed experiments for demonstrating a violation of macroscopic realism employs superconducting quantum interference devices. There, using [[Josephson junction]]s, one should be able to prepare macroscopic superpositions of left and right rotating macroscopically large electronic currents in a superconducting ring. Under sufficient suppression of decoherence one should be able to demonstrate a violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality.&lt;ref name="Leggett"&gt;Testing the limits of quantum mechanics: motivation, state of play, prospects. A. J. Leggett. J. Phys.: Condens. Matter '''14''', R414-R451 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; However, some criticism has been raised concerning the nature of indistinguishable electrons in a Fermi sea.&lt;ref name="Korsbakken"&gt;Electronic structure of superposition states in flux qubits. J. I. Korsbakken, F. K. Wilhelm, and K. B. Whaley, Physica Scripta '''137''', 4022 (2009). https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10701-011-9598-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laloy"&gt;Superconducting qubit in a resonator: test of the Leggett-Garg inequality and single-shot readout, A. Palacios-Laloy, PhD thesis (2010). http://iramis.cea.fr/spec/Pres/Quantro/static/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Palacios-Laloy-Thesis1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of some other proposed experiments on the Leggett–Garg inequality is that they do not really show a violation of macrorealism because they are essentially about measuring spins of individual particles.&lt;ref name="Interp"&gt;Foundations and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. [[Gennaro Auletta]] and [[Giorgio Parisi]], World Scientific, 2001 {{isbn|981-02-4614-5}}, {{isbn|978-981-02-4614-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Robens ''et al.'' &lt;ref name="Robens2015"&gt;[https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.5.011003 "Ideal Negative Measurements in Quantum Walks Disprove Theories Based on Classical Trajectories"]. Carsten Robens, Wolfgang Alt, Dieter Meschede, Clive Emary, and Andrea Alberti, Physical Review X '''5''', 011003 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated an experimental violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality using superpositions of positions instead of spin with a massive particle. At that time, and so far up until today, the Cesium atoms employed in their experiment represent the largest quantum objects which have been used to experimentally test the Leggett–Garg inequality.&lt;ref name="Knee2015"&gt;[http://physics.aps.org/articles/v8/6 "Do Quantum Superpositions Have a Size Limit?"] , George C. Knee,  Physics '''8''', 6 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiments of Robens ''et al.'' &lt;ref name=Robens2015 /&gt; as well as Knee ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="Knee2012"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1614 "Violation of a Leggett–Garg inequality with ideal non-invasive measurements"] , George C. Knee, Stephanie Simmons, Erik M. Gauger, John J.L. Morton, Helge Riemann, Nikolai V. Abrosimov, Peter Becker, Hans-Joachim Pohl, Kohei M. Itoh, Mike L.W. Thewalt, G. Andrew D. Briggs &amp; Simon C. Benjamin,  Nature Communications '''3''' 606 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; using ideal negative measurements, also avoid a second criticism (referred to as “clumsiness loophole” &lt;ref name="Wilde2012"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10701-011-9598-4 "Addressing the Clumsiness Loophole in a Leggett-Garg Test of Macrorealism"]. Mark M. Wilde and Ari Mizel,  Foundations of Physics '''42''', 256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;) that has been directed to previous experiments using measurement protocols that could be interpreted as invasive, thereby conflicting with postulate 2.

Several other experimental violations have been reported, including in 2016 with neutrino particles using the [[MINOS]] dataset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.050402 "Violation of the Leggett-Garg Inequality in Neutrino Oscillations". J. A. Formaggio, D. I. Kaiser, M. M. Murskyj, and T. E. Weiss, Physical Review Letters '''117''', 050402 (2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Brukner and Kofler have also demonstrated that quantum violations can be found for arbitrarily large ''macroscopic'' systems. As an alternative to [[quantum decoherence]], Brukner and Kofler are proposing a solution of the quantum-to-classical transition in terms of ''coarse-grained'' quantum measurements under which usually no violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality can be seen anymore.&lt;ref name="KoflerPaper"&gt;Classical world arising out of quantum physics under the restriction of coarse-grained measurements.

A '''47''', R2427-R2430 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; would be better for testing macroscopic realism, but warns that the experiments may be complex enough to admit unforeseen loopholes in the analysis. A detailed discussion of the subject can be found in the review by Emary et al.&lt;ref name="Emary2014"&gt;Leggett–Garg inequalities. C. Emary, N. Lambert, and F. Nori, Rep. Prog. Phys. '''77''', 016001 (2014). https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related inequalities==
The four-term Leggett–Garg inequality can be seen to be similar to the [[CHSH inequality]]. Moreover, ''equalities'' were proposed by Jaeger ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Bell type equalities for SQUIDs on the assumptions of macroscopic realism and non-invasive measurability. Gregg Jaeger, Chris Viger and Sahotra Sarkar. Phys. Lett. A '''210''', 5-10 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''line field''' on a [[manifold]] is a formation of a [[line (geometry)|line]] being tangent to a manifold at each point, i.e. a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] over the manifold.  Line fields are of particular interest in the study of [[complex dynamics|complex dynamical systems]], where it is conventional to modify the definition slightly.

==Definitions==

In general, let ''M'' be a manifold.  A '''line field''' on ''M'' is a function ''&amp;mu;'' that assigns to each point ''p'' of ''M'' a line ''&amp;mu;''(''p'') through the origin in the tangent space T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'').  Equivalently, one may say that ''&amp;mu;''(''p'') is  an element of the [[projective space|projective tangent space]] PT&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M''), or that ''&amp;mu;'' is a section of the projective [[tangent bundle]] PT(''M'').

In the study of complex dynamical systems, the manifold ''M'' is taken to be a [[Hersee surface]].  A '''line field''' on a subset ''A'' of ''M'' (where ''A'' is required to have positive two-[[dimension]]al [[Lebesgue measure]]) is a line field on ''A'' in the general sense above that is defined [[almost everywhere]] in ''A'' and is also a [[measurable function]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36719">In [[mathematical logic]], a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]] is given by a set of axioms in some
language. This entry lists some of the more common examples used in [[model theory]] and some of their properties.

==Preliminaries==

For every natural mathematical structure there is a  [[Signature (logic)|signature]] &amp;sigma;  listing the constants, functions, and relations of the theory together with their valences,  so that the object is naturally a [[model theory|&amp;sigma;-structure]].   Given a signature &amp;sigma; there is a unique first-order language  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the &amp;sigma;-structure.

There are two common ways to specify theories:
#List or describe a set of sentences in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt;, called the '''axioms''' of the theory.
#Give a set of  &amp;sigma;-structures, and define a theory to be the set of sentences in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; holding in all these models. For example, the "theory of finite fields" consists of all sentences in the language of fields that are true in all finite fields.

An L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; theory may:
*be consistent: no proof of contradiction exists;
* be satisfiable: there exists a &amp;sigma;-structure for which the sentences of the theory are all true (by the [[completeness theorem]], satisfiability is equivalent to consistency);
*be complete: for any statement, either it or its negation is provable;
*have [[quantifier elimination]];
*[[elimination of imaginaries|eliminate imaginaries]];
* be [[finitely axiomatizable]];
*be [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: There is an algorithm to decide which statements are provable;
*be recursively axiomatizable;
*be [[model complete]] or sub-model complete;
*be [[Morley's categoricity theorem|κ-categorical]]: All models of cardinality κ are isomorphic;
*be [[stable theory|stable]]  or unstable;
*be [[ω-stable]] (same as [[totally transcendental]] for countable theories);
*be [[superstable]]
*have an [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic model]];
*have a [[prime model]];
*have a [[saturated model]].

==Pure identity theories==
The signature of the pure identity theory is empty, with no functions, constants, or relations.

'''Pure identity theory''' has no (non-logical) axioms. It is decidable.

One of the few interesting properties that can be stated in the language of pure identity theory is that of being infinite.
This is given by an infinite set of axioms stating there are at least 2 elements, there are at least 3 elements, and so on:
*∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,    ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,...
These axioms define the '''theory of an infinite set'''.

The opposite property of being finite cannot be stated in first-order logic for any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models: in fact any such  theory has infinite models by the [[compactness theorem]]. In general if a property can be stated by a finite number of sentences of first-order logic then the opposite property can also be stated in first-order logic, but if a property needs an infinite number of sentences then its opposite property cannot be stated in first-order logic.

Any statement of pure identity theory is equivalent to either σ(''N'') or to ¬σ(''N'') for some finite subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers, where σ(''N'') is the statement that the number of elements is in ''N''. It is even possible to describe all possible theories in this language as follows. Any theory is either  the theory of all sets of cardinality in ''N'' for some ''finite'' subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers, or the theory of all sets whose cardinality is not in ''N'', for some ''finite or infinite'' subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers. (There are no theories whose models are exactly sets of cardinality ''N'' if ''N'' is an infinite subset of the integers.) The complete theories are the theories of sets of cardinality ''n'' for some finite ''n'', and the theory of infinite sets.

One special case of this is the '''inconsistent theory''' defined by the axiom ∃''x'' ¬''x'' = ''x''. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem is that it has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Propositional and Predicate Calculus: A Model of Argument: A Model of Argument|first=Derek|last=Goldrei|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9781846282294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edqwSVJ9GGQC&amp;pg=PA265|page=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.

==Unary relations==
A set of unary  relations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' in some set ''I'' is called '''independent''' if for every two disjoint finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of ''I''  there is some element ''x'' such that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is true for ''i'' in ''A'' and false for ''i'' in ''B''. Independence can be expressed by a set of first-order statements.

The '''theory of a countable number of independent unary relations''' is complete, but has no [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic models]]. It is also an example of a theory that is [[superstable]] but not [[totally transcendental]].

==Equivalence relations==
The signature of [[equivalence relation]]s has one binary infix relation symbol ~, no constants, and no functions. Equivalence relations satisfy the axioms:
*'''[[Reflexive relation|Reflexivity]]''' ∀''x'' ''x''~''x'';
*'''[[Symmetric relation|Symmetry]]''' ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x''~''y'' → ''y''~''x'';
*'''[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∀''z'' (''x''~''y'' ∧ ''y''~''z'') → ''x''~''z''.

Some first order properties of equivalence relations are:
*~ has an infinite number of [[equivalence classes]];
*~ has exactly ''n'' equivalence classes (for any fixed positive integer ''n'');
*All equivalence classes are infinite;
*All equivalence classes have size exactly ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'').

The theory of an equivalence relation with exactly 2 infinite [[equivalence class]]es is an easy example of a theory which is ω-categorical but not categorical for any larger [[cardinal number|cardinal]].

The equivalence relation ~ should not be confused with the [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] symbol '=': if ''x''=''y'' then ''x''~''y'', but the converse is not necessarily true. Theories of equivalence relations are not all that difficult or interesting, but often give easy examples or counterexamples for various statements.

The following constructions are sometimes used to produce examples of theories with certain [[spectrum of a theory|spectra]]; in fact by applying them to a small number of explicit theories ''T'' one gets examples of complete countable theories with all possible uncountable spectra. If ''T'' is a theory in some language, we define a new theory 2&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; by adding a new binary relation to the language, and adding axioms stating that it is an equivalence relation, such that there are an infinite number of equivalence classes all of which are [[model theory|model]]s of ''T''. It is  possible to iterate this construction [[transfinite induction|transfinitely]]: given an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] α, define a new theory by adding an equivalence relation ''E&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each β&amp;lt;α, together with axioms stating that whenever β&amp;lt;γ then each ''E&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence class is the union of infinitely many ''E&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence classes, and each ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence class is a model of ''T''. Informally, one can visualize models of this theory as infinitely branching trees of height α with models of ''T'' attached to all leaves.

==Orders==
The signature of orders has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbols ≤. (It is of course possible to use ≥, &amp;lt; or &amp;gt; instead as the basic relation, with the obvious minor changes to the axioms.)
We define ''x'' ≥ ''y'', ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'', ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'' as abbreviations for ''y'' ≤ ''x'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∧¬''y'' ≤ ''x'', ''y'' &amp;lt; ''x'',

Some first-order properties of orders: 
*'''Transitive''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∀''z'' ''x'' ≤ ''y''∧''y'' ≤ ''z'' → ''x'' ≤ ''z''
*'''Reflexive''': ∀''x'' ''x ≤ ''x''
*'''Antisymmetric''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∧ ''y'' ≤ ''x'' → ''x'' = ''y''
*'''Partial''': Transitive∧Reflexive∧Antisymmetric;
*'''Linear''' (or '''total'''): Partial ∧ ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x''≤''y'' ∨ ''y''≤''x''
*'''Dense''': ∀''x'' ∀''z'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' → ∃''y'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' ∧ ''y'' &amp;lt; ''z''  ("Between any 2 distinct elements there is another element")
*There is a smallest element: ∃''x'' ∀''y'' ''x'' ≤ ''y''
*There is a largest element: ∃''x'' ∀''y'' ''y'' ≤ ''x''
*Every element has an immediate successor: ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ∀''z'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' ↔ ''y'' ≤ ''z''
The theory DLO of ''dense linear orders without endpoints'' (i.e. no smallest or largest element) is complete, ω-categorical, but not categorical for any uncountable cardinal. There are 3 other very similar theories: the theory of dense linear orders with a:
* Smallest but no largest element;
* Largest but no smallest element;
* Largest and smallest element.

Being '''well ordered''' ("any non-empty subset has a minimal element") is not a first-order property; the usual definition involves quantifying over all ''subsets''.

==Lattices==
[[lattice (order)|Lattices]] can be considered either as special sorts of partially ordered sets, with a signature consisting of one binary relation symbol &amp;le;, or as algebraic structures with a signature consisting of two binary operations &amp;and; and &amp;or;. The two approaches can be related  by defining  ''a''&amp;le; ''b'' to mean ''a''&amp;and;''b''=''a''.

For two binary operations the axioms for a lattice are:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
| '''[[commutative operation|Commutative]] laws:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \; a  \vee b = b \vee a &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b\; a \wedge  b = b \wedge a &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''[[associativity|Associative]] laws:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \forall c\; a \vee (b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \forall c\; a \wedge (b \wedge c) = (a \wedge b) \wedge c &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''[[Absorption law]]s:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \;a  \vee (a \wedge b) = a &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \;a  \wedge (a \vee b) = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

For one relation &amp;le; the axioms are:
*Axioms stating &amp;le; is a partial order, as above.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \exist c\; c\le a\wedge c\le b \wedge \forall d\;d\le a\wedge d\le b \rightarrow d\le c&lt;/math&gt; (existence of c=a&amp;and;b)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \exist c\; a\le c\wedge b\le c \wedge \forall d\;a\le d\wedge b\le d \rightarrow c\le d&lt;/math&gt; (existence of c=a&amp;or;b)

First order properties include:
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y\forall z\;x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[distributive lattice]]s)
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y\forall z\;x \vee (y \wedge (x \vee z)) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[modular lattice]]s)

[[Heyting algebra]]s can be defined as lattices with certain extra first-order properties.

[[Complete lattice|Completeness]] is not a first order property of lattices.

The signature of graphs has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbol ''R'', where ''R''(''x'',''y'') is read as "there is an edge from ''x'' to ''y''".

The axioms for the '''theory of graphs''' are
*'''Symmetric''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''R''(''x'',''y'')→ ''R''(''y'',''x'')
*'''Anti-reflexive''': ∀''x'' ¬''R''(''x'',''x'') ("no loops")

The ''theory of random graphs'' has the following extra axioms for each positive integer ''n'':
* For any two disjoint finite sets of size ''n'', there is a point joined to all points of the first set and to no points of the second set. (For each fixed ''n'', it is easy to write this statement in the language of graphs.)

The theory of random graphs is ω categorical, complete, and decidable, and its countable model is called the [[Rado graph]]. A statement in the language of graphs is true in this theory if and only if the probability that an ''n''-vertex [[random graph]] models the statement tends to 1 in the limit as ''n'' goes to infinity.

==Boolean algebras==
There are several different signatures and conventions used for '''[[Boolean algebras]]''': 
#The signature has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions ∧ and ∨ ("and" and "or"), and one unary function ¬ ("not"). This can be confusing as the functions use the same symbols as the [[propositional function]]s of first-order logic.
#In [[set theory]], a common convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions · and +, and one unary function &amp;minus;. The three functions have the same interpretation as the functions in the first convention. Unfortunately, this convention clashes badly with the next convention:
#In algebra, the usual  convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions · and +. The function · has the same meaning as ∧, but ''a''+''b'' means ''a''∨''b''∧¬(''a''∧''b''). The reason for this is that the axioms for a Boolean algebra are then just the axioms for a ring with 1 plus ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''. Unfortunately this clashes with the standard convention in set theory given above.

The axioms are:
*The axioms for a distributive lattice (see above)
*&amp;forall;a ''a''&amp;and;¬''a'' = 0, &amp;forall;a ''a''&amp;or;¬''a'' = 1 (properties of negation)
*Some authors add the extra axiom ¬0=1, to exclude the trivial algebra with one element.

Tarski proved that the theory of Boolean algebras is decidable.

We write ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as an abbreviation for ''x'' ∧ ''y'' = ''x'', and atom(''x'') as an abbreviation for ¬''x'' = 0 ∧ ∀''y'' ''y''≤''x'' → ''y'' = 0 ∨ ''y'' = ''x'', read as "''x'' is an atom", in other words a non-zero element with nothing between it and 0. Here are some first-order properties of Boolean algebras:
*'''Atomic''': ∀''x'' ''x''=0 ∨ ∃''y'' ''y''≤''x'' ∧ atom(''y'')
*'''Atomless''': ∀''x'' ¬atom(''x'')
The theory of '''atomless Boolean algebras''' is ω-categorical and complete.

For any Boolean algebra ''B'', there are several invariants defined as follows. 
*the ideal ''I''(''B'') consists of elements that are the sum of an atomic and an atomless element (an element with no atoms below it).
*The quotient algebras ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''B'' are defined inductively by ''B''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=''B'', ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;/''I''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).
*The invariant ''m''(''B'') is the smallest integer such that ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is trivial, or &amp;infin; if no such integer exists.
*If ''m''(''B'') is finite, the invariant ''n''(''B'') is the number of atoms of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''(''B'')&lt;/sup&gt; if this number is finite, or &amp;infin; if this number is infinite.
*The invariant ''l''(''B'') is 0 if ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''(''B'')&lt;/sup&gt; is atomic or if ''m''(''B'') is &amp;infin;, and 1 otherwise.

Then two Boolean algebras are elementarily equivalent if and only if their invariants ''l'', ''m'', and ''n'' are the same. In other words, the values of these invariants classify the possible completions of the theory of Boolean algebras. So the possible complete theories are:
*The trivial algebra (if this is allowed; sometimes 0&amp;ne;1 is included as an axiom.)
*The theory with ''m''=&amp;infin;
*The theories with ''m'' a natural number, ''n'' a natural number or &amp;infin;, and ''l'' = 0 or 1 (with ''l'' = 0 if ''n''=0).

==Groups==
The signature of group theory has one constant 1 (the identity), one function of arity 1
(the inverse) whose value on ''t'' is denoted by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and one function 
of arity 2, which is usually omitted from terms. For any integer ''n''. ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an abbreviation for the obvious term for the ''n''th power of ''t''.

'''[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s''' are defined by the axioms
*''Identity'': ∀''x'' 1''x'' = ''x'' ∧ ''x''1 = ''x''
*''Inverse'': ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' = ''1'' ∧ ''xx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''1''
*''Associative'': ∀''x''∀''y''∀''z'' (''xy'')''z'' = ''x''(''yz'')

Some properties of groups that can be defined in the first-order language of groups are:
*'''Abelian''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''xy'' = ''yx''.
*'''Torsion free''': ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1→''x'' = 1, ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 → ''x'' = 1, ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 → ''x'' = 1, ...
*'''Divisible''': ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ...
*'''Infinite''' (as in identity theory)
*'''Exponent''' ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n''): ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
*[[Nilpotent group|Nilpotent]] of class ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'')
*[[solvable group|Solvable]] of class ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'')

The theory of '''abelian groups''' is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The theory of '''finite groups''' is the set of first-order statements in the language of groups that are true in all finite groups (there are plenty of infinite models of this theory). It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is 
"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them".

The properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. More precisely, the first-order theory of all groups with one of these properties has models that do not have this property.

==Rings and fields==
The signature of (unital) rings has 2 constants 0 and 1, two binary functions + and &amp;times;, and, optionally, one unary negation function &amp;minus;.

'''[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s'''

Axioms: Addition makes the ring into an abelian group, multiplication is associative and has an identity 1, and multiplication is left and right distributive.

'''[[Commutative ring]]s'''

The axioms for rings plus ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''xy''=''yx''.

'''[[Field (mathematics)|Field]]s'''

The axioms for commutative rings plus ∀''x'' ¬ ''x''=0 → ∃''y'' ''xy''=1 and ¬ 1=0.   Many of the examples given here have only universal, or ''algebraic'' axioms.  The class of structures satisfying such a theory has the property of being closed under substructure.   For example, a subset of a group closed under the group actions of multiplication and inverse is again a group.  Since the signature of fields does not usually include multiplicative and additive inverse, the axioms for  inverses are not universal, and therefore a substructure of a field closed under addition and multiplication  is not always a field.   This can be remedied by adding unary inverse functions to the language.

For any positive integer ''n'' the property that all equations of degree ''n'' have a root can be expressed by a single first-order sentence:
*∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x'' (...((''x''+''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''x'' +''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''+...)''x''+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

'''[[Perfect field]]s'''

The axioms for fields, plus axioms for each prime number ''p'' stating that if p 1 = 0 (i.e. the field has [[field characteristic|characteristic]] ''p''), then every field element has a ''p''th root.

'''Algebraically closed fields of characteristic ''p'''''

The axioms for fields, plus for every positive ''n'' the axiom that all polynomials of degree ''n'' have a root, plus axioms fixing the characteristic. The classical examples of complete theories. [[Category theory|Categorical]] in all uncountable cardinals. The theory ''ACF''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; has a ''universal domain property'', in the sense that every structure ''N'' satisfying the universal axioms of  ''ACF''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is a substructure of a sufficiently large algebraically closed field  &lt;math&gt; M \models ACF_0 &lt;/math&gt;, and additionally any two such embeddings ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''M'' induce an [[automorphism]] of ''M''.

'''[[Finite field]]s'''

The theory of finite fields is the set of all first-order statements that are true in all finite fields. Significant examples of such statements can, for example, be given by applying the [[Chevalley–Warning theorem]], over the [[prime field]]s. The name is a little misleading as the theory has plenty of infinite models. Ax proved that the theory is decidable.

'''[[Formally real field]]s'''

These are fields with the axiom 
*For every positive ''n'', the axiom ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨ ... ∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).

'''[[Real closed field]]s'''

Axioms: *∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''x''=''yy'' ∨ ''x''+''yy''= 0.
*For every odd positive ''n'', the axiom stating that every polynomial of degree ''n'' has a root.
*For every positive ''n'', the axiom ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨ ... ∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).

The theory of real closed fields is effective and complete and therefore decidable (the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]]). The addition of further function symbols (e.g., the exponential function, the sine function) [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|may change decidability]]. 

''' ''p''-adic fields'''

{{harvtxt|Ax|Kochen|1965}} showed that the theory of ''p''-adic fields is decidable and gave a set of axioms for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Geometry==
Axioms for various systems of geometry usually use a typed language, with the different types corresponding to different geometric objects such as points, lines, circles, planes, and so on. The signature will often consist of binary incidence relations between objects of different types; for example, the relation that a point lies on a line. The signature may have more complicated relations; for example ordered geometry might have a ternary "betweenness" relation for 3 points, which says whether one lies between two others, or a "congruence" relation between 2 pairs of points.

Some examples of axiomatized systems of geometry include [[ordered geometry]], [[absolute geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[Euclidean geometry]], [[projective geometry]],  and [[hyperbolic geometry]]. For each of these geometries there are many different and inequivalent systems of axioms for various dimensions. Some of these axiom systems include "completeness" axioms that are not first order.

As a typical example, the axioms for projective geometry use 2 types, points and lines, and a binary incidence relation between points and lines. If point and line variables are indicated by small and capital letter, and ''a'' incident to ''A'' is written as ''aA'', then one set of axioms is
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\;\lnot a=b\rightarrow \exists C\; aC\land bC &lt;/math&gt; (There is a line through any 2 distinct points ''a'',''b'' ...)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\forall  C\forall D\; \lnot a=b\land aC\land bC \land aD\land bD\rightarrow C=D&lt;/math&gt; (... which is unique)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\forall c\forall d\forall e\forall G\forall H \;aH\land bH\land eH\land cG\land dG\land eG\rightarrow\exists f\exists I\exists J\;  aI\land cI\land fI\land bJ\land dJ\land fJ&lt;/math&gt; (Veblen's axiom: if ''ab'' and ''cd'' lie on intersecting lines, then so do ''ac'' and ''bd''.)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall A\exists b\exists c\exists d\; bA\land cA\land dA\land \lnot b=c\land \lnot b=d\land \lnot c=d &lt;/math&gt; (Every line has at least 3 points)

Euclid did not state all the axioms for Euclidean geometry explicitly, and the first complete list was given by Hilbert in [[Hilbert's axioms]]. This is not a first order axiomatization as one of Hilbert's axioms is a second order completeness axiom. [[Tarski's axioms]] are a first order axiomatization of Euclidean geometry. Tarski showed this axiom system is complete and decidable by relating it to the complete and decidable theory of real closed fields.

==Differential algebra==
* The theory DF of [[differential field]]s.
The signature is that of fields (0, 1, +, −, ×) together with a unary function ∂, the derivation.
The axioms are those for fields together with
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u\forall v\,\partial(uv) = u \,\partial v + v\, \partial u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u\forall v\,\partial (u + v) = \partial u + \partial v\ .&lt;/math&gt;
For this theory one can add the condition that the characteristic is ''p'', a prime or zero,
to get the theory DF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''differential fields of characteristic ''p'' '''(and similarly with the other theories below).

If ''K'' is a differential field then the '''field of constants''' &lt;math&gt; k = \{u \in K : \partial(u) = 0\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The theory of '''differentially perfect fields''' is the theory of differential fields together with the condition that the field of constants is perfect; in other words, for each prime ''p'' it has the axiom:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\partial(u)=0 \land p 1 = 0\rightarrow \exists v\,  v^p=u&lt;/math&gt;
(There is little point in demanding that the whole field should be a [[perfect field]], because in non-zero characteristic this implies the differential is 0.)
For technical reasons to do with [[quantifier elimination]], it is sometimes more convenient to force the constant field to be perfect by adding a new symbol ''r'' to the signature with the axioms
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\partial(u)=0 \land p 1 = 0 \rightarrow r(u)^p=u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\lnot \partial(u)=0\rightarrow r(u)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
* The theory of '''[[differentially closed field]]s''' (DCF) is the theory of differentially perfect fields with axioms saying that if ''f'' and ''g'' are  [[differential polynomial]]s and the [[separant]] of ''f'' is nonzero  and ''g''≠0 and  ''f'' has order greater than that of ''g'', then there is some ''x'' in the field with ''f''(''x'')=0 and ''g''(''x'')≠0.

==Addition==
The '''theory of the natural numbers with a successor function''' has signature consisting of a constant 0 and a unary function ''S'' ("successor": ''S''(''x'') is interpreted as ''x''+1), and has axioms:
# ∀x &amp;not; Sx = 0
# ∀x∀y Sx = Sy → x = y
#Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] with a single free variable ''x''. Then the following formula is an axiom:
:(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'')&amp;rarr;''P''(''Sx''))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').
The last axiom (induction) can be replaced by the axioms
*For each integer ''n''&gt;0, the axiom ∀x SSS...Sx ≠ x (with ''n'' copies of ''S'')
* ∀x &amp;not; x = 0 → ∃y Sy = x

The theory of the natural numbers with a successor function is complete and decidable, and is &amp;kappa;-categorical for uncountable &amp;kappa; but not for countable &amp;kappa;.

'''[[Presburger arithmetic]]''' is the theory of the natural numbers under addition, with signature consisting of a constant 0, a unary function ''S'', and a binary function +. It is complete and decidable. The axioms are 
# ∀x &amp;not; Sx = 0
# ∀x∀y Sx = Sy → x = y
# ∀x x + 0 = x
# ∀x∀y x + Sy = S(x + y)
#Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] with a single free variable ''x''. Then the following formula is an axiom:
:(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'')&amp;rarr;''P''(''Sx''))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').

==Arithmetic==
Many of the first order theories described above can be extended to complete recursively enumerable consistent theories. This is no longer true for most of the following theories; they can usually encode both multiplication and addition of natural numbers, and this gives them enough power to encode themselves, which implies that [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] applies and the theories can no longer be both complete and recursively enumerable (unless they are inconsistent).

The signature of a theory of arithmetic has:
*The constant 0;
*The [[unary function]], the [[successor function]], here denoted by prefix ''S'', or by prefix &amp;sigma; or postfix &amp;prime; elsewhere;
*Two [[binary function]]s, denoted by infix + and &amp;times;, called "addition" and "multiplication."
Some authors take the signature to contain a constant 1 instead of the function ''S'', then define ''S'' in the obvious way as  ''St'' = 1 + ''t''.

'''[[Robinson arithmetic]]''' (also called '''Q'''). Axioms (1) and (2) govern the distinguished element 0. (3) assures that ''S'' is an [[Injective function|injection]]. Axioms (4) and (5) are the standard recursive definition of addition; (6) and (7) do the same for multiplication.  Robinson arithmetic  can be thought of as  Peano arithmetic without induction. '''Q''' is  a weak theory for which [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] holds.
Axioms:
# ∀''x'' &amp;not; S''x'' = 0
# ∀''x'' &amp;not; ''x'' = 0 → ∃''y'' S''y'' = ''x''
# ∀''x''∀''y'' S''x'' = S''y'' → ''x'' = ''y''
# ∀''x'' ''x'' + 0 = ''x''
# ∀''x''∀''y'' ''x'' + S''y'' = S(''x'' + ''y'')
# ∀''x'' ''x'' &amp;times; 0 = 0
# ∀''x''∀''y'' ''x'' &amp;times; S''y'' = (''x'' &amp;times; ''y'') + ''x''.

'''I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is first order Peano arithmetic with induction restricted to [[Arithmetical hierarchy|Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; formulas]] (for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ...). The theory I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is often denoted by I&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a series of more and more powerful fragments of Peano arithmetic. The case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 has about the same strength as  '''[[primitive recursive arithmetic]]''' (PRA).
'''[[Exponential function arithmetic]]''' (EFA) is I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with an axiom stating that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; exists for all ''x'' and ''y'' (with the usual properties).

'''First order [[Peano arithmetic]]''', '''PA'''. The "standard" theory of arithmetic. The axioms are the axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]] above, together with the axiom scheme of induction:
* &lt;math&gt;\phi(0) \wedge (\forall x \phi(x) \rightarrow \phi(Sx)) \rightarrow (\forall x \phi(x))&lt;/math&gt; for any formula &amp;phi; in the language of '''PA'''. &amp;phi; may contain free variables other than ''x''.
[[Kurt Gödel]]'s  1931 paper proved that '''PA''' is incomplete, and has no consistent recursively enumerable completions.

'''Complete arithmetic''' (also known as '''true arithmetic''') is the theory of the standard model of arithmetic, the natural numbers '''N'''. It is complete but does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms.

For the '''real numbers''', the situation is slightly different: The case that includes just addition and multiplication cannot encode the integers, and hence [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem|does not apply]]. [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|Complications]] arise when adding further function symbols (e.g., exponentiation).

==Second order arithmetic==
'''[[Second-order arithmetic]]''' can refer to a first order theory (in spite of the name) with two types of variables, thought of as varying over integers and subsets of the integers. (There is also a theory of arithmetic in second order logic that is called second order arithmetic. It has only one model, unlike the corresponding theory in first order logic, which is incomplete.) The signature will typically be the signature 0, ''S'', +, &amp;times; of arithmetic, together with a membership relation &amp;isin; between integers and subsets (though there are numerous minor variations).  The axioms are those of [[Robinson arithmetic]], together with axiom schemes of [[Mathematical induction|induction]] and [[Axiom schema of specification|comprehension]].

There are  many different subtheories of second order arithmetic that differ in which formulas are allowed in the induction and comprehension schemes. 
In order of increasing strength, five of the most common  systems
are 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{RCA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Recursive Comprehension
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{WKL}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Weak König's lemma
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ACA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Arithmetical comprehension
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ATR}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion
*&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1\mbox{-}\mathsf{CA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; comprehension
These are defined in detail in the articles on [[second order arithmetic]] and [[reverse mathematics]].

==Set theories==
The usual signature of set theory has one binary relation ∈, no constants, and no functions. Some of the theories below are "class theories" which have two sorts of object, sets and classes. There are three common ways of handling this in first-order logic:
#Use first-order logic with two types.
#Use ordinary first-order logic, but add a new unary predicate "Set", where "Set(''t'')" means informally "''t'' is a set".
#Use ordinary first-order logic, and instead of adding a new predicate to the language, treat "Set(''t'')" as an abbreviation for "∃''y'' ''t''∈''y''"

Some first order set theories include:
*Weak theories lacking [[powerset]]s:
**[[General set theory|S']]  (Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson, 1953); (finitely axiomatizable)
**[[General set theory]];
**[[Kripke–Platek set theory]]; KP;
**[[Pocket set theory]]
*[[Mac Lane set theory]] and  [[elementary topos theory]]
*[[Zermelo set theory]]; Z
*[[Ackermann set theory]];
*[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]; ZF, ZFC;
*[[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]; NBG; (finitely axiomatizable)
*[[Morse–Kelley set theory]]; MK;
*[[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]]; TG;
*[[New Foundations]]; (finitely axiomatizable)
*[[Scott–Potter set theory]]
*[[Positive set theory]]

Some extra first order axioms that can be added to one of these (usually ZF) include:
*[[axiom of choice]], [[axiom of dependent choice]]
*[[Generalized continuum hypothesis]]
*[[Martin's axiom]] (usually together with the negation of the continuum hypothesis), [[Martin's maximum]]
*[[diamondsuit|◊]] and [[clubsuit|♣]]
*[[Axiom of constructibility]] (V=L)
*[[proper forcing axiom]]
*[[analytic determinacy]], [[projective determinacy]], [[Axiom of determinacy]]
*Many [[list of large cardinal properties|large cardinal axioms]]

Father '''Magnus J. Wenninger''' [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] (October 31, 1919&lt;ref name=Banchoff&gt;Banchoff (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;– February 17, 2017) was an American mathematician who worked on constructing [[polyhedron model]]s, and wrote the first book on their construction.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born to [[German people|German]] immigrants in Park Falls, Wisconsin, Joseph Wenninger always knew he was going to be a priest.  From an early age, it was understood that his brother Heinie would take after their father and become a baker, and that Joe, as he was then known, would go into the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

When Wenninger was thirteen, after graduating from the parochial school in Park Falls, Wisconsin, his parents saw an advertisement in the German newspaper ''Der Wanderer'' that would help to shape the rest of his life.  The ad was for a preparatory school in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]], associated with the Benedictine [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|St. John’s University]].&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

While admitting to feeling homesick at first, Wenninger quickly made friends and, after a year, knew that this was where he needed to be.  He was a student in a section of the prep school that functioned as a "minor seminary" – later moving on into St. John’s where he studied philosophy and theology, which led into the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Order_in_chaos_Magnus_Wenninger.jpg|thumb|An artistic model created by Father Wenninger called ''Order in Chaos'', representing a chiral subset of triangles of a 16-frequency icosahedral [[geodesic sphere]]]]
When Fr. Wenninger became a [[Benedictine monk]], he took on his monastic name Magnus, meaning "Great".  At the start of his career, Wenninger did not set out on a path one might expect would lead to his becoming the great polyhedronist that he is known as today. Rather, a few chance happenings and seemingly minor decisions shaped a course for Wenninger that led to his groundbreaking studies.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

Shortly after becoming a priest, Wenninger’s Abbot informed him that their order was starting up a school in the Bahamas.  It was decided that Wenninger would be assigned to teach at that school.  In order to do this, it was necessary that he get a master's degree. Wenninger was sent to the [[University of Ottawa]], in Canada, to study educational psychology. There he studied symbolic logic under Thomas Greenwood of the philosophy department. His thesis title was "The Concept of Number According to Roger Bacon and Albert the Great".&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

After completing his degree, Wenninger went to the school in the Bahamas, where he was asked by the headmaster to choose between teaching English or math. Wenninger chose math, since it seemed to be more in line with the topic of his MA thesis. However, not having taken many math courses in college, Wenninger admits to being able to teach by staying a few pages ahead of the students. He taught Algebra, Euclidean Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

After ten years of teaching, Wenninger felt he was becoming a bit stale.  At the suggestion of his headmaster, Wenninger attended the Columbia Teachers College in summer sessions over a four-year period in the late fifties. It was here that his interest in the "New Math" was formed and his studies of the polyhedra began.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

Wenninger died at the age of 97, at St John's Abbey on Friday, February 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170222111836/http://www.saintjohnsabbey.org/news/obituary-fr-magnus-wenninger-osb/ Obituary for Fr.

==Publications==
Wenninger’s first publication on the topic of polyhedra was the booklet entitled, "Polyhedron Models for the Classroom", which he wrote in 1966. He wrote to [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and received a copy of ''Uniform polyhedra ''which had a complete list of all 75 [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]].'' ''After this, he spent a great deal of time building various polyhedra. He made 65 of them and had them on display in his classroom. At this point, Wenninger decided to contact a publisher to see if there was any interest in a book. He had the models photographed and wrote the accompanying text, which he sent off to [[Cambridge University Press]] in London. The publishers indicated an interest in the book only if Wenninger built all 75 of the [[List of uniform polyhedra|uniform polyhedra]].&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

Wenninger did complete the models, with the help of R. Buckley of [[Oxford University]] who had done the calculations for the [[Snub (geometry)|snub]] forms by computer. This allowed Wenninger to build these difficult polyhedra with the exact measurements for lengths of the edges and shapes of the faces. This was the first time that all of the uniform polyhedra had been made as paper models. This project took Wenninger nearly ten years, and the book, ''Polyhedron Models'', was published by the Cambridge University Press in 1971, largely due to the exceptional photographs taken locally in Nassau.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

From 1971 onward, Wenninger focused his attention on the projection of the uniform polyhedra onto the surface of their circumscribing spheres. This led to the publication of his second book, ''Spherical Models'' in 1979, showing how regular, or semiregular, polyhedron can be used to build [[geodesic dome]]s. He also exchanged ideas with other mathematicians, [[Hugo Verheyen]] and [[Gilbert Fleurent]].&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

In 1981, Wenninger left the Bahamas and returned to St. John’s Abbey. His third book, ''Dual Models'', appeared in 1983. The book is a sequel to ''Polyhedron Models'', since it includes instructions on how to make paper models of the [[Dual polyhedron|duals]] of all 75 uniform polyhedra.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

In [[toxicology]], the '''median lethal dose''', '''LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' (abbreviation for "[[lethal dose]], 50%"), '''LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' (lethal concentration, 50%) or '''LCt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a measure of the [[lethal dose]] of a [[toxin]], [[radiation]], or [[pathogen]]. The value of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for a substance is the [[Dose (pharmacology)|dose]] required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's [[acute toxicity]].  A lower LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is indicative of increased toxicity.

The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html|title=What is a LD50 and LC50? : OSH Answers|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last=Safety|date=|website=www.ccohs.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''semilethal dose''' is occasionally used in the same sense, in particular with translations of foreign language text, but can also refer to a sublethal dose. LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is usually determined by tests on animals such as [[Laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]].
In 2011, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved alternative methods to LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for testing the cosmetic drug [[Botox]] without animal tests.&lt;ref&gt;

== Conventions ==
The LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as [[milligram]]s of substance per [[kilogram]] of body mass, sometimes also stated as [[nanogram]]s (suitable for [[botulinum]]), [[microgram]]s, or [[gram]]s (suitable for [[paracetamol]]) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).

The choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is not the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. Measures such as "LD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" and "LD&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf REGISTRY OF TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES (RTECS)&lt;br&gt;COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO THE RTECS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165953/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lethal dosage often varies depending on the method of [[Drug administration|administration]]; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] administered. For this reason, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., "LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; i.v."

The related quantities LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/30 or LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within [[Radiation Health Physics]], as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.

A comparable measurement is LCt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. ICt&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of [[chemical warfare]] agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10&amp;nbsp;l/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration.  The concept of Ct was first proposed by [[Fritz Haber]] and is sometimes referred to as [[Haber's Law]], which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1 × 100 = 100, as does 10 × 10 = 100).

Some chemicals, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's Law.  So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's Law.

For disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage. The median infective dose (ID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;'s to some test animal. In [[biological warfare]] infective dosage is the number of infective doses per cubic metre of air times the number of minutes of exposure (e.g., ICt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is 100 medium doses - min/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Limitation ==
As a measure of toxicity, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ernest Hodgson (2004). ''A Textbook of Modern Toxicology''. Wiley-Interscience (3rd ed.).{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (''[[cf.]]'' [[paracetamol toxicity]]), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be [[Health effects of chocolate#Other animals|toxic to many animals]]. When used to test [[venom]] from venomous creatures, such as [[snake]]s, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many [[venomous snake]]s are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and [[mongoose]]s may be exceptionally resistant. While most [[mammal]]s have a very similar physiology, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, such as humans, etc.

== Examples ==
Note: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] (ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;).  Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by [[therapeutic index]], which is simply the ratio of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; to ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The following examples are listed in reference to LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Mersenne prime''' is a [[prime number]] that is one less than a [[power of two]].  That is, it is a prime number of the form {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} for some [[integer]] {{math|''n''}}.  They are named after [[Marin Mersenne]], a French [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], who studied them in the early 17th century.

The [[exponentiation|exponents]] {{math|''n''}} which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31,&amp;nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000043}} and the resulting Mersenne primes are [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[127 (number)|127]], 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647,&amp;nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000668}}.

If {{math|''n''}} is a [[composite number]] then so is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. ({{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is divisible by both {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} and {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.) This definition is therefore equivalent to a definition as a prime number of the form {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} for some prime {{math|''p''}}.

More generally, numbers of the form {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} without the primality requirement may be called '''Mersenne numbers'''.  Sometimes, however, Mersenne numbers are defined to have the additional requirement that {{math|''n''}} be prime.
The smallest composite Mersenne number with prime exponent ''n'' is {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 × 89}}.

Mersenne primes {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also noteworthy due to their [[#Perfect numbers|connection to perfect numbers]].

A new Mersenne prime was found in December 2017. {{As of|2018|01|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=4}}, 50 are now known. The [[largest known prime number]] {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is a Mersenne prime.&lt;ref name="GIMPS-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=GIMPS Project Discovers Largest Known Prime Number: 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt;-1 |url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M77232917.html |date=3 January 2018 |work=Mersenne Research, Inc. |accessdate=3 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS), a [[distributed computing]] project on the Internet.

==About Mersenne primes==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes?}}
Many fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The [[Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture]] asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their [[asymptotic analysis|order of growth]]. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are [[composite number|composite]], although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of [[Sophie Germain prime]]s [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 ([[Modular arithmetic|mod 4]]). For these primes {{math|''p''}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} (which is also prime) will divide {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, e.g., {{math|23&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|47&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|167&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;83&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|263&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;131&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|359&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;179&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|383&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;191&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|479&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;239&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|503&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;251&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{OEIS|id=A002515}}. Since for these primes {{math|''p''}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}}, and the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}} must divide &lt;math&gt;\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; = {{math|''p''}}. Since {{math|''p''}} is a prime, it must be {{math|''p''}} or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since &lt;math&gt;\Phi_1(2)=1&lt;/math&gt; and 1 has no [[prime factor]]s, so it must be {{math|''p''}}. Hence, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_p(2)=2^p-1&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} = {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} cannot be prime.

The first four Mersenne primes are {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 3}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 31}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 127}} and because the first Mersenne prime starts at {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, all Mersenne primes are congruent to 3 (mod 4). Other than {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}}, all other Mersenne numbers are also congruent to 3 (mod 4). Consequently, in the [[prime factorization]] of a Mersenne number (&amp;nbsp;{{math|&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;) there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4).

A basic [[theorem]] about Mersenne numbers states that if {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is prime, then the exponent {{math|''p''}} must also be prime. This follows from the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&amp;=(2^a-1)\cdot \left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\right)\\&amp;=(2^b-1)\cdot \left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\right). \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 15 {{=}} 3 × 5 {{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) × (1 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

Though the above examples might suggest that {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is prime for all primes {{math|''p''}}, this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number

: {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 × 89}}.

The evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Nonetheless, prime values of {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} appear to grow increasingly sparse as {{math|''p''}} increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes {{mvar|p}} give rise to a Mersenne prime {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).

The lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]] (LLT) is an efficient [[primality test]] that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a [[cult following]]. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using [[distributed computing]].

Mersenne primes are used in [[pseudorandom number generator]]s such as the [[Mersenne twister]], [[Park–Miller random number generator]], Generalized Shift Register and Fibonacci RNG.

==Perfect numbers==
{{main|Euclid–Euler theorem}}
Mersenne primes {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also noteworthy due to their connection with [[perfect number]]s. In the 4th century BC, [[Euclid]] proved that if {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime, then {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as {{math|{{sfrac|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 1)|2}}}}, is the {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}}th [[triangular number]] and the {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}th [[hexagonal number]]. In the 18th century, [[Leonhard Euler]] proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.&lt;ref&gt;Chris K. Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists]&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]. It is unknown whether there are any [[odd perfect number]]s.

Mersenne primes take their name from the 17th-century [[French people|French]] scholar [[Marin Mersenne]], who compiled what was supposed to be a list of Mersenne primes with exponents up to 257.  The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:

::2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.

His list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;257&lt;/sub&gt;}} (which are composite) and omitted {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;89&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;107&lt;/sub&gt;}} (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.&lt;ref&gt;The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Édouard Lucas]] proved in 1876 that {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;}} is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.  {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;}} was determined to be prime in 1883 by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]], though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;}} is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cole|first= F. N.
|title=On the factoring of large numbers|jfm= 34.0216.04|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. |year=1903|volume=10|issue= 3
|pages=134–137|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1903-01079-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without speaking a word, he went to a blackboard and raised 2 to the 67th power, then subtracted one.  On the other side of the board, he multiplied {{nowrap|193,707,721 × 761,838,257,287}} and got the same number, then returned to his seat (to applause) without speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Searching for Mersenne primes==
Fast algorithms for finding Mersenne primes are available, and {{as of|2018|lc=y}} the seven [[largest known prime number]]s are Mersenne primes.

The first four Mersenne primes {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 3}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 31}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 127}} were known in antiquity. The fifth, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 8191}}, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ({{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;}}) were found by [[Pietro Cataldi]] in 1588. After nearly two centuries, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;}} was verified to be prime by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt;}}, found by [[Édouard Lucas]] in 1876, then {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;}} by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]] in 1883. Two more ({{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;89&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;107&lt;/sub&gt;}}) were found early in the 20th century, by [[R. E. Powers]] in 1911 and 1914, respectively.

The best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]]. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime {{math|''p'' &gt; 2}}, {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime [[if and only if]] {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} divides {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 4}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} (''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}} for {{math|''k'' &gt; 0}}.

During the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas–Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Scripta Mathematica |volume= 18 |year=1952 |pp=122–131 |title=A Brief History of the Investigations on Mersenne Numbers and the Latest Immense Primes |author=Horace S. Uhler |url=https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/LukeMirror/lit/lit_019.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for those investigators, the interval they were testing contains the largest known gap between Mersenne primes, in relative terms: the next Mersenne prime exponent, 521, would turn out to be more than four times larger than the previous record of 127.

[[File:Digits in largest Mersenne prime by year.svg|thumb|right|400px|Graph of number of digits in largest known Mersenne prime by year – electronic era. Note that the vertical scale, the number of digits, is doubly logarithmic in the value of the prime.]]
The search for Mersenne primes was revolutionized by the introduction of the electronic digital computer. [[Alan Turing]] searched for them on the [[Manchester Mark 1]] in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Napper, [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/maths.html The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1].&lt;/ref&gt; but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;521&lt;/sub&gt;}}, by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] [[SWAC (computer)|Western Automatic Computer (SWAC)]] at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], under the direction of [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|Lehmer]], with a computer search program written and run by Prof. [[Raphael M. Robinson|R. M. Robinson]]. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;607&lt;/sub&gt;}}, was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more&amp;nbsp;— {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;1279&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;2203&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;2281&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;— were found by the same program in the next several months. {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;4253&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the first Mersenne prime that is [[titanic prime|titanic]], {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;44,497&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the first [[gigantic prime|gigantic]], and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;6,972,593&lt;/sub&gt;}} was the first [[megaprime]] to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.&lt;ref&gt;The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Megaprime The Prime Glossary: megaprime].&lt;/ref&gt; All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size. The number of digits in the decimal representation of {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} equals {{math|⌊''n'' × log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;2⌋ + 1}}, where {{math|⌊''x''⌋}} denotes the [[floor function]] (or equivalently {{math|⌊log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''⌋ + 1}}).

In September 2008, mathematicians at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] participating in GIMPS won part of a $100,000 prize from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for their discovery of a very nearly 13-million-digit Mersenne prime. The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits.  The prime was found on a [[Dell OptiPlex]] 745 on August 23, 2008.  This was the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-prime27-2008sep27,0,2746766.story |title=UCLA mathematicians discover a 13-million-digit prime number|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2011-05-21|first=Thomas H.|last=Maugh II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2009, a GIMPS server log reported that a 47th Mersenne prime had possibly been found. The find was verified on June 12, 2009. The prime is {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;42,643,801&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. Although it is chronologically the 47th Mersenne prime to be discovered, it is smaller than the largest known at the time, which was the 45th to be discovered.

On January 25, 2013, [[Curtis Cooper (mathematician)|Curtis Cooper]], a mathematician at the [[University of Central Missouri]], discovered a 48th Mersenne prime, {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;57,885,161&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} (a number with 17,425,170 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=largest-prime-number-disc |title=Largest Prime Number Discovered |author=Tia Ghose |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 2016, Cooper published his discovery of a 49th Mersenne prime, {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;74,207,281&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} (a number with 22,338,618 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.&lt;ref name="GIMPS-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Curtis |title=Mersenne Prime Number discovery – 2&lt;sup&gt;74207281&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is Prime! |url=http://www.mersenne.org/primes/?press=M74207281 |date=7 January 2016 |work=Mersenne Research, Inc. |accessdate=22 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2073909-prime-number-with-22-million-digits-is-the-biggest-ever-found/|title=Prime number with 22 million digits is the biggest ever found|last=Brook|first=Robert|date=January 19, 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160121"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=New Biggest Prime Number = 2 to the 74 Mil ...

On January 3, 2018, it was announced that Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, had found a 50th Mersenne prime, {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} (a number with 23,249,425 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/?press=M77232917|title=Mersenne Prime Discovery - 2^77232917-1 is Prime!|website=www.mersenne.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# If {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''p''}} are natural numbers such that {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1}} is prime, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 2}} or {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}}.
#* '''Proof''': {{math|''a'' ≡ 1 ([[Modular arithmetic|mod]] ''a'' − 1)}}. Then {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' ≡ 1 (mod ''a'' − 1)}}, so {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1 ≡ 0 (mod ''a'' − 1)}}. Thus {{math|''a'' − 1 {{!}} ''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1}}. However, {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1}} is prime, so {{math|''a'' − 1 {{=}} ''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1}} or {{math|''a'' − 1 {{=}} ±1}}. In the former case, {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, hence {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0,1}} (which is a contradiction, as neither −1 nor 0 is prime) or {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1.}} In the latter case, {{math|''a'' {{=}} 2}} or {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}. If {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}, however, {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 0 − 1 {{=}} −1}} which is not prime. Therefore, {{math|''a'' {{=}} 2}}.
# If {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime, then {{math|''p''}} is prime.
#* '''Proof''': suppose that {{math|''p''}} is composite, hence can be written {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ab''}} with ''a'' and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}. Then {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} {{math|{{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} {{math|{{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} {{math|{{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''b'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; + (2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''b'' − 2&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;}} so {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is composite. By contrapositive, if {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime then ''p'' is prime.
# If {{math|''p''}} is an odd prime, then every prime {{math|''q''}} that divides {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} must be 1 plus a multiple of {{math|2''p''}}. This holds even when {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is prime.
#* For example, {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 31}} is prime, and {{nowrap|31 {{=}} 1 + 3 × (2 × 5)}}.  A composite example is {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 23 × 89}}, where {{nowrap|23 {{=}} 1 + (2 × 11)}} and {{nowrap|89 {{=}} 1 + 4 × (2 × 11)}}.
#* '''Proof''': By [[Fermat's little theorem]], {{math|''q''}} is a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''q'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. Since {{math|''q''}} is a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, for all positive integers {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''q''}} is also a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''pc''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. Since {{math|''p''}} is prime and {{math|''q''}} is not a factor of {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, {{math|''p''}} is also the smallest positive integer {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''q''}} is a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. As a result, for all positive integers {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''q''}} is a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} if and only if {{math|''p''}} is a factor of {{math|''x''}}. Therefore, since {{math|''q''}} is a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''q'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, {{math|''p''}} is a factor of {{math|''q'' − 1}} so {{math|''q'' ≡ 1 (mod ''p'')}}. Furthermore, since {{math|''q''}} is a factor of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, which is odd, {{math|''q''}} is odd. Therefore, {{math|''q'' ≡ 1 (mod 2''p'')}}.
#* This fact leads to a proof of [[Euclid's theorem]], which asserts the infinitude of primes, distinct from the proof written by Euclid: for every odd prime {{math|''p''}}, all primes dividing {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} are larger than {{math|''p''}}; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime.
#* This fact also implies that for every prime p &gt; 2, there is at least one prime of the form 2kp+1 less than or equal to M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, for some integer k.
# If {{math|''p''}} is an odd prime, then every prime {{math|''q''}} that divides {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is congruent to {{nowrap|±1 (mod 8)}}.
#* '''Proof''': {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 2 (mod ''q'')}}, so {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}(p + 1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a square root of {{math|2 mod ''q''}}.  By [[quadratic reciprocity]], every prime modulo in which the number 2 has a square root is congruent to {{nowrap|±1 (mod 8)}}.
# A Mersenne prime cannot be a [[Wieferich prime]].
#* '''Proof''': We show if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is a Mersenne prime, then the congruence {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} does not hold. By Fermat's little theorem, {{math|''m'' {{!}} ''p'' − 1}}.  Therefore, one can write {{math|''p'' − 1 {{=}} ''mλ''}}. If the given congruence is satisfied, then {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{!}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''mλ''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, therefore {{math|0 ≡ {{sfrac|2&lt;sup&gt;''mλ''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1|2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}} {{math|{{=}} 1 + 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;2''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + 2&lt;sup&gt;(''λ'' − 1)''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{math|≡ −''λ'' mod (2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}}. Hence {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{!}} ''λ''}}, and therefore {{math|''λ'' ≥ 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. This leads to {{math|''p'' − 1  ≥ ''m''(2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}}, which is impossible since {{math|''m'' ≥ 2}}.
#If {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}} are natural numbers then {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}} are [[coprime]] if and only if {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} and {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} are coprime. Consequently, a prime number divides at most one prime-exponent Mersenne number,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garlic.com/~wedgingt/mersenne.html Will Edgington's Mersenne Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014102940/http://www.garlic.com/~wedgingt/mersenne.html |date=2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so in other words the set of [[pernicious number|pernicious]] Mersenne numbers is pairwise coprime.
# If {{math|''p''}} and {{math|2''p'' + 1}} are both prime (meaning that {{math|''p''}} is a [[Sophie Germain prime]]), and {{math|''p''}} is [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, then {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/MerDiv2.html|title=Proof of a result of Euler and Lagrange on Mersenne Divisors|first=Chris K.|last=Caldwell|work=[[Prime Pages]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* '''Example''': 11 and 23 are both prime, and {{nowrap|11 {{=}} 2 × 4 + 3}}, so 23 divides {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.
#* '''Proof''': Let {{math|''q''}} be {{math|2''p'' + 1}}. By Fermat's little theorem, {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;2''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''q'')}}, so either {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''q'')}} or {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ −1 (mod ''q'')}}. Supposing latter true, then {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}(''p'' + 1)&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ −2 (mod ''q'')}}, so −2 would be a quadratic residue mod {{math|''q''}}. However, since {{math|''p''}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, {{math|''q''}} is congruent to {{nowrap|7 (mod 8)}} and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod {{math|''q''}}. Also since {{math|''q''}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, −1 is a quadratic nonresidue mod {{math|''q''}}, so −2 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction. Hence, the former congruence must be true and {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

| [[Greek mathematics|Ancient Greek mathematicians]]&lt;ref name="Philolaus"&gt;There is no mentioning among the  [[ancient Egypt]]ians of prime numbers, and they did not have any concept for prime numbers known today. In the [[Rhind papyrus]] (1650 BC) the Egyptian fraction expansions have fairly different forms for primes and composites, so it may be argued that they knew about prime numbers. "The Egyptians used ($) in the table above for the first primes {{math|''r''}} = 3, 5, 7, or 11 (also for {{math|''r''}} = 23). Here is another intriguing observation: That the Egyptians stopped the use of ($) at 11 suggests they understood (at least some parts of) Eratosthenes's Sieve 2000 years before Eratosthenes 'discovered' it." [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptroll2-n.html The Rhind 2/{{math|''n''}} Table] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].

In the school of [[Pythagoras]] (b. about 570 – d. about 495 BC) and the [[Pythagoreans]], we find the first sure observations of prime numbers. Hence the first two Mersenne primes, 3 and 7, were known to and may even be said to have been discovered by them. There is no reference, though, to their special form 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 as such.

The sources to the knowledge of prime numbers among the Pythagoreans are late. The Neoplatonic philosopher [[Iamblichus]], AD c. 245–c. 325, states that the Greek Platonic philosopher [[Speusippus]], c. 408 – 339/8 BC, wrote a book named ''On Pythagorean Numbers''. According to Iamblichus this book was based on the works of the Pythagorean [[Philolaus]], c. 470–c. 385 BC, who lived a century after [[Pythagoras]], 570 – c. 495 BC. In his ''Theology of Arithmetic'' in the chapter ''On the Decad'', Iamblichus writes: "Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book ''On Pythagorean Numbers''. In the first half of the book, he elegantly expounds linear numbers [i.e. prime numbers], polygonal numbers and all sorts of plane numbers, solid numbers and the five figures which are assigned to the elements of the universe, discussing both their individual attributes and their shared features, and their proportionality and reciprocity." [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38568451/Theologoumena-Arithmeticae#page=112 ''Iamblichus'' The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 112f.] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].

[[Iamblichus]] also gives us a direct quote from [[Speusippus]]' book where [[Speusippus]] among other things writes: "Secondly, it is necessary for a perfect number [the concept "perfect number" is not used here in a modern sense] to contain an equal amount of prime and incomposite numbers, and secondary and composite numbers." [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38568451/Theologoumena-Arithmeticae#page=113 ''Iamblichus'' The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 113.] [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. For the Greek original text, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=cUPXqSb7V1wC&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;ots=Q3QhUOGtvH&amp;dq=Speusippus%20prime&amp;hl=sv&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Speusippus of Athens: A Critical Study with a Collection of the Related Texts and Commentary by Leonardo Tarán, 1981, p. 140 line 21–22] [Retrieved 2012-11-11]

In his comments to  [[Nicomachus|Nicomachus of Gerasas]]'s [[Introduction to Arithmetic]], [[Iamblichus]] also mentions that [[Thymaridas]], ca. 400 BC – ca. 350 BC, uses the term ''rectilinear'' for prime numbers, and that [[Theon of Smyrna]], fl. AD 100, uses ''euthymetric'' and ''linear'' as alternative terms. [http://ia700709.us.archive.org//load_djvu_applet.php?file=27/items/NicomachusIntroToArithmetic/nicomachus_introduction_arithmetic.djvu Nicomachus of Gerasa, Introduction to Arithmetic, 1926, p. 127] [Retrieved 2012-11-11] It is unclear though when this said Thymaridas lived. "In a highly suspect passage in Iamblichus, Thymaridas is listed as a pupil of Pythagoras himself."  [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoreanism/#hippasus Pythagoreanism] [Retrieved 2012-11-11]

Before [[Philolaus]], c. 470–c. 385 BC, we have no proof of any knowledge of prime numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

All Mersenne numbers below the 50th Mersenne prime ({{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sub&gt;}}) have been tested at least once but some have not been double-checked. Primes are not always discovered in increasing order. For example, the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered ''after'' the 30th and the 31st. Similarly, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;43,112,609&lt;/sub&gt;}} was followed by two smaller Mersenne primes, first 2 weeks later and then 8 months later.&lt;ref name="GIMPS Milestones"&gt;[http://www.mersenne.org/report_milestones/ GIMPS Milestones Report]. Retrieved 2018-01-27&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;43,112,609&lt;/sub&gt;}} was the first discovered prime number with more than 10 million decimal digits.

The largest known Mersenne prime {{nowrap|(2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} is also the [[largest known prime number]].&lt;ref name="GIMPS-2017" /&gt;

In modern times, the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime.&lt;ref&gt;The largest known prime has been a Mersenne prime since 1952, except between 1989 and 1992; see Caldwell, "[http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History]" from the [[Prime Pages]] website, [[University of Tennessee at Martin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factorization of composite Mersenne numbers==
Since they are prime numbers, Mersenne primes are divisible only by 1 and by themselves.  However, not all Mersenne numbers are Mersenne primes, and the composite Mersenne numbers may be factored nontrivially.  Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the [[special number field sieve]] algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  {{As of|2016|8}}, 2{{sup|1,193}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is the record-holder,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thorsten Kleinjung]], [[Joppe Bos]], [[Arjen Lenstra]] "Mersenne Factorization Factory" http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; having been factored with a variant of the special number field sieve that allows the factorization of several numbers at once.  See [[integer factorization records]] for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a [[primality test]] on the cofactor. {{As of|2018|3}}, the largest factorization with [[probable prime]] factors allowed is {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;7,313,983&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 {{=}} 305,492,080,276,193 × {{math|''q''}}}}, where {{math|''q''}} is a 2,201,714-digit probable prime. It was discovered by Oliver Kruse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=(2^p-1)/%3F&amp;action=Search |title=PRP Top Records |author=Henri Lifchitz and Renaud Lifchitz |accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2018|06}}, the Mersenne number ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1277&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest composite Mersenne number with no known factors; it has no prime factors below 2&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mersenne.org/report_exponent/?exp_lo=1277&amp;full=1| title = Exponent Status for M1277|accessdate=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mersenne primitive part==
The [[primitive part]] of Mersenne number {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, the {{math|''n''}}th [[cyclotomic polynomial]] at 2, they are
:1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 3, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 57, 524287, 205, 2359, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... {{OEIS|id=A019320}}

Besides, if we notice those prime factors, and delete "old prime factors", for example, 3 divides the 2nd, 6th, 18th, 54th, 162nd, ... terms of this sequence, we only allow the 2nd term divided by 3, if we do, they are
:1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 1, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 19, 524287, 41, 337, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... {{OEIS|id=A064078}}

The numbers {{math|''n''}} for which {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}} is prime are
:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 150, ... {{OEIS|id=A072226}}

The numbers {{math|''n''}} for which {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} has an only primitive prime factor are
:2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 54, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 147, 150, ... {{OEIS|id=A161508}} (Differ from last sequence, this sequence does not have the term 6, but has the terms 18, 20, 21, 54, 147, 342, 602, and 889, and it is conjectured that no others)

==Mersenne numbers in nature and elsewhere==
In the mathematical problem [[Tower of Hanoi]], solving a puzzle with an {{math|''n''}}-disc tower requires {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} steps, assuming no mistakes are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petković|first=Miodrag|title=Famous Puzzles of Great Mathematicians|year=2009|publisher=AMS Bookstore|isbn=978-0-8218-4814-2|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of rice grains on the whole chessboard in the [[wheat and chessboard problem]] is {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The [[asteroid]] with [[minor planet]] number 8191 is named [[8191 Mersenne]] after Marin Mersenne, because 8191 is a Mersenne prime ([[3 Juno]], [[7 Iris]], [[31 Euphrosyne]] and [[127 Johanna]] having been discovered and named during the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Chamberlin |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=8191+Mersenne |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |publisher=Ssd.jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], an integer [[right triangle]] that is [[Pythagorean triple|primitive]] and has its even leg a power of 2 (&amp;nbsp;{{math|&amp;ge; 4}}&amp;nbsp;) generates a unique right triangle such that its [[inradius]] is always a Mersenne number. For example if the even leg is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} then because it is primitive it constrains the odd leg to be {{math|4&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}}, the [[hypotenuse]] to be {{math|4&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} and its inradius to be {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeis.org/A016131 |title=OEIS A016131 |publisher=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mersenne–Fermat primes==
A '''Mersenne–Fermat number''' is defined as {{math|{{sfrac|2''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;minus; 1|2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1}}}}, with {{math|''p''}} prime, {{math|''r''}} natural number, and can be written as '''{{math|MF(''p'', ''r'')}}''', when {{math|''r'' {{=}} 1}}, it is a Mersenne number, and when {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, it is a [[Fermat number]], the only known Mersenne–Fermat prime with {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}} are
:{{math|MF(2, 2), MF(3, 2), MF(7, 2), MF(59, 2), MF(2, 3), MF(3, 3), MF(2, 4),}} and {{math|MF(2, 5)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.spd.dcu.ie/johnbcos/fermat6.htm|title=A research of Mersenne and Fermat primes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529014233/http://staff.spd.dcu.ie/johnbcos/fermat6.htm|archivedate=2012-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, {{math|MF(''p'', ''r'') {{=}} ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''(2)}}, where {{math|''Φ''}} is the [[cyclotomic polynomial]].

==Generalizations==
The simplest generalized Mersenne primes are prime numbers of the form {{math|''f''(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is a low-degree [[polynomial]] with small integer [[coefficients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security|first=Jerome A.|last=Solinas|editor-first1=Henk C.

It is also natural to try to generalize primes of the form {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} to primes of the form {{math|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} (for {{math|''b'' ≠ 2}} and {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}). However (see also [[#Theorems about Mersenne numbers|theorems above]]), {{math|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is always divisible by {{math|''b'' − 1}}, so unless the latter is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], the former is not a prime. There are two ways to deal with that:

===Complex numbers===
In the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of integers (on [[real number]]s), if {{math|''b'' − 1}} is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], then {{math|''b''}} is either 2 or 0. But {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} are the usual Mersenne primes, and the formula {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} does not lead to anything interesting (since it is always −1 for all {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}). Thus, we can regard a ring of "integers" on [[complex number]]s instead of [[real number]]s, like [[Gaussian integer]]s and [[Eisenstein integer]]s.

====Gaussian Mersenne primes====
If we regard the ring of [[Gaussian integer]]s, we get the case {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1 + ''i''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1 − ''i''}}, and can ask ([[without loss of generality|WLOG]]) for what {{math|''n''}} the number {{math|(1 + ''i'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is a ''Gaussian prime'' which will then be called a '''Gaussian Mersenne prime'''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Caldwell: [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/GaussianMersenne.html The Prime Glossary: Gaussian Mersenne] (part of the [[Prime Pages]])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{math|(1 + ''i'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is a Gaussian prime for the following {{math|''n''}}:

:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 19, 29, 47, 73, 79, 113, 151, 157, 163, 167, 239, 241, 283, 353, 367, 379, 457, 997, 1367, 3041, 10141, 14699, 27529, 49207, 77291, 85237, 106693, 160423, 203789, 364289, 991961, 1203793, 1667321, 3704053, 4792057, ... {{OEIS|id=A057429}}

This sequence is in many ways similar to the list of exponents of ordinary Mersenne primes.

The [[Gaussian integer#Norm of a Gaussian integer|norm]]s (i.e. squares of absolute values) of these Gaussian primes are rational primes:

:5, 13, 41, 113, 2113, 525313, 536903681, 140737471578113, ... {{OEIS|id=A182300}}.

====Eisenstein Mersenne primes====
We can also regard the ring of [[Eisenstein integer]]s,  we get the case {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1 + ''ω''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1 − ''ω''}}, and can ask for what {{math|''n''}} the number {{math|(1 + ''ω'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is an ''Eisenstein prime'' which will then be called a '''Eisenstein Mersenne prime'''.

{{math|(1 + ''ω'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is an Eisenstein prime for the following {{math|''n''}}:

:2, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 79, 163, 193, 239, 317, 353, 659, 709, 1049, 1103, 1759, 2029, 5153, 7541, 9049, 10453, 23743, 255361, 534827, 2237561, ... {{OEIS|id=A066408}}

The norms (i.e. squares of absolute values) of these Eisenstein primes are rational primes:

:7, 271, 2269, 176419, 129159847, 1162320517, ... {{OEIS|id=A066413}}

===Divide an integer===

====Repunit primes====
{{main|Repunit}}
The other way to deal with the fact that {{math|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is always divisible by {{math|''b'' − 1}}, it is to simply take out this factor and ask which values of {{math|''n''}} make
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b^n-1}{b-1}&lt;/math&gt;
be prime. (The integer {{math|''b''}} can be either positive or negative.) If for example we take {{math|''b'' {{=}} 10}}, we get {{math|''n''}} values of:
:2, 19, 23, 317, 1031, 49081, 86453, 109297, 270343, ... {{OEIS|id=A004023}},&lt;br&gt;corresponding to primes 11, 1111111111111111111, 11111111111111111111111, ... {{OEIS|id=A004022}}.
These primes are called '''[[repunit]] primes'''. Another example is when we take {{math|''b'' {{=}} −12}}, we get {{math|''n''}} values of:
:2, 5, 11, 109, 193, 1483, 11353, 21419, 21911, 24071, 106859, 139739, ... {{OEIS|id=A057178}},&lt;br&gt;corresponding to primes −11, 19141, 57154490053, ....
It is a conjecture that for every integer {{math|''b''}} which is not a [[perfect power]], there are infinitely many values of {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1|''b'' − 1}}}} is prime. (When {{math|''b''}} is a perfect power, it can be shown that there is at most one {{math|''n''}} value such that {{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1|''b'' − 1}}}} is prime)

Least {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1|''b'' − 1}}}} is prime are (starting with {{math|''b'' {{=}} 2}}, {{math|0}} if no such {{math|''n''}} exists)
:2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 17, 2, 5, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 19, 3, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 0, 3, 13, 313, 2, 13, 3, 349, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 19, 2, 127, 19, 0, 3, 4229, 2, 11, 3, 17, 7, 3, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 19, 2, 19, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A084740}}

For negative bases {{math|''b''}}, they are (starting with {{math|''b'' {{=}} −2}}, {{math|0}} if no such {{math|''n''}} exists)
:3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 7, 2, 17, 2, 3, 3, 11, 2, 3, 11, 0, 3, 7, 2, 109, 2, 5, 3, 11, 31, 5, 2, 3, 53, 17, 2, 5, 2, 103, 7, 5, 2, 7, 1153, 3, 7, 21943, 2, 3, 37, 53, 3, 17, 2, 7, 2, 3, 0, 19, 7, 3, 2, 11, 3, 5, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A084742}} (notice this OEIS sequence does not allow {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}})

Least base {{math|''b''}} such that {{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;prime(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; − 1|''b'' − 1}}}} is prime are
:2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 10, 6, 2, 61, 14, 15, 5, 24, 19, 2, 46, 3, 11, 22, 41, 2, 12, 22, 3, 2, 12, 86, 2, 7, 13, 11, 5, 29, 56, 30, 44, 60, 304, 5, 74, 118, 33, 156, 46, 183, 72, 606, 602, 223, 115, 37, 52, 104, 41, 6, 338, 217, ... {{OEIS|id=A066180}}

For negative bases {{math|''b''}}, they are
:3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 16, 61, 2, 6, 10, 6, 2, 5, 46, 18, 2, 49, 16, 70, 2, 5, 6, 12, 92, 2, 48, 89, 30, 16, 147, 19, 19, 2, 16, 11, 289, 2, 12, 52, 2, 66, 9, 22, 5, 489, 69, 137, 16, 36, 96, 76, 117, 26, 3, ... {{OEIS|id=A103795}}

====Other generalized Mersenne primes====

Another generalized Mersenne number is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} any [[coprime]] integers, {{math|''a'' &gt; 1}} and {{math|−''a'' &lt; ''b'' &lt; ''a''}}. (Since {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is always divisible by {{math|''a'' − ''b''}}, the division is necessary for there to be any chance of finding prime numbers. In fact, this number is the same as the [[Lucas sequence|Lucas number]] {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''a'' + ''b'', ''ab'')}}, since {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are the [[zero of a function|roots]] of the [[quadratic equation]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''a'' + ''b'')''x'' + ''ab'' {{=}} 0}}, and this number equals 1 when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}) We can ask which {{math|''n''}} makes this number prime.  It can be shown that such {{math|''n''}} must be primes themselves or equal to 4, and {{math|''n''}} can be 4 if and only if {{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is prime. (Since {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}} {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'')(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Thus, in this case the pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} must be {{math|(''x'' + 1, −''x'')}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be prime. That is, {{math|''x''}} must be in {{oeis|id=A027861}}.) It is a conjecture that for any pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} such that for every natural number {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}}, {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are not both perfect {{math|''r''}}th powers, and {{math|−4''ab''}} is not a perfect [[fourth power]]. there are infinitely many values of {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} is prime.  (When {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are both perfect {{math|''r''}}th powers for an {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}} or when {{math|−4''ab''}} is a perfect fourth power, it can be shown that there are at most two {{math|''n''}} values with this property, since if so, then {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} can be factored algebraically) However, this has not been proved for any single value of {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}.

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Note: if {{math|''b'' &lt; 0}} and {{math|''n''}} is even, then the numbers {{math|''n''}} are not included in the corresponding OEIS sequence.

A conjecture related to the generalized Mersenne primes:&lt;ref name="Wagstaff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/heuristic.html|title=Heuristics: Deriving the Wagstaff Mersenne Conjecture|first=Chris|last=Caldwell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0906&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;P=R295&amp;1=NMBRTHRY&amp;9=A&amp;J=on&amp;d=No%20Match;Match;Matches&amp;z=4|title=Generalized Repunit Conjecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the conjecture predicts where is the next generalized Mersenne prime, if the conjecture is true, then there are infinitely many primes for all such {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} pairs)

For any integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} which satisfy the conditions:

# {{math|''a'' &gt; 1}}, {{math|−''a'' &lt; ''b'' &lt; ''a''}}.
# {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[coprime]]. (thus, {{math|''b''}} cannot be 0)
# For every natural number {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}}, {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are not both perfect {{math|''r''}}th powers. (since when {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are both perfect {{math|''r''}}th powers, it can be shown that there are at most two {{math|''n''}} value such that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} is prime, and these {{math|''n''}} values are {{math|''r''}} itself or a [[nth root|root]] of {{math|''r''}}, or 2)
# {{math|−4''ab''}} is not a perfect fourth power (if so, then the number has [[aurifeuillean factorization]]).

has prime numbers of the form

:&lt;math&gt;R_p(a,b)=\frac{a^p-b^p}{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;

for prime {{math|''p''}}, the prime numbers will be distributed near the best fit line

:&lt;math&gt;Y=G \cdot \log_a(\log_a(R_{(a,b)}(n)))+C&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} G=\frac{1}{e^\gamma}=0.561459483566\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

and there are about

:&lt;math&gt;(\log_e(N)+m \cdot \log_e(2) \cdot \log_e \left(\log_e(N))+\frac{1}{\sqrt N}-\delta\right) \cdot \frac{e^\gamma}{\log_e(a)}&lt;/math&gt;

prime numbers of this form less than {{math|''N''}}.

*{{math|''e''}} is the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithm]].
*{{math|''γ''}} is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].
*{{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[logarithm]] in [[base (exponentiation)|base]] {{math|''a''}}.
*{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;(''a'',''b'')&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}} is the {{math|''n''}}th prime number of the form {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} for prime {{math|''p''}}.
*{{math|''C''}} is a data fit constant which varies with {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.
*{{math|''δ''}} is a data fit constant which varies with {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.
*{{math|''m''}} is the largest natural number such that {{math|''a''}} and {{math|−''b''}} are both {{math|2{{sup|''m'' − 1}}}}th powers.

We also have the following three properties:

# The number of prime numbers of the form {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} (with prime {{math|''p''}}) less than or equal to {{math|''n''}} is about {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt; log&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(log&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''))}}.
# The expected number of prime numbers of the form {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} with prime {{math|''p''}} between {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''an''}} is about {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. 
# The probability that number of the form {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}} is prime (for prime {{math|''p''}}) is about {{math|{{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;|''p'' log&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'')}}}}.

If this conjecture is true, then for all such {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} pairs, let {{math|''q''}} be the {{math|''n''}}th prime of the form {{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a'' − ''b''}}}}, the graph of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(log&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q''))}} versus {{math|''n''}} is almost linear. (See &lt;ref name="Wagstaff"/&gt;)

When {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b'' + 1}}, it is {{math|(''b'' + 1){{sup|''n''}} − ''b''{{sup|''n''}}}}, a difference of two consecutive perfect {{math|''n''}}th powers, and if {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is prime, then {{math|''a''}} must be {{math|''b'' + 1}}, because it is divisible by {{math|''a'' − ''b''}}.

Least {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|(''b'' + 1){{sup|''n''}} − ''b''{{sup|''n''}}}} is prime are
:2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 3, 2, 17, 3, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2, 229, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 7, 2, 3, 37, 2, 3, 5, 58543, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 4663, 54517, 17, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 47, 61, 19, ... {{OEIS|id=A058013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13078">'''NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies''' ('''NEAT''') is a [[genetic algorithm]] (GA) for the generation of evolving [[artificial neural network]]s (a [[neuroevolution]] technique) developed by Ken Stanley in 2002 while at [[The University of Texas at Austin]]. It alters both the weighting parameters and structures of networks, attempting to find a balance between the fitness of evolved solutions and their diversity. It is based on applying three key techniques: tracking genes with history markers to allow crossover among topologies, applying speciation (the evolution of species) to preserve innovations, and developing topologies incrementally from simple initial structures ("complexifying").

== Performance ==
On simple control tasks, the NEAT algorithm often arrives at effective networks more quickly than other contemporary neuro-evolutionary techniques and [[reinforcement learning]] methods.&lt;ref name="stanley2002"&gt;Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen (2002). "Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies". Evolutionary Computation 10 (2): 99-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor2006"&gt;Matthew E. Taylor, Shimon Whiteson, and Peter Stone (2006). "Comparing Evolutionary and Temporal Difference Methods in a Reinforcement Learning Domain". GECCO 2006: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algorithm  ==
Traditionally a neural network topology is chosen by a human experimenter, and effective connection weight values are learned through a training procedure. This yields a situation whereby a trial and error process may be necessary in order to determine an appropriate topology. NEAT is an example of a topology and weight evolving artificial neural network (TWEAN) which attempt to simultaneously learn weight values and an appropriate topology for a neural network.

In order to encode the network into a phenotype for the GA, NEAT uses a direct encoding scheme which means every connection and neuron is explicitly represented. This is in contrast to indirect encoding schemes which define rules that allow the network to be constructed without explicitly representing every connection and neuron allowing for more compact representation.

The NEAT approach begins with a [[perceptron]]-like feed-forward network of only input neurons and output neurons. As evolution progresses through discrete steps, the complexity of the network's topology may grow, either by inserting a new neuron into a connection path, or by creating a new connection between (formerly unconnected) neurons.

=== Competing conventions ===
The competing conventions problem arises when there is more than one way of representing information in a phenotype. For example, if a genome contains neurons A, B and C and is represented by [A B C], if this genome is crossed with an identical genome (in terms of functionality) but ordered [C B A] crossover will yield children that are missing information ([A B A] or [C B C]), in fact 1/3 of the information has been lost in this example. NEAT solves this problem by tracking the history of genes by the use of a global innovation number which increases as new genes are added. When adding a new gene the global innovation number is incremented and assigned to that gene. Thus the higher the number the more recently the gene was added. For a particular generation if an identical mutation occurs in more than one genome they are both given the same number, beyond that however the mutation number will remain unchanged indefinitely.

These innovation numbers allow NEAT to match up genes which can be crossed with each other.&lt;ref name="stanley2002" /&gt;

== Implementation ==
The original implementation by Ken Stanley is published under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. It integrates with [[GNU Guile|Guile]], a GNU [[Scheme (programming language)|scheme]] interpreter. This implementation of NEAT is considered the conventional basic starting point for implementations of the NEAT algorithm.

== Extensions ==

=== rtNEAT ===
In 2003 Stanley devised an extension to NEAT that allows evolution to occur in real time rather than through the iteration of generations as used by most genetic algorithms. The basic idea is to put the population under constant evaluation with a "lifetime" timer on each individual in the population. When a network's timer expires its current fitness measure is examined to see whether it falls near the bottom of the population, and if so it is discarded and replaced by a new network bred from two high-fitness parents. A timer is set for the new network and it is placed in the population to participate in the ongoing evaluations.

The first application of rtNEAT is a video game called Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives, or NERO. In the first phase of the game, individual players deploy robots in a 'sandbox' and train them to some desired tactical doctrine. Once a collection of robots has been trained, a second phase of play allows players to pit their robots in a battle against robots trained by some other player, to see how well their training regimens prepared their robots for battle.

=== Phased pruning ===
An extension of Ken Stanley's NEAT, developed by Colin Green, adds periodic pruning of the network topologies of candidate solutions during the evolution process. This addition addressed concern that unbounded automated growth would generate unnecessary structure.

=== HyperNEAT ===

{{Main|HyperNEAT}}

[[HyperNEAT]] is specialized to evolve large scale structures. It was originally based on the [[CPPN]] theory and is an active field of research.

=== cgNEAT ===

Content-Generating NEAT (cgNEAT) evolves custom video game content based on user preferences. The first video game to implement cgNEAT is [[Galactic Arms Race]], a space-shooter game in which unique particle system weapons are evolved based on player usage statistics.&lt;ref name="hastings2009"&gt;Erin J. Hastings, Ratan K. Guha, and Kenneth O. Stanley (2009). "Automatic Content Generation in the Galactic Arms Race Video Game ". IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, volume 4, number 1, pages 245-263, New York: IEEE Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Each particle system weapon in the game is controlled by an evolved [[CPPN]], similarly to the evolution technique in the [[NEAT Particles]] interactive art program.

=== odNEAT ===
odNEAT is an online and decentralized version of NEAT designed for multi-robot systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = odNEAT: An Algorithm for Decentralised Online Evolution of Robotic Controllers|url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/EVCO_a_00141|journal = Evolutionary Computation|date = 2015-09-15|pages = 421–449|volume = 23|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/evco_a_00141|first = Fernando|last = Silva|first2 = Paulo|last2 = Urbano|first3 = Luís|last3 = Correia|first4 = Anders Lyhne|last4 = Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  odNEAT is executed onboard robots themselves during task execution to continuously optimize the parameters and the topology of the artificial neural network-based controllers. In this way, robots executing odNEAT have the potential to adapt to changing conditions and learn new behaviors as they carry out their tasks. The online evolutionary process is implemented according to a physically distributed island model. Each robot optimizes an internal population of candidate solutions (intra-island variation), and two or more robots exchange candidate solutions when they meet (inter-island migration). In this way, each robot is potentially self-sufficient and the evolutionary process capitalizes on the exchange of controllers between multiple robots for faster synthesis of effective controllers.

'''Noncommutative geometry''' ('''NCG''') is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with a geometric approach to [[noncommutative algebra]]s, and with the construction of ''spaces'' that are locally presented by noncommutative algebras of functions (possibly in some generalized sense). A noncommutative algebra is an [[associative algebra]] in which the multiplication is not [[commutative]], that is, for which &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; does not always equal &lt;math&gt;yx&lt;/math&gt;; or more generally an [[algebraic structure]] in which one of the principal [[binary operation]]s is not commutative; one also allows additional structures, e.g. [[topology]] or [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], to be possibly carried by the noncommutative algebra of functions.

==Motivation==

The main motivation is to extend the commutative duality between spaces and functions to the noncommutative setting. In mathematics, ''spaces'', which are geometric in nature, can be related to numerical [[function (mathematics)|functions]] on them. In general, such functions will form a [[commutative ring]]. For instance, one may take the ring ''C''(''X'') of [[continuous function|continuous]] [[complex number|complex]]-valued functions on a [[topological space]] ''X''. In many cases (''e.g.'', if ''X'' is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]), we can recover ''X'' from ''C''(''X''), and therefore it makes some sense to say that ''X'' has ''commutative topology''.

More specifically, in topology, compact [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] topological spaces can be reconstructed from the [[Banach algebra]] of functions on the space ([[Gelfand representation#Statement of the commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem|Gel'fand-Neimark]]). In commutative [[algebraic geometry]], [[Scheme (algebraic geometry)|algebraic scheme]]s are locally prime spectra of commutative unital rings (A. Grothendieck), and schemes can be reconstructed from the categories of quasicoherent sheaves of modules on them ([[Pierre Gabriel|P. Gabriel]]-A. Rosenberg). For [[Grothendieck topologies]], the cohomological properties of a site are invariant of the corresponding category of sheaves of sets viewed abstractly as a [[topos]] (A. Grothendieck). In all these cases, a space is reconstructed from the algebra of functions or its categorified version—some [[Sheaf (mathematics)|category of sheaves]] on that space.

Functions on a topological space can be multiplied and added pointwise hence they form a commutative algebra; in fact these operations are local in the topology of the base space, hence the functions form a sheaf of commutative rings over the base space.

The dream of noncommutative geometry is to generalize this duality to the duality between noncommutative algebras, or sheaves of noncommutative algebras, or sheaf-like noncommutative algebraic or operator-algebraic structures, and geometric entities of certain kinds, and give an interaction between the algebraic and geometric description of those via this duality.

Regarding that the commutative rings correspond to usual affine schemes, and commutative [[C*-algebras]] to usual topological spaces, the extension to noncommutative rings and algebras requires non-trivial generalization of [[topological space]]s as "non-commutative spaces". For this reason some talk about [[non-commutative topology]], though the term also has other meanings.

===Applications in mathematical physics===

Some applications in [[particle physics]] are described in the entries [[Noncommutative standard model]] and [[Noncommutative quantum field theory]]. The sudden rise in interest in noncommutative geometry in physics follows after the speculations of its role in [[M-theory]] made in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, Albert Schwarz, Noncommutative geometry and matrix theory: compactification on tori.  J. High Energy Phys. 1998, no. 2, Paper 3, 35 pp. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1126-6708/1998/02/003 doi], [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9711162 hep-th/9711162]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation from ergodic theory===
Some of the theory developed by [[Alain Connes]] to handle noncommutative geometry at a technical level has roots in older attempts, in particular in [[ergodic theory]]. The proposal of [[George Mackey]] to create a ''virtual subgroup'' theory, with respect to which ergodic [[group action]]s would become [[homogeneous space]]s of an extended kind, has by now been subsumed.

==Noncommutative C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras==
(The formal duals of) [[non-commutative]] [[C*-algebra]]s are often now called non-commutative spaces. This is by analogy with the [[Gelfand representation]], which shows that [[commutative]] C*-algebras are [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s.  In general, one can associate to any C*-algebra ''S'' a topological space ''Ŝ''; see [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]].

For the [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] between σ-finite [[measure space]]s and commutative [[von Neumann algebra]]s, [[noncommutative]] [[von Neumann algebra]]s are called ''non-commutative [[measure space]]s''.

==Noncommutative differentiable manifolds==

A smooth [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' is a topological space with a lot of extra structure. From its algebra of continuous functions ''C(M)'' we only recover ''M'' topologically. The algebraic invariant that recovers the Riemannian structure is a [[spectral triple]]. It is constructed from a smooth vector bundle ''E'' over ''M'', e.g. the exterior algebra bundle. The Hilbert space ''L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(M,E)'' of square integrable sections of ''E'' carries a representation of ''C(M)'' by multiplication operators, and we consider an unbounded operator ''D'' in ''L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(M,E)'' with compact resolvent (e.g. the [[signature operator]]), such that the commutators ''[D,f]'' are bounded whenever ''f'' is smooth. A recent deep theorem&lt;ref&gt;Connes, Alain, On the spectral characterization of manifolds, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2088 arXiv:0810.2088v1]&lt;/ref&gt; states that ''M'' as a Riemannian manifold can be recovered from this data.

This suggests that one might define a noncommutative Riemannian manifold as a [[spectral triple]] ''(A,H,D)'', consisting of a representation of a ''C*''-algebra ''A'' on a Hilbert space ''H'', together with an unbounded operator ''D'' on ''H'', with compact resolvent, such that ''[D,a]'' is bounded for all ''a'' in some dense subalgebra of ''A''. Research in spectral triples is very active, and many examples of noncommutative manifolds have been constructed.

==Noncommutative affine and projective schemes==
In analogy to the [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] between [[affine scheme]]s and [[commutative ring]]s, we define a category of '''noncommutative affine schemes''' as the dual of the category of associative unital rings. There are certain analogues of Zariski topology in that context so that one can glue such affine schemes to more general objects.

There are also generalizations of the Cone and of the Proj of a commutative graded ring, mimicking a Serre's theorem on Proj. Namely the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O-modules on a Proj of a commutative graded algebra is equivalent to the category of graded modules over the ring localized on Serre's subcategory of graded modules of finite length; there is also analogous theorem for coherent sheaves when the algebra is Noetherian. This theorem is extended as a definition of '''noncommutative projective geometry''' by [[Michael Artin]] and J. J. Zhang,&lt;ref&gt;M. Artin, J. J. Zhang, Noncommutative projective schemes, Adv. Math. 109 (1994), no. 2, 228--287, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/aima.1994.1087 doi]&lt;/ref&gt; who add also some general ring-theoretic conditions (e.g. Artin-Schelter regularity).

Many properties of projective schemes extend to this context. For example, there exist an analog of the celebrated [[Serre duality]] for noncommutative projective schemes of Artin and Zhang.&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Yekutieli, James J. Zhang, Serre duality for noncommutative projective schemes, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 125, n. 3, 1997, 697-707, [https://www.ams.org/proc/1997-125-03/S0002-9939-97-03782-9/S0002-9939-97-03782-9.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A. L. Rosenberg has created a rather general relative concept of '''noncommutative quasicompact scheme''' (over a base category), abstracting the Grothendieck's study of morphisms of schemes and covers in terms of categories of quasicoherent sheaves and flat localization functors.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Rosenberg, Noncommutative schemes, Compositio Mathematica 112 (1998) 93--125, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1000479824211 doi]; Underlying spaces of noncommutative schemes, preprint MPIM2003-111, [http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preprints/send?bid=1947 dvi], [http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preprints/send?bid=1948 ps]; [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|MSRI]] lecture ''Noncommutative schemes and spaces'' (Feb 2000): [http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/interact/rosenberg/1/index.html video]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also another interesting approach via localization theory, due to [[Fred Van Oystaeyen]], Luc Willaert and Alain Verschoren, where the main concept is that of a '''schematic algebra'''.&lt;ref&gt;Freddy van Oystaeyen, Algebraic geometry for associative algebras, {{isbn|0-8247-0424-X}} - New York: Dekker, 2000.- 287 p. - (Monographs and textbooks in pure and applied mathematics , 232); F. van Oystaeyen, L. Willaert, Grothendieck topology, coherent sheaves and Serre's theorem for schematic algebras, J. Pure Appl. Alg. 104 (1995), p. 109--122
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariants for noncommutative spaces==

Some of the motivating questions of the theory are concerned with extending known [[topological invariant]]s to formal duals of noncommutative (operator) algebras and other replacements and candidates for noncommutative spaces. One of the main starting points of the [[Alain Connes]]' direction in noncommutative geometry is his discovery of a new homology theory associated to noncommutative associative algebras and noncommutative operator algebras, namely the [[cyclic homology]] and its relations to the algebraic K-theory (primarily via Connes-Chern character map).

The theory of [[characteristic classes]] of smooth manifolds has been extended to spectral triples, employing the tools of operator [[K-theory]] and [[cyclic cohomology]]. Several generalizations of now classical [[index theorem]]s allow for effective extraction of numerical invariants from spectral triples. The fundamental characteristic class in cyclic cohomology, the [[JLO cocycle]], generalizes the classical [[Chern character]].

==Examples of noncommutative spaces==
* In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics,  the [[Symplectic manifold|symplectic]] [[phase space]] of [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical mechanics]] is [[deformation quantization|deformed]] into a non-commutative phase space generated by the [[Heisenberg group|position and momentum operators]].
* The [[standard model]] of particle physics is another example of a noncommutative geometry, cf [[noncommutative standard model]].
* The [[noncommutative torus]], deformation of the function algebra of the ordinary torus, can be given the structure of a spectral triple. This class of examples has been studied intensively and still functions as a test case for more complicated situations.
* Snyder space&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Snyder, Quantized Space-Time, Phys. Rev. 71 (1947) 38&lt;/ref&gt;
* Noncommutative algebras arising from [[foliation]]s.
* Examples related to [[dynamical systems]] arising from [[number theory]], such as the [[Continued fractions#Continued fractions and dynamical systems|Gauss shift]] on continued fractions, give rise to noncommutative algebras that appear to have interesting noncommutative geometries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8670">In [[mathematics]], '''Pascal's simplex''' is a generalisation of [[Pascal's triangle]] into arbitrary number of [[dimensions]], based on the [[multinomial theorem]].

== Generic Pascal's ''m''-simplex ==
Let ''m'' (''m'' &gt; 0) be a number of terms of a polynomial and ''n'' (''n'' ≥ 0) be a power the polynomial is raised to.

Let &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m&lt;/math&gt; denote a Pascal's ''m''-[[simplex]]. Each Pascal's ''m''-[[simplex]] is a [[semi-infinite]] object, which consists of an infinite series of its components.

Let &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_n&lt;/math&gt; denote its ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component, itself a finite (''m − 1'')-[[simplex]] with the edge length ''n'', with a notational equivalent &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle^{m-1}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ===
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_n = \vartriangle^{m-1}_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of the [[multinomial theorem#Multinomial coefficients|coefficients of multinomial expansion]] of a polynomial with ''m'' terms raised to the power of ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;|x|^n=\sum_{|k|=n}{\binom{n}{k}x^k};\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^m,\ k\in\mathbb{N}^m_0,\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ m\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle|x|=\sum_{i=1}^m{x_i},\ |k|=\sum_{i=1}^m{k_i},\ x^k=\prod_{i=1}^m{x_i^{k_i}}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example for &lt;math&gt;\wedge^4&lt;/math&gt; ===
Pascal's 4-simplex {{OEIS|id=A189225}}, sliced along the ''k&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''. All points of the same color belong to the same ''n''-th component, from red (for ''n'' = 0) to blue (for ''n'' = 3).

[[File:Simplex-4.svg|x220px|First four components of Pascal's 4-simplex.]]

== Specific Pascal's simplices ==
=== Pascal's 1-simplex ===
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^1&lt;/math&gt; is not known by any special name.

[[File:Simplex-1.svg|frameless|First four components of Pascal's line.]]

==== ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ====
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^1_n = \vartriangle^0_n&lt;/math&gt; (a point) is the [[multinomial theorem#Multinomial coefficients|coefficient of multinomial expansion]] of a polynomial with 1 term raised to the power of ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1)^n = \sum_{k_1=n} {n \choose k_1} x_1^{k_1};\ \ k_1, n \in \mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;

===== Arrangement of &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle^0_n&lt;/math&gt; =====
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle {n \choose n}&lt;/math&gt;
which equals 1 for all ''n''.

=== Pascal's 2-simplex ===
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as [[Pascal's triangle]] {{OEIS|id=A007318}}.

[[File:Simplex-2.svg|frameless|First four components of Pascal's triangle.]]

==== ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ====
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^2_n = \vartriangle^1_n&lt;/math&gt; (a line) consists of the coefficients of [[binomial expansion]] of a polynomial with 2 terms raised to the power of ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2)^n = \sum_{k_1+k_2=n} {n \choose k_1, k_2} x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2};\ \ k_1, k_2, n \in \mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;

===== Arrangement of &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle^1_n&lt;/math&gt; =====
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle {n \choose n, 0}, {n \choose n - 1, 1}, \cdots, {n \choose 1, n - 1}, {n \choose 0, n} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Pascal's 3-simplex ===
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^3&lt;/math&gt; is known as [[Pascal's tetrahedron]] {{OEIS|id=A046816}}.

[[File:Simplex-3.svg|frameless|First four components of Pascal's tetrahedron.]]

==== ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ====
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^3_n = \vartriangle^2_n&lt;/math&gt; (a triangle) consists of the coefficients of [[trinomial expansion]] of a polynomial with 3 terms raised to the power of ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^n = \sum_{k_1+k_2+k_3=n} {n \choose k_1, k_2, k_3} x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} x_3^{k_3};\ \ k_1, k_2, k_3, n \in \mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;

===== Arrangement of &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle^2_n&lt;/math&gt; =====
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textstyle {n \choose n, 0, 0} &amp;, \textstyle {n \choose n - 1, 1, 0}, \cdots\cdots, {n \choose 1, n - 1, 0}, {n \choose 0, n, 0}\\
\textstyle {n \choose n - 1, 0, 1} &amp;, \textstyle {n \choose n - 2, 1, 1}, \cdots\cdots, {n \choose 0, n - 1, 1}\\
&amp;\vdots\\
\textstyle {n \choose 1, 0, n - 1} &amp;, \textstyle {n \choose 0, 1, n - 1}\\
\textstyle {n \choose 0, 0, n}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==
=== Inheritance of components ===
&lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_n = \vartriangle^{m-1}_n&lt;/math&gt; is numerically equal to each (''m'' − 1)-face (there is ''m'' + 1 of them) of &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle^m_n = \wedge^{m+1}_n&lt;/math&gt;, or:

:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_n = \vartriangle^{m-1}_n \subset\ \vartriangle^m_n = \wedge^{m+1}_n&lt;/math&gt;

From this follows, that the whole &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m&lt;/math&gt; is (''m'' + 1)-times included in &lt;math&gt;\wedge^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;, or:

:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^m \subset \wedge^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example ====
         &lt;math&gt;\wedge^1&lt;/math&gt;         &lt;math&gt;\wedge^2&lt;/math&gt;        &lt;math&gt;\wedge^3&lt;/math&gt;         &lt;math&gt;\wedge^4&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_0&lt;/math&gt;     1          1          1          1
 
 &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_1&lt;/math&gt;     1         1 1        1 1        1 1  1
                              1          1
 
 &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_2&lt;/math&gt;     1        1 2 1      1 2 1      1 2 1  2 2  1
                             2 2        2 2    2
                              1          1
 
 &lt;math&gt;\wedge^m_3&lt;/math&gt;     1       1 3 3 1    1 3 3 1    1 3 3 1  3 6 3  3 3  1
                            3 6 3      3 6 3    6 6    3
                             3 3        3 3      3
                              1          1

For more terms in the above array refer to {{OEIS|id=A191358}}

=== Equality of sub-faces ===
Conversely, &lt;math&gt;\wedge^{m+1}_n = \vartriangle^m_n&lt;/math&gt; is (''m'' + 1)-times bounded by &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle^{m-1}_n = \wedge^m_n&lt;/math&gt;, or:

:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^{m+1}_n = \vartriangle^m_n \supset \vartriangle^{m-1}_n = \wedge^m_n&lt;/math&gt;

From this follows, that for given ''n'', all ''i''-faces are numerically equal in ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; components of all Pascal's (''m'' &amp;gt; ''i'')-simplices, or:

:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^{i+1}_n = \vartriangle^i_n \subset \vartriangle^{m&gt;i}_n = \wedge^{m&gt;i+1}_n&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example ====
The 3rd component (2-simplex) of Pascal's 3-simplex is bounded by 3 equal 1-faces (lines). Each 1-face (line) is bounded by 2 equal 0-faces (vertices):

 2-simplex   1-faces of 2-simplex         0-faces of 1-face
 
  1 3 3 1    1 . . .  . . . 1  1 3 3 1    1 . . .   . . . 1
   3 6 3      3 . .    . . 3    . . .
    3 3        3 .      . 3      . .
     1          1        1        .

Also, for all ''m'' and all ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \wedge^1_n = \vartriangle^0_n \subset \vartriangle^{m-1}_n = \wedge^m_n&lt;/math&gt;

=== Number of coefficients ===
For the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ((''m'' − 1)-simplex) of Pascal's ''m''-simplex, the number of the [[multinomial theorem#Multinomial coefficients|coefficients of multinomial expansion]] it consists of is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;{(n-1) + (m-1) \choose (m-1)} + {n + (m - 2) \choose (m - 2)} = {n + (m - 1) \choose (m - 1)},&lt;/math&gt;

that is, either by a sum of the number of coefficients of an (''n'' − 1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ((''m'' − 1)-simplex) of Pascal's ''m''-simplex with the number of coefficients of an ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component ((''m'' − 2)-simplex) of Pascal's (''m'' − 1)-simplex, or by a number of all possible partitions of an ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power among ''m'' exponents.

In [[computational complexity theory]], '''polyL''' is the [[complexity class]] of [[decision problem]]s that can be solved on a [[deterministic Turing machine]] by an algorithm whose [[space complexity]] is bounded by a [[polylogarithmic]] function in the size of the input. In other words, '''polyL'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''[[DSPACE]]'''((log&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;sup&gt;O(1)&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''n'' denotes the input size, and [[Big O notation|O]](1) denotes a constant.

Just as '''[[L (complexity)|L]]''' ⊆ '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', '''polyL''' ⊆ '''[[Quasi-polynomial time|QP]]'''. However, the only proven relationship between '''polyL''' and '''P''' is that '''polyL''' ≠ '''P'''; it is unknown if '''polyL''' ⊊ '''P''', if '''P''' ⊊ '''polyL''', or if neither is contained in the other. One proof that '''polyL''' ≠ '''P''' is that '''P''' has a [[complete problem]] under [[logarithmic space]] [[many-one reduction]]s but '''polyL''' does not due to the [[space hierarchy theorem]].
The space hierarchy theorem guarantees that '''DSPACE'''(log&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') ⊊ '''DSPACE'''(log&lt;sup&gt;d + 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') for all integers d &gt; 0. If '''polyL''' had a complete problem, call it ''A'', it would be an element of '''DSPACE'''(log&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') for some integer k &gt; 0. Suppose problem ''B'' is an element of '''DSPACE'''(log&lt;sup&gt;k + 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') \ '''DSPACE'''(log&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ''n''). The assumption that ''A'' is complete implies the following O(log&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') space algorithm for ''B'': reduce ''B'' to ''A'' in logarithmic space, then decide ''A'' in O(log&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') space. This implies that ''B'' is an element of '''DSPACE'''(log&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') and hence violates the space hierarchy theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1425">In [[logic]], '''predicate abstraction''' is the result of creating a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] from a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. If Q is any formula then the predicate abstract formed from that sentence is (λy.Q), where λ is an [[abstraction operator]] and in which every occurrence of y occurs bound by λ in (λy.Q). The resultant predicate (λx.Q(x)) is a monadic predicate capable of taking a term t as argument as in (λx.Q(x))(t), which says that the object denoted by 't' has the property of being such that Q.

The ''law of abstraction'' states ( λx.Q(x) )(t) ≡ Q(t/x) where Q(t/x) is the result of replacing all free occurrences of x in Q by t. This law is shown to fail in general in at least two cases: (i) when t is irreferential and (ii) when Q contains [[modal operator]]s.

In [[modal logic]] the "''de re''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''de dicto'' distinction" is stated as

1. (DE DICTO): &lt;math&gt;\Box A(t)&lt;/math&gt;

2. (DE RE): &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.\Box A(x))(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In (1) the modal operator applies to the formula A(t) and the term t is within the scope of the modal operator. In (2) t is ''not'' within the scope of the modal operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7570">In [[mathematics]], the '''Prékopa–Leindler inequality''' is an [[integral]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] closely related to the [[reverse Young's inequality]], the [[Brunn–Minkowski inequality]] and a number of other important and classical inequalities in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. The result is named after the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]]s [[András Prékopa]] and [[László Leindler]].

==Statement of the inequality==
Let 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and let ''f'', ''g'', ''h''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞) be non-[[negative number|negative]] [[real number|real-valued]] [[measurable function]]s defined on ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Suppose that these functions satisfy

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;h \left( (1-\lambda)x + \lambda y \right) \geq f(x)^{1 - \lambda} g(y)^\lambda &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

for all ''x'' and ''y'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\| h\|_{1} := \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} h(x) \, \mathrm{d} x \geq \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} x \right)^{1 -\lambda} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} g(x) \, \mathrm{d} x \right)^\lambda =: \| f\|_1^{1 -\lambda} \| g\|_1^\lambda. &lt;/math&gt;

==Essential form of the inequality==
Recall that the [[essential supremum]] of a measurable function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{ess\,sup}}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}} f(x) = \inf \left\{ t \in [- \infty, + \infty] \mid f(x) \leq t \text{ for almost all } x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This notation allows the following ''essential form'' of the Prékopa–Leindler inequality: let 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and let ''f'', ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;;&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)) be non-negative [[absolutely integrable function|absolutely integrable]] functions. Let

:&lt;math&gt;s(x) = \mathop{\mathrm{ess\,sup}}_{y \in \mathbb{R}^n} f \left( \frac{x - y}{1 - \lambda} \right)^{1 - \lambda} g \left( \frac{y}{\lambda} \right)^\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''s'' is measurable and

:&lt;math&gt;\| s \|_1 \geq \| f \|_1^{1 - \lambda} \| g \|_1^\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

The essential supremum form was given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = [[Herm Jan Brascamp]] and [[Elliott H. Lieb]] | title = On extensions of the Brunn–Minkowski and Prekopa–Leindler theorems, including inequalities for log concave functions and with an application to the diffusion equation | journal = Journal of Functional Analysis | volume = 22 |issue=4 | pages = 366–389 | year = 1976 |doi=10.1016/0022-1236(76)90004-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its use can change the left side of the inequality. For example, a function ''g'' that takes the value 1 at exactly one point will not usually yield a zero left side in the "non-essential sup" form but it will always yield a zero left side in the "essential sup" form.

==Relationship to the Brunn–Minkowski inequality==
It can be shown that the usual Prékopa–Leindler inequality implies the [[Brunn–Minkowski inequality]] in the following form: if 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''A'' and ''B'' are [[bounded set|bounded]], [[measurable set|measurable subsets]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the [[Minkowski sum]] (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'')''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;λ''B'' is also measurable, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left( (1 - \lambda) A + \lambda B \right) \geq \mu (A)^{1 - \lambda} \mu (B)^{\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ'' denotes ''n''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]. Hence, the Prékopa–Leindler inequality can also be used&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Richard J. (2002). "The Brunn–Minkowski inequality". Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 39 (3): pp. 355–405 (electronic). doi:10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00941-2. {{issn|0273-0979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to prove the Brunn–Minkowski inequality in its more familiar form: if 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''A'' and ''B'' are non-[[empty set|empty]], [[bounded set|bounded]], [[measurable set|measurable subsets]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'')''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;λ''B'' is also measurable, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left( (1 - \lambda) A + \lambda B \right)^{1 / n} \geq (1 - \lambda) \mu (A)^{1 / n} + \lambda \mu (B)^{1 / n}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications in probability and statistics==
The Prékopa–Leindler inequality is useful in the theory of [[Logarithmically concave function|log-concave distributions]], as it can be used to show that log-concavity is preserved by [[Marginal distribution|marginalization]] and [[Independence (probability)|independent]] summation of log-concave distributed random variables. Suppose that ''H''(''x'',''y'') is a log-concave distribution for (''x'',''y'') ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so that by definition we have

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;H \left( (1 - \lambda)(x_1,y_1) + \lambda (x_2,y_2) \right) \geq H(x_1,y_1)^{1 - \lambda}  H(x_2,y_2)^{\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

and let ''M''(''y'') denote the marginal distribution obtained by integrating over ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;M(y) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^m} H(x,y) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 be given. Then equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) satisfies condition ({{EquationNote|1}}) with ''h''(''x'') = ''H''(''x'',(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'')y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''λy''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),  ''f''(''x'') = ''H''(''x'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''g''(''x'') = ''H''(''x'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), so the Prékopa–Leindler inequality applies. It can be written in terms of ''M'' as

:&lt;math&gt;M((1-\lambda) y_1 + \lambda y_2) \geq M(y_1)^{1-\lambda} M(y_2)^\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the definition of log-concavity for ''M''.

To see how this implies the preservation of log-convexity by independent sums, suppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are independent random variables with log-concave distribution. Since the product of two log-concave functions is log-concave, the joint distribution of (''X'',''Y'') is also log-concave. Log-concavity is preserved by affine changes of coordinates, so the distribution of (''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y'',&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is log-concave as well. Since the distribution of ''X+Y'' is a marginal over the joint distribution of (''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y'',&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Y''), we conclude that ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y'' has a log-concave distribution.

In [[mathematics]], the '''quadruple product''' is a product of four [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The name "quadruple product" is used for two different products,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|Wilson|1901|loc=§42 of section "Direct and skew products of vectors", p.77 |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scalar-valued '''scalar quadruple product''' and the vector-valued '''vector quadruple product or vector product of four vectors '''.

== Scalar quadruple product ==
The '''scalar quadruple product'''  is defined as the [[dot product]] of two [[cross product]]s:
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{a \times b})\mathbf {\cdot}(\mathbf{c}\times \mathbf{d}) \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a, b, c, d''' are vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|Wilson|1901|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be evaluated using the identity:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{a \times b})\mathbf {\cdot}(\mathbf{c}\times \mathbf{d}) = (\mathbf{a \cdot c})(\mathbf{b \cdot d}) - (\mathbf{a \cdot d})(\mathbf{b \cdot c}) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
or using the [[determinant]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a \times b})\mathbf {\cdot}(\mathbf{c}\times \mathbf{d}) =\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{a\cdot c} &amp; \mathbf{a\cdot d} \\
 \mathbf{b\cdot c} &amp; \mathbf{b\cdot d}  \end{vmatrix} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==Vector quadruple product ==
The '''vector quadruple product'''  is defined as the [[cross product]] of two cross products:
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{a \times b}) \mathbf{\times} (\mathbf{c}\times \mathbf{d}) \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a, b, c, d''' are vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|Wilson|1901|pp=77 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be evaluated using the identity:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|Wilson|1901|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{a \times b} )\mathbf{\times} (\mathbf{c}\times \mathbf{d}) = [\mathbf{a,\ b, \ d}] \mathbf c - [\mathbf{a,\ b, \ c}] \mathbf d \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
This identity can also be written using [[tensor]] notation and the [[Einstein summation]] convention as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a \times b} )\mathbf{\times} (\mathbf{c}\times \mathbf{d})=\varepsilon_{ijk} a^i c^j d^k b^l - \varepsilon_{ijk} b^i c^j d^k a^l=\varepsilon_{ijk} a^i b^j d^k c^l - \varepsilon_{ijk} a^i b^j c^k d^l&lt;/math&gt;
using the notation for the [[triple product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{a,\ b, \ d}] = (\mathbf{a \times b}) \mathbf{\cdot d } =  \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{a\cdot }\hat {\mathbf i} &amp; \mathbf{b \cdot} \hat {\mathbf i} &amp; \mathbf{d\cdot} \hat {\mathbf i}\\
 \mathbf{a\cdot }\hat {\mathbf j} &amp; \mathbf{b\cdot} \hat {\mathbf j} &amp; \mathbf{d\cdot}\hat {\mathbf j}\\ \mathbf{a\cdot} \hat {\mathbf k} &amp; \mathbf{b\cdot} \hat {\mathbf k} &amp; \mathbf{d\cdot }\hat {\mathbf k}  \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{a\cdot }\hat {\mathbf i} &amp; \mathbf{a \cdot} \hat {\mathbf j} &amp; \mathbf{a\cdot} \hat {\mathbf k}\\
 \mathbf{b\cdot }\hat {\mathbf i} &amp; \mathbf{b\cdot} \hat {\mathbf j} &amp; \mathbf{b\cdot}\hat {\mathbf k}\\ \mathbf{d\cdot} \hat {\mathbf i} &amp; \mathbf{d\cdot} \hat {\mathbf j} &amp; \mathbf{d\cdot }\hat {\mathbf k}  \end{vmatrix}
\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the last two forms are determinants with &lt;math&gt; \hat {\mathbf i}, \  \hat {\mathbf j}, \  \hat {\mathbf k} &lt;/math&gt; denoting unit vectors along three mutually orthogonal directions.

Equivalent forms can be obtained using the identity:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|Wilson|year=1901|loc=Equation 27, p. 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{b,\ c, \ d}]\mathbf a - [\mathbf{c,\ d, \ a}]\mathbf b+[\mathbf{d,\ a, \ b}]\mathbf{c} -[\mathbf{a,\ b, \ c}]\mathbf d = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

== Application==
The quadruple products are useful for deriving various formulas in spherical and plane geometry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; For example, if four points are chosen on the unit sphere, ''A, B, C, D'', and unit vectors drawn from the center of the sphere to the four points, '''a, b, c, d''' respectively, the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a \times b})\mathbf{\cdot}(\mathbf{c \times d}) = (\mathbf {a\cdot c })(\mathbf {b\cdot d })-(\mathbf{ a\cdot d })(\mathbf {b\cdot c }) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
in conjunction with the relation for the magnitude of the cross product:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{a \times b}\| = a b \sin \theta_{ab} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and the dot product:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a \cdot b} = a b \cos \theta_{ab} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a = b'' = 1 for the unit sphere, results in the identity among the angles attributed to Gauss:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_{ab}\sin \theta_{cd}\cos x = \cos\theta_{ac}\cos\theta_{bd} - \cos\theta_{ad} \cos \theta_{bc} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' is the angle between '''a × b''' and '''c × d''', or equivalently, between the planes defined by these vectors.

[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]'s pioneering work on vector calculus provides several other examples.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[most general unifier]] of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{L_2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; have no common variables.

== Example ==
The clauses &lt;math&gt;P(x),Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P(b)&lt;/math&gt; can apply this rule with &lt;math&gt;[b/x]&lt;/math&gt; as unifier.

Here x is a variable and b is a constant.

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{P(x),Q(x) \,\,\,\, \neg P(b)}
{Q(b)}[b/x]
&lt;/math&gt;

Here we see that

* The clauses &lt;math&gt;P(x),Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \neg P(x) &lt;/math&gt; are the inference’s premises
* &lt;math&gt; Q(b) &lt;/math&gt; (the resolvent of the premises) is its conclusion.
* The literal &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the left resolved literal,
* The literal &lt;math&gt;\neg P(b)&lt;/math&gt; is the right resolved literal,
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the resolved atom or pivot.
* &lt;math&gt;[b/x]&lt;/math&gt; is the most general unifier of the resolved literals.

:&lt;math&gt;C(f,h)(x)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty f(kh) \, \textrm{sinc} \left(\dfrac{x}{h}-k \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where the step size h&gt;0 and where the sinc function is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{sinc}(x)=\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}&lt;/math&gt;
Sinc approximation methods excel for problems whose solutions may have singularities, or infinite domains, or boundary layers.

The truncated Sinc expansion of f is defined by the following series:
:&lt;math&gt; C_{M,N}(f,h)(x)  = \displaystyle \sum_{k=-M}^{N} f(kh) \, \textrm{sinc} \left(\dfrac{x}{h}-k \right)  &lt;/math&gt; .

==Sinc numerical methods cover==
*function approximation,
*approximation of [[derivative]]s,
*approximate definite and indefinite [[integral|integration]],
*approximate solution of initial and boundary value ordinary [[differential equation]] (ODE) problems,
*approximation and inversion of [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] and [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] transforms,
*approximation of [[Hilbert transforms]],
*approximation of definite and indefinite [[convolution]],
*approximate solution of partial differential equations,
*approximate solution of [[integral equations]],
*construction of conformal maps.
Indeed, Sinc are ubiquitous for approximating every operation of calculus

In the standard setup of the sinc numerical methods, the errors (in [[big O notation]]) are known to be &lt;math&gt;O\left(e^{-c\sqrt{n}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with some c&gt;0, where n is the number of nodes or bases used in the methods. However, Sugihara&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sugihara | first1 = M. | last2 = Matsuo | first2 = T. | doi = 10.1016/j.cam.2003.09.016 | title = Recent developments of the Sinc numerical methods | journal = Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume = 164-165 | pages = 673 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; has recently found that the errors in the Sinc numerical methods based on double exponential transformation are &lt;math&gt;O\left(e^{-\frac{k n}{\ln n}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with some k&gt;0, in a setup that is also meaningful both theoretically and practically and are found to be best possible in a certain mathematical sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3615">'''Sinkhorn's theorem''' states that every square matrix with positive entries can be written in a certain standard form.

==Theorem==
If ''A'' is an [[Matrix (mathematics)#Square matrices|''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix]] with strictly positive elements, then there exist [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with strictly positive diagonal elements such that ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''AD''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Doubly stochastic matrix|doubly stochastic]]. The matrices ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are unique modulo multiplying the first matrix by a positive number and dividing the second one by the same number. 
&lt;ref name="Sinkhorn"&gt;Sinkhorn, Richard. (1964). "A relationship between arbitrary positive matrices and doubly stochastic matrices." ''Ann. Math. Statist.'' '''35''', 876–879. {{doi|10.1214/aoms/1177703591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm==
A simple iterative method to approach the double stochastic matrix is to alternately rescale all rows and all columns of ''A'' to sum to 1. Sinkhorn and Knopp presented this algorithm and analyzed its convergence.
&lt;ref name="SinkhornKnopp"&gt;Sinkhorn, Richard, &amp; Knopp, Paul. (1967). "Concerning nonnegative matrices and doubly stochastic matrices". ''Pacific J. Math.'' '''21''', 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogues and extensions==
The following analogue for unitary matrices is also true: for every [[unitary matrix]] ''U'' there exist two diagonal unitary matrices ''L'' and ''R'' such that ''LUR'' has each of its columns and rows summing to 1.&lt;ref name="IdelWolf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Idel|first1=Martin|last2=Wolf|first2=Michael M.|title=Sinkhorn normal form for unitary matrices|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|date=2015|volume=471|pages=76–84|doi=10.1016/j.laa.2014.12.031|arxiv=1408.5728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following extension to maps between matrices is also true (see Theorem 5&lt;ref name="GeoPav"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Georgiou|first1=Tryphon|last2=Pavon|first2=Michele|title=Positive contraction mappings for classical and quantum Schrödinger systems|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|date=2015|volume=56|pages=033301-1-24|doi=10.1063/1.4915289|arxiv=1405.6650|bibcode=2015JMP....56c3301G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also Theorem 4.7&lt;ref name="Gur"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurvits|first1=Leonid|title=Classical complexity and quantum entanglement|journal=Journal of Computational Science|date=2004|volume=69|pages=448-484|doi=10.1016/j.jcss.2004.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;): given a [[Quantum_operation|Kraus operator]]
which represents the quantum operation Φ mapping a [[density matrix]] into another,
:&lt;math&gt; S \to \Phi(S) = \sum_i B_i S B_i^*, &lt;/math&gt;
that is trace preserving,
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_i B_i^* B_i = I, &lt;/math&gt;
and, in addition, whose range is in the interior of the positive definite cone (strict positivity), there exist scalings ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''j'' in {0,1}, that are positive definite so that the rescaled [[Quantum_operation|Kraus operator]]
:&lt;math&gt; S \to x_1\Phi(x_0^{-1}Sx_0^{-1})x_1 = \sum_i (x_1B_ix_0^{-1}) S (x_1B_ix_0^{-1})^* &lt;/math&gt;
is doubly stochastic. In other words, it is such that both,
:&lt;math&gt; x_1\Phi(x_0^{-1}I x_0^{-1})x_1 = I, &lt;/math&gt;
as well as for the adjoint,
:&lt;math&gt; x_0^{-1}\Phi^*(x_1I x_1)x_0^{-1} = I, &lt;/math&gt;
where I denotes the identity operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">In [[number theory]], a '''symbol''' is any of many different generalizations of the [[Legendre symbol]]. This article describes the relations between these various generalizations.

The symbols below are arranged roughly in order of the date they were introduced, which is usually (but not always) in order of increasing generality.

* [[Legendre symbol]]  &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined for ''p'' a prime, ''a'' an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or −1.
* [[Jacobi symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined for ''b'' a positive odd integer, ''a'' an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or −1. An extension of the Legendre symbol to more general values of ''b''. 
* [[Kronecker symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined for ''b'' any integer, ''a'' an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or −1. An extension of the Jacobi and Legendre symbols to more general values of ''b''. 
* [[Power residue symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)_m&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ''a'' in some global field containing the ''m''th roots of 1 ( for some ''m''), ''b'' a fractional ideal of ''K'' built from prime ideals coprime to ''m''. The symbol takes values in the ''m'' roots of 1. When ''m'' = 2 and the global field is the rationals this is more or less the same as the Jacobi symbol. 
* [[Hilbert symbol]] The local Hilbert symbol (''a'',''b'') = is defined for ''a'' and ''b'' in some local field containing the ''m'' roots of 1 (for some ''m'') and takes values in the ''m'' roots of 1. The power residue symbol can be written in terms of the Hilbert symbol. The global Hilbert symbol  &lt;math&gt;(a,b)_p=\left(\frac{a,b}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{a,b}{p}\right)_m&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ''a'' and ''b'' in some global field ''K'', for ''p'' a finite or infinite place of ''K'', and is equal to the local Hilbert symbol in the completion of ''K'' at the place ''p''.
* [[Artin symbol]] The local Artin symbol or norm residue symbol &lt;math&gt;\theta_{L/K}(\alpha) = (\alpha,L/K) = \left(\frac{L/K}{\alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ''L'' a finite extension of the local field ''K'', α an element of ''K'', and takes values in the abelianization of the Galois group Gal(''L''/''K''). The global Artin symbol &lt;math&gt;\psi_{L/K}(\alpha) = (\alpha,L/K) = \left(\frac{L/K}{\alpha}\right)=((L/K)/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for α in a ray class group or idele (class) group of a global field ''K'', and takes values in the abelianization of Gal(''L''/''K'') for ''L'' an abelian extension of ''K''. When α is in the idele group the symbol is sometimes called a '''Chevalley symbol''' or '''Artin–Chevalley symbol'''. The local Hilbert symbol of ''K'' can be written in terms of the Artin symbol for [[Kummer extension]]s ''L''/''K'', where the roots of unity can be identified with elements of the Galois group. 
*The [[Frobenius symbol]] &lt;math&gt;[(L/K)/P]=\left[\frac{L/K}{P}\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the [[Frobenius element]] of the prime ''P'' of the Galois extension ''L'' of ''K''. 
* "Chevalley symbol" has several slightly different meanings. It is sometimes used for the Artin symbol for ideles. A variation of this is the Chevalley symbol  &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a,\chi}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for ''p'' a prime ideal of ''K'', ''a'' an element of ''K'', and χ a homomorphism of the Galois group of ''K'' to '''R'''/'''Z'''. The value of the symbol is then the value of the character χ on the usual Artin symbol.  
* [[Norm residue symbol]] This name is for several different closely related symbols, such as the Artin symbol or the Hilbert symbol or Hasse's norm residue symbol. The Hasse norm residue symbol &lt;math&gt;((\alpha,L/K)/p)=\left(\frac{\alpha,L/K}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is defined if ''p'' is a place of ''K'' and α an element of ''K''. It is essentially the same as the local Artin symbol for the localization of ''K'' at ''p''. The Hilbert symbol is a special case of it in the case of Kummer extensions.
* [[Steinberg symbol]] (''a'',''b''). This is a generalization of the local Hilbert symbol to arbitrary fields ''F''. The numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''F'', and the symbol (''a'',''b'') takes values in the second K-group of ''F''. 
* [[Galois symbol]] A sort of generalization of the Steinberg symbol to higher algebraic K-theory. It takes a Milnor K-group to an étale cohomology group.

'''System dynamics''' ('''SD''') is an approach to understanding the [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] behaviour of [[complex system]]s over time using [[Stock and flow|stocks, flows]], internal [[feedback loop]]s, table functions and time delays.&lt;ref&gt;Abidin N, Z., Mamat M, Dangerfield B, Zulkepli JH, Baten MA, et al.

==Overview==
System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the 1950s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes, SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

Convenient [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the 1990s and have been applied to diverse systems. SD models solve the problem of simultaneity (mutual causation) by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control. The best known SD model is probably the 1972 ''[[The Limits to Growth]]''. This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital, with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays, would lead to economic collapse during the 21st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios.

System dynamics is an aspect of [[systems theory]] as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system, the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components, is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are [[chaos theory]] and [[social dynamics]]. It is also claimed that because there are often properties-of-the-whole which cannot be found among the properties-of-the-elements, in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts.

==History==
System dynamics was created during the mid-1950s&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay (1971). Counterintuitive behavior of social systems. Technology Review 73(3): 52–68&lt;/ref&gt; by Professor [[Jay Forrester]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1956, Forrester accepted a professorship in the newly formed [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. His initial goal was to determine how his background in science and engineering could be brought to bear, in some useful way, on the core issues that determine the success or failure of corporations. Forrester's insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering, which led to the creation of system dynamics, were triggered, to a large degree, by his involvement with managers at [[General Electric]] (GE) during the mid-1950s. At that time, the managers at GE were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in Kentucky exhibited a significant three-year cycle. The [[business cycle]] was judged to be an insufficient explanation for the employment instability. From hand simulations (or calculations) of the stock-flow-feedback structure of the GE plants, which included the existing corporate decision-making structure for hiring and layoffs, Forrester was able to show how the instability in GE employment was due to the internal structure of the firm and not to an external force such as the business cycle. These hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics.&lt;ref name="UDE"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Origin of System Dynamics: Jay W. Forrester and the History of System Dynamics"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''. Retrieved 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal [[computer modeling]] stage. [[Richard Bennett (computer scientist)|Richard Bennett]] created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE (Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations) in the spring of 1958. In 1959, [[Phyllis Fox]] and [[Alexander Pugh]] wrote the first version of
[[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]] (DYNAmic MOdels), an improved version of SIMPLE, and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first, and still classic, book in the field titled ''Industrial Dynamics'' in 1961.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

From the late 1950s to the late 1960s, system dynamics was applied almost exclusively to corporate/managerial problems. In 1968, however, an unexpected occurrence caused the field to broaden beyond corporate modeling. [[John F. Collins]], the former mayor of Boston, was appointed a visiting professor of Urban Affairs at MIT. The result of the Collins-Forrester collaboration was a book titled ''Urban Dynamics''. The [[Urban Dynamics]] model presented in the book was the first major non-corporate application of system dynamics.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

The second major noncorporate application of system dynamics came shortly after the first. In 1970, Jay Forrester was invited by the [[Club of Rome]] to a meeting in Bern, Switzerland. The Club of Rome is an organization devoted to solving what its members describe as the "predicament of mankind"—that is, the global crisis that may appear sometime in the future, due to the demands being placed on the Earth's [[carrying capacity]] (its sources of renewable and nonrenewable resources and its sinks for the disposal of pollutants) by the world's exponentially growing population. At the Bern meeting, Forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind. His answer, of course, was that it could. On the plane back from the Bern meeting, Forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world's socioeconomic system. He called this model WORLD1. Upon his return to the United States, Forrester refined WORLD1 in preparation for a visit to MIT by members of the Club of Rome. Forrester called the refined version of the model WORLD2. Forrester published WORLD2 in a book titled [[World Dynamics]].&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

==Topics in systems dynamics==
The elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback, accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays.

As an illustration of the use of system dynamics, imagine an organisation that plans to introduce an innovative new durable consumer product.  The organisation needs to understand the possible [[market dynamics]] in order to design marketing and production plans.

===Causal loop diagrams===
{{Main article|Causal loop diagram}}
In the system dynamics methodology, a problem or a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) may be represented as a [[causal loop diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. (2000). Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World. New York: McGraw&lt;/ref&gt; A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system’s behavior over a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Donella. (2008). Thinking in Systems: A Primer. Earthscan&lt;/ref&gt;

The causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows:

[[Image:Adoption CLD.svg|centre|Causal loop diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

There are two feedback loops in this diagram.  The positive reinforcement (labeled R) loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product, the stronger the word-of-mouth impact.  There will be more references to the product, more demonstrations, and more reviews.  This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow.

The second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement (or "balancing" and hence labeled B).  Clearly, growth cannot continue forever, because as more and more people adopt, there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters.

Both feedback loops act simultaneously, but at different times they may have different strengths.  Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years, and then declining sales in the later years. However, in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G. P. (1986), Problems with causal-loop diagrams. Syst. Dyn. Rev., 2: 158–170. doi:10.1002/sdr.4260020207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock and flow diagrams===
{{Main article|Stock and flow}}
Causal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system’s structure and behavior, and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a causal loop diagram is transformed to a [[stock and flow]] diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way; such models are usually built and simulated using computer software.

A stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time.  A flow is the rate of change in a stock.

[[Image:Simple stock and flow diagram.gif|centre|frame|A flow is the rate of accumulation of the stock]]

In our example, there are two stocks: Potential adopters and Adopters.  There is one flow: New adopters.  For every new adopter, the stock of potential adopters declines by one, and the stock of adopters increases by one.

[[Image:Adoption SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

===Equations===
The real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation.  Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a [[spreadsheet]], there are a [[Comparison of system dynamics software|variety of software]] packages that have been optimised for this.

The steps involved in a simulation are:

*Define the problem boundary
*Identify the most important stocks and flows that change these stock levels
*Identify sources of information that impact the flows
*Identify the main feedback loops
*Draw a causal loop diagram that links the stocks, flows and sources of information
*Write the equations that determine the flows
*Estimate the parameters and initial conditions.  These can be estimated using statistical methods, expert opinion, market research data or other relevant sources of information.&lt;ref name="Sterman2001CMR"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sterman |first=John D. |year=2001 |month= |title=System dynamics modeling: Tools for learning in a complex world |journal=California management review |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=8–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simulate the model and analyse results.

In this example, the equations that change the two stocks via the flow are:

 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Potential adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{-New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't want to mark up this great contribution, but shouldn't this be something like potential adopters at t(0) - sum(new adopters at t(i))? Yes --&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

===Equations in discrete time===
List of all the equations in [[discrete time]], in their order of execution in each year, for years 1 to 15 :

 &lt;math&gt;1) \ \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}=\mbox{Potential adopters} / (\mbox{Potential adopters } + \mbox{ Adopters}) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;2) \ \mbox{Imitators}=q \cdot \mbox{Adopters} \cdot \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;3) \ \mbox{Innovators}=p \cdot \mbox{Potential adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4) \ \mbox{New adopters}=\mbox{Innovators}+\mbox{Imitators} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\ p=0.03 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ q=0.4 &lt;/math&gt;

====Dynamic simulation results====
The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in ''adopters'' that follows a classic s-curve shape.&lt;br /&gt;
The increase in ''adopters'' is very slow initially, then exponential growth for a period, followed ultimately by saturation.

===Equations in continuous time===
To get intermediate values and better accuracy, the model can run in continuous time: we multiply the number of units of time and we proportionally divide values that change stock levels. In this example we multiply the 15 years by 4 to obtain 60 trimesters, and we divide the value of the flow by 4.&lt;br&gt;
Dividing the value is the simplest with the [[Euler method]], but other methods could be employed instead, such as [[Runge–Kutta methods]].

List of the equations in continuous time for trimesters = 1 to 60 :
*They are the same equations as in the section ''Equation in discrete time'' above, except equations ''4.1'' and ''4.2'' replaced by following :
 &lt;math&gt;10) \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters} \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{Valve New adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{Valve New adopters } &lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; \ TimeStep = 1/4 &lt;/math&gt;

*In the below stock and flow diagram, the intermediate flow 'Valve New adopters' calculates the equation :
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters } \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;

==Application==
System dynamics has found application in a wide range of areas, for example [[Population dynamics|population]], agriculture&lt;ref&gt;F. H. A. Rahim, N. N. Hawari and N. Z. Abidin, “Supply and demand of rice in Malaysia: A system dynamics approach”, International Journal of Supply Chain and Management, Vol.6, No.4, pp. 234-240, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ecosystem model|ecological]] and [[Economics|economic]] systems, which usually interact strongly with each other.

System dynamics have various "back of the envelope" management applications. They are a potent tool to:
*Teach [[system thinking]] reflexes to persons being coached
*Analyze and compare assumptions and [[mental model]]s about the way things work
*Gain qualitative insight into the workings of a system or the consequences of a decision
*Recognize archetypes of dysfunctional systems in everyday practice

Computer software is used to [[computer simulation|simulate]] a system dynamics [[model (abstract)|model]] of the situation being studied. Running "what if" simulations to test certain policies on such a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time.  System dynamics is very similar to [[systems thinking]] and constructs the same [[causal loop diagram]]s of systems with feedback.  However, system dynamics typically goes further and utilises simulation to study the behaviour of systems and the impact of alternative policies.&lt;ref name="SysDynSociety"&gt;[http://www.systemdynamics.org/ System Dynamics Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

System dynamics has been used to investigate resource dependencies, and resulting problems, in product development.&lt;ref name="Repenning:2001kx"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Repenning |first=Nelson P. |year=2001 |month= |title= Understanding fire fighting in new product development |journal= The Journal of Product Innovation Management |volume= 18 |issue=5|pages= 285–300|doi= 10.1016/S0737-6782(01)00099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Repenning:1999ng"&gt;Nelson P. Repenning (1999). ''Resource dependence in product development improvement efforts'', [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] Department of Operations Management/System Dynamics Group, Dec 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A system dynamics approach to  [[macroeconomics]], known as ''[[Minsky (economic simulator)|Minsky]]'',  has been developed by the economist [[Steve Keen]].&lt;ref name="SForge"&gt;&amp;nbsp;[http://sourceforge.net/blog/january-2014-potm/&amp;nbsp;SourceForge]&amp;nbsp;Minsky&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Project of the month January 2014. Interview with Minsky development team. Accessed January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used to successfully model world economic behaviour from the apparent stability of the [[Great Moderation]] to the sudden unexpected [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]].

===Example===
[[Image:Causal Loop Diagram of a Model.png|thumb|600px|center|Causal loop diagram of a model examining the growth or decline of a life insurance company.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"/&gt;]]

The figure above is a causal loop diagram of a system dynamics model created to examine forces that may be responsible for the growth or decline of [[life insurance]] companies in the [[United Kingdom]]. A number of this figure's features are worth mentioning. The first is that the model's negative feedback loops are identified by ''C's'', which stand for ''Counteracting'' loops. The second is that double slashes are used to indicate places where there is a significant delay between causes (i.e., variables at the tails of arrows) and effects (i.e., variables at the heads of arrows). This is a common causal loop diagramming convention in system dynamics. Third, is that thicker lines are used to identify the feedback loops and links that author wishes the audience to focus on. This is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention. Last, it is clear that a decision maker would find it impossible to think through the dynamic behavior inherent in the model, from inspection of the figure alone.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Feedback"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''.

=== Example of piston motion ===
# Objective: study of a crank-connecting rod system.&lt;br /&gt; We want to model a crank-connecting rod system through a system dynamic model. Two different full descriptions of the physical system with related systems of equations can be found  [[Piston motion equations#Position|here]] {{en icon}} and [[:fr:Système bielle-manivelle#Équations horaires|here]] {{fr icon}}; they give the same results. In this example, the crank, with variable radius and angular frequency, will drive a piston with a variable connecting rod length.
# System dynamic modeling: the system is now modeled, according to a stock and flow system dynamic logic.&lt;br /&gt; The figure below shows the stock and flow diagram [[Image:TRUE Piston SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram for crank-connecting rod system|frame]]
# Simulation: the behavior of the crank-connecting rod dynamic system can then be simulated.&lt;br /&gt; The next figure is a 3D simulation created using [[procedural animation]]. Variables of the model animate all parts of this animation: crank, radius, angular frequency, rod length, and piston position.

In [[mathematics]], '''trigonometric substitution''' is the substitution of trigonometric functions for other expressions.  One may use the [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] to simplify certain [[integral]]s containing [[radical expression]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Thomas | first1 = George B. | last2=Weir | first2= Maurice D. | last3=Hass | first3=Joel | author3-link = Joel Hass | authorlink=George B. Thomas | title=Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | year=2010 | edition=12th | isbn=0-321-58876-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Substitution 1.''' If the integrand contains ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let
: &lt;math&gt;x = a \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
and use the [[list of trigonometric identities|identity]]
: &lt;math&gt;1-\sin^2 \theta = \cos^2 \theta.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Substitution 2.''' If the integrand contains ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let
: &lt;math&gt;x = a \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;
and use the identity

&lt;math&gt;1+\tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Substitution 3.''' If the integrand contains ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let
:&lt;math&gt;x = a \sec \theta&lt;/math&gt;
and use the identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sec^2 \theta -1 = \tan^2 \theta.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples==
=== Integrals containing ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ===

In the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

we may use

:&lt;math&gt;x=a\sin \theta,\quad dx=a\cos\theta\, d\theta, \quad \theta=\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &amp;= \int\frac{a\cos\theta \,d\theta}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2 \theta}} \\
   &amp;= \int\frac{a\cos\theta\,d\theta}{\sqrt{a^2(1 - \sin^2 \theta )}} \\
   &amp;= \int\frac{a\cos\theta\,d\theta}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\theta}} \\
   &amp;= \int d\theta \\
   &amp;= \theta + C \\
   &amp;= \arcsin \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)+C.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above step requires that {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}} and {{math|cos(''θ'') &gt; 0}}; we can choose {{mvar|a}} to be the positive square root of {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and we impose the restriction {{math|−''π''/2 &lt; ''θ'' &lt; ''π''/2}} on {{mvar|θ}} by using the [[arcsin]] function.

For a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change.  For example, as {{mvar|x}} goes from 0 to {{math|''a''/2}}, then {{math|sin ''θ''}} goes from 0 to 1/2, so {{mvar|θ}} goes from 0 to {{math|''π''/6}}.  Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{a/2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}=\int_0^{\pi/6} d\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

Some care is needed when picking the bounds. The integration above requires that {{math|−''π''/2 &lt; ''θ'' &lt; ''π''/2}}, so {{mvar|θ}} going from 0 to π/6 is the only choice. Neglecting this restriction, one might have picked {{mvar|θ}} to go from {{mvar|π}} to {{math|5''π''/6}}, which would have resulted in the negative of the actual value.

===Integrals containing ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===
In the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{a^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

we may write

:&lt;math&gt;x=a\tan\theta,\quad dx=a\sec^2\theta\, d\theta, \quad \theta=\arctan\frac{x}{a},&lt;/math&gt;

so that the integral becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int\frac{dx}{a^2+x^2} &amp;= \int\frac{a\sec^2\theta\, d\theta}{a^2 + a^2\tan^2\theta} \\
   &amp;= \int\frac{a\sec^2\theta\, d\theta}{a^2(1+\tan^2\theta)} \\
   &amp;= \int\frac{a\sec^2\theta\, d\theta}{a^2\sec^2\theta} \\
   &amp;= \int\frac{d\theta}{a} \\
   &amp;= \frac{\theta}{a}+C \\
   &amp;= \frac{1}{a} \arctan \frac{x}{a} + C,
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

provided {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}.

===Integrals containing ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===
Integrals like

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{x^2 - a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

can also be evaluated by [[partial fractions in integration|partial fractions]] rather than trigonometric substitutions. However, the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

cannot.  In this case, an appropriate substitution is:

:&lt;math&gt;x = a \sec\theta,\quad dx = a \sec\theta\tan\theta\, d\theta, \quad \theta = \arcsec\frac{x}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\, dx &amp;= \int\sqrt{a^2 \sec^2\theta - a^2} \cdot a \sec\theta\tan\theta\, d\theta \\
   &amp;= \int\sqrt{a^2 (\sec^2\theta - 1)} \cdot a \sec\theta\tan\theta\, d\theta \\
   &amp;= \int\sqrt{a^2 \tan^2\theta} \cdot a \sec\theta\tan\theta\, d\theta \\
   &amp;= \int a^2 \sec\theta\tan^2\theta\, d\theta \\
   &amp;= a^2 \int (\sec\theta)(\sec^2\theta - 1)\, d\theta \\
   &amp;= a^2 \int (\sec^3\theta - \sec\theta)\, d\theta.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can then solve this using the formula for the [[integral of secant cubed]].

==Substitutions that eliminate trigonometric functions==
Substitution can be used to remove trigonometric functions.  In particular, see [[Tangent half-angle substitution]].

For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int f(\sin(x), \cos(x))\, dx &amp;=\int\frac1{\pm\sqrt{1-u^2}} f\left(u,\pm\sqrt{1-u^2}\right)\, du &amp;&amp;  u=\sin (x) \\
\int f(\sin(x), \cos(x))\, dx &amp;=\int\frac{1}{\mp\sqrt{1-u^2}} f\left(\pm\sqrt{1-u^2},u\right)\, du &amp;&amp; u=\cos (x) \\
\int f(\sin(x), \cos(x))\, dx &amp;=\int\frac2{1+u^2} f \left(\frac{2u}{1+u^2},\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}\right)\, du &amp;&amp;  u=\tan\left (\tfrac{x}{2} \right ) \\
\int\frac{\cos x}{(1+\cos x)^3}\, dx &amp;= \int\frac2{1+u^2}\frac{\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}}{\left(1+\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}\right)^3}\, du = \int (1-u^2)(1+u^2)\, du
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Hyperbolic substitution==
Substitutions of [[hyperbolic function]]s can also be used to simplify integrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyadzhiev|first=Khristo N.|title=Hyperbolic Substitutions for Integrals|url=http://www2.onu.edu/~m-caragiu.1/bonus_files/HYPERSUB.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the integral &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;, make the substitution &lt;math&gt;x=a\sinh{u}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dx=a\cosh u\, du.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, using the identities &lt;math&gt;\cosh^2 (x) - \sinh^2 (x) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sinh^{-1}{x} = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}\, dx &amp;= \int \frac{a\cosh u}{\sqrt{a^2+a^2\sinh^2 u}}\, du\\
&amp;=\int \frac{a\cosh{u}}{a\sqrt{1+\sinh^2{u}}}\, du\\
&amp;=\int \frac{a\cosh{u}}{a\cosh u}\, du\\
&amp;=u+C\\
&amp;=\sinh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}}+C\\
&amp;=\ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{a^2} + 1} + \frac{x}{a}\right) + C\\
&amp;=\ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^2+a^2} + x}{a}\right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
