== Introduction ==
Advocacy planning was formulated in the 1960s by [[Paul Davidoff]]. It is a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] and inclusive planning theory where planners seek to represent the interests of various groups within society. Davidoff (1965) was an activist lawyer and planner who believed that advocacy planning was a necessary method for representing the low-income and minority groups who were not always on equal footing with the rich and powerful.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=Paul|date=1965|title=Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning|url=|journal=The City Reader|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and Context ==
Before the 1960s, planning was usually performed by trained professionals within local governments who worked directly under the guidance of planning commissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method of planning is commonly referred to as top down and was a result of the planning practices that developed throughout history. Top down is characterised by its authoritative and [[undemocratic]] methods, where institutions and individuals plan without first consulting the various stakeholders who are involved with the use and development of the land. An example of this approach is [[colonialism]] in Africa during the early nineteenth century, where settlements were created simply for the purpose of exploiting workers and extracting the wealth produced by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The African City: A History|last=Freund|first=Bill|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This attitude to planning continued beyond colonialism and spread throughout the [[modernist]] movement in the 1920s. During this time, designers and planners were given opportunities to conceive a vision for utopian cities. These designs were a response to the rise of industrialisation in cities, which led to the working class living in dirty and often overcrowded slums. Although the vision and intention of these [[utopian]] cities was to create a society that sought to protect and preserve humanity through the built environment, this top down method of planning assumes that the values and beliefs held by the planner are the same as those that they are planning for. Many of these projects failed to achieve expectations and were instead discarded or set aside.

Directly following modernism and continuing this trend of a top down approach was the post world war period of reconstruction and planning. With the war over, there was a need for social and economic reconstruction. Governments were given the task to rebuild cities that had been afflicted by the damage left behind from the war. With the rise of the [[technocratic]] experts, they were consulted to design and plan the city in a scientific, logical and rigorous manner which would produce the best outcome for all stakeholders. This disconnected and elitist approach led to the constant failure of the government to meet the needs of its citizens and was met with backlash, giving rise to alternative planning practices.

== Advocacy Planning ==
Davidoff understood that not all stakeholders are equally represented and involved in the planning process. Leaving the groups of lower socioeconomic status vulnerable to the interests of larger public institutions or private companies. Without sufficient protection and care, the concerns and opinions of these individuals were left unheard and unaccounted for when developing plans. Davidoff realised that it was necessary to implement a “humanistic, grassroots and pluralistic”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; system where planners would advocate for the interests of the oppressed and powerless.

In practice advocacy planners use their experience and knowledge within the field of planning to represent the ideas and needs of their clients. These clients are often groups of lower socioeconomic standing who are unable to access the resources, tools or skills to represent themselves. Advocate planners work with these disadvantaged groups to develop plans which incorporate and preserve their social and economic needs.

The plans are then produced in front of a planning commission where they consider the various pros and cons of each plan produced by other advocate planners. This is what Davidoff claimed would lead to a rigorous and systematic legal methodology of “fair notice and hearings, production of supporting evidence, cross-examination and reasoned decision”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Allowing the planning commission to arrive at “a just decision”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Davidoff believed that upholding the political ideology of democracy through the planning process led to three major improvements within his discipline.

First is the raising of the public’s awareness. By employing a method of participatory planning and engaging with the wider community, this helps the public to realise that planning is not simply a process engaged by well educated men of science, rather that the best planners are the people themselves. It is the realisation that the public has the freedom and choice to develop plans according to their needs.

Secondly, this ideal structure for advocacy planning allows planners to compete among themselves while representing the views of their clients. Healthy amounts of competition should in fact raise the standard and quality of planning practices and outcomes. Davidoff acknowledges that “conflict keeps people honest”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, rather than critiquing the planners and institutions that support them, those that are critical are given the opportunity to instead provide input and feedback on the plans with which they disagree. Creating an environment that encourages positive attitudes towards constructive participation.

However, simply providing a platform for expression is not always sufficient, as participatory and democratic planning requires a certain level of critical consciousness from the individual participating. Otherwise the participant may struggle to identify problems without being aware of the larger social and economic forces that influences their choices. The role of the advocate then, must be not only to provide assistance in developing an appropriate plan for the committee to judge, but must also be to encourage the people to be “free, informed, participating to the fullest degree, working together cooperatively, possessed of an understanding of their problems and those of their fellow men”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reveille for Radicals|last=Alinsky|first=Saul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ambilineality''' is a [[Cognatic kinship|cognatic descent system]] in which individuals may be affiliated either to their father's or mother's group. This type of descent results in descent groups which are non-unilineal in the sense that descent passes either through women or men, contrary to [[unilineal]] systems, whether [[patrilineal]] or [[matrilineal]]. Affiliation to a descent group will be determined either by choice or by residence. In the latter case, children will belong to the descent group with whom their parents are living.

Societies practicing ambilineal descent are especially common in [[Southeast Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, 2014, p.88-98&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pacific]]. [[Polynesian culture]]s and [[Micronesia|Micronesian cultures]] are often ambilineal, including, for example, [[Samoans]], [[Māori people|Māori]]&lt;ref&gt;Firth,1929, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] and people of the [[Gilbert Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[indigenous peoples]] of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Northwest Coast|Northwestern North America]] are also followers of ambilineality; and it also found among the Southern  [[Yoruba people]]&lt;ref&gt;Llyod, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; residing in [[West Africa]].

NASA planned to use Ares I to launch ''[[Orion (spacecraft)#Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)|Orion]]'', the [[spacecraft]] intended for NASA [[human spaceflight]] missions after the [[Space Shuttle]] was retired in 2011. Ares I was to complement the larger, unmanned [[Ares V]], which was the cargo launch vehicle for Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref name="SafetyDesign"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresl/index.html |title=NASA – Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle |accessdate=May 13, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=April 29, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504015905/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresl/index.html |archivedate= May 4, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Constellation program, including Ares I was cancelled by U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] in October 2010 with the passage of his 2010 NASA authorization bill. In September 2011, NASA detailed the [[Space Launch System]] as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html NASA Announces Design for New Deep Space Exploration System]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

=== Advanced Transportation System Studies ===
In 1995 Lockheed Martin produced an Advanced Transportation System Studies (ATSS) report for the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]. A section of the ATSS report describes several possible vehicles much like the Ares I design, with liquid rocket second stages stacked above segmented [[solid rocket booster]] (SRB) first stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19960028972_1996058483.pdf |title=Technical Area 2 Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle Development Final Report |pages=3–17, 3–18 |publisher=[[NASA]] |work=[[Lockheed Martin]] |date=July 1995 |format=PDF| accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variants that were considered included both the [[J-2 (rocket engine)#J-2S|J-2S]] engines and [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs) for the second stage. The variants also assumed use of the [[Advanced Solid Rocket Motor]] (ASRM) as a first stage, but the ASRM was cancelled in 1993 due to significant cost overruns.

=== Exploration Systems Architecture Study ===

President [[George W. Bush]] had announced the [[Vision for Space Exploration]] in January 2004, and NASA under [[Sean O'Keefe]] had solicited plans for a [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] from multiple bidders, with the plan for having two competing teams. These plans were discarded by incoming administrator [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]], and on April 29, 2005, NASA chartered the [[Exploration Systems Architecture Study]] to accomplish specific goals:&lt;ref name="ESAS report"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/news/ESAS_report.html |title=Exploration Systems Architecture Study – Final Report |first=Erin |last=Mahoney |date=December 31, 2008| publisher=[[NASA]]| accessdate=August 5, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831023206/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/news/ESAS_report.html| archivedate= August 31, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ares I Evolution.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Concept image of the evolution of the Ares I design from pre-[[Exploration Systems Architecture Study|ESAS]] to latest developments.]]
A Shuttle-derived launch architecture was selected by NASA for the Ares I. Originally, the crewed vehicle would have used a four-segment solid rocket booster (SRB) for the first stage, and a simplified Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) for the second stage. An unmanned version was to use a five-segment booster with the same second stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1040 |title=NASA Plans to Build Two New Shuttle-derived Launch Vehicles |publisher=[[Spaceref.com]] |date=July 5, 2005 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the initial design was approved, additional tests revealed that the Orion spacecraft would be too heavy for the four-segment booster to lift,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.NASAspaceflight.com/content/?cid=4659 |title=NASA makes major design changes to CEV |publisher=[[NASAspaceflight.com]] |date=July 22, 2006 |first=Chris |last=Bergin |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405215413/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=4659 |archivedate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2006 NASA announced they would slightly reduce the size of the Orion spacecraft, add a fifth segment to the solid-rocket first stage, and replace the single SSME with the Apollo-derived [[J-2 (rocket engine)#J-2X|J-2X]] motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_08116_power_pack_tests.html |title=NASA Successfully Completes First Series of Ares Engine Tests |first=Brian |last=Dunbar |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the change from a four-segment first stage to a five-segment version would allow NASA to construct virtually identical motors, the main reason for the change to the five-segment booster was the move to the J-2X.&lt;ref name="J2X"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/187393main_j2x_fs_nov08.pdf |format=PDF |title=The J–2X Engine |publisher=[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploration Systems Architecture Study concluded that the cost and safety of the Ares was superior to that of either of the [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELVs).&lt;ref name="ESAS report"/&gt; The cost estimates in the study were based on the assumption that new launch pads would be needed for [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] EELVs.&lt;ref name="ESAS report"/&gt; The facilities for the current EELVs (LC-37 for Delta IV, LC-41 for Atlas V) are in place and could be modified, but this may not have been the most cost effective solution as LC-37 is a contractor owned and operated (COGO) facility and modifications for the Delta IV H were determined to be similar to those required for Ares I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/377875main_081109%20Human%20Rated%20Delta%20IV.pdf|title=Human-Rated Delta IV Heavy Study – Constellation Architecture Impacts|publisher=Aerospace Corporation|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESAS launch safety estimates for the Ares were based on the Space Shuttle, despite the differences, and included only launches after the post-Challenger Space Shuttle redesign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Report to the President: Actions to Implement the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher=NASA| date = July 14, 1986| url = https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/actions.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate counted each Shuttle launch as two safe launches of the Ares booster.

===Role in Constellation program===
[[File:SDLV rockets.jpg|thumb|right|An early concept image of the Ares I (right) and [[Ares V]] (left) rockets]]

Ares I was the crew launch component of the Constellation program. Originally named the "Crew Launch Vehicle" or CLV, the Ares name was chosen from the Greek deity [[Ares]].&lt;ref name="New"/&gt; Unlike the Space Shuttle, where both crew and cargo were launched simultaneously on the same rocket, the plans for Project Constellation outlined having two separate launch vehicles, the Ares I and the Ares V, for crew and cargo, respectively. Having two separate launch vehicles allows for more specialized designs for the crew and heavy cargo launch rockets.&lt;ref name="Constellation overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf |title=Constellation Program Overview |format=PDF |last=Connolly |first=John F. |date=October 2006 |publisher=Constellation Program Office |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ares I rocket was specifically being designed to launch the [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]]. Orion was intended as a crew capsule, similar in design to the [[Apollo program]] capsule, to transport astronauts to the [[International Space Station]], the [[Moon]], and eventually [[Mars]]. Ares I might have also delivered some (limited) resources to [[orbit]], including supplies for the International Space Station or subsequent delivery to the planned [[Lunar outpost (NASA)|lunar base]].&lt;ref name="SafetyDesign"/&gt;

=== Contractor selection ===
NASA selected Alliant Techsystems, the builder of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s, as the prime contractor for the Ares I first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bergin |first=Chris |url=http://www.NASAspaceflight.com/2005/12/atk-win-clv-contract/ |title=ATK win CLV contract |publisher=[[NASAspaceflight.com]] |date=December 7, 2005 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ares1stStage"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/230922main_1stStage_FS.pdf |format=PDF |title=NASA’s Ares I First Stage, Powering the Ares I Rocket for liftoff |publisher=[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] |date=April 29, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA announced that [[Rocketdyne]] would be the main subcontractor for the [[J-2 (rocket engine)#J-2X|J-2X]] rocket engine on July 16, 2007.&lt;ref name ="Rocketdyne"&gt;{{cite press |title = NASA Awards Upper Stage Engine Contract for Ares Rockets |publisher =[[NASA]] |date = July 16, 2007 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_C07030_J2X_Contract_prt.htm |accessdate=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA selected [[Boeing]] to provide and install the [[avionics]] for the Ares I rocket on December 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/dec/HQ_C07060_Ares_1_Avionics.html |title=NASA Selects Prime Contractor For Ares I Rocket Avionics |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2007 NASA awarded the Ares I Upper Stage manufacturing contract to Boeing. Boeing built the S-IC stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket at [[Michoud Assembly Facility|Michoud Aerospace Factory]] in the 1960s. The upper stage of Ares I was to have been built at the same rocket factory used for the Space Shuttle's External Tank and the Saturn V's [[S-IC]] first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Harry |last=Wadsworth |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/ssc/michoud/about/History.html |title=History – History of Michoud |publisher=[[Lockheed Martin]] |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804011158/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/ssc/michoud/about/History.html |archivedate=August 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://boeing.com/history/boeing/saturn.html |title=Boeing History – Saturn V Moon Rocket |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=July 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719093659/http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/saturn.html |archivedate=July 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J-2X engines ===
{{Main|J-2X}}

At approximately US$20–25 million per engine, the Rocketdyne-designed and produced J-2X would have cost less than half as much as the more complex [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (around $55 million).&lt;ref name="DeltaIVcheaper"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/Study061509.xml&amp;headline=Study%20Finds%20Human-rated%20Delta%20IV%20Cheaper&amp;channel=space| title=NASA Study Finds Human-rated Delta IV Cheaper| publisher=[[Aviation Week]]| date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Space Shuttle Main Engine, which was designed to start on the ground, the J-2X was designed from inception to be started in both mid-air and in near-vacuum. This air-start capability was critical, especially in the original J-2 engine used on the Saturn V's [[S-IVB]] stage, to propel the [[Apollo spacecraft]] to the Moon. The Space Shuttle Main Engine, on the other hand, would have required extensive modifications to add an air-start capability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacepolicy/2005Architecture-01-ExecutiveSummary.pdf|title=2005 ESAS Architecture Executive Summary|last=|first=|date=January 2004|website=NSS.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423135006/http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacepolicy/2005Architecture-01-ExecutiveSummary.pdf |archivedate=April 23, 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J2X"/&gt;

=== System requirements review ===
[[File:Aiaa2.jpg|thumb|right|A concept image of an Ares I launching from [[Kennedy Space Center]] launchpad 39B.]]

On January 4, 2007, NASA announced that the Ares I had completed its system requirements review, the first such review completed for any manned spacecraft design since the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{Cite press release| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/07-002.html |title=NASA Completes Review Milestone for Ares I Vehicle |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review was the first major milestone in the design process, and was intended to ensure that the Ares I launch system met all the requirements necessary for the Constellation Program. In addition to the release of the review, NASA also announced that a redesign in the tank hardware was made. Instead of separate LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks, separated by an "intertank" like that of the [[Space Shuttle External Tank]], the new LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LOX tanks would have been separated by a common bulkhead like that employed on the Saturn V [[S-II]] and S-IVB stages. This would have provided a significant mass saving and eliminated the need to design a second stage interstage unit that would have had to carry the weight of the Orion spacecraft with it.&lt;ref name="Ares1stStage"/&gt;

=== Analysis and testing ===

In January 2008, [[NASA Watch]] revealed that the first stage [[solid-fuel rocket|solid rocket]] of the ''Ares I'' could have created high vibrations during the first few minutes of ascent. The vibrations would have been caused by thrust oscillations inside the first stage.&lt;ref name="Houston Chronicle"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Carreau |first=Mark |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5467711.html |title=Severe vibration problem plagues moon rocket design |work=Houston Chronicle |date=January 19, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}} – note: article does not seem to still be available online (February 19, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; NASA officials had identified the potential problem at the Ares I system design review in late October 2007, stating in a press release that it wanted to solve it by March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Keith |last=Cowing |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1266 |title=NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate Responds to Ares 1 and Orion Questions |publisher=[[NASA Watch]] |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA admitted that this problem was very severe, rating it four out of five on a risk scale, but the agency was very confident in solving it.&lt;ref name="Houston Chronicle"/&gt; The mitigation approach developed by the Ares engineering team included active and passive vibration damping, adding an active tuned-mass absorber and a passive "compliance structure" – essentially a spring-loaded ring that would have detuned the Ares I stack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/thrust_oscillation.html Thrust Oscillation Mitigation Approach]. NASA&lt;/ref&gt; NASA also pointed out that, since this would have been a new launch system, like the [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]] or Space Shuttle systems, it was normal for such problems to arise during the development stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Seth |last=Borenstein |url=http://www.space.com/news/080118-nasa-new-rocket-shake.html |title=NASA's Next Rocket May Shake Too Much |publisher=[[Space.com]] |agency=''[[Associated Press]]'' |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NASA, analysis of the data and telemetry from the Ares I-X flight showed that vibrations from thrust oscillation were within the normal range for a Space Shuttle flight.&lt;ref name="splashdown"&gt;[http://www.space.com/common/media/video/player.php?videoRef=SP_091110_ares-launch Video of Ares I-X First Stage splashdown] from NASA via Space.com, November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A study released in July 2009 by the [[45th Space Wing]] of the US Air Force concluded that an abort 30–60 seconds after launch would have a ~100% chance of killing all crew, due to the capsule being engulfed until ground impact by a cloud of {{Convert|4000|F|C}} solid propellant fragments, which would melt the capsule's nylon parachute material. NASA's study showed the crew capsule would have flown beyond the more severe danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=31792 |title=USAF 45th Space Wing Study: Capsule~100%-Fratricide Environments (Implications for NASA's Ares-1 and Crew) |publisher=45th Space Wing |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/orl-new-blow-to-nasa-ares-071809,0,3051613.story |title=Report: No escape system could save astronauts if Ares I rocket exploded during first minute |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |first=Mark K. |last=Matthew |date=July 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2009 |quote=Subtitle: Report saying crew would be doomed is yet another blow to NASA's troubled Constellation program to return U.S. to the moon then Mars |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720215310/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/orl-new-blow-to-nasa-ares-071809,0,3051613.story |archivedate=July 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ares I igniter was an advanced version of the flight-proven igniter used on the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters. It was approximately 18&amp;nbsp;inches (46&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and 36&amp;nbsp;inches (91&amp;nbsp;cm) long, and took advantage of upgraded insulation materials that had improved thermal properties to protect the igniter's case from the burning solid propellant.&lt;ref name="Igniter"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/igniter_test.html |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |title=NASA Ares Iginiter Tests |first=Brooke |last=Boen |date=March 12, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA successfully completed test firing of the igniter for the Ares I engines on March 10, 2009 at [[Alliant Techsystems|ATK Launch Systems]] test facilities near [[Promontory, Utah]]. The igniter test generated a flame 200 feet (60 meters) in length, and preliminary data showed the igniter performed as planned.&lt;ref name="Igniter" /&gt;

Development of the Ares I propulsion elements continued to make strong progress.

Originally scheduled for first test flights in 2011, the independent analysis by the [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|Augustine Commission]] found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an unconstrained budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/GAP072809.xml&amp;headline=U.S.%20Spaceflight%20Gap%20Wider%20Than%20Thought |title=US Spaceflight Gap Wider Than Thought |publisher=[[Aviation Week]] |date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated recurring cost of almost $1 billion per flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee – Final Report |url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf |year = 2009 |accessdate =December 12, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091122095823/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf| archivedate= November 22, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later financial analysis in March 2010 showed that the Ares I would have cost $1 billion or more to operate per flight had the Ares I flown just once a year.

=== First stage ===
The first stage was to have been a more powerful and reusable [[solid fuel rocket]] derived from the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]] (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust.&lt;ref name="SafetyDesign" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1177 |title=NASA To Evaluate Non-recoverable First Stage for Ares I Launch Vehicle |publisher=[[Spaceref.com]] |date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the [[Space Shuttle External Tank]] (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter was to have been equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent.&lt;ref name="SafetyDesign" /&gt; The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.&lt;ref&gt;ATK Inc. [http://www.atk.com/Products/documents/Ares%20I%20First%20Stage.pdf], "Ares I First Stage Ground Test", ATK Investor Relations and Public Affairs, September 9, 2009, p. 2. {{dead link|date=April 2017 |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upper stage ===
The upper stage, derived from the Shuttle's External Tank (ET) and based on the [[S-IVB]] stage of the Saturn V, was to be propelled by a single [[J-2X]] rocket engine fueled by [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/187391main_aresI_fs_nov08.pdf |format=PDF |title=Constellation Program: America’s Fleet of Next-Generation Launch Vehicles, The Ares l Crew Launch Vehicle |date=November 2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The J-2X was derived from the original [[J-2 engine]] used during the Apollo program, but with more thrust (~294,000&amp;nbsp;lbf) and fewer parts than the original engine. On July 16, 2007, NASA awarded [[Rocketdyne]] a sole-source contract for the J-2X engines to be used for ground and flight tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NASA Awards Upper Stage Engine Contract for Ares Rockets |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 16, 2007 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_C07030_J2X_Contract_prt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocketdyne was the prime contractor for the original J-2 engines used in the Apollo program.

Although its J-2X engine was derived from an established design, the upper stage itself would have been wholly new. Originally to have been based on both the internal and external structure of the ET, the original design called for separate fuel and oxidizer tanks, joined together by an "intertank" structure, and covered with the spray-on foam insulation to keep venting to a minimum. The only new hardware on the original ET-derived second stage would have been the thrust assembly for the J-2X engine, new fill/drain/vent disconnects for the fuel and oxidizer, and mounting interfaces for the solid-fueled first stage and the Orion spacecraft.

Using a concept going back to the Apollo program, the "intertank" structure was dropped to decrease mass, and in its place, a common bulkhead, similar to that used on both the [[S-II]] and S-IVB stages of the Saturn V, would have been used between the tanks. The savings from these changes were used to increase propellant capacity, which was {{Convert|297900|lb|kg|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.NASAspaceflight.com/2007/02/ares-i-upper-stage-change-receives-additional-capacity/ |title=Ares I Upper Stage change – receives additional capacity |publisher=[[NASAspaceflight.com]] |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spray-on foam insulation was the only part of the Shuttle's ET that would have been used on this new Saturn-derived upper stage.

'''Atílio Munari''' (1901 – 19 October 1941) was born in [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]].

==Biography==
He lived near the [[Sanga da Alemoa]], and when he was 14 years old, he lived with the scientist '''H. Lotz''', a [[Germans|German]] [[paleontologist]], who taught him to collecting and preparing fossils. Many of the fossils collected by him, are now in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]]. Helped a lot of paleontologists who visited the city of [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]]. Has contributed considerably to the [[Geopark]] of Paleorrota.

In his honor, the city of [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]], received the '''Atilio Munari''' street. He was buried in ''São José Cemetery'', near where he was collecting fossils.

{{Inline|date=April 2018}}

A '''Bellman equation''', named after [[Richard E. Bellman]], is a [[necessary condition]] for optimality associated with the mathematical [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] method known as [[dynamic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Avinash K. |last=Dixit |title=Optimization in Economic Theory |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=Second |year=1990 |isbn=0-19-877211-4 |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHrsHz0VocUC&amp;pg=PA164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It writes the value of a decision problem at a certain point in time in terms of the payoff from some initial choices and the value of the remaining decision problem that results from those initial choices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} This breaks a dynamic optimization problem into a [[sequence]] of simpler subproblems, as [[Bellman equation#Bellman's Principle of Optimality|Bellman's “principle of optimality”]] prescribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Kirk |title=Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1970 |isbn=0-13-638098-0 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCh2SAtWIdwC&amp;pg=PA55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering [[control theory]] and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in [[economic theory]]; though the basic concepts of dynamic programming are prefigured in [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]'s ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' and [[Abraham Wald]]'s ''[[sequential analysis]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Almost any problem that can be solved using [[optimal control theory]] can also be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation.{{Why|date=September 2017}}{{Explain|date=September 2017}} However, the term 'Bellman equation' usually refers to the dynamic programming equation associated with [[discrete-time]] optimization problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Kirk |title=Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1970 |isbn=0-13-638098-0 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCh2SAtWIdwC&amp;pg=PA70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In continuous-time optimization problems, the analogous equation is a [[partial differential equation]] that is usually called the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morton I. |last=Kamien |authorlink=Morton Kamien |first2=Nancy L. |last2=Schwartz |title=Dynamic Optimization: The Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control in Economics and Management |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |edition=Second |year=1991 |isbn=0-444-01609-0 |page=261 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald E. |last=Kirk |title=Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1970 |isbn=0-13-638098-0 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCh2SAtWIdwC&amp;pg=PA88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytical concepts in dynamic programming ==
To understand the Bellman equation, several underlying concepts must be understood. First, any optimization problem has some objective: minimizing travel time, minimizing cost, maximizing profits, maximizing utility, etc. The mathematical function that describes this objective is called the ''[[Optimization (mathematics)#Optimization problems|objective function]]''.

Dynamic programming breaks a multi-period planning problem into simpler steps at different points in time. Therefore, it requires keeping track of how the decision situation is evolving over time. The information about the current situation that is needed to make a correct decision is called the "state".&lt;ref name=BellmanDP&gt;Bellman, R.E. 1957. ''Dynamic Programming''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. Republished 2003: Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-42809-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dreyfus&gt;S. Dreyfus (2002), [http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf 'Richard Bellman on the birth of dynamic programming'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf |date=January 10, 2005 }} ''Operations Research'' 50 (1), pp. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to decide how much to consume and spend at each point in time, people would need to know (among other things) their initial wealth. Therefore, wealth &lt;math&gt;(W)&lt;/math&gt; would be one of their ''[[state variable]]s'', but there would probably be others.

The variables chosen at any given point in time are often called the ''[[control variable (programming)|control variables]]''. For example, given their current wealth, people might decide how much to consume now. Choosing the control variables now may be equivalent to choosing the next state; more generally, the next state is affected by other factors in addition to the current control. For example, in the simplest case, today's wealth (the state) and consumption (the control) might exactly determine tomorrow's wealth (the new state), though typically other factors will affect tomorrow's wealth too.

The dynamic programming approach describes the optimal plan by finding a rule that tells what the controls should be, given any possible value of the state. For example, if consumption (''c'') depends ''only'' on wealth (''W''), we would seek a rule  &lt;math&gt;c(W)&lt;/math&gt; that gives consumption as a function of wealth. Such a rule, determining the controls as a function of the states, is called a ''policy function'' (See Bellman, 1957, Ch. III.2).&lt;ref name=BellmanDP /&gt;

Finally, by definition, the optimal decision rule is the one that achieves the best possible value of the objective. For example, if someone chooses consumption, given wealth, in order to maximize happiness (assuming happiness ''H'' can be represented by a mathematical function, such as a [[utility]] function and is something defined by wealth), then each level of wealth will be associated with some highest possible level of happiness, &lt;math&gt;H(W)&lt;/math&gt;. The best possible value of the objective, written as a function of the state, is called the ''value function''.

[[Richard Bellman]] showed that a dynamic [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem in [[discrete time]] can be stated in a [[recursion|recursive]], step-by-step form known as [[backward induction]] by writing down the relationship between the value function in one period and the value function in the next period. The relationship between these two value functions is called the "Bellman equation". In this approach, the optimal policy in the last time period is specified in advance as a function of the state variable's value at that time, and the resulting optimal value of the objective function is thus expressed in terms of that value of the state variable. Next, the next-to-last period's optimization involves maximizing the sum of that period's period-specific objective function and the optimal value of the future objective function, giving that period's optimal policy contingent upon the value of the state variable as of the next-to-last period decision. This logic continues recursively back in time, until the first period decision rule is derived, as a function of the initial state variable value, by optimizing the sum of the first-period-specific objective function and the value of the second period's value function, which gives the value for all the future periods. Thus, each period's decision is made by explicitly acknowledging that all future decisions will be optimally made.

== Derivation ==

=== A dynamic decision problem ===
Let the state at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;. For a decision that begins at time 0, we take as given the initial state &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. At any time, the set of possible actions depends on the current state; we can write this as &lt;math&gt; a_{t} \in \Gamma (x_t)&lt;/math&gt;, where the action &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; represents one or more control variables. We also assume that the state changes from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to a new state &lt;math&gt;T(x,a)&lt;/math&gt; when action &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is taken, and that the current payoff from taking action &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;F(x,a)&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, we assume impatience, represented by a [[discount factor]] &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\beta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

Under these assumptions, an infinite-horizon decision problem takes the following form:

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_0) \; = \; \max_{ \left \{ a_{t} \right \}_{t=0}^{\infty} }  \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t F(x_t,a_{t}), &lt;/math&gt;

subject to the constraints

:&lt;math&gt; a_{t} \in \Gamma (x_t), \; x_{t+1}=T(x_t,a_t), \; \forall t = 0, 1, 2, \dots &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we have defined notation &lt;math&gt;V(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the optimal value that can be obtained by maximizing this objective function subject to the assumed constraints. This function is the ''value function''. It is a function of the initial state variable &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, since the best value obtainable depends on the initial situation.

=== Bellman's Principle of Optimality ===
The dynamic programming method breaks this decision problem into smaller subproblems. [[Richard Bellman]]'s ''principle of optimality'' describes how to do this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Principle of Optimality: An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision. (See Bellman, 1957, Chap. III.3.)&lt;ref name=BellmanDP /&gt;&lt;ref name=dreyfus /&gt;&lt;ref name=BellmanTheory&gt;R Bellman, ''On the Theory of Dynamic Programming'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In computer science, a problem that can be broken apart like this is said to have [[optimal substructure]]. In the context of dynamic [[game theory]], this principle is analogous to the concept of [[subgame perfect equilibrium]], although what constitutes an optimal policy in this case is conditioned on the decision-maker's opponents choosing similarly optimal policies from their points of view.

As suggested by the ''principle of optimality'', we will consider the first decision separately, setting aside all future decisions (we will start afresh from time 1 with the new state &lt;math&gt;x_1 &lt;/math&gt;). Collecting the future decisions in brackets on the right, the previous problem is equivalent to:{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt; \max_{ a_0 } \left \{ F(x_0,a_0)
+ \beta  \left[ \max_{ \left \{ a_{t} \right \}_{t=1}^{\infty} }
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \beta^{t-1} F(x_t,a_{t}):
a_{t} \in \Gamma (x_t), \; x_{t+1}=T(x_t,a_t), \; \forall t \geq 1 \right] \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the constraints

:&lt;math&gt; a_0 \in \Gamma (x_0), \; x_1=T(x_0,a_0). &lt;/math&gt;

Here we are choosing &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;, knowing that our choice will cause the time 1 state to be &lt;math&gt;x_1=T(x_0,a_0)&lt;/math&gt;. That new state will then affect the decision problem from time 1 on. The whole future decision problem appears inside the square brackets on the right.{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}{{Explain|date=September 2017}}

=== The Bellman equation ===
So far it seems we have only made the problem uglier by separating today's decision from future decisions. But we can simplify by noticing that what is inside the square brackets on the right is ''the value'' of the time 1 decision problem, starting from state &lt;math&gt;x_1=T(x_0,a_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, we can rewrite the problem as a [[Recursion|recursive]] definition of the value function:

:&lt;math&gt;V(x_0) = \max_{ a_0 } \{ F(x_0,a_0) + \beta V(x_1) \} &lt;/math&gt;, subject to the constraints: &lt;math&gt; a_0 \in \Gamma (x_0), \; x_1=T(x_0,a_0). &lt;/math&gt;

This is the Bellman equation. It can be simplified even further if we drop time subscripts and plug in the value of the next state:

:&lt;math&gt;V(x) = \max_{a \in \Gamma (x) } \{ F(x,a) + \beta V(T(x,a)) \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Bellman equation is classified as a [[functional equation]], because solving it means finding the unknown function ''V'', which is the ''value function''. Recall that the value function describes the best possible value of the objective, as a function of the state ''x''. By calculating the value function, we will also find the function ''a''(''x'') that describes the optimal action as a function of the state; this is called the ''policy function''.

=== In a stochastic problem ===
{{See also|Markov decision process}}

In the deterministic setting, other techniques besides dynamic programming can be used to tackle the above [[optimal control]] problem. However, the Bellman Equation is often the most convenient method of solving ''stochastic'' optimal control problems.

For a specific example from economics, consider an infinitely-lived consumer with initial wealth endowment &lt;math&gt;{\color{Red}a_0}&lt;/math&gt; at period &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. He has an instantaneous [[utility function]] &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; denotes consumption and discounts the next period utility at a rate of &lt;math&gt;0&lt; \beta&lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;. Assume what is not consumed in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; carries over next period with interest rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Then the consumer's utility maximization problem is to choose a consumption plan &lt;math&gt;\{{\color{OliveGreen}c_t}\}&lt;/math&gt; that solves

:&lt;math&gt;\max \sum_{t=0} ^{\infty} \beta^t u ({\color{OliveGreen}c_t})&lt;/math&gt;

subject to

:&lt;math&gt;{\color{Red}a_{t+1}} = (1 + r) ({\color{Red}a_t} - {\color{OliveGreen}c_t}), \; {\color{OliveGreen}c_t} \geq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} {\color{Red}a_t} \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The first constraint is the capital accumulation/law of motion specified by the problem, while the second constraint is a [[Transversality (mathematics)|transversality condition]] that the consumer does not carry debt at the end of his life. The Bellman equation is

:&lt;math&gt;V(a) = \max_{ 0 \leq c \leq a } \{ u(c) + \beta V((1+r) (a - c)) \},&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, one can treat the sequence problem directly using, for example, the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian equations]].

Now, if the interest rate varies from period to period, the consumer is faced with a stochastic optimization problem. Let the interest ''r'' follow a [[Markov process]] with probability transition function &lt;math&gt;Q(r, d\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[probability measure]] governing the distribution of interest rate next period if current interest rate is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The timing of the model is that the consumer decides his current period consumption after the current period interest rate is announced.

Rather than simply choosing a single sequence &lt;math&gt;\{{\color{OliveGreen}c_t}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the consumer now must choose a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{{\color{OliveGreen}c_t}\}&lt;/math&gt; for each possible realization of a &lt;math&gt;\{r_t\}&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that his lifetime expected utility is maximized:

:&lt;math&gt;\max \mathbb{E}\bigg( \sum_{t=0} ^{\infty} \beta^t u ({\color{OliveGreen}c_t})   \bigg).&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is taken with respect to the appropriate probability measure given by ''Q'' on the sequences of ''r'' 's. Because ''r'' is governed by a Markov process, dynamic programming simplifies the problem significantly. Then Bellmann equation is simply

:&lt;math&gt;V(a, r) =  \max_{ 0 \leq c \leq a } \{ u(c) + \beta \int V((1+r) (a - c), r') Q(r, d\mu_r) \} .&lt;/math&gt;

Under some reasonable assumption, the resulting optimal policy function ''g''(''a'',''r'') is [[measurable]].

For a general stochastic sequential optimization problem with Markovian shocks and where the agent is faced with his decision ''[[ex-post]]'', the Bellmann equation takes a very similar form

:&lt;math&gt;V(x, z) = \max_{c \in \Gamma(x,z)} F(x, c, z) + \beta \int V( T(x,c), z') d\mu_z(z'). &lt;/math&gt;

== Solution methods ==
* The [[method of undetermined coefficients]], also known as 'guess and verify', can be used to solve some infinite-horizon, [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] Bellman equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lars |last=Ljungqvist |first2=Thomas J. |last2=Sargent |title=Recursive Macroeconomic Theory |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004 |edition=2nd |pages=88–90 |isbn=0-262-12274-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx-j-tYaPQUC&amp;pg=PA88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Bellman equation can be solved by [[backwards induction]], either [[Closed-form expression|analytically]] in a few special cases, or [[numerical analysis|numerically]] on a computer. Numerical backwards induction is applicable to a wide variety of problems, but may be infeasible when there are many state variables, due to the [[curse of dimensionality]]. Approximate dynamic programming has been introduced by [[Dimitri Bertsekas|D. P. Bertsekas]] and J. N. Tsitsiklis with the use of [[artificial neural network]]s ([[multilayer perceptron]]s) for approximating the Bellman function.&lt;ref name="NeuroDynProg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bertsekas |first=D. P. |last2=Tsitsiklis |first2=J. N. |title=Neuro-Dynamic Programming |location= |publisher=Athena Scientific |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing the impact of dimensionality by replacing the memorization of the complete function mapping for the whole space domain with the memorization of the sole neural network parameters.
* By calculating the first-order conditions associated with the Bellman equation, and then using the [[envelope theorem]] to eliminate the derivatives of the value function, it is possible to obtain a system of [[difference equation]]s or [[differential equation]]s called the '[[Euler–Lagrange equation|Euler equation]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jianjun |last=Miao |title=Economic Dynamics in Discrete Time |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=2014 |page=134 |isbn=978-0-262-32560-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh2EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard techniques for the solution of difference or differential equations can then be used to calculate the dynamics of the state variables and the control variables of the optimization problem.

== Applications in economics ==
The first known application of a Bellman equation in economics is due to [[Martin Beckmann]] and [[Richard Muth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Martin |last=Beckmann |first2=Richard |last2=Muth |year=1954 |title=On the Solution to the ‘Fundamental Equation’ of inventory theory |work=Cowles Commission Discussion Paper 2116 |url=http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/cdp/e-2116.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Beckmann also wrote extensively on consumption theory using the Bellman equation in 1959. His work influenced [[Edmund S. Phelps]], among others.

A celebrated economic application of a Bellman equation is [[Robert C. Merton]]'s seminal 1973 article on the [[ICAPM|intertemporal capital asset pricing model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert C. |last=Merton |year=1973 |title=An Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=867–887 |jstor=1913811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Merton's portfolio problem]]).The solution to Merton's theoretical model, one in which investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, is a form of Bellman's equation. Because economic applications of dynamic programming usually result in a Bellman equation that is a [[difference equation]], economists refer to dynamic programming as a "recursive method" and a subfield of [[recursive economics]] is now recognized within economics.

[[Nancy Stokey]], [[Robert E. Lucas]], and [[Edward Prescott]] describe stochastic and nonstochastic dynamic programming in considerable detail, and develop theorems for the existence of solutions to problems meeting certain conditions. They also describe many examples of modeling theoretical problems in economics using recursive methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Stokey |first2=Robert E. |last2=Lucas |first3=Edward |last3=Prescott |year=1989 |title=Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics |location= |publisher=Harvard Univ. Press. |isbn=0-674-75096-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book led to dynamic programming being employed to solve a wide range of theoretical problems in economics, including optimal [[economic growth]], [[resource extraction]], [[principal–agent problem]]s, [[public finance]], business [[investment]], [[asset pricing]], [[factor of production|factor]] supply, and [[industrial organization]]. [[Lars Ljungqvist]] and [[Thomas Sargent]] apply dynamic programming to study a variety of theoretical questions in [[monetary policy]], [[fiscal policy]], [[taxation]], [[economic growth]], [[search theory]], and [[labor economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lars |last=Ljungqvist |first2=Thomas |last2=Sargent |year=2012 |title=Recursive Macroeconomic Theory |location= |publisher=MIT Press |edition=Third |isbn=978-0-262-01874-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avinash Dixit]] and [[Robert Pindyck]] showed the value of the method for thinking about [[capital budgeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Avinash |last=Dixit |first2=Robert |last2=Pindyck |year=1994 |title=Investment Under Uncertainty |location= |publisher=Princeton Univ. Press |isbn=0-691-03410-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson adapted the technique to business valuation, including privately held businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., Business Economics &amp; Finance, CRC Press, 2004 (chapter 10), {{ISBN|1-58488-348-0}}; The Value of Private Businesses in the United States, ''Business Economics'' (2009) 44, 87–108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}. ''Economics of Business Valuation'', Stanford University Press (2013); {{ISBN|9780804758307}}. [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=11400 Stanford Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using dynamic programming to solve concrete problems is complicated by informational difficulties, such as choosing the unobservable discount rate. There are also computational issues, the main one being the [[curse of dimensionality]] arising from the vast number of possible actions and potential state variables that must be considered before an optimal strategy can be selected. For an extensive discussion of computational issues, see Miranda and Fackler,&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, M., &amp; Fackler, P., 2002. ''Applied Computational Economics and Finance''. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Meyn 2007.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Meyn, 2007.  [http://decision.csl.uiuc.edu/~meyn/pages/CTCN/CTCN.html Control Techniques for Complex Networks], Cambridge University Press, 2007.  Appendix contains abridged [http://decision.csl.uiuc.edu/~meyn/pages/book.html Meyn &amp; Tweedie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194420/http://decision.csl.uiuc.edu/~meyn/pages/book.html |date=2007-10-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
In [[Markov decision process]]es, a Bellman equation is a [[recursion]] for expected rewards. For example, the expected reward for being in a particular state ''s'' and following some fixed policy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; has the Bellman equation:

:&lt;math&gt; V^\pi(s)= R(s,\pi(s)) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,\pi(s)) V^\pi(s').\ &lt;/math&gt;

This equation describes the expected reward for taking the action prescribed by some policy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation for the optimal policy is referred to as the ''Bellman optimality equation'':

:&lt;math&gt; V^*(s)=  \max_a \{ {R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V^*(s')} \}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

It describes the reward for taking the action giving the highest expected return.

{{Politics}}
The interdisciplinary study of '''biology and political science''' is the application of theories and methods from the biology toward the scientific understanding of [[political behavior]]. The field is sometimes called '''[[biopolitics]]''', a term that will be used in this article as a synonym although it has other, less related meanings. More generally, the field has also been called "[[politics]] and the [[life sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Robert H., and Samuel M. Hines. 2001. ''Biology and Political Science''. New York: Routledge; Somit, A., and S. A. Peterson. 1998. "Review article: Biopolitics after three decades - A balance sheet." British Journal of Political Science 28:559-71; Masters, Roger D. 1989. ''The Nature of Politics''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
The field can be said to originate with the 1968 manifesto of [[Albert Somit]], ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', which appeared in the ''[[Midwest Journal of Political Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Maxwell|title=The Sociobiological Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OPxMX-2h2cC&amp;pg=PA142|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0768-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{jstor|2110295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopolitics" was appropriated for this area of study by [[Thomas Thorton]], who used it as the title of his 1970 book.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"/&gt;

The [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]] was formed in 1981 and exists to study the field of biopolitics as a subfield of political science. APLS owns and publishes an academic peer-reviewed journal called ''Politics and the Life Sciences'' (PLS). The journal is edited in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]’s School of Public Policy, in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Politics and the Life Sciences|url=http://www.aplsnet.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s and since, biopolitics research has expanded rapidly, especially in the areas of [[evolutionary theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, and Robert Kurzban. 2003. "Evolutionary Approaches to Political Psychology." In ''Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology'', ed. D. O. Sears, L. Huddie and R. Jervis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Alford, J. R., C. L. Funk, and J. R. Hibbing. 2005. "Are political orientations genetically transmitted?" American Political Science Review 99 (2):153-67; Hatemi, Peter K., Carolyn L. Funk, Hermine Maes, Judy Silberg, Sarah E. Medland, Nicholas Martin, and Lyndon Eaves. 2009. "Genetic Influences on Political Attitudes over the Life Course." Journal of Politics 71 (3):1141-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Darren. 2011. "From SCAN to Neuropolitics. In ''Man is By Nature a Political Animal'', edited by P. K. Hatemi and R. McDermott. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical link between biology and politics on the one hand, and sociological organicism on the other, is inescapable.  The essential difference here is that the early modern application of biological ideas to politics revolved around the idea that society was a ‘social organism’, whereas the subject this article describes expressly sets out to separate the essential logic of the association of biology to human social life, from this earlier model.  Hence the emphasis upon ‘politics’, denoting the primacy of the individual who engages in social life, as in political behaviour, underpinned by biological foundations.  In this sense the rise of Biopolitics represents the replacement of sociological organicism that had been eradicated by the end of the Second World War, with an acceptable form of political organicism.  Some discussion bearing on this point may be found in ''Biology and Politics : Recent Explorations'' by Albert Somit, 1976, which is a collection of essays, one brief essay by William Mackenzie is ''Biopolitics : A Minority Viewpoint'', in which he talks about the ‘founding father’ of Biopolitics as being Morley Roberts, because of his 1938 book of that name.  But Roberts was not using the term in its modern, politically sanitized sense, but in the context of society viewed as a true living being, a social organism.  And in a reply to Somit’s ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', published in the same journal, we find ''Some Questions about a More Biologically Oriented Political Science'' by Jerone Stephens, which sets out to warn against lurching back into the errors of previous venturers into the realms of biology and politics, as in sociological organicism.

'''Blades Glacier''' ({{Coord|77|38|S|153|0|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] flowing east from the snow-covered saddle just north of [[La Gorce Peak]], [[Alexandra Mountains]]. It merges with [[Dalton Glacier]] on the north side of [[Edward VII Peninsula]]. It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey]] from surveys and from [[U.S. Navy]] air photos, 1959–65, and named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for [[William Robert Blades]] who served as navigator during [[U.S. Navy Operation Highjump]] (1946–47) and [[Operation Deep Freeze]] (1955–59).

Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 134, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Roman grid''', was a method of land measurement used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a [[field system]], often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to [[O. A. W. Dilke]],&lt;ref&gt;O.A.W.Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 34, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.

Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square [[grid plan|grid]] traced using [[Surveying|surveyors']] instruments. It may appear in the form of [[Roman roads|roads]], canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to [[Roman army]] veterans in a new [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).&lt;ref&gt;A. Piganiol, ''Les documents cadastraux de la colonie romaine d'Orange'', XVIe supplément à ''Gallia'', Paris, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing [[landscape history]] in many former areas of the [[Roman empire]].

==History==
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new [[Roman colony|colonies]] in the ''ager Sabinus'', northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the [[Po valley]], starting with ''Ariminum'' ([[Rimini]]) in 268 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''Studi di storia romana e di diritto'', p. 415, 2001, {{ISBN|88-87114-70-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian law introduced by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ''[[ager publicus]]'', gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' p. 416, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuriation was used later for [[land reclamation]] and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by [[Virgil]], in his [[Eclogues]], when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near [[Mantua]] to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.

Centuriation was widely used throughout [[Italy]] and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between [[Rome]] and [[Salerno]], 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Giacinto Libertini, ''Persistenza di luoghi e toponimi nelle terre delle antiche città di Atella e Acerrae'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==System and procedure==
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ''ager centuriatus'' system.

The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the ''umbilicus agri'' or ''umbilicus soli''. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:
* ''ultra'', the land he saw in front of him;
* ''citra'', the land behind him;
* ''dextera'', the land to his right;
* ''sinistra'', the land to his left.

He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a [[Groma surveying|groma]], tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:
* the first, generally oriented east-west, was called ''[[decumanus maximus]]'', which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Anders | title=Castra et urbs romana: An Examination of the Common Features of Roman Settlements in Italy and the Empire and a System to aid in the Discovery of their Origins. | work=CAC Undergraduate Essay Contest for 2000-2001 | publisher=Classical Association of Canada | year=2001 | url=http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the second, with a north-south orientation, was called ''[[cardo maximus]]''.

==Measurement instruments==

* [[Chorobates]] for levels
* [[Dioptra]] for levels and angles of slopes

==Orientation==
[[File:NE-PLSS.JPG|thumb|left|Example of road system in a PLSS area; [[Nebraska]] – US grid system]]
[[File:Centurisation.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Centuriation near [[Cesena]], [[Italy]], in a late nineteenth century Italian military map – Roman grid system]]
It has been suggested that the Roman centuriation system inspired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s proposal to  create a grid of [[Survey township|townships]] for survey purposes, which ultimately led to the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]]. The similarity of the two systems is empirically obvious in certain parts of Italy, for example, where traces of centuriation have remained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1451&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Thrower points out that, unlike the later US system, ''"not all Roman centuriation displays consistent orientation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Joseph William Thrower, "Maps &amp; civilization: cartography in culture and society", The University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1972, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, for practical reasons, the orientation of the axes did not always coincide with the four cardinal points and followed instead the orographic features of the area, also taking into account the slope of the land and the flow of rainwater along the drainage channels that were traced (centuriation of [[Florentia]] ([[Florence]]). In other cases, it was based on the orientation of existing lines of communication (centuriation along the [[Via Emilia]]) or other geomorphological features.

Centuriation is typical of flat land, but centuriation systems have also been documented in hilly country.

== Centuriation of the surrounding territory ==
Sometimes the ''umbilicus agri'' was located in a city or a [[castrum]]. This central point was generally referred to as ''groma'', from the name of the instrument used by the ''[[gromatici]]'' (surveyors).

In such cases, the grid was traced by extending the urban ''cardo maximus'' and  the ''decumanus maximus'' through the gates of the city into the surrounding agricultural land.

Parallel secondary roads (''limites quintarii'') were then traced on both sides of the initial axes at intervals of 100 ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|actus]]'' (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km). The territory was thus divided into square areas.

The road network density was then increased with other roads parallel to those already traced at a distance from each other of 20 ''actus'' (710.40 m). Each of the square areas – 20 × 20 ''actus'' – resulting from this further division was called a ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|centuria]]'' or ''century''.

This dimension of the ''centuria'' became prevalent in the period when the large areas of the Po Valley were delimited, while smaller centuries of 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 ''actus'', as the name ''centuria'' suggests, had formerly been used.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' page 415, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was divided after the completion of the roads.

Each century was divided into 10 strips, lying parallel to the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'', with  a distance between them of 2 ''actus'' (71.04 m), thus forming 100 squares (''heredia'') of about 0.5 hectares each: 100 ''heredia'' =  1 ''centuria''.

Each ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|heredium]]'' was divided in half along the north-south axis thus creating two ''jugera'': one ''[[jugerum]]'', from ''jugum'' (yoke), measured 2523 square metres, which was the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day by a pair of oxen.

==Regions where centuriation was used==
Even today, in some parts of Italy, the landscape of the plain is determined by the outcome of Roman centuriation, with the persistence of straight elements (roads, drainage canals, property divisions) which have survived territorial development and are often basic elements of urbanisation, at least until the twentieth century, when the human pressure of urban growth and infrastructures destroyed many of the traces scattered throughout the agricultural countryside.

===Significant examples of centuriation in Italy===

* [[Cesena]], and in particular the country to the north-east and north-west of the city;
* Central [[Romagna]];
* [[Padua]], eastern area of the province; in this area of [[Veneto|Venetia]], the geometrical layout of the landscape is known as the ''Graticolato Romano'';
* ''Ager Campanus'' (Acerra, Capua, Nola, Atella);
* [[Florence]] ([[Florentia]]), first century CE, in the plain to the west  to [[Prato]] and beyond.
*[[Province of Bergamo]]: There are still several easily identifiable traces, from the low plain almost to the foot of the hills, for example, the straight road of about ten [[kilometre]]s between [[Spirano]]  and [[Stezzano]], through [[Comun Nuovo]]; there are also traces of agricultural centuriation identifiable in the street network of [[Treviglio]].&lt;ref&gt;Maps with text in Italian: http://www.provincia.bergamo.it/provpordocs/D0_02_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemists Without Borders''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] involved in [[international development]] work designed to solve humanitarian problems through [[chemistry]] and related activities.  As a public benefit, non-profit organization, the primary goals of Chemists Without Borders include, but are not limited to:
*providing affordable [[medicines]] and [[vaccines]] to those who need them most
* providing [[clean water]] through [[water purification]] technologies
* supporting [[sustainable energy]] technologies
* encouraging [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] to scholarly chemistry research articles throughout the world
* advocating a better understanding of chemistry through [[education]].

Chemists Without Borders was founded in 2004 by Bego Gerber and Steve Chambreau as a result of a letter that Gerber sent to the editor of ''[[Chemical and Engineering News]]'' in September 2004.

{{update|date= January 2016}}
The compilation of a unified '''list of [[computer viruses]]''' is made difficult because of naming. To aid the fight against computer viruses and other types of malicious software, many security advisory organizations and developers of [[anti-virus]] software compile and publish lists of viruses. When a new virus appears, the rush begins to identify and understand it as well as develop appropriate counter-measures to stop its propagation. Along the way, a name is attached to the virus.  As the developers of anti-virus software compete partly based on how quickly they react to the new threat, they usually study and name the viruses independently.  By the time the virus is identified, many names denote the same virus.

Another source of ambiguity in names is that sometimes a virus initially identified as a completely new virus is found to be a variation of an earlier known virus, in which cases, it is often renamed.  For example, the second variation of the [[Sobig]] worm was initially called "Palyh" but later renamed "Sobig.b".  Again, depending on how quickly this happens, the old name may persist. 

== Scope ==
In terms of scope, there are two major variants: the list of "in-the-wild" viruses, which list viruses in active circulation, and lists of all known viruses, which also contain viruses believed not to be in active circulation (also called "zoo viruses").  The sizes are vastly different: in-the-wild lists contain a hundred viruses but full lists contain tens of thousands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5618">'''Credit valuation adjustment''' ('''CVA''') is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio value]] that takes into account the possibility of a [[counterparty]]’s default. In other words, CVA is the [[market value]] of [[Counterparty risk|counterparty credit risk]]. This price depends on counterparty credit spreads as well as on the market risk factors that drive derivatives’ values and, therefore, exposure. CVA is one of a family of related valuation adjustments, collectively [[xVA]];  for further context here see [[Financial economics #Derivative pricing]].

Unilateral CVA is given by the [[risk-neutral]] expectation of the discounted loss. The risk-neutral expectation can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{CVA(T)} = E^Q[L^*] = (1-R)\int_0^T E^Q\left[\frac{B_0}{B_t} E(t)|t=\tau\right] d\mathrm{PD}(0,t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] of the longest transaction in the portfolio, &lt;math&gt; B_t &lt;/math&gt; is the future value of one unit of the [[base currency]] invested today at the prevailing interest rate for maturity &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the portfolio value that can be recovered in case of a default, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time of default, &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the exposure at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{PD}(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the risk neutral probability of counterparty default between times &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. These probabilities can be obtained from the term structure of [[credit default swap]] (CDS) spreads.

More generally CVA can refer to a few different concepts:
* The mathematical concept as defined above;
* A part of the regulatory Capital and RWA ([[Risk-weighted asset]]) calculation introduced under [[Basel 3]];
* The CVA desk of an investment bank, whose purpose is to:
** hedge for possible losses due to counterparty default;
** hedge to reduce the amount of capital required under the CVA calculation of Basel 3;
* The "CVA charge". The hedging of the CVA desk has a cost associated to it, i.e. the bank has to buy the hedging instrument. This cost is then allocated to each business line of an investment bank (usually as a contra revenue). This allocated cost is called the "CVA Charge".

According to the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]]'s July 2015 consultation document regarding CVA calculations, if CVA is calculated using 100 timesteps with 10,000 scenarios per timestep, 1 million simulations are required to compute the value of CVA. Calculating CVA risk would require 250 daily market risk scenarios over the 12-month stress period. CVA has to be calculated for each market risk scenario, resulting in 250 million simulations. These calculations have to be repeated across 6 risk types and 5 liquidity horizons, resulting in potentially 8.75 billion simulations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/the-triple-convergence-of-credit-valuation-adjustment-cva/|author=Alvin Lee|title=The Triple Convergence Of Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)|publisher=Global Trading|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure, independent of counterparty default==

Assuming independence between exposure and counterparty’s [[credit quality]] greatly simplifies the analysis. Under this assumption this simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{CVA} = (1-R) \int_0^T \mathrm{EE}^*(t)~d\mathrm{PD}(0,t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EE}^*&lt;/math&gt; is the risk-neutral discounted expected exposure (EE)

== Approximation ==
Full calculation of CVA is done via Monte-Carlo simulation of all risk factors which is very computationally demanding. There exists a simple approximation for CVA which consists in buying just one default protection (Credit Default Swap) for amount of NPV of netted set of derivatives for each counterparty.[http://www.pricederivatives.com/en/simple-cva-calculation-example-credit-valuation-adjustment-excel/]

==Function of the CVA desk and implications for technology==
{{POV-check|section|date=July 2012}}
In the view of leading [[Investment banking|investment banks]], CVA is essentially an activity carried out by both finance and a trading desk in the Front Office.  Tier 1 banks either already generate counterparty EPE and ENE (expected positive/negative exposure) under the ownership of the CVA desk (although this often has another name) or plan to do so.  Whilst a CVA platform is based on an exposure measurement platform, the requirements of an active CVA desk differ from those of a Risk Control group and it is not uncommon to see institutions use different systems for risk exposure management on one hand and CVA pricing and hedging on the other. 

A good introduction can be found in a paper by Michael Pykhtin and Steven Zhu.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Modeling Counterparty Credit Risk, GARP Risk Review,July-August 2007 [http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=1032522 Related SSRN Research Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dry distillation''' is the [[heat]]ing of [[solid]] materials to produce [[gaseous]] products (which may condense into liquids or solids). The method may involve [[pyrolysis]] or [[Thermal decomposition|thermolysis]], or it may not (for instance, a simple mixture of ice and glass could be separated without breaking any chemical bonds, but organic matter contains a greater diversity of molecules, some of which are likely to break). If there are no chemical changes, just phase changes, it resembles classical [[distillation]], although it will generally need higher temperatures. Dry distillation in which chemical changes occur is a type of [[destructive distillation]] or [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].

==Uses==
The method has been used to obtain liquid [[fuel]]s from [[coal]] and [[wood]].  It can also be used to break down mineral [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s such as [[sulfate]]s ({{chem|SO|4|2-}}) through [[Thermal decomposition|thermolysis]], in this case producing [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) gas which can be dissolved in water to obtain [[sulfuric acid]].  By this method sulfuric acid was first identified and artificially [[Vitriol#Manufacture of sulfuric acid|produced]]. When substances of vegetable origin, e.g. [[coal]], [[oil shale]], [[peat]] or [[wood]], are heated in the absence of air (dry distillation), they decompose into gas, liquid products and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]/[[charcoal]]. The yield and chemical nature of the decomposition products depend on the nature of the raw material and the conditions under which the dry distillation is done. Decomposition within a temperature range of 450 to about 600°C is called [[carbonization]] or low-temperature degassing. At temperatures above 900°C, the process is called [[Coke (fuel)|coking]] or high-temperature degassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eagleson |first=Mary|title=Concise Encyclopedia Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Owuv-c9L_IMC&amp;pg=PA240|year=1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-011451-5 |pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt; If coal is [[coal gasification|gasified]] to make [[coal gas]] or carbonized to make coke then [[Coal tar]] is among the by-products.

===Wood===
When wood is heated above 270°C it begins to carbonize. If air is absent the final product, since there is no oxygen present to react with the wood, is charcoal. If air, which contains oxygen, is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400–500°C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, first the moisture is driven off and until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100–110°C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises and at about 270°C it begins to spontaneously decompose and, at the same time, heat is evolved. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in [[charcoal burning]]. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450°C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%) and small amounts of tarry substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600°C.

In the common practice of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning a part of it, all the by-product vapors and gas escapes into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases through a series of water to yield so-called wood vinegar ([[pyroligneous acid]]) and the non-condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJoules per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Simple Technologies for Charcoal Making, Issue 41 of Forestry Papers Series|date=1983|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org. |isbn=9251013284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww-hfFDy1WYC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 February 2015|chapter=Volume 41 of FAO forestry paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[deciduous]] tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are [[methanol]] (wood alcohol) and [[charcoal]]. The distillation of [[pine]] wood causes [[Pine tar]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. [[Birch tar]] from [[birch bark]] is a particularly fine tar, known as "[[Russia]]n oil", suitable for [[leather]] protection. The by-products of wood tar are [[turpentine]] and [[charcoal]].

[[Tar kiln]]s are dry distillation ovens, historically used in Scandinavia for producing [[tar]] from wood. They were built close to the forest, from [[limestone]] or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split into dimensions of a finger, stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss. If oxygen can enter, the wood might catch fire, and the production would be ruined. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out and continues to do so for a few days.

The '''Eckert number''' ('''Ec''') is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]] used in [[continuum mechanics]]. It expresses the relationship between a flow's [[kinetic energy]] and the boundary layer [[enthalpy]] difference, and is used to characterize heat [[dissipation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/gsac/grad_info/prelims/binders/dimensionless_numbers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Ernst R. G. Eckert]].

It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Ec} = \frac{u^2}{c_p \Delta T} = \frac{ \mbox{Heat  Dissipation  Potential}}{ \mbox{Advective  Transport} }
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''u'' is the local [[flow velocity]] of the continuum,
* ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the constant-pressure local [[specific heat]] of the continuum,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between wall temperature and local temperature.

== Current research about the Food Valley ==

The Food Valley as a region has been the subject of study by several human geographers. Even before the Food Valley was established as an organisation in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodvalley.nl/Documenten/Jaarbericht%202005%20Stichting%20Food%20Valley%20-%20website.pdf |title=Stichting Food Valley |publisher=//www.foodvalley.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011060754/http://www.foodvalley.nl/Documenten/Jaarbericht%202005%20Stichting%20Food%20Valley%20-%20website.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a region in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.werv.nl/ |title=WERV |publisher=//www.werv.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Kraak and Frits Oevering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://overons.rabobank.com/content/images/FoodValleyWageningen-200304_tcm64-77231.pdf |title= Food Valley Van agglomeratie naar cluster |publisher= Rabobank Nederland |date=  |accessdate= 2012-08-01 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; made a SWOT analysis of the region using an [[Evolutionary economics]] framework and compared it with similar regions in Canada, Denmark, Italy and Sweden. A similar study was done by Floris Wieberdink.&lt;ref name="Wieberdink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://essay.utwente.nl/57846/1/scriptie_Wieberdink.pdf |title= Van Netwerk tot Regio |publisher= Universiteit Twente |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study utilised [[Geomarketing]] concepts in the WERV, the predecessor of the Regio Food Valley. Geijer and Van der Velden &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://overons.rabobank.com/content/images/Kracht%20van%20de%20Vallei%20-%20volledige%20rapport%20incl%20voorwoord_tcm64-131685.pdf |title= De economische Kracht van de Vallei |publisher= Rabobank Nederland |date=  |accessdate= 2012-08-01 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the economic development of the Regio Food Valley using statistical data.

=== Discussion ===

The research performed in the Food Valley has generated some discussion about the influence of culture on economic growth. Wieberdink&lt;ref name="Wieberdink" /&gt; argued that culture and habitat are not spatially bounded, but historically. More recently a study about the Food Valley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/grboom/docs/publieksversie |title= Het gezicht van de innovatie |publisher= Issuu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that culture and habitat are in fact spatially bounded. Both studies, however, recommend the Regio Food Valley to promote its distinct culture.

The area of the square is the sum of the area of the yellow region (=X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the area of the green region (=Y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the area of the two white regions (=2×X×Y).]]

The '''freshman's dream''' is a name sometimes given to the erroneous equation (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is a real number (usually a positive integer greater than 1). Beginning students commonly make this error in computing the [[exponentiation|power]] of a sum of real numbers, falsely assuming powers [[distributive law|distribute]] over sums.&lt;ref&gt;Julio R. Bastida, ''Field Extensions and Galois Theory'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1984, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraleigh, John B., ''A First Course in Abstract Algebra'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1993, p.453, {{ISBN|0-201-53467-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''n'' = 2, it is easy to see why this is incorrect: (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be correctly computed  as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''xy''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; using [[distributivity]] (commonly known as the [[FOIL method]]). For larger positive integer values of ''n'', the correct result is given by the [[binomial theorem]].

The name "freshman's dream" also sometimes refers to the theorem that says that for a [[prime number]] ''p'', if ''x'' and ''y'' are members of a [[commutative ring]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', then 
(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;. In this more exotic type of arithmetic, the "mistake" actually gives the correct result, since ''p'' divides all the [[binomial coefficient]]s save the first and the last, making all intermediate terms equal to zero.

==Examples==
*&lt;math&gt;(1+4)^2 = 5^2 = 25&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;1^2+4^2 = 17&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt; does not generally equal &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2}+\sqrt{y^2}=|x|+|y|&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9+16}=\sqrt{25}=5&lt;/math&gt;, which does not equal {{nowrap|1=3 + 4 = 7}}. In this example, the error is being committed with the exponent {{nowrap|1=''n'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

==Prime characteristic==

When ''p'' is a prime number and ''x'' and ''y'' are members of a [[commutative ring]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', then {{nowrap|1=(''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This can be seen by examining the prime factors of the binomial coefficients: the ''n''th binomial coefficient is

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{p}{n} = \frac{p!}{n!(p-n)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[numerator]] is ''p'' [[factorial]], which is divisible by ''p''. However, when {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''n'' &lt; ''p''}}, neither ''n''! nor {{nowrap|(''p'' &amp;minus; ''n'')!}} is divisible by ''p'' since all the terms are less than ''p'' and ''p'' is prime. Since a binomial coefficient is always an integer, the ''n''th binomial coefficient is divisible by ''p'' and hence equal to 0 in the ring. We are left with the zeroth and ''p''th coefficients, which both equal 1, yielding the desired equation.

Thus in characteristic ''p'' the freshman's dream is a valid identity. This result demonstrates that exponentiation by ''p'' produces an [[endomorphism]], known as the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] of the ring.

The demand that the characteristic ''p'' be a prime number is central to the truth of the freshman's dream. A related theorem states that if a number ''n'' is prime then {{nowrap|(''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' + 1 (mod ''n'')}} in the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n[x]&lt;/math&gt;. This theorem is a direct consequence of [[Fermat's little theorem]] and it is a key fact in modern primality testing.&lt;ref name=Granville&gt;A. Granville, ''[http://www.ams.org/bull/2005-42-01/S0273-0979-04-01037-7/S0273-0979-04-01037-7.pdf It Is Easy To Determine Whether A Given Integer Is Prime]'', Bull. of the AMS, Volume 42, Number 1 (Sep. 2004), Pages 3–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and alternate names==
The history of the term "freshman's dream" is somewhat unclear. In a 1940 article on [[modular field]]s, [[Saunders Mac Lane]] quotes [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]]'s remark that a knowledge of {{nowrap|1=(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of characteristic 2 would corrupt freshman students of [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. This may be the first connection between "freshman" and binomial expansion in fields of positive characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Colin R. Fletcher, Review of ''Selected papers on algebra, edited by [[Susan Montgomery]], Elizabeth W. Ralston and others. Pp xv, 537. 1977. {{ISBN|0-88385-203-9}} (Mathematical Association of America)'', ''The Mathematical Gazette'', Vol. 62, No. 421 (Oct., 1978), The Mathematical Association. p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, authors of undergraduate algebra texts took note of the common error. The first actual attestation of the phrase "freshman's dream" seems to be in [[Thomas W. Hungerford|Hungerford's]] graduate algebra textbook (1974), where he quotes McBrien.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Hungerford, ''Algebra,'' Springer, 1974, p. 121; also in ''Abstract Algebra: An Introduction'', 2nd edition. Brooks Cole, July 12, 1996, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative terms include "'''freshman exponentiation'''", used in Fraleigh (1998).&lt;ref&gt;John B. Fraleigh, ''A First Course In Abstract Algebra'', 6th edition, Addison-Wesley, 1998. pp. 262 and 438.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "freshman's dream" itself, in non-mathematical contexts, is recorded since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22freshman%27s+dream%22&amp;tbs=,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan%201_2%201800,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201900&amp;num=10 Google books 1800–1900 search for "freshman's dream"]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3XNHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=%22freshman%27s+dream%22 Bentley's miscellany, Volume 26, p. 176], 1849&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the expansion of {{nowrap|1=(''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is correctly given by the [[binomial theorem]], the freshman's dream is also known as the "'''child's binomial theorem'''"&lt;ref name=Granville/&gt; or "'''schoolboy binomial theorem'''".

'''Fyodor Alekseyevich Minin''' ({{Lang-ru|Федор Алексеевич Минин}}) (ca. 1709 - after 1742) was a Russian [[Arctic]] [[explorer]].

In 1730s, Minin participated in the [[Second Kamchatka expedition]]. In 1736, he joined the unit led by [[Dmitry Ovtsyn]]. In 1738, he was in charge of a group of explorers, that would [[chart]] the [[Arctic Ocean]] coastline east of the [[Yenisei]] river. In 1738-1740, Minin made an attempt to go around the [[Taimyr Peninsula]] from the north and reached 75°15'N. Together with [[Dmitry Sterlegov]], he mapped this part of the Arctic Ocean coastline.

A [[Headlands and bays|cape]] at the [[Mammoth Peninsula]], a peninsula, the [[Minina Skerries]] in the [[Kara Sea]], a [[Headlands and bays|gulf]], and a [[mountain]] on the shores of the Taimyr Peninsula bear Minin's name.

'''Giacomo Luigi Ciamician''' ({{lang-hy|Հակոբ (Ջակոմո) Լուիջի Չամիչյան}}; 27 August 1857&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 1922) was an Italian photochemist and senator of [[Armenia]]n descent.&lt;ref name=jcs&gt;{{cite journal|year=1926|title=Giacomo Luigi Ciamician|journal=[[Journal of the Chemical Society]]|pages=993–1050|doi=10.1039/JR9262900993|url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=JR9262900993&amp;JournalCode=JR|author=Nasini, Raffaello|volume=129|last2=Brown|first2=Reginald|last3=Roe|first3=Alfred|last4=Miller|first4=W.

== Life and work ==
Ciamician was born in [[Trieste]], Italy (then part of [[Austrian Empire]]) from Armenian parents.

Ciamician was an early researcher in the area of [[photochemistry]], where from 1900 to 1914 he published 40 notes, and nine memoirs.He received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Giessen]]. His first [[photochemistry]] experiment was published in 1886 and was titled "On the conversion of [[quinone]] into [[quinol]].&lt;ref name=jcs/&gt;

In 1910 he became the first man born in Trieste to be nominated Senator, in the XXIII Legislation of the Kingdom of Italy.

In 1912 he presented a paper before the 8th International Congress on Applied Chemistry later also published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] in which he described the world's need for an [[energy transition]] to [[renewable energy]]. Ciamician saw the possibility to use photochemical devices that utilizing [[solar energy]] to produce fuels to power the human civilization and called for their development. They would not only make humanity independent from coal, but could also rebalance the economic gap between rich and poor countries. His vision makes him one early proponents of [[artificial photosynthesis]].:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicola Armaroli]], [[Vincenzo Balzani]], (2007). ''The Future of Energy Supply: Challenges and Opportunities''. In: ''[[Angewandte Chemie]]''. '''46'''. pp. 52–66. {{DOI|10.1002/anie.200602373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincenzo Balzani et al. (2008). ''Photochemical Conversion of Solar Energy''. In: ''[[ChemSusChem]]'' '''1''', (1–2), pp. 26–58. {{DOI|10.1002/cssc.200700087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"''On the arid lands there will spring up industrial colonies without smoke and without smokestacks; forests of glass tubes will extend over the plains and glass buildings will rise everywhere; inside of these will take place the photochemical processes that hitherto have been the guarded secret of the plants, but that will have been mastered by human industry which will know how to make them bear even more abundant fruit than nature, for nature is not in a hurry and mankind is.  And if in a distant future the supply of coal becomes completely exhausted, civilization will not be checked by that, for life and civilization will continue as long as the sun shines!'"'&lt;ref&gt;Ciamician, G. (1912). The photochemistry of the future. ''Science''. '''36'''. pp. 385–394.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciamician received the honorary [[Legum Doctor|Doctor of Laws]] (DLL) from the [[University of Glasgow]] in June 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=Glasgow University jubilee|day_of_week=Friday|date=14 June 1901|page_number=10|issue=36481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciamician died in [[Bologna]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">The '''Gough–Joule effect''' (a.k.a. '''Gow–Joule effect''') is originally the tendency of [[elastomer]]s to contract when heated if they are under [[Tension (physics)|tension]]. Elastomers that are not under tension do not see this effect. The term is also used more generally to refer to the dependence of the temperature of any solid on the mechanical deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Truesdell, Noll | title = The non-linear theories of mechanics | publisher = Springer | year = 2004 | pages = 360 | isbn = 978-3-540-02779-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an elastic band is first stretched and then subjected to heating, it will shrink rather than expand.  This effect was first observed by [[John Gough (natural philosopher)|John Gough]] in 1802, and was investigated further by [[James Joule]] in the 1850s, when it then became known as the Gough–Joule effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/goodyear/Gough.html |title=John Gough and his Observation of Rubber Thermodynamics |accessdate=2009-07-19 |date=1998-10-06 |publisher=Yale University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607134244/http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/goodyear/Gough.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Loadman | first = John | title = Tears of the Tree: The Story of Rubber -- A Modern Marvel | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2005 | pages = 165 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GE43QpP83RUC&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=Gough-Joule%20effect&amp;pg=PA165 | isbn = 978-0-19-856840-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''Examples in Literature:''
* Popular Science magazine, January 1972:  "A stretched piece of rubber ''contracts'' when heated.  In doing so, it exerts a measurable increase in its pull.  This surprising property of rubber was first observed by James Prescott Joule about a hundred years ago and is known as the '''Joule effect'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mzWswaAaeEAC&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=%22joule%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA94 |title=Heat Runs |accessdate=2009-07-20 |last=Kouhoupt |first=Rudy |date=January 1972 |publisher=Popular Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rubber as an Engineering Material (book), by Khairi Nagdi:  "The '''Joule effect''' is a phenomenon of practical importance that must be considered by machine designers.  The simplest way of demonstrating this effect is to suspend a weight on a rubber band sufficient to elongate it at least 50%.  When the stretched rubber band is warmed up by an infrared lamp, it does not elongate because of thermal expansion, as may be expected, but it retracts and lifts the weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nagdi | first = Khairi | title = Rubber as an Engineering Material | publisher = Hanser Verlag | year = 1992 | location = | pages = 33–34 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh9cv93gpLYC&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22joule%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA33 |  isbn = 978-3-446-16282-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is important in [[O-ring]] seal design, where the seals can be mounted in a peripherally compressed state in hot applications to prolong life.&lt;ref name = "Practical Seal Design"&gt;{{cite book

| year =1984

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect is also relevant to rotary seals which can bind if the seal shrinks due to overheating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3577">'''Hantavirus vaccine''' is a vaccine that protects in humans against hantavirus infections causing [[Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome]] (HFRS) or [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]] (HPS). The vaccine is considered important as acute hantavirus infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that about 1.5 million cases and 46,000 death happened in China from 1950 to 2007. The number of cases is estimated at 32,000 in Finland from 2005 to 2010 and 90,000 in Russia from 1996 to 2006.&lt;ref name=Schmaljohn2012/&gt;

The first hantavirus vaccine was developed in 1990 initially for use against [[Hantaan River virus]] which causes one of the most severe forms of HFRS.&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt; It is estimated that about two million doses of rodent brain or cell-culture derived vaccine are given in China every year. The wide use of this vaccine may be partly responsible for a significant decrease in the number of HFRS cases in China to less than 20,000 by 2007.&lt;ref name=Schmaljohn2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schmaljohn | first1 = C. S. | title = Vaccines for hantaviruses: Progress and issues | doi = 10.1586/ERV.12.15 | journal = Expert Review of Vaccines | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 511–513 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22827236| pmc = | url = http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA583184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hantaviruses for which the vaccine is used include Seoul (SEOV) virus. However the vaccine is thought not to be effective against European hantaviruses including Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava-Belgrade (DOBV) viruses. The pharmaceutical trade name for the vaccine is Hantavax.&lt;ref name=Lee1999&gt;Lee HW, Ahn CN, Song JW, Back LJ, Seo TJ, Park SC.

Antibody responses in humans to an inactivated hantavirus vaccine (Hantavax). Vaccine. 1999;17:2569–75.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013 no hantavirus vaccine have been approved for use in Europe or USA.&lt;ref name=Schmaljohn2012/&gt; A [[Phases of clinical research|phase 2 study]] on a human HTNV/PUUV DNA hantavirus vaccine is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02116205?term=NCT02116205 |title=Phase 2a Immunogenicity Study of Hantaan/Puumala Virus DNA Vaccine for Prevention of Hemorrhagic Fever |publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hantavax three more vaccine candidates have been studied in I–II stage clinical trials. They include a recombinant vaccine and vaccines derived from HTNV and PUUV viruses. However, their prospects are unclear.&lt;ref name=Schmaljohn2012/&gt;

'''Hostile worlds''' is sociologist [[Viviana Zelizer]]'s term for the view that the market must be kept separate from intimate, sacred and otherwise important spheres if they are to retain their value and importance. As she says, it is the assumption "that the entry of instrumental means such as monetization and cost accounting into the worlds of caring, friendship, sexuality, and parent-child relations depletes them of their richness, hence that zones of intimacy only thrive if people erect effective barriers around them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelizer|first1=Viviana|authorlink1=Circuits within Capitalism|editor1-last=Nee|editor1-first=Victor|editor2-last=Swedberg|editor2-first=Richard|title=The Economic Sociology of Capitalism|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=289–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is contrasted with the "Nothing But" view, where we do not have separated spheres of money vs. intimate relations, but there is nothing but the market (or culture, or politics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelizer|title=ibid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory has been productively used to study intimate relations, as in Zelizer's other work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zelizer|first1=Viviana|title=The Purchase of Intimacy|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8023.html|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also to examine care relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bandelj|first1=Nina|last2=Morgan|first2=Paul James|last3=Sowers|first3=Elizabeth|title=Hostile Worlds or Connected Lives?

For example, Olav Velthuis used this to understand the views of contemporary artists and their hostility to investment interests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Velthuis|first1=Olav|title=Talking Prices: Symbolic Meanings of Prices on the Market for Contemporary Art|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Coslor found this to be a prevalent view for collectors and art lovers, though not necessarily all gallerists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coslor|first1=Erica|authorlink1=Hostile Worlds and Questionable Speculation: Recognizing the Plurality of Views About Art and the Market|editor1-last=Wood|editor1-first=Donald|title=Economic Action in Theory and Practice: Anthropological Investigations|date=2010|publisher=Emerald|location=Bingley, UK|pages=209–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">[[File:Image-based flow visualization.png|thumb|Image-based flow visualization where a grid image is advected by the flow field.]]

In [[scientific visualization]], '''image-based flow visualization''' (or '''visualisation''') is a computer modelling technique developed by [[Jarke van Wijk]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Wijk|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack van Wijk|title=Image Based Flow Visualization|journal=Proceedings ACM SIGGRAPH 2002, San Antonio, Texas|year=2002|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/ibfv/ibfv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to visualize two dimensional flows of liquids such as water and air, like the wind movement of a [[tornado]]. Compared with integration techniques it has the advantage of producing a whole image at every step, as the technique relies upon graphical computing methods for frame-by-frame capture of the model of advective transport of  a decaying dye. It is a method from the [[texture advection]] family.

==Principle==
The core idea is to create a noise texture on a regular grid and then bend this grid according to the flow (the vector field). The bent grid is then sampled at the original grid locations. Thus, the output is a version of the noise, that is displaced according to the flow.

[[File:Image-Based Flow Visualization.svg|Warping of the grid and resampling at original locations]]

The advantage of this approach is that it can be accelerated on modern graphics hardware, thus allowing for real-time or almost real-time simulation of 2D flow data. This is particularly handy if one wants to visualise multiple scaled versions of the vector field to first gain an overview and then concentrate on the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiscale Image Based Flow Visualization|journal=Proceedings of SPIE's Conference on Visualization and Data Analysis (VDA) 2006|volume=6060|pages=606001|year=2006|url=http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~strzodka/papers/public/TeSt06MIBFV.pdf |bibcode=2006SPIE.6060E..01T|last1=Telea|first1=Alexandru|last2=Strzodka|first2=Robert|doi=10.1117/12.640425|series=Visualization and Data Analysis 2006|citeseerx=10.1.1.72.3457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to political theory, a state is perceived as being [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] when its citizens treat it as properly holding and exercising political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilley|first1=Bruce|title=The meaning and measure of state legitimacy: Results for 72 countries|journal=European Journal of Political Research|date=2006|page=500|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00307.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=John|title=Validating a Measure of National Political Legitimacy|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1974|volume=18|issue=1|pages=117–134, 118|doi=10.2307/2110657}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term exists beyond the political realm, as it encompasses sociology, philosophy, and psychology, legitimacy is often referred to with respect to actors, institutions, and the political orders they constitute.&lt;ref name=Reus-Smit/&gt; In other words, actors, institutions, and social orders can be seen as being either legitimate or illegitimate. When political actors engage in the process of legitimation they are pursuing legitimacy for themselves or for another institution.&lt;ref name=Reus-Smit/&gt; According to Morris Zelditch, Jr., Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Stanford, theories of legitimacy span 24 centuries, beginning with [[Thucydides]]' [[History of the Peloponnesian War]].&lt;ref name=Morris33-53/&gt;

==Theories of legitimacy==

[[File:Aristotle Politica page 1.png|thumb|First page of Aristotle's ''Politics'' ca. 335-323 B.C.]]

===Aristotle===

Some of the earliest [[#Chronology of Legitimacy Theories|accounts of legitimacy]] come from early Greek thought.&lt;ref name=Morris33-53/&gt; [[Aristotle]] is mainly concerned with the stability of the government.&lt;ref name=Morris36&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelditch Jr.|first1=Morris|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy Emerging: Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he argues that the legitimacy of the government relies upon [[constitutionalism]] and consent, he posits that political stability relies upon the [[Distributive justice|legitimacy of rewards]].&lt;ref name=Morris38&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Zelditch Jr.|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy Emerging: Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Breede&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breede|first1=Christian|title=The Challenge of Nation-Building: Insights from Aristotle|journal=The Journal of Conflict Studies|date=2009|volume=29|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/15240/24501}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book [[Aristotle politics|''Politics'']], Aristotle argues the ways in which rewards are distributed are found within politics, and distributive justice (the proper allocation of rewards according to merit) is what makes a government stable.&lt;ref name=Morris36/&gt;&lt;ref name=Breede&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breede|first1=Christian|title=The Challenge of Nation-Building: Insights from Aristotle|journal=The Journal of Conflict Studies|date=2009|volume=29|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/15240/24501}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is distributive injustice, on the other hand, the government becomes unstable. Also concerned with justness and distinguishing between right and wrong constitutions, Aristotle bases legitimacy on the rule of law, voluntary consent, and the public interest.&lt;ref name=Morris41&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelditch Jr.|first1=Morris|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy: Emerging Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle's theory of distribution of rewards and legitimacy of constitutions both deal with legitimation, the prior emphasizes an actors acceptance that rewards are just,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=J.S.|title=Towards an understanding of inequity|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date=1963|volume=67|pages=422–436|doi=10.1037/h0040968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=J.|last2=Zelditch|first2=M.|last3=Anderson|first3=B.|last4=Cohen|first4=B.P|title=Sociological theories in progress|date=1972|chapter=Structural aspects of distributive justice: A status value formulation|volume=2|pages=119–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homans|first1=G.C.|title=Social behavior: Its elementary forms|date=1961|publisher=Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=M.J.|title=The belief in a just world: A fundamental delusion|date=1980|publisher=Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walster|first1=E.|last2=Walster|first2=G.W.|last3=Berscheid|first3=E.|title=Equity: Theory and research|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter is concerned with an actors acceptance of a "moral obligation to obey a system of power."&lt;ref name=Morris38/&gt;

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===

Detailed at greater length in ''[[The Social Contract]]'', Rousseau insists that government legitimacy is dependent upon the "general will" of its members.&lt;ref name=Morris41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertram|first1=Christopher|title=Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general will itself is the common interests of all the citizens to provide for the common good of all citizens, as opposed to individual interests.&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertram|first1=Christopher|title=Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people who express this general will, according to Rousseau, are those who have consensually entered into a civil society.&lt;ref name=Morris41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertram|first1=Christopher|title=Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, implicit consent is not sufficient for political legitimacy; rather, it requires the active participation of citizens in the justification of state's laws, through the general will of the people.&lt;ref name=Fabienne1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabienne|first1=Peter|title=Political Legitimacy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because legitimacy rests on the general will of the people, Rousseau believes republican or popular rule is legitimate, while tyranny and despotism are illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=J.J.|editor1-last=Gourevitch|editor1-first=Victor|title=The Social Contract and other later political writings|publisher=The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Max Weber===

According to [[Max Weber|Weber]], a political regime is legitimate when the citizens have faith in that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odero, Mbondenyi, Lumumba|first1=Steve O.,  Morris K.,  P.

=== Mark C. Suchman ===
In his book ''Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'', [[Mark C. Suchman|Suchman]] defines legitimacy as “a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Suchman states three types of legitimacy: pragmatic legitimacy, moral legitimacy, and cognitive legitimacy.

====Pragmatic legitimacy====
Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; This is further broken down into three sub-sections: exchange legitimacy, influence legitimacy, and dispositional legitimacy. Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues86-92&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues87&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues88&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

====Moral legitimacy====
Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, if the constituency  believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Yankelovich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankelovich|first1=Daniel|title=A Crisis of Moral Legitimacy|date=1974|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections: consequential legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, structural legitimacy, and personal legitimacy. Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues89&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff1-22&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight).&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidhues89"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff4/&gt;  Suchman refers to this organization as being the "right organization for the job."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues90&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff5&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive legitimacy====
Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff5/&gt; Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sun|first1=William|last2=Louche|first2=Céline|last3=Pérez|first3=Roland|title=Finance and Sustainability: Towards a New Paradigm? A Post-Crisis Agenda|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|date=2011|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff6&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologist and philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] was the first to use the term "legitimation crisis," which he defined in ''[[Legitimation Crisis (book)|Legitimation Crisis]]'', his 1973 book of the same name.&lt;ref name="Habermas"/&gt; A ''legitimation crisis'' is an identity crisis that results from a loss of confidence in administrative institutions, which occurs despite the fact that they still retain legal authority by which to govern.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a legitimation crisis, governing structures are unable to demonstrate that their practical functions fulfill the role for which they were instituted.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas46-48"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crisis definition===
A [[crisis]] is a state of jeopardy that arises because of contradicting motivations of the subsystems within a self-enclosed system.&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Habermas, the definition of crisis used in the social sciences is often based on the principles of [[systems theory]].&lt;ref name="Habermas2-3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues that a crisis is properly understood in two dimensions, the objective and the subjective, though this connection has been difficult to grasp using conventional approaches such as systems theory or [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]].&lt;ref name="Habermas2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=Review Essay: Habermas's Social and Political Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1977|volume=83|issue=1|pages=198–212|jstor=2777774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between social integration and system integration helps distinguish between the objective and subjective components of crises.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social integration]] refers to what Habermas calls the "life-world," a term adapted from the writings of [[Alfred Schutz]], which is composed of a consensual foundation of shared understandings, including norms and values, upon which a society is built.&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Arthur W.|title=Notes on Habermas: Lifeworld and System|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~frank/habermas.html|website=University of Calgary: Department of Sociology|publisher=University of Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweickart|first1=David|article=Reading Legitimation Crisis During the Meltdown|editor1-last=Snow|editor1-first=Nancy E.|title=Social Philosophy Today: Poverty, Justice, and Markets|publisher=Philosophy Documentation Center|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[System integration]], alternatively, refers to the determinants of a society, which break down when their structures "allow fewer possibilities for problem solving than are necessary to the[ir] continued existence[s]."&lt;ref name="Habermas2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of rationalization are efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control, which are characteristic of systems as Habermas refers to them.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Arthur W.|title=Notes on Habermas: Lifeworld and System|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~frank/habermas.html|website=University of Calgary: Department of Sociology|publisher=University of Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a social system exist three subsystems: the economic, the political, and the socio-cultural.&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas5"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsystem that assumes functional primacy in a society is determined by the type of social formation that exists in the society.&lt;ref name="Habermas17-18"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four types of social formations can potentially characterize a social system: primitive, traditional, capitalist (liberal and advanced/organized capitalist), and post-capitalist.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these, with the exception of the primitive, is a class-based society.&lt;ref name="Habermas17"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''principle of organization'' of a social system determines when crises occur and what type of crisis predominates in each type of social system.&lt;ref name="Habermas16-17"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Liberal [[capitalism]]'' has its principle of organization in the "relationship of wage labor and capital, which is anchored in the system of bourgeois civil law."&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas20"/&gt; One of the facets of this social formation is the "political anonymization of class rule," which results in the socially dominant class having to convince itself that it no longer rules.&lt;ref name="Habermas22"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that it is for this reason that unconstrained communication is imperative to social progress, since analysis and critique of the bourgeois society is one way to "unmask" these ideologies and cause the bourgeois to confront the contradiction between the idea and reality of its society.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crises in liberal capitalism arise through unresolved economic steering problems.&lt;ref name="Habermas24"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, markets steer the social formation not only through the use of money and power but through ideology, although they appear to be anonymous and unpolitical entities.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimation crisis tendencies===

The political subsystem of the social world requires an input of mass loyalty in order to produce an output, which consists of legitimate administrative decisions that are executed by the state.&lt;ref name="Habermas46"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''rationality crisis'' is an output crisis that occurs when the state fails to meet the demands of the economy.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas46-48"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''legitimation crisis'', on the other hand, is an input crisis that occurs when "the legitimation system does not succeed in maintaining the requisite level of mass loyalty."&lt;ref name="Habermas46"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an identity crisis in which administrations are unable to establish normative structures to the extent required for the entire system to function properly.&lt;ref name="Habermas47"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the state suffers a loss of support by the public when the electorate judges its administration unaccountable.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohendah|first1=Peter Uwe|title=Critical Theory, Public Sphere and Culture.

==Historical examples==
In the past, there have been many examples of social upheaval and systemic power exchanges that can be classified as legitimation crises.  According to Habermas, these crises have all occurred as a natural consequence of society's productive advancement, as the social system struggles to adapt to the strains on relations of production.  In other words, as a society's "technical knowledge" advances, the equilibrium is disturbed between the technical and political aspects of production, which can result in a crisis if the imbalance isn't corrected by adequate advancement of "moral-practical knowledge." &lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=David|title=Between Reason and History: Habermas and the Idea of Progress|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A prime example of this is in the process of [[industrialization]], where the establishment of factories and massive workforces often precedes the establishment of government regulations, workers' rights and labor unions.  As sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]] explains, a group is most successful and stable when it is satisfied by the achievement of its institutional goals (technical/forces of production) and also with the institutional norms and regulations condoned to achieve those goals (moral-practical/relations of production).  Therefore, in order to maintain legitimacy, a society, constituted by both the government and the governed,  must engage in an ongoing and competitive reevaluation of its goals and norms to ensure they continue to satisfy the society's needs.  The establishment of new social movements is essential to this process.

Historically, the most stable societies have been those that enjoy widespread acceptance of both the society's institutional goals and the means used to achieve them.  In contrast, every crisis of legitimacy has occurred when a large and/or important portion of a society strongly disagrees with some or all aspects of the institutional norms, as established and advanced by a particular regime or government.&lt;ref name="Merton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Social Structure and Anomie|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1938|volume=3|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a government loses support, in this regard, it risks losing its legitimacy, as the public begins to question and doubt the grounds upon which the government's claim to power is built.&lt;ref name="Zhong201-221"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=201–221|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dealing with these crises, individuals and groups of individuals in the society resort to various modes of adjustment or adaptation.&lt;ref name="Merton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Social Structure and Anomie|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1938|volume=3|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, these have usually cropped up in the form of revolutions, coups and wars.

Additionally, it is important to note that the logic of legitimation strongly depends on the system of domination deployed.  In fact, it's the logic of legitimation that informs the concrete ways citizens and subjects comply to authority and/or contend with authority.  In other words, the basis for any claim to legitimacy is often the basis for resistance against that same claim to legitimacy.  For example, in some societies the economic achievements under a particular regime or government form the basis for its legitimation claims; in those societies, counterclaims to legitimacy will often highlight economic failures in order to strategically undermine the regime or government's authority.&lt;ref name="Shue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shue|first1=Vivienne|title=State and Society in 21st-Century China|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|location=New York|pages=27–28|chapter=Legitimacy crisis in China?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Weber, who first advanced this point, summarizes it below:

::every...system [of domination] attempts to establish and to cultivate the belief in its legitimacy.  But according to the kind of legitimacy which is claimed, the type of obedience, the kind of administrative staff developed to guarantee it, and the mode of exercising authority, will all differ fundamentally.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=Max|title=Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary France===
The events of the [[French Revolution]], from 1789 to 1799, and the socio-political changes that it comprised can be classified as a legitimation crisis.  The revolution was characteristic of a time in Europe where the divine right of monarchical rule was being undermined and transformed as the universal rights of the common citizen were emphasized instead.&lt;ref name="How187"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=How|first1=Alan|title=Habermas, History and Social Evolution: Moral Learning and the Trial of Louis XVI|journal=Sociology|date=February 2001|volume=35|pages=187|doi=10.1177/0038038501035001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the mythological world views that underpinned the governing institutions of law and that bound popular conceptions of morality were replaced with more rational ones.&lt;ref name="How186"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=How|first1=Alan|title=Habermas, History and Social Evolution: Moral Learning and the Trial of Louis XVI|journal=Sociology|date=February 2001|volume=35|pages=186|doi=10.1177/0038038501035001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===

The legitimation crisis in China took place after decades of power struggles and cultural shifts that had been in effect since the 1960s. The legitimation crisis, itself, was the result of several economic and political reforms made by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) as part of an effort to salvage their reputation after the [[socialism|socialist]] policies and [[populism|populist]] leadership of [[Mao Zedong]] in the 60s and 70s had left the Chinese economy in poor condition.

During Mao's rule, an informal [[social contract]] was established, in which the government would supply socialist benefits (e.g. egalitarianism, food and shelter, medical care, education, job security, stable prices, social stability, and elimination of social evils) in return for the public's acquiescence to one-party rule and the loss of some civil liberties and political rights.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=History.com Staff|title=Cultural Revolution|url=http://history.com/topics/cultural-revolution|publisher=A+E Networks|website=history.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the midst of the a time referred to as the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the social contract was put in jeopardy as political and social stability faded.&lt;ref name="Zhong5-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Mao died in 1976, a brief crisis of legitimation followed, as the cult of personality died with him and the CPC was left without its last strong grounds for authority. Since the party's core socialist policies had also failed, in order to regain and maintain legitimacy the party was forced to shift away from its longstanding focus on Marxist ideology, economic socialism, and charismatic appeals to focusing on political and economic rationalization and legalization instead.&lt;ref name="Zhong7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=7|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's economic achievements (e.g. improved standard of living, growth and development) under its newly liberalized policies became the primary evidence of its legitimacy. In essence, the reforms were a solid move away from a control-oriented economy towards a more market-oriented, capitalist one.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickson|first1=Bruce J.|editor1-last=Gries|editor1-first=Peter Hays|editor2-last=Rosen|editor2-first=Stanley|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|location=New York City|pages=141|title=Dilemmas of Party adaptation: The CCP's strategies for survival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPC faced a new legitimation crisis with the move toward capitalism, as it violated the terms of the previously established social contract (inflation rose, the income gap widened, job insecurity increased, social welfare programs deteriorated and social evils returned) and the CPC's claim to one-party rule was challenged, as the public began to wonder why they were necessary as a party if socialism had failed and capitalism was the answer;&lt;ref name="Zhong9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=9|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt; after all, the CPC's leaders were not the most qualified to exercise market-oriented economic reforms. The shift towards capitalist policies coupled with the CPC's inability to accommodate increased pressure for political liberalization and democratization eventually culminated in the Chinese democracy movement and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.&lt;ref name="Zhong1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=1|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcolonial Africa===
In the twentieth-century, as African states adjusted to postcolonial independence, legitimation crises and state collapse were constant threats.&lt;ref name="Zartman1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zartman|first1=I. William|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|date=1995|publisher=Lynne Reinner Publishers, Inc.|location=Colorado|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While authority was passed from colonial to independent rule successfully in most African states throughout the continent, some attempts at transition resulted in collapse.  In Congo, for example, the state collapsed as its respective institutions (e.g. army, executives, local governments, populations) refused to recognize each other's authority and work together.&lt;ref name="Zartman2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zartman|first1=I. William|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|date=1995|publisher=Lynne Reinner Publishers, Inc.|location=Colorado|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It took international intervention and the installation of a strongman with foreign connivance to reconstitute the state there.

[[File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Stalin]]'s brand of communism successfully took hold due to a combination of terror and charisma.]]

In other African countries, state collapse was not a strictly postcolonial issue, as most states had some success transferring between regimes.  Problems arose, however, when second-generation (and later) regimes began overthrowing original nationalist ones.  Chad, Uganda, and Ghana are all instances of this happening – in each, a successfully established, but dysfunctional independent regime was replaced by a military regime that managed to concentrate power, but failed to effectively wield it.  Legitimation crises and state collapse soon followed.&lt;ref name="Zartman3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zartman|first1=I. William|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|date=1995|publisher=Lynne Reinner Publishers, Inc.|location=Colorado|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Europe===
In Eastern European countries where [[Stalinism]] was the system of domination, the legitimacy of the system was dependent on the instillment of fear among citizens and the charisma of the state leader.&lt;ref name="Heller141"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Paul G.|title=Eastern Europe: Political Crisis and Legitimation|date=1984|publisher=Croom Held Australia Pty Ltd|location=Australia|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the strategy that worked for [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], himself, in the Soviet Union, as his brand of terror and charisma inspired a strong personality cult that placed authority and legitimacy in Stalin's hands alone.&lt;ref name="Heller142"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other Eastern European states, however, Soviet [[communism]] was a foreign system that had to be imported.  This proved to be a major problem, as the communist leaders in other Eastern European states lacked Stalin's charisma.

Furthermore, communism was implemented in other East European states (e.g. Romania, Hungary, Poland) in a much shorter time frame and developed very differently from the way it did in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Heller143"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, for example, the communist party initially came to power via tacit consent to a coalition government. Over time, the party began to strategically gain more power and get rid of competition.  However, the democratic means the communist parties in these states initially used to gain power lost credibility once they were seen as violent tyrannies in service of an alien power.&lt;ref name="Heller154"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, populist platforms - giving farmers land, social and economic stability, and welfare benefits - gave way to brutal collectivist realities, as leaders were blamed for the very same reforms they were once praised for.&lt;ref name="Heller155"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary examples==

===Tunisia===

[[File:Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 2.jpg|thumb|Ben Ali, former president of Tunisia, was deposed by the Tunisian people when the Arab Spring began in his state in late 2010.]]

The [[Tunisian Revolution]] began with the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] on December 17, 2010, although it is also possible to consider the miner strike in the west central town of Gafsa in 2008 to be the official beginning of the movement.&lt;ref name="Promises132"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promises and Challenges: The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011|journal=National Lawyers Guild Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=68|issue=3|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tunisian people toppled [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]], who had imposed a [[police state]].&lt;ref name="Promises131-132"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promises and Challenges: The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011|journal=National Lawyers Guild Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=68|issue=3|page=|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revolution, like other [[Arab Spring]] revolutions which would soon follow, was prompted by endemic poverty, rising food prices, and chronic unemployment.&lt;ref name="Promises131"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promises and Challenges: The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011|journal=National Lawyers Guild Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=68|issue=3|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunisians demanded democracy, human rights, the end of corruption, and the end of the enforcement of the [[Terrorism Acts|2003 Anti-Terrorism Act]], which effectively criminalized their religious ideas and practices.&lt;ref name="Promises132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tunsian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisian anti-terrorism law: A balance between security and freedoms|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/africa/12016-tunisian-anti-terrorism-law-a-balance-between-security-and-freedoms|accessdate=25 November 2014|publisher=Middle East Monitor|date=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous legitimacy of the Tunisian government had been based on a combination of the charisma of former president [[Habib Bourguiba|Bourguiba's]] secular legacy and an achievement legitimacy based on the modernization of the Tunisian state.&lt;ref name="Redissi383"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=383|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this legitimacy had failed and its accompanying regime had fallen, [[Ennahda Movement|En-Nahdha]], an Islamist party, sought to provide legitimacy through criticism of the previous regime.&lt;ref name="Redissi382"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=382|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tunisia initiated a top-down modernization, led by civil, urban, and secular petty bourgeoisie,&lt;ref name="Redissi383"/&gt; contrasting with the military coups in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, the leadership of traditional scriptural elites in Morocco and Libya, and the leadership of revolutionary armed peasantry in Algeria.&lt;ref name="Redissi383"/&gt;

Tunisians asked that a [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|National Constituent Assembly]] (NCA) be formed that would be charged with writing the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Redissi384"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=384|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The party of the former regime, the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally|Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD) was banned from running for re-election, and En-Nahdha received 40% of the vote in an election overseen by a higher independent authority in April 2011.&lt;ref name="Redissi384"/&gt;  With its share of 89 out of 217 total seats, En-Nahdha then formed a coalition in the form of a [[triumvirate]], or troika, with the [[Congress for the Republic]] and the Forum known as [[Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties|Ettakatul]] within the NCA.&lt;ref name="Redissi385"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=385|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

En-Nahdha then seized considerable control by appointing 83% of public agents at all levels, and shutting down the media by physically attacking hundreds of journalists.&lt;ref name="Redissi385"/&gt;  En-Nahdha was also suspected of several assassinations, prompting the resignation of En-Nahdha prime minister [[Hamadi Jebali]] in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Redissi385"/&gt;  En-Nahdha also failed to produce a constitution by the agreed-upon time of a year, causing many political parties, including the major political party [[Nidaa Tounes]], to declare the end of En-Nahdha's electoral legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Redissi386"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=386|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tunisian public and political parties then asked for a compromise legitimacy that consisted of a mandatory national dialogue between En-Nahdha and the other ruling members of the NCA, which began in October 2013.&lt;ref name="Redissi386"/&gt;  This effectively forced En-Nahdha to negotiate its own immediate departure from the government, while at the same time conceding the current failure of Islamism as a means of legitimacy.  The national dialogue, which is still taking place, is seeking to establish a legitimate government, end the legislative process for the constitution and electoral code, and set up an independent body to organize elections and fix a definitive date.&lt;ref name="Redissi388"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=388|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to establish democratic legitimacy and sovereignty, the National Transitional Council has had to deal with these brigades, a process which has so far been mostly unsuccessful due to mistrust between the two bodies and the popularly illegitimate but regardless tangible military strength of the brigades.&lt;ref name="Wehrey118"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehrey|first1=Frederic|title=Libya's Revolution at Two Years: Perils and Achievements|journal=Mediterranean Politics|date=March 2013|volume=18|issue=1|page=118|doi=10.1080/13629395.2013.764655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To firmly establish democratic legitimacy, the National Transitional Council is attempting to draft a new constitution.

===Yemen===
[[File:Ali Abdullah Saleh 2004.jpg|thumb|Former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh operated an extensive, primarily tribal patronage system in Yemen.]]
Even before the 2011 revolution, former Yemeni president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]’s regime’s legitimacy relied on a patronage network based on the entrenched Yemeni tribal system, effectively tying Saleh’s political legitimacy to the tribes’ much more established and trusted socio-political legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Dingli97"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dingli|first1=Sophia|title=Is the Failed State Thesis Analytically Useful? The Case of Yemen.|journal=Politics|date=June 2013|volume=33|issue=2|page=97|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2012.01453.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Longley77"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longley Alley|first1=April|title=Yemen Changes Everything... and Nothing|journal=Journal of Democracy|date=October 2013|volume=24|issue=4|page=77|doi=10.1353/jod.2013.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yemen is historically tribal,&lt;ref name="Yemen"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Yemen a New Model?|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter 2013|volume=67|issue=1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; with tribes being responsible for defense, keeping the peace, protecting and encouraging trade and markets, and either prohibiting or facilitating travel.&lt;ref name="Dingli97"/&gt;  For many Yemenis, tribal systems are “the main or only administrative system they know.”&lt;ref name="Dingli97"/&gt;  Tribes function effectively as local governments, introducing generators and water pumps, opening schools, and providing local services.&lt;ref name="Dingli98"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dingli|first1=Sophia|title=Is the Failed State Thesis Analytically Useful? The Case of Yemen.|journal=Politics|date=June 2013|volume=33|issue=2|page=98|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2012.01453.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for many “the state is not representative of the Yemeni nation to which they feel they belong.”&lt;ref name="Dingli98"/&gt;

The Yemeni revolution, also part of the Arab Spring, was brought about by the loss of legitimacy by Saleh's regime.&lt;ref name="Change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Change in Yemen|journal=New York Times|date=March 26, 2011|volume=160|issue=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yemeni youth wanted Saleh's resignation and “a more accountable and democratic system.”&lt;ref name="Change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Change in Yemen|journal=New York Times|date=March 26, 2011|volume=160|issue=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though reform came slowly due to a lack of support from the international community and the poverty of the protestors&lt;ref name="Eldin194"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eldin|first1=Kamal|last2=Salih|first2=Osman|title=The Roots and Causes of the 2011 Arab Uprisings|journal=Arab Studies Quarterly|date=Spring 2013|volume=35|issue=2|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Yemen is the Arab world's poorest country&lt;ref name="Dorell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorell|first1=Oren|title=Yemen must address people's problems, analysts say|journal=USA Today|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the anti-Saleh movement gained steam and high-level government officials and tribal leaders joined the opposition against Saleh.  The most significant government official to join the revolutionary movement was [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar|Major General Ali Mohsin Al-Ahmar]], who ordered his troops to defend antigovernment demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Change in Yemen|journal=New York Times|date=March 26, 2011|volume=160|issue=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saleh was deposed and his successor, [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi|Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi]], was elected in an uncontested election&lt;ref name="Longley74"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longley Alley|first1=April|title=Yemen Changes Everything... and Nothing|journal=Journal of Democracy|date=October 2013|volume=24|issue=4|page=74|doi=10.1353/jod.2013.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as head of the transitional government, which includes the oppositional bloc, the [[Political parties in Yemen|Joint Meeting parties]] (JMP), a five-party alliance including the leading Islamist party [[Islah]] and the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] (YSP), the Nasirist Popular Unity Party, and two small Islamist [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] parties.&lt;ref name="Longley74"/&gt;  The [[National Dialogue Conference]], launched in March 2013, brought together 565 delegates from these parties in order to write a constitution and deal with longstanding challenges to Yemeni governance,&lt;ref name="Longley74"/&gt; such as counterterrorism,&lt;ref name="Yemen"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Yemen a New Model?|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter 2013|volume=67|issue=1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorell|first1=Oren|title=Yemen must address people's problems, analysts say|journal=USA Today|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; development, and the [[South Yemen Movement|Southern Separatist Movement]].&lt;ref name="Sprusansky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sprusansky|first1=Dale|title=Yemen's Path Forward|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=February 2013|volume=32|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Yemen was the only country from the 2011 Arab Spring to emerge with a negotiated settlement with the current regime and a transition plan for a national dialogue,&lt;ref name="Longley74"/&gt; by 2013 there was “no significant redistribution of resources or hard power outside the traditional elite.”&lt;ref name="Longley74"/&gt;  The vestiges of Saleh's regime&lt;ref name="Dingli99"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dingli|first1=Sophia|title=Is the Failed State Thesis Analytically Useful?

==International crises of legitimacy==
The implications of an international crisis of legitimacy usually reach further than domestic crises, given that the actors have power over several different countries. International crises can threaten the stability between countries, increasing the probability for conflict.

===The European Union===
The [[European Union]] (E.U.) is a governing body over 28 European countries. The E.U. does not have complete legitimacy over the citizens of the 28 countries given that it only governs in the realm of politics and economics. Additionally, the E.U. does not operate under [[majority rule]] meaning any one country can veto laws.&lt;ref name="Vobruba"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vobruba|first1=Georg|title=The Limits for Legitimation. Preconditions for Conflict Resolution by Majority Rule in the European Union|journal=Czech Sociological Review|date=December 2006|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1137–1150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The E.U. suffered a legitimation crisis when it attempted to pass a constitution which failed in the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005]].&lt;ref name="Brunkhorst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brunkhorst|first1=Hauke|title=The Legitimation Crisis of the European Union|journal=Constellations|date=June 2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=165–180|doi=10.1111/j.1351-0487.2006.00448.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaara|first1=E.|title=Struggles over legitimacy in the Eurozone crisis: Discursive legitimation strategies and their ideological underpinnings|journal=Discourse &amp; Society|date=6 July 2014|volume=25|issue=4|pages=500–518|doi=10.1177/0957926514536962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United States===
During the [[Cold war era|Cold War era]], most European Countries respected the authority of the United States as an international leader.&lt;ref name="Kagan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kagan|first1=Robert|title=America's Crisis of Legitimacy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=2004|volume=83|pages=65–87|doi=10.2307/20033903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans accepted the United States as the primary defender against the [[Soviet Union]]. After the Soviet Union fell, however, some scholars believe the United States was no longer needed by the Europeans for that purpose and therefore lost international legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Kagan /&gt;

==In the United States==
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. in August, 1963.]]

In this time period, it was accepted by many political theorists that the United States was undergoing a crisis of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedrichs|first1=David O.|title=The Legitimacy Crisis in the United States: A Conceptual Analysis|journal=Social Problems|date=June 1980|volume=27|issue=5|pages=540–555|doi=10.2307/800195|jstor=800195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities in the United States began to question the legitimacy of the government because they felt they were being denied rights.&lt;ref name="Kateb"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kateb|first1=George|title=On the "Legitimation Crisis"|journal=Social Research|date=Winter 1979|volume=46|issue=4|pages=695–727|jstor=40970809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mindset was transferred into movements beginning in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which primarily involved African Americans and college students but eventually spread to a larger portion of the population.&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt; The United States government's reaction to the legitimation crisis of the late twentieth century shows that in a consolidated democracy, undergoing a legitimation crisis can strengthen legitimacy. In this case, the system adapted to the wants of the citizens and the United States re-established legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt; In the mid 1960s, the legitimacy of the United States government was challenged when citizens began to question the [[legality of the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendrickson|first1=David|title=The Sources of American Legitimacy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=November 2004|url=http://www.cfr.org/world/sources-american-legitimacy/p7473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Harry|title=On Strategy:  A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War|date=1995|publisher=Presidio Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000: Bush v. Gore reelection===

In the United States 2000 presidential election, [[United States presidential election, 2000]], Bush lost the popular vote but still won the electoral vote. Many United States citizens did not believe this was right. The legitimacy of the United States came into question after the Supreme Court Decision, [[Bush v. Gore]].&lt;ref name="Casebeer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casebeer|first1=Kenneth|title=A cautionary tale: Globalisation and legitimation crisis in the rule of law in the United States|journal=International Journal of the Legal Profession|date=March 2001|volume=8|issue=1|pages=57–68|doi=10.1080/09695950120103181|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=5655234&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some believe the legitimacy of the presidency came into question,&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt; others believe the legitimacy of the court was jeopardized after the decision was released&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yates|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Whitford|first2=Andrew|title=The Presidency and the Supreme Court After Bush v. Gore|journal=Stanford Law &amp; Policy Review|date=2002|volume=13|issue=1|pages=101–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackerman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|title=Bush v. Gore: The Question of Legitimacy|date=October 2002|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=39–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the decision, six hundred and seventy five law professors argued against the decision in ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt;

==Resolution==
When an actor loses [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the public no longer trusts the actor to maintain a [[social contract]]. Without the social contract, the natural rights of the public, such as life, liberty, and property,&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jim|title=John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property|website=The Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; are in jeopardy.&lt;ref name="Fabienne2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peter|first1=Fabienne|last2=Zalta|first2=Edward|title=Political Legitimacy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/#FunPolLeg|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is usually in the interest of both the public and the actor to end the legitimation crisis.There are several ways in which to end a legitimation crisis, but there is currently no unified theory as for the best method. Although the actor could be replaced, as seen in many of the examples above and effectively ending the legitimation crisis, this section will focus on the [[conflict resolution]] of the crisis. In this situation, the actor that was seeking legitimacy before the crisis regains legitimacy.

An actor can regain legitimacy in two ways:
# Re-establish the base:  realigning the political actions to the widely accepted social values and norms. In 1956 in Montgomery, Alabama, the more than year-long [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] eventually led to repeal of the local ordinance for bus segregation. In     this case, by realigning the laws to fit with public opinion, the government was able to regain legitimacy. 
# Coerce legitimacy:  drawing on capital goods to create a "material source of power."&lt;ref name="Reus-Smit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reus-Smit|first1=Christian|title=International Crises of Legitimacy|journal=International Politics|date=2007|volume=44|pages=157–174|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v44/n2/full/8800182a.html|accessdate=8 November 2014|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rwandan Genocide]] in 1994, the loss of government legitimacy led to an outbreak in genocide. One of the political factions, the Hutu, killed thousands of members of the Tutsi party. The RPF had to rely on the capital goods of the international community, in the form of weapons and money, and thus were able to regain control and legitimacy in Rwanda.

=== WWDC 2005 (June 6–10, 2005) ===
After a basic market update, Jobs announced that Apple would transition the Macintosh platform to Intel x86 processors. The keynote featured developers from Wolfram Research, who discussed their experience porting Mathematica to Mac OS X on the Intel platform. The conference consisted of 110 lab sessions and 95 presentation sessions, while more than 500 Apple engineers were on site alongside 3,800 attendees from 45 countries. The band The Wallflowers played at the Apple campus.

=== WWDC 2006 (August 7–11, 2006) ===
In 2006, Jobs once again delivered the keynote presentation at the WWDC, which was held from August 7 to 11 in Moscone Center West, San Francisco. The Mac Pro was announced as a replacement to the Power Mac G5, which was Apple's prior pro desktop computer and the last remaining PowerPC-based Mac. The standard Mac Pro featured two 2.66 GHz dual core Xeon (Woodcrest) processors, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB hard drive, and a 256 MB video card. An Xserve update, based on the dual core Xeons, was also announced. Redundant power and Lights Out Management were further product improvements to Apple's server lineup. While certain key Mac OS X improvements were undisclosed, there were 10 improvements in the next iteration, Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), including: full 64-bit app support, Time Machine, Boot Camp, Front Row, Photo Booth, Spaces (Virtual Desktops), Spotlight enhancements, Core Animation, Universal Access enhancements, Mail enhancements, and Dashboard enhancements (including Dashcode, and iChat enhancements).

New features to the Server included: a simplified set-up process, iCal Server (based on the CalDAV standard), Apple Teams (a set of web-based collaborative services), Spotlight Server, and Podcast Producer. The 2006 WWDC attracted 4,200 developers from 48 countries, while there were 140 sessions and 100 hands-on labs for developers.

![[File extension]](s)&lt;ref name="file extensions"&gt;File extensions may differ across platforms.  The case of these extensions may differ on case-insensitive platforms.&lt;/ref&gt;
![[MIME]] type&lt;ref name="MIME type"&gt;[[MIME]] media types may be conjectural. Very few have been officially registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]. Compression-only formats should often be denoted by the media type of the decompressed data, with a content coding indicating the compression format.&lt;/ref&gt;
!Official name&lt;ref name="official name"&gt;Official names may be disputed.&lt;/ref&gt;
!Platform&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;Creation platform indicates the platform(s) under which a format can be created.&lt;/ref&gt;
!Description
|-
|.a, .ar
|
|[[ar (Unix)|Unix Archiver]]
|Unix-like
|The traditional archive format on [[Unix-like]] systems, now used mainly for the creation of [[Static library|static libraries]].
|-
|.cpio
|application/x-cpio
|[[cpio]]
|Unix-like
|[[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] files consist of metadata concatenated with (usually) a cpio archive. Newer RPM systems also support other archives, as cpio is becoming obsolete. cpio is also used with [[initramfs]].
|-
|.shar
|application/x-shar
|[[Shell archive]]
|Unix-like
|A self-extracting archive that uses the [[Bourne shell]] (sh).
|-
|.LBR
| 
|[[LBR (file format)|.LBR]]
|CP/M
DOS
|A system for storing multiple files.  LBR archives typically contained files processed by SQ, or the archive itself was compressed with SQ.  LBR archives that were compressed with SQ ended with the extension .LQR
|-
|.iso
|
|[[ISO Image|ISO-9660 image]]
|(Various; cross platform)
|An archive format originally used mainly for archiving and distribution of the exact, nearly-exact, or custom-modified contents of an optical storage medium such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.  However, it can be used to archive the contents of other storage media, selected partitions, folders, and/or files.  The resulting archive is typically optimized for convenient rendering to (re-)writable CD or DVD media.  
|-
|.lbr
|
|
|Commodore 64/128
|A library format used primarily on the Commodore 64 and 128 lines of computers.  This bears no resemblance to the DOS LBR format.  While library files were quick to implement (a number of programs exist to work with them) they are crippled in that they cannot grow with use: once a file has been created it cannot be amended (files added, changed or deleted) without recreating the entire file.
|-
|.mar
|
|[[Mozilla Archive Format]]
|(Various; cross platform)
|An archive format used by Mozilla for storing  binary [[diff]]s. Used in conjunction with [[bzip2]].
|-
|.sbx
|application/x-sbx
|[https://github.com/MarcoPon/SeqBox SeqBox]
|(Various; cross platform)
|A single file container/archive that can be reconstructed even after total loss of file system structures.
|-
|.tar
|application/x-tar
|[[tar (file format)|Tape archive]]
|Unix-like
|A common archive format used on Unix-like systems. Generally used in conjunction with compressors such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[compress]] or [[xz]] to create .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.Z or tar.xz files.

!Description
|-
|.bz2
|application/x-bzip2
|[[bzip2]]
|Unix-like
|An [[Open-source license|open source]], [[patent]]- and [[Royalties|royalty]]-free compression format. The compression algorithm is a [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] followed by a [[move-to-front transform]] and finally [[Huffman coding]]
|-
|.F  (or     .?XF in MS-DOS)
|
|Freeze/melt [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/compress/freeze-2.5.0.tar.gz]

|[[gzip]]
|Unix-like
|[[GNU]] Zip, the primary compression format used by [[Unix-like]] systems. The compression algorithm is [[DEFLATE]].
|-
|.lz
|application/x-lzip
|[[lzip]]
|Unix-like
|An alternate [[LZMA]] algorithm implementation, with support for checksums and ident bytes.
|-
|.lzma
|application/x-lzma
|[[LZMA|lzma]]
|Unix-like
|The [[LZMA]] compression algorithm as used by [[7-Zip]]
|-
|.lzo
|application/x-lzop
|[[lzop]]
|Unix-like
|An implementation of the [[Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer|LZO]] data compression algorithm
|-
|.rz
|
|[[rzip]]
|Unix-like
|A compression program designed to do particularly well on very large files containing long distance redundancy.
|-
|.sfark
|
|[[sfArk]]
|[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] compress/decompress- [[Linux]] and [[macOS]] decompress only
|A compression program designed to do high compression on SF2 files ([[SoundFont]])
|-
|.sz
|application/x-snappy-framed
|[[Snappy (compression)|Snappy]]
|Unix-like
|A compression format invented by [[Google]] and open-sourced in 2011. [[Snappy (compression)|Snappy]] aims for very high speeds, reasonable compression, and maximum stability rather than maximum compression or compatibility with any other compression library.
|-
|.?Q?
|
|[[SQ (program)|SQ]]
|[[CP/M]] and [[DOS]]
|Squeeze: A program which compressed files.  A file which was "squeezed" had the middle initial of the name changed to "Q", so that a squeezed text file would end with .TQT, a squeezed executable would end with .CQM or .EQE.  Typically used with .LBR archives, either by storing the squeezed files in the archive, or by storing the files decompressed and then compressing the archive, which would have a name ending in ".LQR".
|-
|.?Z?
|
|[[CRUNCH (program)|CRUNCH]]
|[[CP/M]] and [[DOS]]
|A compression program written by Steven Greenberg&lt;!-- not any Steven Greenberg currently in wikipedia --&gt; implementing the LZW algorithm. For several years in the CP/M world when no implementation was available of ARC, CRUNCHed files stored in .LBR archives were very popular. CRUNCH's implementation of LZW had a somewhat unusual feature of modifying and occasionally clearing the code table in memory when it became full, resulting in a few percent better compression on many files.
|-
|.xz
|application/x-xz
|[[xz]]
|Unix-like
|A compression format using [[LZMA2]] to yield very high compression ratios.
|-
|.z
|application/x-compress
|[[deflate]] (pack)
|Unix-like
|The traditional [[Huffman coding]] compression format.
|-
|.Z
|application/x-compress
|[[compress]]
|Unix-like
|The traditional [[LZW]] compression format.
|-
|.??_
|
|
|MS-DOS/Windows
|Compression format(s) used by some DOS and Windows install programs. MS-DOS includes expand.exe to decompress its install files.  The compressed files are created with a matching compress.exe command. The compression algorithm is [[LZSS]].

|SDAs refer to Self Dissolving ARC files, and are based on the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 versions of ARC, originally written by Chris Smeets.  While the files share the same extension, they are not compatible between platforms.  That is, an SDA created on a Commodore 64 but run on a Commodore 128 in Commodore 128 mode will crash the machine, and vice versa.  The intended successor to SDA is SFX.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16211">'''[[Medical school#Malaysia|Medical Schools in Malaysia]]''' generally offer a five-year undergraduate program for future doctors. It is compulsory for students who have graduated from medical school to work in the Government Hospital under housemanship program for a duration of three years. Under section 40 of the Malaysian Medical Act 1971, every practitioner has to serve a minimum period of continuous total period of not less than three years within the public services upon being given full registration as a doctor. As defined under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, this service may be completed in a government healthcare facility, the Ministry of Health, or other government agencies as determined by the Director General of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmc.gov.my/v1/|title=Malaysian Medical Council|work=www.mmc.gov.my|accessdate=6 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706133421/http://www.mmc.gov.my/v1/|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissions ==

Entry to the public medical schools is very competitive. Courses last five or six years. The medical program is usually divided into 3 phases. Phase 1 consists of the first two years of the programme involving integrated teaching and learning of the relevant basic medical sciences. Phase II (Year 3) and Phase III (Year 4 and Year 5) involve clinical skills development and subsequently consolidation of clinical clerkship in the various clinical disciplines. Two years of pre-clinical training in an academic environment and three years clinical training at a [[teaching hospital]]. Medical schools and teaching hospitals are closely integrated. Entry requirements are basically based on [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia]] ([[STPM]]), [[Malaysian Matriculation Programme]], [[GCE A Level]], [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), Foundation in Science programme, Diploma in Health Sciences or [[Unified Examinations Certificate|Unified Examination Certificate]].

Given a transformation between input and output values, described by a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] ''f'', [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] deals with generating and selecting a best solution from some set of available alternatives, by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set, computing the output of the function, and recording the best output values found during the process. Many real-world problems can be modeled in this way. For example, the inputs can be design parameters of a motor, the output can be the power consumption, or the inputs can be business choices and the output can be the obtained profit.

An [[optimization problem]], in this case a minimization problem, can be represented in the following way
:''Given:'' a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; '''R''' from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' to the [[real number]]s
:''Search for:'' an element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' such that ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''.

In continuous optimization, ''A'' is some [[subset]] of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, often specified by a set of ''[[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s'', equalities or inequalities that the members of ''A'' have to satisfy. In combinatorial optimization, ''A'' is some [[subset]] of a discrete space, like binary strings, permutations, or sets of integers.

The use of '''optimization software''' requires that the function ''f'' is defined in a suitable programming language and connected at compile or run time to the optimization software. The optimization software will deliver input values in ''A'', the software module realizing ''f'' will deliver the computed value ''f''(''x'') and, in some cases, additional information about the function like derivatives.

In this manner, a clear separation of concerns is obtained: different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function ''f'', or a given optimization software can be used for different functions ''f''.

The following tables provide a list of notable optimization software organized according to license and business model type.

'''Prehistoric fish''' are early fish that are known only from [[fossil]] records. They are the earliest known [[vertebrate]]s, and include the first and extinct fish that lived through the [[Cambrian]] to the [[Quaternary]]. The study of prehistoric fish is called ''paleoichthyology''. A few living forms, such as the [[coelacanth]] are also referred to as prehistoric fish, or even [[living fossil]]s, due to their current rarity and similarity to extinct forms. Fish which have become recently [[extinct]] are not usually referred to as prehistoric fish.

'''Louis Palmer''' (born 1971 in [[Budapest]]) is a Swiss keynote speaker, global environmental adventurer, and "Solar Pioneer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.morgenpost.de/web-wissen/article1375733/In-80-Tagen-ohne-Abgase-um-die-Welt.html |title=In 80 Tagen ohne Abgase um die Welt - Wissen - Berliner Morgenpost |language=de|website=Morgenpost.de |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Solartaxi.jpg|thumb|Palmer on the Solartaxi]]

==Life==
Louis Palmer was raised in [[Luzern]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solartaxi.com/mission/louis-page/ |title=Louis' Page |publisher=Solartaxi |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was a little child, his dream was to show the benefit of [[renewable energy]] sources and solar cars to the world. After finishing school, he became a schoolteacher. After [http://louispalmer.ch/en/projects/ several trips] to foreign countries, he discovered his vision and took his first steps into [[Solar energy|Solar Energy]]. In 2007 and 2008, he was the first to circumnavigate the globe on solar power.

==Motivational speaker==
Louis Palmer is a motivational speaker at conferences worldwide. He speaks about his vision of solar energy and about his dream of a better world with renewable energy. His experience as a teacher is part of his special way of communicating to people.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} As a conference speaker, he has had the opportunity to speak to audiences of researchers, politicians, and students. This part of educating the audience and inspiring people to change their consumption behaviour into a reflected awareness of the environment is of great importance to him. In 2009, Palmer was awarded the European Solar Prize, and in 2011, he was awarded [[Champions of the Earth|Champion of the Earth]] for his achievements.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Solartaxi==
In 2004, with the help of sponsors and technical support, Palmer began building a [[solar-charged vehicle|solar-powered car]] called the ''Solartaxi''. For the technical expertise, he worked together with the [[Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts|Hochschule für Technik und Architektur Luzern]] and three other Swiss universities. He drove around the world in his Solartaxi between 2007 and 2008, logging over 54,000 kilometers through over 40 counties. In 2008, the tour ended in Luzern after 18 months, making it the first tour around the world in a solar-powered car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/fernweh/0,1518,597903,00.html |title=Solartaxi am Ziel: In 80 Tagen um die Welt - mit Elektroautos - SPIEGEL ONLINE |website=Spiegel.de |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour his companion Erik Schmitt made a documentary film about the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solartaxi-themovie.com/ |title=Solartaxi The Movie |publisher=Solartaxi The Movie |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he was awarded the [[European Solar Prize]] for his Solartaxi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosolar.de/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=115 |title=European Solar Prize 2009 |website=Eurosolar.de |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero Race==
After his Solartaxi tour, Palmer drew from his previous experience when he became the initiator and tour director of an organized race. The [[Zero Emissions Race]] took place between August 2010 and February 2011. The aim was to make it around the world in 80 days and to show what emission-free vehicles can accomplish. Palmer invited four teams to enter the competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zero-race.com/en/teams/ |title=Driving Teams from around the world |website=Zero-race.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting vehicle criteria that were quite concrete: They had to be propelled by an electric motor, they had to be able to drive a certain distance in a certain time, and they had to be able to carry at least two passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zero-race.com/en/race/ |title=It's about |website=Zero-race.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Zero Emissions Race, Palmer was once again able to draw attention to his vision of sustainable living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12578749 |title=Trio of electric vehicles end emission-free world tour |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Industries/202631/Green-cars-begin-world-race.html |title=Green cars begin world race - Society - Vietnam News &amp;#124; Politics, Business, Economy, Society, Life, Sports - VietNam News |website=Vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WAVE World Advanced Vehicle Expedition==
Pamer's third tour began on 10 September 2011 in Paris and finished on 25 September 2011 in Prague. 25 electric vehicles from eight countries joined his first [http://www.wave2011.net WAVE] across 3,000&amp;nbsp;km and eight countries. The tour stopped in around 30 cities to demonstrate to the public that electric vehicles are reliable, fun, and powerful. All vehicles had to produce their own electricity from a renewable source such as wind or solar and feed it into the grid. In December, the second WAVE took place in India. Five electric cars joined this tour from Mumbai to Bangalore and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wave2011.net |title=WAVE - World Advanced Vehicle Expedition |website=Wave2011.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 75 vehicles have already joined the tour, and Palmer set the world record for the largest electric vehicle parade with 481 vehicles, which joined the WAVE at its start in Stuttgart on May 31, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wavetrophy.com |title=WAVE TROPHY join the world's largest EV rally |website=Wavetrophy.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switchbus / Switzerland Explorer==
Together with his wife, Dr. Julianna Priskin, Palmer co-founded the Switzerland Explorer" with the world's first 100% electric tour bus. The aim of Switzerland Explorer is to take groups or individual tourists on sustainable tours around Switzerland. The bus was originally in service for the German army, and then it was converted to electric drive by Design-werk. It can transport up to 16 passengers and has a range of up to 300&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Meyerhofferite''' is a hydrated [[borate]] mineral of calcium, with the chemical formula  Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmineral.com/data/Meyerhofferite.shtml Meyerhofferite Webmineral data]&lt;/ref&gt; CaB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/meyerhofferite.pdf Handbook of Mineralogy]&lt;/ref&gt; or Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-2699.html Mindat with localities]&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs principally as an alteration product of [[inyoite]], another borate mineral.

Natural meyerhofferite was discovered in 1914 in [[Death Valley]], [[California]] It is named for German chemist [[Wilhelm Meyerhoffer]] (1864–1906), collaborator with [[J. H. van't Hoff]] on the composition and origin of saline minerals, who first synthesized the compound.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

'''Michael Winston "Mike" Melvill''' (born November 30, 1940 [[Johannesburg]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Melvill|title=Michael Melvill - American pilot and astronaut|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a world-record-breaking pilot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronological listing of all known flights around the World |url=http://www.earthrounders.com/cgi/chrono.php |publisher=Earthrounders.com |accessdate=3 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712175742/http://www.earthrounders.com/cgi/chrono.php |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and one of the [[test pilot]]s for [[SpaceShipOne]], the experimental [[spaceplane]] developed by [[Scaled Composites]]. Melvill piloted SpaceShipOne on its first flight past the [[edge of space]], [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|flight 15P]] on June 21, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/combined_white_knight_spaceshipone_flight_tests |title=Scaled Composites: combined white knight spaceshipone flight tests |publisher=Scaled.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus becoming the first [[commercial astronaut]] and the 434th person to go into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldspaceflight.com/bios/m/melvill-m.php |title=M.Melvill |publisher=Worldspaceflight.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the pilot on SpaceShipOne's [[SpaceShipOne flight 16P|flight 16P]], the first competitive flight in the [[Ansari X Prize]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/melvill_michael.htm |title=Astronaut Biography: Michael Melvill |publisher=Spacefacts.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

In 1978, Melvill met aerospace designer and [[Scaled Composites]] founder [[Burt Rutan]] when he flew to California to show Rutan the [[Rutan VariViggen|VariViggen]] he had built at his home. Rutan then hired him on the spot. In 1982, he was named Rutan's lead test pilot.&lt;ref name=Astronautix&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/melvill.htm |title=Melvill |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020020000/http://astronautix.com/astros/melvill.htm |archivedate=2010-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Melvill and [[Dick Rutan]], Burt's brother, flew two [[Rutan Long-EZ|Long-Eze]] aircraft that they built side-by-side around the world. This "around the world in 80 nights" flight was called The Spirit of [[Experimental Aircraft Association|EAA]] Friendship World Tour, and some legs of it lasted for over 14 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airportjournals.com/dick-rutan-the-frontiers-of-flight-the-last-great-world-record/|title=Dick Rutan The Frontiers of Flight – The Last Great World Record|date=10 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his career he became Vice President/General Manager at [[Scaled Composites]].&lt;ref name=Astronautix/&gt;

==Awards and achievements==
[[File:Scott Crossfield, passes the torch of Space Travel to Mike Melville by D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb| The first "Commercial Astronaut", Mike Melvill, reviews the first private space flight with [[Scott Crossfield]]]]
Melvill is the sole or joint holder of nine [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] aviation world records in various categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://records.fai.org/data?p=707 |title=History of Records: Michael W.

'''Mithan Lal Roonwal''' (18 September 1908 – 22 July 1990) was an Indian zoologist and director of the [[Zoological Survey of India]]. Roonwal studied a range of taxa from termites to mammals. His landmark works were on the biology of termites and a monograph on the [[primate]]s of South Asia. He was the first to note geographic patterns in the shape in which [[gray langur]]s (treated in his time as a single species) carried their tails.  He described many new species during his career at the Zoological Survey of India.

Roonwal was born in [[Jodhpur]] where he received his early education. He then studied at Lucknow where he obtained a Master of Science in 1930. He began work at the Locust Research Institute in 1931 at [[Lyallpur]] and went to Cambridge where he worked on the embryology of ''[[Schistocerca gregaria]]'' under the guidance of [[Augustus Daniel Imms]] and obtained a Ph.D. in 1935. He joined the Zoological Survey of India where he worked at the birds and mammals section from 1939 to 1940. Roonwal joined the army during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and served as a Major in the 5th Punjab Regiment and received a [[Burma Star]] for his services. From 1946 he continued his studies on the desert locust and published ideas on predicting the formation of swarms. He joined the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] in 1949 as an entomologist and worked on cataloguing the insect collections held there. He continued working there until 1956 during which time he took an interest in the systematics of termites in which he collaborated with [[Alfred E. Emerson]]. In 1956 he joined the Zoological Survey of India to succeed [[Sunder Lal Hora]] as the director. He retired from the ZSI in 1965 and joined Jodhpur University. He received a Sc.D. for his work on the morphology and systematics of termites in 1962 from Cambdrige University.&lt;ref name=zsi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thakur, M.L.|year= 1990|title= Obituary Professor Mithan Lal Roonwal|journal= Indian Journal of Entomology|volume= 52|issue=2|pages= 345–348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zsi&gt;{{cite journal| title=In memoriam: The late Dr. M.L.Roonwal (1908-1990)|author=Varshney, R.K.|pages= ix-xiv|journal=Records of the Zoological Survey of India|year=1991| volume=89|issue=1|url=http://faunaofindia.nic.in/PDFVolumes/records/089/01-04/index.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=My association with the Zoological Survey of India, 1939-1965|author=Roonwal, M.L.|pages= ix-xiv xiv-xvi|journal=Records of the Zoological Survey of India|year=1991| volume=89|issue=1|url=http://faunaofindia.nic.in/PDFVolumes/records/089/01-04/index.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-disciplinary design optimization''' ('''MDO''') is a field of [[engineering]] that uses [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods to solve [[design]] problems incorporating a number of disciplines. It is also known as multidisciplinary optimization and multidisciplinary system design optimization (MSDO).

MDO allows designers to incorporate all relevant disciplines simultaneously.  The optimum of the simultaneous problem is superior to the design found by optimizing each discipline sequentially, since it can exploit the interactions between the disciplines.  However, including all disciplines simultaneously significantly increases the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the problem.

These techniques have been used in a number of fields, including [[automobile]] design, [[naval architecture]], [[electronics]], [[architecture]], [[computer]]s, and [[electricity distribution]].  However, the largest number of applications have been in the field of [[aerospace engineering]], such as [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design.  For example, the proposed [[Boeing]] [[blended wing body]] (BWB) aircraft concept has used MDO extensively in the conceptual and preliminary design stages.  The disciplines considered in the BWB design are [[aerodynamics]], [[structural analysis]], [[Air propulsion|propulsion]], [[control theory]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Traditionally engineering has normally been performed by teams, each with expertise in a specific discipline, such as aerodynamics or structures.  Each team would use its members' experience and judgement to develop a workable design, usually sequentially.  For example, the aerodynamics experts would outline the shape of the body, and the structural experts would be expected to fit their design within the shape specified.  The goals of the teams were generally performance-related, such as maximum speed, minimum [[drag (physics)|drag]], or minimum structural weight.

Between 1970 and 1990, two major developments in the aircraft industry changed the approach of aircraft design engineers to their design problems.  The first was [[computer-aided design]], which allowed designers to quickly modify and analyse their designs.  The second was changes in the procurement policy of most [[airline]]s and military organizations, particularly the [[military of the United States]], from a performance-centred approach to one that emphasized [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle]] cost issues.  This led to an increased concentration on economic factors and the attributes known as the "[[ilities]]" including [[manufacturability]], [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]], [[maintainability]], etc.

Since 1990, the techniques have expanded to other industries.  Globalization has resulted in more distributed, decentralized design teams.  The high-performance [[personal computer]] has largely replaced the centralized [[supercomputer]] and the [[Internet]] and [[local area network]]s have facilitated sharing of design information. Disciplinary design software in many disciplines (such as [[OptiStruct]] or [[NASTRAN]], a [[finite element analysis]] program for structural design) have become very mature.  In addition, many optimization algorithms, in particular the population-based algorithms, have advanced significantly.

=== Origins in structural optimization ===
Whereas optimization methods are nearly as old as [[calculus]], dating back to [[Isaac Newton]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who used them to solve problems such as the shape of the [[catenary]] curve, numerical optimization reached prominence in the digital age. Its systematic application to structural design dates to its advocacy by Schmit in 1960. The success of structural optimization in the 1970s motivated the emergence of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the 1980s. Jaroslaw Sobieski championed decomposition methods specifically designed for MDO applications. The following synopsis focuses on optimization methods for MDO. First, the popular gradient-based methods used by the early structural optimization and MDO community are reviewed. Then those methods developed in the last dozen years are summarized.

=== Gradient-based methods ===
There were two schools of structural optimization practitioners using [[Gradient|gradient]]-based methods during the 1960s and 1970s: optimality criteria and [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]]. The optimality criteria school derived recursive formulas based on the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions]] for an optimal design. The KKT conditions were applied to classes of structural problems such as minimum weight design with constraints on stresses, displacements, buckling, or frequencies [Rozvany, Berke, Venkayya, Khot, et al.] to derive resizing expressions particular to each class. The mathematical programming school employed classical gradient-based methods to structural optimization problems. The method of usable feasible directions, Rosen’s gradient projection (generalized reduce gradient) method, sequential unconstrained minimization techniques, sequential linear programming and eventually sequential quadratic programming methods were common choices. Schittkowski et al. reviewed the methods current by the early 1990s.

The gradient methods unique to the MDO community derive from the combination of optimality criteria with math programming, first recognized in the seminal work of Fleury and Schmit who constructed a framework of approximation concepts for structural optimization. They recognized that optimality criteria were so successful for stress and displacement constraints, because that approach amounted to solving the dual problem for [[Lagrange multipliers]] using linear Taylor series approximations in the reciprocal design space. In combination with other techniques to improve efficiency, such as constraint deletion, regionalization, and design variable linking, they succeeded in uniting the work of both schools. This approximation concepts based approach forms the basis of the optimization modules in modern structural design software such as Altair – Optistruct, ASTROS, MSC.Nastran, PHX [[ModelCenter]], Genesis, iSight, and I-DEAS.

Approximations for structural optimization were initiated by the reciprocal approximation Schmit and Miura for stress and displacement response functions. Other intermediate variables were employed for plates. Combining linear and reciprocal variables, Starnes and Haftka developed a conservative approximation to improve buckling approximations. Fadel chose an appropriate intermediate design variable for each function based on a gradient matching condition for the previous point. Vanderplaats initiated a second generation of high quality approximations when he developed the force approximation as an intermediate response approximation to improve the approximation of stress constraints. Canfield developed a [[Rayleigh quotient]] approximation to improve the accuracy of eigenvalue approximations. Barthelemy and Haftka published a comprehensive review of approximations in 1993.

=== Non-gradient-based methods  ===
In recent years, non-gradient-based evolutionary methods including [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]], [[Simulated annealing|simulated annealing]], and [[Ant colony optimization algorithms|ant colony algorithms]] came into existence. At present, many researchers are striving to arrive at a consensus regarding the best modes and methods for complex problems like impact damage, dynamic failure, and [[Real-time analyzer|real-time analyses]]. For this purpose, researchers often employ multiobjective and multicriteria design methods.

=== Recent MDO methods ===
MDO practitioners have investigated [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods in several broad areas in the last dozen years. These include decomposition methods, [[approximation]] methods, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, [[memetic algorithm]]s, [[response surface methodology]], reliability-based optimization, and [[multi-objective optimization]] approaches.

The exploration of decomposition methods has continued in the last dozen years with the development and comparison of a number of approaches, classified variously as hierarchic and non hierarchic, or collaborative and non collaborative. 
Approximation methods spanned a diverse set of approaches, including the development of approximations based on [[surrogate model]]s (often referred to as metamodels), variable fidelity models, and trust region management strategies. The development of multipoint approximations blurred the distinction with response surface methods. Some of the most popular methods include [[Kriging]] and the [[moving least squares]] method.

[[Response surface methodology]], developed extensively by the statistical community, received much attention in the MDO community in the last dozen years. A driving force for their use has been the development of massively parallel systems for high performance computing, which are naturally suited to distributing the function evaluations from multiple disciplines that are required for the construction of response surfaces. Distributed processing is particularly suited to the design process of complex systems in which analysis of different disciplines may be accomplished naturally on different computing platforms and even by different teams.

Evolutionary methods led the way in the exploration of non-gradient methods for MDO applications. They also have benefited from the availability of massively parallel high performance computers, since they inherently require many more function evaluations than gradient-based methods. Their primary benefit lies in their ability to handle discrete design variables and the potential to find globally optimal solutions.

Reliability-based optimization (RBO) is a growing area of interest in MDO. Like response surface methods and evolutionary algorithms, RBO benefits from parallel computation, because the numeric integration to calculate the probability of failure requires many function evaluations. One of the first approaches employed approximation concepts to integrate the probability of failure. The classical first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM) are still popular. Professor Ramana Grandhi used appropriate normalized variables about the most probable point of failure, found by a two-point adaptive nonlinear approximation to improve the accuracy and efficiency. [[Southwest Research Institute]] has figured prominently in the development of RBO, implementing state-of-the-art reliability methods in commercial software. RBO has reached sufficient maturity to appear in commercial structural analysis programs like Altair's [[OptiStruct|Optistruct]] and MSC's [[Nastran]].

Utility-based probability maximization (Bordley and Pollock, Operations Research, Sept, 2009, pg.1262) was developed in response to some logical concerns (e.g., Blau's Dilemma) with reliability-based design optimization. This approach focuses on maximizing the joint probability of both the objective function exceeding some value and of all the constraints being satisfied.  When there is no objective function, utility-based probability maximization reduces to a probability-maximization problem.   When there are no uncertainties in the constraints, it reduces to a constrained utility-maximization problem.  (This second equivalence arises because the utility of a function can always be written as the probability of that function exceeding some random variable.)   Because it changes the constrained optimization problem associated with reliability-based optimization into an unconstrained optimization problem, it often leads to computationally more tractable problem formulations.

In the marketing field there is a huge literature about optimal design for multiattribute products and services, based on experimental analysis to estimate models of consumers' utility functions. These methods are known as [[Conjoint analysis|Conjoint Analysis]]. Respondents are presented with alternative products, measuring preferences about the alternatives using a variety of scales and the utility function is estimated with different methods (varying from regression and surface response methods to choice models). The best design is formulated after estimating the model. The experimental design is usually optimized to minimize the variance of the estimators. These methods are widely used in practice.

==Problem formulation==

Problem formulation is normally the most difficult part of the process.  It is the selection of design variables, constraints, objectives, and models of the disciplines.  A further consideration is the strength and breadth of the interdisciplinary coupling in the problem.

===Design variables===

A design variable is a specification that is controllable from the point of view of the designer.  For instance, the thickness of a structural member can be considered a design variable.  Another might be the choice of material.  Design variables can be continuous (such as a wing span), discrete (such as the number of ribs in a wing), or boolean (such as whether to build a monoplane or a [[biplane]]).  Design problems with continuous variables are normally solved more easily.

Design variables are often bounded, that is, they often have maximum and minimum values.  Depending on the solution method, these bounds can be treated as constraints or separately.

One of the important variables that needs to be accounted is an uncertainty. Uncertainty, often referred to as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to lack of knowledge or incomplete information. Uncertainty is essentially unknown variable but it may causes the failure of system.

===Constraints===

A constraint is a condition that must be satisfied in order for the design to be feasible.  An example of a constraint in aircraft design is that the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a wing must be equal to the weight of the aircraft.  In addition to physical laws, constraints can reflect resource limitations, user requirements, or bounds on the validity of the analysis models.  Constraints can be used explicitly by the solution algorithm or can be incorporated into the objective using [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

===Objectives===

An objective is a numerical value that is to be maximized or minimized.  For example, a designer may wish to maximize profit or minimize weight.  Many solution methods work only with single objectives.  When using these methods, the designer normally weights the various objectives and sums them to form a single objective.  Other methods allow multiobjective optimization, such as the calculation of a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto front]].

===Models===

The designer must also choose models to relate the constraints and the objectives to the design variables.  These models are dependent on the discipline involved.  They may be empirical models, such as a [[regression analysis]] of aircraft prices, theoretical models, such as from [[computational fluid dynamics]], or reduced-order models of either of these.  In choosing the models the designer must trade off fidelity with analysis time.

The multidisciplinary nature of most design problems complicates model choice and implementation.  Often several iterations are necessary between the disciplines in order to find the values of the objectives and constraints.  As an example, the aerodynamic loads on a wing affect the structural deformation of the wing.  The structural deformation in turn changes the shape of the wing and the aerodynamic loads.  Therefore, in analysing a wing, the aerodynamic and structural analyses must be run a number of times in turn until the loads and deformation converge.

===Standard form===

Once the design variables, constraints, objectives, and the relationships between them have been chosen, the problem can be expressed in the following form:

: find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;  that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x})\leq\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}\leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{x}_{ub} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is an objective, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of design variables, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of inequality constraints, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of equality constraints, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{ub}&lt;/math&gt; are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the design variables.  Maximization problems can be converted to minimization problems by multiplying the objective by -1.  Constraints can be reversed in a similar manner.  Equality constraints can be replaced by two inequality constraints.

==Problem solution==

The problem is normally solved using appropriate techniques from the field of optimization.  These include [[gradient]]-based algorithms, population-based algorithms, or others.  Very simple problems can sometimes be expressed linearly; in that case the techniques of [[linear programming]] are applicable.

===Gradient-based methods===
*[[Adjoint equation]]
*[[Newton's method]]
*[[Steepest descent]]
*[[Conjugate gradient]]
*[[Sequential quadratic programming]]

===Gradient-free methods===
* Hooke-Jeeves pattern search
* [[Nelder-Mead method]]

===Population-based methods===
*[[Genetic algorithm]]
*[[Memetic algorithm]]
*[[Particle swarm optimization]]
*[[Harmony search]]
*ODMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|title=ODMA: a novel swarm-evolutionary metaheuristic optimizer inspired by open source development model and communities|author1=Hossein Hajipour|author2=Hamed Behzadi Khormuji|author3=Habib Rostami|doi=10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|journal=Soft Comput|year=2016|volume=20|page=727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
*Random search
*[[Grid search]]
*[[Simulated annealing]]
*[[Brute-force search|Direct search]]
*[[IOSO]] (Indirect Optimization based on Self-Organization)

Most of these techniques require large numbers of evaluations of the objectives and the constraints.  The disciplinary models are often very complex and can take significant amounts of time for a single evaluation.  The solution can therefore be extremely time-consuming.  Many of the optimization techniques are adaptable to [[parallel computing]].  Much current research is focused on methods of decreasing the required time.

Also, no existing solution method is guaranteed to find the [[global optimization|global optimum]] of a general problem (see [[No free lunch in search and optimization]]). Gradient-based methods find local optima with high reliability but are normally unable to escape a local optimum.  Stochastic methods, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, will find a good solution with high probability, but very little can be said about the mathematical properties of the solution.  It is not guaranteed to even be a local optimum.  These methods often find a different design each time they are run.

The '''National Science and Ecclesiology Museum at Maynooth''' is a [[science museum]] and museum of ecclesiology, located on the joint campus of [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth]] and [[Maynooth University]] (the southern campus of the university), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is an institution of the college, having begun as an ecclesiological museum.

The museum was founded in 1934 as the Museum of Ecclesiology in what was then simply [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|St. Patrick's College]], with Dr. William Moran, Professor of Dogmatic Theology, as its first curator. After Moran resigned in 1942, the Very Rev. Dr. Patrick J McLaughlin (then Professor of Experimental Physics and later Vice-President of the College) was appointed as curator. Moran oversaw the transferral of much of Callan's apparatus, which are now on display, into the museum, a process that was completed by his successor, Rev. Dr.  [[Michael T. Casey|Michael Casey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maynoothcollege.ie/national-museum-maynooth/|title=National Museum Maynooth {{!}} Just another WordPress site|website=maynoothcollege.ie|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The museum has two main collections: a collection of scientific instruments associated with [[Nicholas Callan]] and a collection of [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical artifacts]].
The Callan collection is significant because it includes the first induction coil,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/national-science-museum-st-patricks-college-maynooth-ireland|title=BSHS Travel Guide - National Science Museum, St. Patrick’s College, Maynooth, Ireland|website=www.bshs.org.uk|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; invented by Callan in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sentex.net/~mec1995/circ/hv/classic/classic.html|title=The Classic Induction Coil, Induction, Coils, HV|website=www.sentex.net|access-date=2016-04-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030062249/http://www.sentex.net/~mec1995/circ/hv/classic/classic.html|archivedate=2016-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of his other [[induction coil]]s, including his giant induction coil (pictured) which he created in 1845, which produced 600,000 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Apparatus of Nicholas Callan and other Historic Instruments|last=Mollan|first=Charles|last2=Upton|first2=John|publisher=St. Patrick's Colleg Maynooth and Samton  Limited|year=1994|isbn=1-898706-02-6|location=Dublin|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two coils in this invention, the primary coil and the secondary coil.  Over twenty miles of wires in the induction coil were hand-insulated with bees wax.  Callan used [[seminarians]] holding hands touching the coil to measure the strength of the current.  The current passed through the seminarians and Callan judged its strength by the height the seminarians jumped.&lt;ref name="RTE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en-ie.radioline.co/podcast-rte-icons-of-irish-science|title=RTÉ - Icons of Irish Science podcast online, show, free|website=Radioline|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with a local blacksmith to create the large [[electromagnet]] (pictured) in 1836.

The collection contains a number of documents and books, including a royal patent for [[galvanization]].&lt;ref name="RTE"/&gt;

There is also a large holding of nineteenth century batteries in the museum.  Other items of note in the collection include a Norremberg [[Polarimetry|polariscope]], a nineteenth century polarizing microscope, and the first portable GPS device (pictured below).

The museum's ecclesiastical collection includes a set of priestly vestments including a set of robes commissioned under the royal patronage of [[Marie Antoinette]].  They include an old Ecce Homo (12C) and a leaf of an ivory [[diptych]] (14C, Northern France).  In addition there are a number of altar stones.  Also of historical note is a statue of Jesus that was defaced by [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian soldiers]] during the Siege of Drogheda in 1649.

Navigation instruments are also to be found in the museum, namely several [[octant (instrument)|octants]] and [[sextant]]s which were the life blood of navigation on the seas. These instruments are used to fix the position of a ship on the ocean. The octant was a hand-held instrument,with mirrors, used to look at the line of the horizon, take the measurements from the marked scale, and use sea charts to calculate your position. The year 1731 saw the Hadley octant improved in design to become the forerunner of the modern sextant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61iflan.htm|title=The History of the Sextant|website=www.mat.uc.pt|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The octant inscribed with the name 'Yeates' in the collection appears to refer to a George Yeates, active from 1826-1858.

'''''NetGuide''''' is a live news website with weekly email newsletters dedicated to New Zealand consumers, covering technology news, product reviews and buying advice. NetGuide is the largest site in the Techday network.

==History and profile==
''NetGuide'' was launched in September 1996 by an independent [[Auckland]]-based publisher, then owned by [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP) 2003 to 2008, then shifted to Action Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10522294|title=ACP Media to sell NetGuide magazine|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now owned exclusively by Techday Ltd. Originally entirely internet focused, it developed to cover wider computer, telecommunications, and technology issues. 
The magazine competed with [[International Data Group|IDG]]'s ''[[PC World (magazine)|New Zealand PC World]]'' and ran the annual ''NetGuide Web Awards''.&lt;ref name="nzsales"&gt;[http://www.techday.com/webawards/ NetGuide "WebAwards"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, NetGuide and the entire Techday network discontinued all print publications and moved to exclusively online content. 

In April 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://futurefive.co.nz/story/futurefive-rebrand-anniversary-2000-epic-giveaway-week/|title=FutureFive rebrand anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, NetGuide was renamed as FutureFive NZ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://futurefive.co.nz/story/what-is-futurefive-and-why-should-you-care/|title=We bring you the future today: Why NetGuide changed its name|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Australian edition==
The magazine launched a version for the Australian market, ''[[Australian NetGuide]]'', which ran 1996–2009. It competed with [[NineMSN]]'s ''[[Australian Personal Computer|apc]]'' and IDG's ''[[PC World (magazine)|Australian PC World]]''. Now, Australian news is integrated into Netguide's New Zealand website, or published under one of Techday's Australian brands: IT Brief Australia, SecurityBrief Australia, or ChannelLife Australia.

• No pure culture isolated or available for Prokayotes.&lt;br/&gt;
• Not validly published because the effective publication only documents deposit of the type strain in a single recognized culture collection.&lt;br/&gt;
• Not approved and published by the [[International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology]]  or the [[International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology]] (IJSB/IJSEM).

'''Repetitive Control''' is a control method developed by a group of [[Japan]]ese scholars in 1980s. It is based on the [[Internal model (motor control)|Internal Model Principle]] and used specifically in dealing with [[periodic signal]]s, for example, tracking periodic reference or rejecting periodic disturbances. The repetitive control system has been proven to be a very effective and practical method dealing with periodic signals.&lt;ref name=PPT&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview on Repetitive  Control --- what are the  issues and where does it  lead to?|url=http://wiener.kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yy/Papers/RepetitiveControldocfin.pdf|work=Yutaka Yamamoto|accessdate=22 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006211955/http://wiener.kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yy/Papers/RepetitiveControldocfin.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PPT2&gt;{{cite web|title=Iterative Learning Control, Delays and Repetitive Control|url=http://www.enm.bris.ac.uk/anm/workshop-a/programme/control-talks/owens.pdf|work=David Owens and Jari Hätönen*|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive control has some similarities with [[iterative learning control]]. The differences between these two methods can be found in [Wang, Gao, and Doyle. 2009].

'''Scientistic materialism''' is a philosophical stance which posits a limited definition of [[consciousness]] to that which is observable and subject to the [[scientific method]]. The term is used as a pejorative by proponents of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]].

==History==
The "[[Wedge Document]]" produced by the [[Discovery Institute]], described "materialism" as denial of "the proposition that human beings are created in the image of God," and that humans are instead "animals or machines who inhabited a universe ruled by purely impersonal forces and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the unbending forces of biology, chemistry and environment." The document states that materialism leads inevitably to "[[moral relativism]]" and denounce its "stifling dominance" in modern culture. By this definition, scientific materialism is linked to the more general version of [[materialism]] which declares that the physical world is the only thing that exists and that nothing [[supernatural]] exists.

[[File:SomersetSpaceWalk-The Sun (open side).jpg|thumb|right|The walk begins here: the Sun model at Higher Maunsel Lock]]
The '''Somerset Space Walk''' is a [[sculpture trail]] model of the [[Solar System]], located in [[Somerset]], England. The model uses the [[towpath]] of the {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=off|sing=on}} [[Bridgwater and Taunton Canal]] to display a model of the [[Sun]] and its planets in their proportionally correct sizes and distances apart. Unusually for a [[Solar System model]], there are two sets of planets.

Aware of the inadequacies of printed pictures of the Solar System, the Space Walk was designed by [[inventor]] Pip Youngman as a way of challenging our perceptions of space and experiencing the vastness of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=SCC_2&gt;{{cite web| title = Services Directory – Canal Walks | publisher = [[Somerset County Council]] | date = | url = http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/public/services/directory/service?rid=/wpccontent/Sites/SCC/Web%20Pages/Services/Services/Environment/Canal%20walks | accessdate = 20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The model is built to a scale of 1:530,000,000,&lt;ref name=PlutoPic&gt;From the inscription on the Pluto model ([http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/2334/4420/1600/320221/BL_Space.jpg photo of Pluto sculpture at Taunton end])&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that one millimetre on the model equates to 530 kilometres. The Sun is sited at Higher Maunsel Lock, and one set of planets is installed in each direction along the canal towards [[Taunton]] and [[Bridgwater]]; the distance between the Sun and each model of [[Pluto]] being {{Convert|11|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=SCC_2 /&gt; For less hardy walkers, the inner planets are within {{Convert|67|m|ft}} of the Sun, and near to the Maunsel Canal Centre (and tea shop) at Lower Maunsel Lock, where a more detailed leaflet about the model is available.&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet /&gt;

The Space Walk was opened on 9&amp;nbsp;August 1997 by British [[astronomer]] [[Heather Couper]].&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngman |first=Pip |title=Somerset Space Walk leaflet |url=http://www.hiddensomerset.com/docs/somerset_spacewalk_leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Taunton Solar Model Group |accessdate=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165218/http://www.hiddensomerset.com/docs/somerset_spacewalk_leaflet.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a project team from Somerset County Council refurbished some of the models.

==Background==
[[File:Somerset Space Walk Sun 2.jpg|thumb|right|Maunsel Lock, showing the model of the Sun at the centre of the two sets of planets]]
The Walk is a joint venture between the Taunton Solar Model Group &lt;!--no web presence, don't wikilink--&gt; and [[British Waterways]], with support from [[Somerset County Council]], [[Taunton Deane]] Borough Council and the [[Somerset Waterways Development Trust]].&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet /&gt; The Taunton Solar Model Group comprised Pip Youngman, Trevor Hill – a local physics teacher who had been awarded the title of "[[Institute of Physics]] (IOP) Physics Teacher of the Year"&lt;ref name=SCGazette /&gt; – and David Applegate who, during his time as Mayor of Taunton, had expressed a wish to see some kind of science initiative in the area. Pip came up with the idea for the Space Walk, and Trevor assisted by calculating the respective positions and sizes of the planets.

Funding for the project came from the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), the initial advertising leaflet was paid for by the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] (PPARC) and there was also a small grant from [[Sustrans]], who fund art installations along cyclepaths, to deal with maintenance requirements in the years before Somerset County Council took on that responsibility. In order to apply for the COPUS funding Youngman needed two 'sponsors', so he wrote to [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (a local boy himself, then living in Sri Lanka) and [[Patrick Moore]], who both wrote warm letters in support. Arthur C Clarke's brother Fred read out his letter at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="SCGazette"&gt;{{cite news|title=Space Walk launched|newspaper=Somerset County Gazette|date=15 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RMC Group|ReadyMix Concrete]] supplied the concrete for the plinths, and [[Avimo]] (now part of [[Thales Group]]), a local defence contractor, supplied the steel for the models.&lt;!--Note for EdJogg: Refs for PPARC and COPUS are on the Space Walk leaflets!--&gt;

==Individual models==
[[File:Bathpool - Canal and Neptune.jpg|thumb|right|The model of [[Uranus]] in its setting beside the canal at Bathpool.]]
[[File:Somerset Space Walk Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|The model of [[Jupiter]]]]
The model of the [[Sun]] is a {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}-wide 14-ton concrete sphere,&lt;ref name=SCGazette /&gt; with a vertical segment removed to give two vertical faces upon which explanatory plates are mounted. The solid sphere was cast by Pip Youngman and Trevor Hill in the grounds of what was the [[SWEB]] storage yard adjacent to the Obridge Viaduct in [[Taunton]]. Originally 'natural' in colour (matching the other models) it was painted yellow as part of the refurbishment, making it much more visible.

Each of the smallest planet models is contained within a round-topped concrete plinth about {{convert|1|m|ft}} high. The stainless steel model is held inside a circular hole through the side of the plinth; hence the model of the planet may be viewed by looking through the hole. The plinths were created by Youngman using fibreglass moulds which he had also made.

The models of the largest [[gas giant]]s, [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], are moulded as part of the top face of the concrete pillars. Originally concrete-coloured, they have been painted as part of the refurbishment.

Each pillar doubles-up as a [[milepost]]: the distance to [[Bridgwater]] and [[Taunton]] is cast in the concrete at ground level – below a depiction of the [[British Waterways]] 'bridge' logo – although the sculptures are sited according to the spacings needed for the model, and not at kilometre increments for the convenience of boaters.

On each pillar is a plaque containing a short inscription describing the planet. The Earth inscription reads:

{{cquote|"Earth orbits far enough from the heat of the Sun for water to be liquid, near enough not to freeze, for air to be a gas and earth a solid. With gravity strong enough to hold our atmosphere, gentle enough to allow delicate life forms. Rotating to give our day and night, tilted to give the four seasons. Enormous to us, tiny on the cosmic scale. Our home, unique, beautiful, fragile." – ''Pip Youngman'' &lt;ref&gt;Caption may be read on [[:File:Somerset Space Walk Earth.jpg|photograph of model]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Nearest star==
The installation does not include a model of the [[nearest star]] for comparison, as this would be impossible. On the same scale as the other models, the nearest star ([[Proxima Centauri]], which is about one-seventh the size of the Sun) would need to be a red ball {{convert|37.5|cm|in}} in diameter&lt;ref&gt;[Calculated as one-seventh the size of the Sun: 2.63 ÷ 7 = 0.375]&lt;/ref&gt; sited {{convert|76,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;[Calculated as 270,000 x distance from Earth to Sun (270,000 x 1.496x10^8 km) ÷ 530,000,000 = 76,000km &lt;br /&gt;{{pad|2em}}(where 1:530,000,000 is the scale of the model)]&lt;/ref&gt; away (roughly twice the circumference of [[Earth]]).&lt;!--
[Assumption]: An information panel on the Sun model indicates the size and distance of the nearest star.

==Pip Youngman==
The Space Walk's designer, Philip Robert Vassar Youngman&lt;!--insufficient web presence to wikilink yet--&gt; (born: 26 August 1924, Hunstanton, Norfolk – died: 23 May 2007, Taunton, Somerset), known as 'Pip', was a designer and inventor of mechanical apparatus. Around 1969, Youngman was approached by the [[Open University]] to adapt a mechanical calculator he had designed, originally prototyped in [[Lego]], into a product suitable for school use. The result was the "Ball Operated Binary Calculator And Tutor" (BOBCAT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BOBCAT | work =  | publisher = Allard's Computer Museum, Groningen | date =  | url = http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/bobcat/bobcat.html | accessdate = 2009-03-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090228065606/http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/bobcat/bobcat.html | archivedate = 28 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical model for teaching binary arithmetic and the inner workings of the computer, using ball bearings for binary data bits and plastic levers for the calculating logic.&lt;!--and manufactured by E J Arnold--&gt;

==Location==
The trail can be walked either from Taunton's [[Brewhouse Theatre]] to Maunsel Lock ([[Pluto]] to the Sun) or from Bridgwater's Morrison's Supermarket to Maunsel Lock (also Pluto to the Sun) or of course, vice versa.

'''''The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature''''' is a [[popular science]] book by [[Matt Ridley]] exploring the [[evolutionary psychology]] of [[sexual selection]].  ''The Red Queen'' was one of seven books shortlisted for the 1994 [[Rhône-Poulenc Prize]] (now known as the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books]]), that was eventually won by [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]]' ''[[The Language of the Genes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists], The Royal Society website&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridley argues that few, if any, aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of [[evolution]], driven by [[sexual reproduction]] in the case of [[sexual selection in human evolution]].

==Summary==
The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive "[[head start (positioning)|head start]]" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.

Toward the end of the book Ridley argues that human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. He argues that human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the [[peacock]]'s tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection.  Human intelligence, he suggests, is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.  This view of Intelligence is treated at length in [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller's]] ''The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature'' (2001).

'''''The Science of Life''''' is a book written by [[H. G. Wells]], [[Julian Huxley]] and [[G. P. Wells]], published in three volumes by The Waverley Publishing Company Ltd&lt;ref&gt;not verified, but probably a subsidiary of Amalgamated Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1929–30, giving a popular account of all major aspects of biology as known in the 1920s. It has been called "the first modern textbook of biology"&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the best popular introduction to the biological sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Jean Mackenzie, ''H.G. Wells: A Biography'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Wells's most recent biographer notes that ''The Science of Life'' "is not quite as dated as one might suppose."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In undertaking ''The Science of Life,'' H. G. Wells, who had published ''[[The Outline of History]]'' a decade earlier, selling over two million copies, desired the same sort of treatment for biology. He thought of his readership as "the intelligent lower middle classes . . . [not] idiots, half-wits . . . greenhorns, religious fanatics . . . smart women or men who know all that there is to be known."&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Jean Mackenzie, ''H.G. Wells: A Biography'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Huxley, the grandson of [[T. H. Huxley]] under whom Wells had studied biology, and his son "Gip," a zoologist, divided the initial writing between them; H.G. Wells revised, dealt (with the help of his literary agent, A.P. Watt) with publishers, and acted as a strict taskmaster, often obliging his collaborators to sit down and work together and keeping them on a tight schedule.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; (H.G. Wells had begun the book during his wife's final illness and is said to have used work on the book as a way to keep his mind off his loss.)&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Jean Mackenzie, ''H.G. Wells: A Biography'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), pp. 352, 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text as published is presented as the common work of a "triplex author."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: Literary Guild, 1934), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; H.G. Wells took 40% of the royalties; the remainder was split between Huxley and Wells's son.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, H.G. Wells left his rights in the book to G.P. Wells.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Huxley gave up his chair of Zoology at [[King's College, London]] to concentrate on the work.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=Huxley, Sir Julian Sorell|first=Robert |last=Olby |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31271}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thanks to the success of the book, Huxley was able to give up teaching and devote himself to administration and experimental science.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was originally serialised in 31 fortnightly parts, published in 3 volumes in 1929–30 and in a single volume in 1931. The volume includes more than 300 illustrations.  It was a great success, though the stock market crash and subsequent depression held back sales, in part because of declining memberships in book clubs.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said of Book Four (''The How and Why of Development and Evolution'') that it "offers perhaps the clearest, most readable, succinct and informative popular account of the subject ever penned. It was here that [Huxley] first expounded his own version of what later developed into the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary synthesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Olby R. in Waters, C. Kenneth and Van Helden, Albert (eds) 1993. ''Julian Huxley: biologist and statesman of science''. Rice University Press, Houston.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Science of Life'' is also notable for its introduction of modern ecological concepts. It is also notable for its emphasis on the importance of [[behaviorism]]&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: Literary Guild, 1934), pp. 1318–25.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carl Gustav Jung|Jung]]'s psychology.&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: Literary Guild, 1934), pp. 1364–68.  However, Wells added: "Let not our criticisms seem to be . . . a belittlement of Freud.  Sigmund Freud's name is as cardinal in the history of human thought as Charles Darwin's" (p. 1368).&lt;/ref&gt;  Toward the end ''The Science of Life'' strays from the scientific to the moral realm and devotes a chapter (Book Eight, Ch. VIII: "Modern Ideas of Conduct") to practical moral advice to the reader, advising him (the masculine pronoun is used throughout, a universal practice circa 1930): "After his primary duties to himself, the first duty of Mr. Everyman to others is to learn about himself, to acquire poise and make his persona as much of a cultivated gentleman as he can. He has to be considerate. He has to be trustworthy."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: Literary Guild, 1934), pp. 1399–1400.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its last pages, Wells emphasises the lack of "credibility" of personal immortality, and advocates "realization of [one's] participation in a greater being with which he identifies himself," whether this be "the Deity" or "Man."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: Literary Guild, 1934), p. 1475.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication record==
The full details of its publishing record are as follows:

Wells H.G., Huxley Julian S. and Wells G.P. 1929–30. ''The Science of Life: a summary of contemporary knowledge about life and its possibilities''. First issued in 31 fortnightly parts published by Amalgamated Press, 1929–30, bound up in three volumes as publication proceeded. A mail-order version of the book was also published, though this was dropped after the stock market crash.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; First issued in one volume by Cassell in 1931, reprinted 1934, 1937; popular edition, fully revised, with a new preface by H.G. Wells, 1938. Published as separate volumes by Cassell 1934–37: I ''The living body''. II ''Patterns of life'' (1934). III ''Evolution—fact and theory''. IV ''Reproduction, heredity and the development of sex''. V ''The history and adventure of life''. VI ''The drama of life''. VII ''How animals behave'' (1937). VIII ''Man's mind and behaviour''. IX ''Biology and the human race''. Published in New York by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. 1931, 1934, 1939; and by The [[Literary Guild]] in 1934. Three of the Cassell spin-off books were also published by Doubleday in 1932: ''Evolution, fact and theory''; ''The human mind and the behaviour of Man''; ''Reproduction, genetics and the development of sex''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker J.R. and Green J-P. 1978. ''Julian Huxley: Man of science and citizen of the world 1887–1975.'' UNESCO. Bibliography p76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Science of Life'' was translated into French.  During [[World War II]] a one-volume edition designed for use in military classes was issued. As late as 1960 the work was still being used in college classes in the US&lt;ref&gt;David C. Smith, ''H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of historic interest is ''Book Three – The Incontrovertible Fact of Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;this title is an early version of ''Evolution, fact and theory''.&lt;/ref&gt; comprising five chapters; I The fact to be proved, II The evidence in the rocks, III The evidence from plant and animal structure, IV The evidence from the variation and distribution of living things, V The evolution of Man. Considering that this was written less than five years from the [[Scopes Trial]], it is a bold, comprehensive account of the scientific knowledge of evolution at the time. Book Four concentrates on the controversies about evolution concluding that "the broad positions of Darwinism emerge from a scrutiny of the most exacting sort, essentially unchanged."&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=The Science of life|first1=H. G. |last1=Wells|first2=Julian|last2=Huxley|first3=G. P.|last3=Wells|year=1931|page=600|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00600?View=PDFPages}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The section entitled "The Ecological Outlook" anticipates many of the themes of the later [[green movement]], including stressing the importance of reducing pollution and protecting [[endangered species]] from extinction, as well as the importance of alternative power sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sherborne, Michael 2010.

'''''Tomorrowland: Our Journey from Science Fiction to Science Fact''''' is a 2015 [[non-fiction]] book by [[science journalist]] [[Steven Kotler]] and published by [[Amazon Publishing]].

==Content==
The book is composed of a series of essay articles that were published by Kotler in various online news publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', and ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''. There are sixteen chapters made up of the same number of articles, each dealing with a different topic of technological innovation in a variety of fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Constant |first=Paul |date=May 23, 2015 |title=‘Tomorrowland’ (The Book) And the Heartbreak of Prediction |url=http://recode.net/2015/05/23/tomorrowland-the-book-and-the-heartbreak-of-prediction/ |newspaper=[[Re/code]] |access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised Kotler for not just presenting the technological innovations themselves, but also focusing on the "obsessive people behind the science" and how his insight into their work encompasses a "range from humane and gripping stories of redemption to indifferent research scientists unsure if their developments will even make the world a better place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Kirkus Review: Tomorrowland |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/steven-kotler/tomorrowland/ |newspaper=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=March 5, 2015 |access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Library Journal]]'' reviewer Talea Anderson also noted the introduction of each essay and discussed technology focusing on "presenting the array of often quirky inventors and early adopters who have engaged with it" and ultimately recommended the book for readers of [[popular science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Talea |date=April 15, 2015 |title=Review: Tomorrowland: Our Journey from Science Fiction to Science Fact |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=03e0ff25-e224-4864-8732-6f02b39e53a6%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4106 |journal=[[Library Journal]] |publisher=[[Media Source]] |volume=140 |issue=7 |pages=113-114 |issn=0363-0277 |access-date=April 12, 2016}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate review in ''Library Journal'' of the audiobook, reviewer Lisa Youngblood recommended the book and its look at not only the technology, but also the "social and moral questions that arise" from the potential ramifications of the [[emerging technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Youngblood |first=Lisa |date=August 1, 2015 |title=Media Review: Tomorrowland: Our Journey from Science Fiction to Science Fact |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=94ea4742-acd5-49d4-a5be-72e7854ad6a3%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4106 |journal=[[Library Journal]] |publisher=[[Media Source]] |volume=140 |issue=13 |pages=49 |issn=0363-0277 |access-date=April 12, 2016}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
