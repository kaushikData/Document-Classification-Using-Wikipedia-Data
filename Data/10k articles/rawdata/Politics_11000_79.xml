The '''1968 Red Square demonstration''' ({{lang-ru|Демонстра́ция 25 а́вгуста 1968 го́да}}) took place on 25 August 1968 at [[Red Square]], Moscow, [[Soviet Union]], to protest the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968)|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, that occurred during the night of 20–21 August 1968, crushing the [[Prague spring|Prague Spring]], a set of de-centralization reforms promoted by [[Alexander Dubček]].

Many people over the world had protested against the suppression of the [[Prague spring]] with troops of Soviet Union and other countries of the Warsaw Pact. One such act of protest took place in Moscow, at the [[Red Square]]. The protest was held at the [[Lobnoye Mesto]], to avoid any violation of public order that could have occurred during the demonstration. The protesters were sitting to avoid any inconvenience to ordinary citizens which might be caused by them standing, although this appears to have had little effect.

==The protest==
The protest began at noon as eight protesters ([[Larisa Bogoraz]], Konstantin Babitsky, [[Vadim Delaunay]], Vladimir Dremliuga, [[Pavel Litvinov]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Viktor Fainberg]], and Tatiana Baeva) sat at the Lobnoye Mesto and held a small [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] flag and banners with various slogans, including:
* "We are losing our best friends" («мы теряем лучших друзей»),
* "Ať žije svobodné a nezávislé Československo!" (Long live free and independent Czechoslovakia),
* "Shame to the occupiers" («Позор оккупантам!»),
* "Hands off the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|ČSSR]]" («Руки прочь от ЧССР!»),
* "[[For your freedom and ours]]" («За вашу и нашу свободу!»),
* "Freedom for [[Alexander Dubček|Dubček]]" («Свободу Дубчеку!»).

Within a few minutes, seven protesters were assaulted, brutally beaten and loaded into cars by [[KGB]] operatives. The Czechoslovak flag was broken, and the banners were confiscated. Since [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] had recently given birth, she was not made to stand trial. The other protesters convinced 21-year-old Tatiana Baeva to declare that she had been at the scene by accident, and she was released soon after.

The KGB failed to find out which protester was holding which banner; therefore, all the banners were attributed to each protester, except for Tatiana Baeva, who was released. The banners were branded by the KGB as "[[anti-Soviet]]".&lt;ref name="an"&gt;Letter by [[Yuri Andropov]] to [[Central Committee]] about the demonstration, 5 sept. 1968, in the [[Vladimir Bukovsky]]'s archive, (PDF, faximile, in Russian), http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis60/kgb68-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andropov to the Central Committee. The Demonstration in Red Square Against the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia. 20 September 1968, at [[Andrei Sakharov]]'s archive, in Russian and translation into English, {{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/documents_frames/Sakharov_008.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132901/http://yale.edu/annals/sakharov/documents_frames/Sakharov_008.htm |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
During the investigation and trial, the defence revealed several inconsistencies in the accusations.
One of the eyewitnesses declared that he saw protesters leaving the [[GUM (department store)|GUM]], a large store in the vicinity, even though this store is closed on Sundays. Additionally, all eyewitnesses happened to be from the same military division, even though they all claimed that they ended up on Red Square accidentally. However, these inconsistencies were not taken into account during the trial.

None of the demonstrators pleaded guilty. Vadim Delaunay and Vladimir Dremlyuga were sentenced to three years. Victor Fainberg had his teeth knocked out during the arrest; instead of appearing in court, he was sent to a [[psikhushka|psychiatric prison]]. Larisa Bogoraz was sentenced to four years of exile to a remote Siberian settlement in the Irkutsk region. Konstantin Babitsky was sentenced to three years of exile. Pavel Litvinov was sentenced to five years of exile. Natalya Gorbanevskaya was released the same day but was later sent to a psychiatric prison.

==Reaction to the trial and recognition of protesters==
Lawyers for the defence, all members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] who were appointed and paid for by the state, had shown that there was no criminal intent in the demonstration held by the protesters,&lt;ref&gt;Talk by advocate [[Sofia Kallistratova|S.V.Kallistratova]] in defense of [[Vadim Delaunay|V.Delaunay]] (Речь адвоката [[Каллистратова, Софья Васильевна|С.В.Калистратовой]] в защиту [[Делоне, Вадим Николаевич|В.Делоне]]), in Russian. http://www.memo.ru/library/books/sw/chapt49.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but despite this, the protesters received harsh sentences of up to several years in prison.

It was claimed by [[Yuliy Kim]] that the sentences had already been written down before the trial.&lt;ref name="АВка"&gt;[[Yuly Kim]]. Advocat's vals. (Адвокатский вальс), in Russian http://www.memo.ru/library/books/sw/chapt18.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuliy Kim]] wrote the song "Ilyich", which mentions [[Yuri Andropov]]'s and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s anger regarding the demonstration, and names three of the participants: [[Pavel Litvinov]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] and [[Larisa Bogoraz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuily Kim]], "Ya sam sebe Iliich" (in Russian), http://www.bards.ru/archives/part.php?id=6188&lt;/ref&gt;

Public recognition of the protesters had to wait 40 years. During the [[conflict in South Ossetia]], August 2008, the former president of the Czech Republic, [[Václav Havel]], expressed his sympathies for the protesters of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ярошевский, Виталий|title=На Лобном месте|trans-title=On the Lobnoe mesto|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/61/17.html|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=61|date=21 August 2008|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904084029/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/61/17.html|archivedate=4 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech Premier [[Mirek Topolánek]] recognized the heroism of the protesters with awards.&lt;ref&gt;Premier Awarded Commemorative Medals to Ten Dissidents from 1968. Press Release of the government of the Czech Republic, 21 August 2008, http://www.vlada.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=40255&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet, no similar recognition is reported from the side of the Russian government. Instead, 24 August 2008, the [[2008 Red Square demonstration|similar demonstration]] with the slogan [[For your freedom and ours]] happened at the same place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/25/europe/25russia.4.php|title= Red Square protest echoes 1968|publisher=[[Gerald Tribune]] |author = Sophia Kishkovsky|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=31 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080913165452/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/25/europe/25russia.4.php| archivedate= 13 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 2013, the 45th anniversary of the demonstration, Gorbanevskaya and several of her friends recreated the original protest,&lt;ref&gt;Photograph from 2013 recreation of the protest, from Gorbanevskaya's Livejournal blog, http://ng68.livejournal.com/2062987.html{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; again featuring the "For your freedom and ours" banner. Ten participants (among them Delaunay's son Sergey) were arrested almost immediately, brutally beaten and taken to a police station. They were soon arraigned and released pending court appearance on charges of failing to secure prior permission for a political rally,&lt;ref&gt;"Police release all Red Square detainees", in Russian, "Lenta" news stream, 25 August 2013 http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/25/redsquare/&lt;/ref&gt; a misdemeanor under current Russian law.

{{History of Thailand}}
In 2005 and 2006, a series of events occurred in [[Thailand]] as a result of an unrest with [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] that was supported by Sondhi Limthongkul and his coalitions. It led a military coup that concluded in the overthrow of the [[Thai Rak Thai]] government in September 2006, the flight of Thaksin after the court verdict, and the establishment of the junta government led by [[Surayud Chulanont]], a favourite of privy councillor and senior statesman [[Prem Tinsulanonda]].

The crisis and resulting coup and post-coup military government called into question issues of media freedom, the role of the constitution in breaking a political deadlock, and the existence of political stability in Thailand. It also reflected long-term and significant disparity between urban and rural political orientation and [[abuses of power]] and conflict of interest of a democratically elected leader that have long plagued the Thai political landscape. These issues contributed to the crisis and culminated in the coup d'état of September 2006.

[[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a media mogul who had previously been a staunch supporter of Thaksin, played a major, leading role in the crisis through the establishment of the anti-Thaksin [[People's Alliance for Democracy]]. The PAD aligned itself with several state-enterprise unions (who were against Thaksin's [[privatisation]] plans for state enterprises), human right and civil politics activists who charged Thaksin rule as "undemocratic", monopoly of power, human right abuse, suppressing the freedom of press and [[extrajudicial killings]] of drug traffickers, a main concern among several human right groups.

The crucial anti-Thaksin coalitions were also supporters of the controversial monk Luang Ta Maha Bua (who opposed the Thaksin government's appointment of Somdet Phra [[Buddhacharya]] as acting [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]] in place of the critically ill Somdet Phra [[Yanasangworn]]), allegedly the political intervention of the monastic affairs.

Significant supporters of PAD were also prominent socialists, scholars and "royalists" (who claimed that Thaksin frequently insulted King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]), various factions in the Thai military (who claimed that Thaksin promoted only those who were loyal to him), and various civil groups (who criticised Thaksin for not paying taxes during the [[sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings]], although the capital gains from the transaction were legally exempt from taxation. The movement then was seen highly controversial and complicated.

In February 2006, Thaksin dissolved Parliament and called a [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|general legislative election for the House of Representatives in April 2006]]. Most major opposition parties [[election boycott|boycotted the election]], led by [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]. After the elections, King [[Bhumibol]] requested that the courts resolve the crisis. Soon afterwards, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] invalidated the elections based on the positioning of voting booths, and the Criminal Court later jailed members of the Election Commission that did not obey the Court's request to resign. [[Thai legislative election, October 2006|New elections]] were scheduled for 15 October 2006. This time, the opposition announced it was contesting the election, and numerous newly founded parties actively campaigned. The election was cancelled after a military coup on 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was in New York to attend a United Nations summit. Thaksin has since been in exile. The PAD dissolved itself 2 days after the coup after announcing that their goal had been accomplished, but since then (February 2008) has vowed to resume protests should pro-Thaksin practices and policies of the Samak government become evident.

Apparently, critics on Thaksin Shinawatra took place even before the Sondhi's movement. Severe critics occurred around the Thaksin case of hidden assets, filed to the Constitutional Court. According to the verdict, Thaksin could escape the proof of guilty with 8-7 votes of the judges.

Human right abuses were also the cause of critics. Thaksin's war of drug became controversial when thousands of killings and murder cases explained by the authority as "extrajudicial" and could-be a "revenge" among the drug traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/275/thailandwar.shtml |title=Thailand War on Drugs Turns Murderous, 600 Killed This Month – Human Rights Groups Denounce Death Squads, Executions |publisher=Stopthedrugwar.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the removal and a threat on Sondhi's program, freedom of press became the focus. Sutthichai Yoon, another major critic, was filed a case against. In early 2006, the supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, claimed supported by the premier himself and his close figures, blockaded the entry of the Nation Group building, threatening to "burn" the building. Possibly the movement rallied by Sondhi, then became the focus of several anti-Thaksin groups.

==Origins of the crisis==
[[Image:Thaksin.jpg|thumb|right|Thaksin Shinawatra]]

===Context===
Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] was embroiled in several controversies after assuming power following the [[Thailand legislative election, 2001|2001 election]]. These controversies included alleged conflicts of interest due to his family's holdings in [[Shin Corporation]] and a [[Thaksin Shinawatra#Anti-drug policies|violent crackdown on drug dealers]]. However, none of these controversies caused significant damage to his popularity, and he became the first elected prime minister to serve a full term, subsequently winning re-election in [[Thailand legislative election, 2005|January 2005]].

===Viroj Nualkhair controversy===
The origins of the crisis may be traced to the controversy surrounding [[Viroj Nualkhair]], CEO of state-owned [[Krung Thai Bank]] (KTB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New party, old friends aid Sondhi|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/New-party-old-friends-aid-Sondhi-58371.html|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|date=11 April 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223102534/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/New-party-old-friends-aid-Sondhi-58371.html|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viroj faced pressure to leave his position after KTB reported higher than expected levels of [[non-performing loans]] in 2004. Viroj was vigorously defended by [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a media tycoon who had previously been a staunch Thaksin supporter. As KTB CEO, Viroj had forgiven Sondhi's personal debts by 1.6 billion baht and arranged for further rounds of debt forgiveness. When Viroj was forced out of his position, Sondhi's public criticism of Thaksin started to increase.

===The conflict escalates===

The Sondhi-Thaksin conflict escalated when Sondhi's Channel 11/1 was temporarily ordered to stop broadcasting due to a contract dispute between cable operator UBC and the government regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12552| publisher=Bangkok Post| title=UBC complies, drops channel| date=2 July 2004| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521183901/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12552| archivedate=21 May 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12621| publisher=Bangkok Post| title=UBC to resume televising Channel 11/1| date=8 July 2004| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521183915/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12621| archivedate=21 May 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Sondhi reportedly made repeated disrespectful on-air references to King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Among these references was a claim that the government's 2004 appointment of Somdet Phra [[Kiaw|Buddhacharya]] as acting [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]] in place of the critically ill Somdet Phra [[Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana|Yanasangworn]] contravened the prerogative of the King. According to Thai ecclesiastic law, the Supreme Patriarch is nominated by the [[Sangha Supreme Council]] and formally appointed by the King. Somdet Phra [[Kiaw|Phuthacharn's]] appointment was vehemently opposed by Luang Ta Maha Bua, an influential monk with close affiliations to Sondhi (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Luang Ta Maha Bua incident|Luang Ta Maha Bua's opposition to Thaksin Shinawatra]]). After discussions with King's principal private secretary, Arsa Sarasin, [[MCOT]] executive, removed the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The Nation| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r17.php| title=Ch 9 drops Sondhi for royal references| date=16 September 2005| access-date=18 July 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907025153/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r17.php| archive-date=7 September 2006| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The Bangkok Post| url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,854,0,0,1,0| title=Monastic feud could lead to a schism| date= 5 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Judiciary under the 1997 Constitution===
The Administrative and Constitutional Courts (the first in Thai history) were set up to be based on the French and Italian judicial system, where the judge has direct authority and supervises the investigation into the facts of the case. This is in contrast to the civil and criminal justice systems in Thailand (and most countries) based on the role of a judge as the one who examines the case based solely on the arguments of the prosection and defence attorneys. The administrative court was set up to resolve complaints against the misconduct, neglect or outright abuse by bureaucratic and government agencies. The constitution court was set up to resolve conflicts about unconstitutional legislation.

Apparently the drafters of the 1997 Constitution, one of the most "democratic" constitutions, were quite far sighted by putting in a mechanism to resolve abuses and misconduct by people in authority. But then the Constitutional Court was initially not seen as important, and few anticipated the nature of potential conflicts in legislation could be critical. So the more experienced judges did not see any prestige in taking up position within that judiciary.

Their oversight became glaring when Thaksin's 1st Asset Concealment case was brought to the Constitutional Court. His TRT party had just won the popular vote by a historic majority, but he had not completely disclosed his assets as required by the law. A false asset disclosure would normally disqualify someone from taking up any political post for five years. But he pleaded with tears in his eyes that it was just a clerical error. The judges voted narrowly by a 7–8 margin, allowing Thaksin to take up the office of Prime Minister. Thaksin himself claimed that people had overwhelmingly voted for his party and his wealth was distributed in many assets that the clerical error could probably be an "honest mistake".

==Luang Ta Maha Bua incident==
On 27 September 2005, ''[[Manager Daily]]'' published a sermon by [[Luang Ta Maha Bua]], a popular but controversial monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=th:เทวทัตยังรู้โทษ|url=http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9480000132593|publisher=[[Manager Daily]]|accessdate=12 February 2014|author=[[Ajahn Maha Bua]]|language=Thai|date=27 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vamvanij|first=Tom|title=Channeling Luangta Maha Bua, sort of|url=http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/?id=198|publisher=Sanpaworn Vamvanij|accessdate=12 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129104330/http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/?id=198|archivedate=29 November 2005|date=10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon, previously the supporter of Thaksin, became extremely critical of his "former disciple". The issue became further controversial because it came from a monk who is one of Thailand's most revered temple abbots (who are above criticism in Buddhist Thailand) and who has organised several huge donations of solid gold to the Thai Treasury after the previous financial crisis. Especially controversial were the following quotes:

''"They complained to me about PM Thaksin and Mr. Visanu and two other people that I don’t remember. This is the big ogre [Thai: ตัวยักษ์ใหญ่], big power. Atrocious power will swallow our country, bite liver and lungs and aim for the presidency....He will put a torch to the country. He will never listen....This savagery and atrocity appear in every aspect of him.... All he has are things to be used for burning."''

''"He is clearly aiming for the presidency now. The monarch trampled, the religion trampled, the country trampled, by this savage and atrocious power in a few people in the government circle. That is the circle of ogres, of ghosts, of trolls, of demons [Thai:ยักษ์วงผีวงเปรตวงมาร], all in there....So even [[Devadatta]] saw the harm he caused, and he was rewarded for his good deed. He would attain Buddhahood [Thai:พระปัจเจกพุทธเจ้า]. For those who have made mistakes, if we see the harm we cause, we can still get by. But what is it with Thailand? What kind of governance?"

''"They even dare to accuse Luangta Maha Bua of playing politics. Politics, dog shit [Thai:การบ้านการเมืองขี้หมาอะไร]. There’s only shit all over the country. I brought Buddha’s [[dharma]] to cleanse in order for them to repent and recognise good and evil. Because they’re the government. The world flatters them as smart people, but don’t be smart down the toilet [Thai:แต่อย่าฉลาดลงส้วมลงถาน]. Don’t be smart about putting a torch to the head of everyone in the country, from Nation, Religion, and Monarchy on down. These guys will get burned unless they recognise the truth. I’m saddened by all this. How does this come about?"''

On 11 October 2005, Thaksin sued ''Manager'' newspaper for THB 500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r24.php| title=DEFAMATION LAWSUITS: Luangta Bua escapes PM's legal wrath| publisher=The Nation| date=11 October 2005| accessdate=21 September 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908014014/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r24.php| archive-date=8 September 2006| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As monks have traditionally been above criticism, Thaksin did not sue Luang Ta Maha Bua. "This is an exercise of an individual's right to protect his reputation and privacy. The newspaper did not criticise the prime minister fairly as a public official, but rather it took him to task personally, using harsh words, which was damaging to him," Thana Benjathikul, Thaksin's lawyer said.

Thaksin was immediately attacked by critics and accused of gagging the press. ''Manager'' owner [[Sondhi Limthongkul]]'s lawyer, Suwat Apaipakdi, quoting claimed that "every newspaper reproduced his [Luang Ta Maha Bua] comments. Why did Thaksin not sue him [Luang Ta Maha Bua]? He chose to sue only the Manager Media Group because it's linked to Khun Sondhi". Thaksin's legal team noted that other newspapers only published selected passages of the sermon, and furthermore, that a slanderous headline was used. Respected civil rights lawyer Thongbai Thongpao has noted that Thaksin's lawsuit did have merit. He added that the lawsuits "do not constitute an attack on freedom of the press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GK02Ae01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: Southeast Asia news and business from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2 November 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as 14 March 2006, Luang Ta Maha Bua has asked Thaksin to resign. In a sermon that the monk called "most vehement since the temple was set up," the monk said it was time for Thaksin to abandon the "rotten system he is presiding over". He described the government as "wicked, corrupt, power-hungry and greedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luangta Maha Bua asks Thaksin to resign|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Luangta-Maha-Bua-asks-Thaksin-to-resign-20002208.html|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|date=7 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223102537/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Luangta-Maha-Bua-asks-Thaksin-to-resign-20002208.html|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple of the Emerald Buddha incident==
[[Image:Emerald buddha.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Emerald Buddha]]
On 10 April 2005, Thaksin Shinawatra presided over a "secret" and "private" [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit-making]] ceremony at the [[Wat Phra Kaew|Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], the holiest site in Thai [[Buddhism]].

Starting October 2005, the website of [[Phoochatkarn newspaper]] ran an article alleging that the Prime Minister had usurped the Royal powers of the King by presiding over the ceremony. This blast, referring to a photo printed in [[The Nation Multimedia]] newspaper, led [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], the owner of Phoochatkarn, to start using "We Love the King", "We Will Fight for the King", and "Return Power to the King" as his key anti-Thaksin rallying slogans. This allegation has been repeated in Sondhi's "Thailand Weekly" live tapings. It also became a staple of the Thailand-insider.com website of [[Ekkayuth Anchanbutr]], a notable critic of Thaksin. A widely circulated spam email showed a picture of Thaksin sitting on a chair normally used by the King and asking "People are familiar with images only of the King and members of the Royal Family, all dressed in royal uniforms and decorated with full regalia, presiding over grand ceremonies in the temple’s main chapel. Yet this picture makes me think: What has happened to our country?".

On 9 November 2005, Cabinet secretary-general Bovornsak Uwanno claimed that King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] granted permission to Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to preside over a grand merit-making ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/10/national/index.php?news=national_19114638.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402162255/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/10/national/index.php?news=national_19114638.html |archive-date=2 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was corroborated by Chaktham Thammasak, who was director-general of the Bureau of National Buddhism during the time of the incident. Chaktham claims that the Royal Household Bureau designed every aspect of the ceremony, including the positioning of the chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/11/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19127252.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402143726/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/11/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19127252.html |archive-date=2 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2005, the Civil Court issued a gag order on Sondhi to prevent him from making further allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/17/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19189415.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402161855/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/17/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19189415.html |archive-date=2 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This immediately prompted academics and intellectuals to attack Thaksin and accuse him of restricting press freedom. In November 2005, General Kittisak Ratprasert, former chief aide-de-camp to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, filed a complaint at Phra Ratchawang police station alleging that Thaksin and his deputy Visanu Krue-ngarm committed [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]] at the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2bangkok.com/high2005.shtml |title=High tension in Thailand – 2005 |publisher=2Bangkok.com |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These charges have apparently been quietly dropped after King Bhumibol Adulyadej's birthday speech where he claimed he didn't take lèse majesté charges seriously. However, to this day, Sondhi still uses "We Will Fight for the King" and "Return Power to the King" as rallying cries in his anti-Thaksin protests.

==Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident==
[[Image:Thai 4 Buddies.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Erawan shrine's Brahma ([[Phra phom|Phra Phrom]]) statue]]
In the early hours of 21 March 2006, [[Thanakorn Pakdeepol]], 27, broke into the Phra Phrom [[Erawan Shrine]] in central Bangkok and attacked the statue of the god Brahma with a hammer. After destroying the statue, he was attacked and beaten to death by several people in the vicinity. Thanakorn Pakdeepol had a history of mental illness and depression. Thai police are still investigating the case but it became complicated as the wrongdoer was beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/22/headlines/headlines_20003314.php |title=Man beaten to death after desecrating the Erawan Shrine |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=22 March 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820161638/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/22/headlines/headlines_20003314.php |archive-date=20 August 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robin33.blogspot.com/2006/03/angel-has-taken-flight-from-city.html |title=robin's karma: The angel has taken flight from the city |publisher=Robin33.blogspot.com |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an anti-Thaksin rally on 22 March, protest-leader [[Sondhi Limthongkul]] claimed that [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] masterminded the destruction of the idol to replace Brahma with a "dark force" aligned to Thaksin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/4/2/focus/13836842&amp;sec=focus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531011055/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F4%2F2%2Ffocus%2F13836842&amp;sec=focus |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 May 2008 |title=Dreaded day dawns – despite lies and dark forces |publisher=Thestar.com.my |accessdate=30 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sondhi claimed that Thaksin hired Thanakorn through a [[Cambodia|Khmer]] [[black magic]] [[shaman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/23/politics/politics_20003410.php |title=Vandal's dad distraught |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120012349/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/23/politics/politics_20003410.php |archive-date=20 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sondhi also questioned "why was the man stomped to death after he smashed the statue? I have in-depth information about someone who is deeply obsessed with superstition[referring to Thaksin]. He wants to destroy Thao Maha Phrom so that he can rebuild it by himself and then bury "his stuff" in the statue. This is a way to avert ill omens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/23/headlines/headlines_20003407.php |title=Things to improve from now: Chidchai |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306021604/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/23/headlines/headlines_20003407.php |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vandal's father, [[Sayant Pakdeepol]] called Sondhi "the biggest liar I have ever seen". Thaksin called Sondhi's accusations "insane". To date, Sondhi has refused to make public any details about his "in-depth information" regarding his accusations.

==Personal attacks==
Protesters made many personal attacks against [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. It is debatable whether such attacks had any significant role in his downfall. Among them:
* Senator [[Karoon Sai-ngam]] of [[Buriram Province]] told women to pass photos of Thaksin between their legs and curse Thaksin three times to leave Thailand and flee to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/16/headlines/headlines_20002858.php Has PM turned to black magic?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213731/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/16/headlines/headlines_20002858.php |date=3 March 2016 }}, The Nation, 16 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controversial social critic and winner of the Right Livelihood Award [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] claimed that Thaksin Shinawatra had committed adultery: "As for breaking the Third Precept, I don’t have hard evidence. But there are lots of rumors that Thaksin and his cabinet ministers have engaged in many illicit sexual reveries—that Thaksin has been unfaithful to his wife. There is even a toddler who looks astonishingly like Thaksin. All these still cannot be proven. So we may have to give him the benefit of the doubt. But truths about Thaksin’s notorious sexual life will surely surface after his fall from power—like those of the dictator [[Sarit Thanarat]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sivaraksa|first=Sulak|title=Removing Thaksin Mindfully|url=http://www.sulak-sivaraksa.org/sulak313.php|publisher=Sathirakoses-Nagapradipa Foundation|accessdate=7 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420045415/http://www.sulak-sivaraksa.org/sulak313.php|archivedate=20 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==$1.88 billion Shin Corporation transaction==
{{main article|Thaksin Shinawatra $1.88 billion deal controversy}}

On Monday, 23 January 2006, three days after new [[Thai Telecommunication Act]] (2006) passed on Friday, 20 January, his family sold all stake in [[Shin Corporation]], a leading communication company in Thailand, to [[Temasek Holdings]] with tax liability exemption. The families of Thaksin and his wife netted about 73 billion baht (about US$1.88 billion) tax-free from the buyout, using a regulation that individuals (as opposed to corporations) who sell shares on the stock exchange pay no [[capital gains tax]].

The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the transaction. "The investigation concluded that Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his daughter Pinthongta are clear from all wrongdoing," said SEC secretary-general [[Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala]] on 23 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai PM's son violated disclosure laws: SEC|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060223/1/3ywh2.html|work=[[Yahoo!

"The case is not severe because Panthongtae did inform the SEC but his report was not totally correct" said the SEC's deputy chief Prasong Vinaiphat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand's unions urge support for protest as PM's son fined|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2006-03-10/thailands-unions-urge-support-for-protest-as-pms-son-fined/746574|work=[[Radio Australia|ABC Radio Australia]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=7 February 2014|date=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of insider trading by the Shinawatras, executives, and major shareholders were also investigated. No irregularities were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chanjindamanee|first=Siriporn|title=SET gives Shin, AIS officials clean bill of health|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/06/business/business_30001064.php|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|date=6 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223102651/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/06/business/business_30001064.php|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military junta later reopened the investigations.

The transactions have made the Prime Minister the target of accusations that he was selling an asset of national importance to a foreign entity, and hence selling out his nation. The Democrat party spokesman called Thaksin worse than [[Saddam Hussein]] for not protecting the Thai economy from foreigners: "Dictator Saddam, though a brutal tyrant, still fought the superpower for the Iraqi motherland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/log/261/worse-than-saddam| title=Worse than Saddam| date=28 February 2006| accessdate=21 September 2006| publisher=sanpaworn.vissaventure.com| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027193408/http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/log/261/worse-than-saddam| archivedate=27 October 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matichon.co.th/matichon/matichon_detail.php?s_tag=01p0102300149&amp;day=2006%2F01%2F30 |title=รุกเปิดเจ้าของ"แอมเพิลริช" จี้"แม้ว"ตอบ ยุแก้ลำเลิกใช้มือถือ"เอไอเอส" |accessdate=21 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221205232/http://www.matichon.co.th/matichon/matichon_detail.php?s_tag=01p0102300149&amp;day=2006%2F01%2F30 |archivedate=21 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters, however, counter that Thailand's mobile phone industry is highly competitive, and that little criticism was raised when the Norwegian firm [[Telenor]] acquired [[Total Access Communication]], the country's second largest operator.

==Anti-Thaksin and pro-Thaksin demonstrations==

===Genesis of the demonstrations===
[[Image:From anti-Thaksin demonstration.jpg|thumb|left|An anti-Thaksin protester wearing the anti-Thaksin slogan "Fight for the King." Her shirt is [[royal yellow]], the official colour of the [[People's Alliance for Democracy|PAD]].]]
The prime minister faced growing pressure to resign since the sell-off of his family’s controlling stake in Shin Corporation to [[Temasek Holdings]], the Singapore government's investment agency. Although the SEC's investigation of the transaction cleared Thaksin of all wrongdoing, critics have still accused him of insider trading, use of tax law loopholes, selling out the nation, and other offences.

Anti-Thaksin protesters are largely composed of urban upper/middle class royalist Bangkokians, dubbed the "Blue Blood Jet Set" by the ''[[Bangkok Post]]''. They have been joined by supporters of the controversial [[Santi Asoke]] Buddhist sect, followers of the controversial monk Luang Ta Maha Bua, and state enterprises employees who oppose privatisation. Some academics and intellectuals have also joined the protests.

However, the protests have been divisive. Many urban upper/middle class Bangkokians have expressed frustration at the protesters. Early in 2005, a majority of the employees at state-owned [[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] supported privatisation. The popular but controversial [[Dharmakaya]] Buddhist sect has come out in support of Thaksin. Several members of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]'s Privy Council have asked protesters to seek a peaceful resolution to the situation. Supreme Commander General [[Ruengroj Mahasaranond]] said "I should like to direct my message at a certain person who resorts to self-promotion by invoking the name of His Majesty...Rivals should not involve the monarch in their quarrels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/19/national/index.php?news=national_19202821.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=19 November 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206162727/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/19/national/index.php?news=national_19202821.html |archive-date=6 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many academics have urged the protesters to adhere to the constitution and not pressure the King to appoint a replacement prime minister. Many also note that the majority of Thailand's population, particular the rural poor, are strong supporters of Thaksin.

On 14 January 2006, hundreds of protestors headed by Sondhi Limthongkul, former senator Pratin Santiprapop, Klanarong Chantik, and Democrat MP Kalaya Sophonpanich stormed into Government House at half past midnight, overwhelming security forces. They occupied the building for twenty minutes before regrouping outside and continuing their protest.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/01/14/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19657935.html Thousands of protesters lay siege to Government House] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210623/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/01/14/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19657935.html |date=3 March 2016 }}, 14 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An anti-Thaksin rally on 4 February 2006 at the Royal Plaza drew a very large crowd.
Police and foreign media estimated the turnout to be 40,000 – 50,000. Some local newspapers estimated that up to 100,000 attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.epochtimes.com/news/6-2-4/37778.html |title=Huge Rally Calls for Thai PM's Resignation |publisher=The Epoch Times |date=4 February 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232428/http://english.epochtimes.com/news/6-2-4/37778.html |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151652/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/196346/1/.html Channelnewsasia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, protests waned, with rewer protesters showed up at the Royal Plaza the next weekend. Most Thai newspapers estimated the turnout at 30,000 – 50,000 people. ''Phoochatkarn Raiwan'' (owned by [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], the leader of the protest) estimated 100,000 attended. The BBC, Reuters, and AFP estimated 5,000 – 15,000 attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2bangkok.com/highfeb112006news.shtml |title=High tension in Thailand |publisher=2Bangkok.com |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAD's protests took on an increasingly critical tone in February. In a single protest on 26 February 2006, Buddhist leader [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] called Thaksin a pitiful dog and chairman of the northeastern teachers' group Auychai Watha called for Thaksin's children to "become whores infected with venereal disease." The behaviour of the protesters was condemned by the Chairperson of [[Amnesty International Thailand]]. Protestors often harassed journalists and newscrews.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/01/opinion/opinion_20001744.php Non-violence is not simply the absence of physical violence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191630/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/01/opinion/opinion_20001744.php |date=3 March 2016 }}, 1 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-Thaksin demonstrations===
On 3 March 2006, a pro-Thaksin rally at Sanam Luang arranged by the TRT party was attended by a massive crowd. Local media reported that up to 200,000 people attended.&lt;ref name="headlines_20001979.php"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/04/headlines/headlines_20001979.php| date=8 March 2006| title=PRO-GOVERNMENT RALLY: Thaksin on warpath| accessdate=21 September 2006| publisher=The Nation| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212184644/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/04/headlines/headlines_20001979.php| archive-date=12 December 2006| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thaksin’s rally at Sanam Luang|url=http://2bangkok.com/06-mar3rally.html|publisher=2Bangkok.com|accessdate=11 February 2014|date=3 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some foreign media reported up to 150,000 attended.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this rally, Thaksin promised that "If my party receive less votes than the number of people abstaining combined with votes for smaller parties, I will not accept the premiership...I beg the three opposition parties, Democrat, Chat Thai and Mahachon, to join the contest. If they really insist on a boycott, they can campaign for voters to mark "abstention" to reject me".&lt;ref name="headlines_20001979.php"/&gt; He also promised to amend Article 313 of the Constitution to allow representatives of the people to draft a new charter as occurred in 1974 after the 1973 bloodshed. Some additional laws later would be amended, he said. The whole political reform would take about one year before a referendum to endorse the new charter and another parliament dissolution before a new election. Anti-Thaksin protesters have claimed that most of the attendants were uneducated people who were paid to attend.

===Demonstrations before the April election===
On 5 March 2006, while Thaksin was campaigning for the [[Thai legislative election, April 2006|April 2006 elections]] in the rural areas, tens of thousands of protesters in [[Bangkok]], shouting "Thaksin Get Out" and "Restore Power to the King", demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister. The anti-Thaksin rally included the burning of an effigy of him in a mock funeral to cries of "Thaksin out! Thaksin out!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4775926.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Mass rally against Thailand's PM | date=5 March 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/03/05/thailand.protests/ | work=CNN | title=Thousands protest against Thai PM | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as "the biggest anti-government demonstration in Thailand since 1992" in some news reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-05T204237Z_01_BKK198058_RTRUKOC_0_UK-THAILAND-POLITICS.xml&amp;archived=False| title=404 error| publisher=Reuters.co.uk| accessdate=21 September 2006| df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The protest also included a satirical [[Chinese opera]] and performances of anti-Thaksin [[Lam tad]]'' singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/01/headlines/headlines_20001781.php |title=The Art of Sarcasm |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306021805/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/01/headlines/headlines_20001781.php |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting 13 March 2006, anti-Thaksin protests moved to permanent tents and stands outside Government House at the Miskawan Intersection, leading to massive traffic jams in that area. By 5.30&amp;nbsp;pm, 18 March 2006, approximately 3,000 were protesting at Government House (source: Thai Rath, 19 March 2005).

On 18 March 2006, Nuansri Rodkhrut, a representative of the Thai Red Cross, met protest-leader Chamlong Srimuang to inform him that protest tents were in space reserved for the 2006 Red Cross Fair. She was roundly booed by protesters. The [[Red Cross]] Fair is held annually at the Royal Plaza, Amphorn Gardens, Sri Ayuthaya Road, and the Miskawan Intersection from the end of March to early April. The fair is hosted by the Thai Red Cross Society and was to be attended by Princess [[Sirindhorn]]. Chamlong responded "The protest area does not belong to any individual. Our move from Sanam Luang to Government House to kick out PM Thaksin is our job. I have been to the Red Cross Fair since I was a kid, and I don't want to disrupt it. In fact, it is good that the protesters can visit the fair and raise its attendance. Few Fair attendees will visit the area used by the protesters." He suggested to Nuansri that the entrance booth of the Fair be moved 10 meters behind the main stage of the protests. Nuansri responded that she would seek further guidance from her superiors. On the same day, Traffic Police Commander Phanu Kerdlabphon warned that any disruption of Princess Sirindhorn's visit to the Fair would "surely lead to trouble". Chamlong was quoted as saying "If the officers consider it is against the law, then, come and arrest all 100,000 of us here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/19/headlines/headlines_20003073.php |title=PAD tells top police it will not budge |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=19 March 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306021821/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/19/headlines/headlines_20003073.php |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting 15 March 2006, Thaksin supporters have moved en-masse to Bangkok from the North and North-east in a caravan of Ee Taen (slow-moving diesel-engine powered farming vehicles),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro-Thaksin demonstrators at Chatuchak Park|url=http://2bangkok.com/06-mar182006-mar18.html|publisher=2Bangkok.com|accessdate=11 February 2014|date=18 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thai: อีแต๋น). The "Mob Ee Taen" (so called by the Thai press), as of 18 March 2006, numbered thousands of demonstrators in several hundred Ee Taen and had chosen [[Chatuchak Park]], in the north of Bangkok, as its demonstration site.

The farmers were joined by 400 motorcycle taxi drivers, who claim that a Thaksin-initiated crackdown has eliminated the need to make payments to corrupt police and underworld elements.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Thai Rath 19 May&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2006, a group of Thaksin supporters burned a coffin of [[Apirak Kosayothin]], Democrat governor of Bangkok, claiming that the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration was trying to force the protesters out of Chatuchak Park, that the BMA would not provide any water, and provided only two mobile toilet buses. Anti-Thaksin protesters have claimed that the Thaksin supporters are uneducated and had been paid to come support Thaksin.&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}}{{cite web|title=Thaskin Shinawatra|url= http://tnews.teenee.com/politic/386.html|publisher=Teenee}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also claimed that it is illegal to drive [[Ee Taen]] on city streets.

On the week before the 2006 election, the anti-Thaksin rally moved to Bangkok's shopping districts, with rallies at Bumrungrad International Hospital, [[The Emporium (Bangkok)|The Emporium]], and [[Siam Square]]. Siam Centre, Siam Discovery, [[Siam Paragon]], and many other businesses and office buildings in the protest area were closed, causing up to 1.2 billion baht in losses.&lt;ref name="29Mar2006_news00.php"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bangkokpost.net/News/29Mar2006_news00.php| title=404 error| accessdate=21 September 2006| publisher=Bangkok Post}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March, the [[Bangkok Skytrain|BTS skytrain]] had to shut down service at the Siam intersection station, though the service also reported record ridership as a result of the protest rallies. The protests also caused major traffic jams throughout Bangkok, especially [[Sukhumvit Road]] and Silom Road, both major Bangkok arteries. The local press estimated 50,000 protesters, although foreign press and independent observers noted only 5,000 – 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.thai/browse_thread/thread/3dafed19f012fd4c/deb1f7c6b0344fbf#deb1f7c6b0344fbf| title=Counting demonstrators| work=soc.culture.thai| accessdate=21 September 2006| publisher=Google Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pre-poll rally"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.thai/browse_thread/thread/137a53e8608e0b14/6c6d083fdab462ee#6c6d083fdab462ee| title=Thaksin faces last pre-poll rally| work=soc.culture.thai| publisher=Google Groups| accessdate=21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-Thaksin protesters were harshly criticised, with 50,000 complaints being made to the FM91 traffic radio station. A poll showed that 71% of Bangkokians disagreed with the protests being moved into the city centre.&lt;ref name="29Mar2006_news00.php"/&gt; An opinion poll showed that 26% of Bangkok people supported the resignation of Thaksin, compared to 48% three weeks previously.&lt;ref name="pre-poll rally"/&gt; Protest leader Chamlong Srimuang defended the protesters, saying "Two days of traffic jams is a minor matter, but the nation remaining jammed up was a big problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/headlines/headlines_30000538.php| title=Two rallies plus two fairs equals gridlock| publisher=The Nation| date=30 March 2006| accessdate=21 September 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908035828/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/headlines/headlines_30000538.php| archive-date=8 September 2006| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanapol Eawsakul, "The Coup for Democracy with the King as Head of State", Fa Dieo Kan special issue, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours about unrest in the armed forces and possible coup plots unfurled for months leading to the coup. In May 2006, General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]] issued assurances that the military would not seize power. On 20 July 2006, around a hundred middle-ranking army officers said to be supporters of [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]] were reassigned by the army high command, fuelling rumours that the army was divided between supporters and opponents of the prime minister. In July 2006, 3rd Army Area Commander Saprang Kalayanamitr gave an interview where he stated that Thai politics was below standard and that the Kingdom's leadership was weak. He also claimed that Thailand had a false democracy.&lt;ref&gt;คมชัดลึก, [มทภ.3ชี้ชาติไร้ผู้นำ ตท.10ย้ำชัดไม่ยึดอำนาจ], 19 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, there were reports of tank movements near Bangkok, but the military attributed these to a scheduled exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/68906b70-4806-11db-a42e-0000779e2340.html Timeline: From contested elections to military coup] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121183955/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/68906b70-4806-11db-a42e-0000779e2340.html |date=21 November 2008 }}, ''Financial Times'', 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In early September, Thai police arrested five army officers, all members of Thailand's [[Internal Security Operations Command|counter-insurgency command]], after intercepting one of the officers with a bomb in a car allegedly targeting the prime minister's residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5324172.stm Thai arrests over Thaksin "plot"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070938/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5324172.stm |date=4 March 2016 }}, BBC News, 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the suspects were released after the coup.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/30/headlines/headlines_30015051.php Car-bomb suspects get bail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180101/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/30/headlines/headlines_30015051.php |date=3 March 2016 }}, 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, former National Security Council head [[Prasong Soonsiri]] claimed that he and five other senior military figures had been planning a coup as early as July.

==Impeachment attempts==
[[Image:Thaksin Rally Petition Booth.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Signature collecting booth at Thammasat University]]

In February 2006, 28 [[Senate of Thailand|senators]] submitted a petition to the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] calling for the Prime Minister's impeachment for [[conflicts of interest]] and improprieties in the sell-off of [[Shin Corporation]] under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the [[Constitution of Thailand|Thai constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.concourt.or.th/concourt/eng/contents/Constitution%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Thailand.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=21 September 2006| title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019041805/http://www.concourt.or.th/concourt/eng/contents/Constitution%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Thailand.pdf| archivedate=19 October 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senators said the Prime Minister violated the Constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the Court [[Constitutional Court of Thailand#Thaksin Shinawatra's alleged conflicts of interest|rejected the petition]] on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=6718| publisher=MCOT News| title=Paralympians Return Home| accessdate=21 September 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007174100/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=6718| archivedate=7 October 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another impeachment attempt was made by the Thai university students network, led by [[Thammasat University]] students. A petition was launched to impeach Thaksin via the Senate. As of 27 February 2006, over 50,000 people signed the petition. This exceeded the minimum number required by the Constitution to launch the bid.

{{see also|Thailand legislative election, 2006 (disambiguation)}}

===House dissolution===
Thaksin announced a [[Dissolution of parliament|House dissolution]] on 24 February 2006, in a bid to defuse the political crisis triggered by his family’s sale of [[Shin Corporation]]. General elections were scheduled for 2 April. In his weekly radio address following the announcement of his decision, Thaksin promised a series of new populist measures, including pay rises for government workers, an increase in the minimum wage and debt relief for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749784.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Thai premier unveils new policies | date=25 February 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]], [[Chart Thai]] and [[Mahachon Party|Mahachon]] parties announced a boycott of the election on 27 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=82074 |title=Breaking News |publisher=Bangkok Post |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Ppnno9aR?url=http://bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=82074 |archivedate=24 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Nation'' criticised Thaksin for calling for parliamentary elections. In an editorial, it noted that the election "fails to take into consideration a major fallacy of the concept, particularly in a less-developed democracy like ours, in which the impoverished, poorly informed masses are easily manipulated by people of his ilk. And Thaksin's manipulation has been well documented. It includes an ingenious use of populist policies that pander to the unprincipled wants and needs of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |title=Democracy put to the ultimate test |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=21 March 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |archive-date=26 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, demands for royal intervention have met with much criticism. The King himself in speeches on 26 April to newly appointed judges dismissed the notion, saying Article 7 of the Constitution invoked by the anti-Thaksin protestors did not give him that power. "Asking for a Royally appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess.

{{update|date=November 2010}}
Unofficial results as of 3 April 2006 gave Thaksin's TRT Party victory, with 462 seats in Parliament and 66% of the popular vote. However, 38 TRT candidates, all in the Democrat-dominated south, failed to win up to 20% of votes from eligible voters in their constituency, thus forcing the Election Commission to hold by-elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |title=38 one-horse candidates fail |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=4 April 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206162906/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |archive-date=6 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on 23 April.&lt;ref name="newsid30000955"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955| title=Second round of elections be held on April 23| publisher=The Nation| accessdate=21 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022737/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |archivedate = 8 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Election Commission commissioner Prinya Nakchudtree said that election laws would allow new applications in 23 April by-elections, allowing the Democrat Party (which had boycotted 3 April elections) to run in the by-elections.&lt;ref name="newsid30000955"/&gt; However, the Democrat Party has vowed to boycott the by-elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-07T083105Z_01_BKK199695_RTRUKOC_0_US-THAILAND.xml| title=404 error| agency=Reuters| accessdate=21 September 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527105400/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-07T083105Z_01_BKK199695_RTRUKOC_0_US-THAILAND.xml| archivedate=27 May 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has petitioned the Central Administrative Court to cancel the by-elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democrat executive asks court to cancel 2nd round of election|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Democrat-executive-asks-court-to-cancel-2nd-round--30001232.html|accessdate=11 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|date=7 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223110326/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Democrat-executive-asks-court-to-cancel-2nd-round--30001232.html|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many expect that this will prevent Parliament from reconvening and a Government from forming within the 3 May time-limit set by the Constitution.&lt;ref name="04/07/thailand.politics/"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/thailand.politics/| title= Thai rally toasts Thaksin's exit| date=7 April 2006|publisher=CNN | accessdate=21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After unofficial voting tallies became public, the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) petitioned the Administrative Court to suspend the results of the election.

==After the 2006 election==

===Thaksin proposes reconciliatory panel===
On 3 April 2006, Thaksin Shinawatra appeared on television to declare victory in the controversial 2006 election, called for unity in the kingdom, reiterated his proposal for a government of national unity, and proposed the creation of an independent reconciliatory commission to end the political stalemate. He offered to resign if the new panel recommended it. The commission could consist of three former parliament presidents, three Supreme Court presidents, three former prime ministers and rectors of state universities. He also suggested that four potential candidates from the TRT could replace him if he stepped down, including former House Speaker Bhokin Bhalakula and caretaker Commerce Minister [[Somkid Jatusripitak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/04/headlines/headlines_30000930.php |title=Thaksin's "victory" declaration |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=4 April 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508053824/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/04/headlines/headlines_30000930.php |archive-date=8 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/04/world/asia/04thailand.html | work=The New York Times | title=Thailand Leader Cushions Claim of Ballot Victory | first=Thomas | last=Fuller | date=4 April 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/03/thailand.polls/ | work=CNN | title=Thai leader claims victory | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrat Party and the PAD immediately rejected the reconciliation panel.

After an audience with King Bhumibol, Thaksin announced on 4 April 2006 that he would not accept the post of Prime Minister after the Parliament reconvenes. However, he would continue to be Caretaker Prime Minister until his successor is elected by the Parliament.&lt;ref name="201527/1/.html"/&gt;

"My main reason for not accepting the post of prime minister is because this year is an auspicious year for the king, whose 60th anniversary on the throne is just 60 days away… I want all Thais to reunite," said Thaksin in a nationally televised speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=89047 |title=Breaking News |publisher=Bangkok Post |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205195607/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=89047 |archivedate=5 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/04/headlines/headlines_30000957.php |title=I will not accept post of premier in the next government : Thaksin |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=4 April 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019045600/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/04/headlines/headlines_30000957.php |archive-date=19 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then delegated his functions to Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister [[Chidchai Wannasathit]], moved out of Government House, and scheduled a vacation with his family.

The Democrat Party welcomed the decision and promised to co-operate to resolve the current political crisis. However, they continued their boycott of by-elections. Many expected that the boycott would prevent Parliament from reconvening and a Government from forming within the 3 May time-limit set by the Constitution – thus causing a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref name="04/07/thailand.politics/"/&gt; In a celebration at Sanam Luang on 7 April, PAD leaders announced that their new goal was the eradication of the Thaksin "regime"&lt;ref name="04/07/thailand.politics/"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PAD leaders swear to fight on to eradicate Thaksin regime|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/PAD-leaders-swear-to-fight-on-to-eradicate-Thaksin-30001271.html|accessdate=11 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|date=7 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223110323/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/PAD-leaders-swear-to-fight-on-to-eradicate-Thaksin-30001271.html|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; amid continued concerns that a constitutional crisis, a lack of a government, and continued protests could spoil King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]'s Diamond Jubilee Celebrations on 9 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Rosalind|title=Thailand struggles with constitutional impasse|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/international/461871/thailand_struggles_with_constitutional_impasse/|work=redOrbit.com|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=11 February 2014|date=7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/06/opinion/edvatik.php| title= In Thailand, a silk revolution| first=Michael| last= Vatikiotis|work=International Herald Tribune| date=7 April 2006| accessdate=21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,18748128-2703,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918185424/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C20867%2C18748128-2703%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 September 2006 |title=Democrat spanner in Thaksin succession |work=The Australian |accessdate=21 September 2006 |df= }} (no longer available at this URL)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/06/AR2006040602481_3.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024130348/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/06/AR2006040602481_3.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=24 October 2012| title=404 error|work=The Washington Post | accessdate=21 September 2006}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of the Election Commission===
In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, King Bhumibol requested that the judiciary take action to resolve the political crisis.&lt;ref name="invalidate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asiaviews.org/?content=153499ym32dddw4&amp;headline=20060706003624 | title = Group of women of royal descent calls on Thaksin to name "charismatic figure" | publisher = Bangkok Post | accessdate =9 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May 2006, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitution Court]] [[Constitutional Court of Thailand#Invalidation of the April 2006 election|invalidated the results]] of the [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|April elections]] and ordered a new round of elections, later set for [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|October elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php | title = Constitution Court invalidate the April election and order new election | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 5 July 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060616174003/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php | archivedate = 16 June 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several judges also called for three members of the Election Commission to resign. The Commissioners refused to do so, citing their constitutional independence. Several legal experts including [[Worachet Pakeerut]] and [[Banjerd Singkanet]] of Thammasat University noted the unprecedented nature of the judiciary's demands. "I'm concerned that if the courts get too involved in political affairs, politics may hit back. Moreover, it's difficult to examine the courts, and who is to examine the courts' use of power in politics," said Worachet.&lt;ref&gt;Public Relations Department of Thailand, [http://www.parliament.go.th/news/news_detail.php?prid=4712 Judges call for EC to step aside] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231213/http://www.parliament.go.th/news/news_detail.php?prid=4712 |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Commissioners still refused to resign, the Criminal Court jailed the Election Commissioners, removing them from their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php | title = EC Commissioners arrive at Bangkok Remand Prison | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 25 July 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060805193731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php | archivedate = 5 August 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 |title=EC Guilty in Historic Ruling |publisher=Bangkok Post |accessdate=25 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010030203/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==September 2006 coup d'état==
{{Main article|September 2006 Thailand military coup d'état}}
The ongoing political crisis escalated drastically on 19 September 2006 when [[Thai Army]] units loyal to the army chief of staff, Gen [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]], staged a coup attempt in Bangkok to unseat Thaksin while he was attending a meeting of the United Nations in New York City.

In a statement, the military [[Administrative Reform Council|Democratic Reform Council]] cited the government's alleged [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]], interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php Statement from the military reformist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212504/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |date=3 March 2016 }}, 20 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations, however, failed to be pursued seriously, except for charges of corruption in which Thaksin, family and associates were identified by name and criminal offence in court documents. The lèse majesté charge, in fact, was somewhat confused by 2008 accusations by Thai courts that Sondhi Limthongkul, media barron and former associate-turned foe of Thaksin had induced Thai people to believe that there were pro and con-monarchy groups in Thailand. Some believe the accusation was an attempt to reduce the negative image of Thaksin among royalists.

The '''African National Congress Women's League''' is the [[women's wing]] of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).  It was founded in 1931 as the Bantu Women's League,&lt;ref name="Rubert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubert|first1=Steven C.|last2=Rasmussen|first2=R.

It was integrated into the ANC during the period from 1943, when women were first admitted as members of the ANC, to 1948, when the ANCWL was officially founded. It participated with the [[Federation of South African Women]] in protests against the apartheid-era government, such as the 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]] and the [[National Women's Day#1956 Women.27s March|Women's March of 9 August 1956]]. In 1956, [[Lilian Ngoyi]] became the first elected female member of the [[National Executive Committee (African National Congress)|ANC National Executive Committee]].  In 1960 the organization was banned along with the ANC forcing its central leaders underground; it was unbanned in 1990 when the ANC was likewise unbanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ANC Women's League (ANCWL)|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/anc-womens-league-ancwl|website = www.sahistory.org.za|accessdate = 2015-12-05|last = Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League's current president is [[Bathabile Dlamini]].

Among the activists and politicians who were allied with the ANC during the apartheid years are:

* [[Lillian Ngoyi]]
* [[Helen Joseph]]
* Dorothy Nyembe
* Sophie du Bruyn
* [[Rachel Simons|Ray Alexander]] and Rayn Alexander
* [[Frances Baard]]

==Criticisms==

The ANC Women's League has been criticised for failing to take up women's issues in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=152382 Will the real ANC Women’s League stand up?] Sisonke Msimang, ''Business Day'', 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4985">The '''Anti-Socialist Union''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] political pressure group that supported [[free trade]] economics and opposed [[socialism]]. It was active from 1908 to 1948 with its heyday occurring before the [[First World War]].

==Organizational history==
===Formation===
Coming from the same [[laissez-faire]] economic position as contemporaries such as the [[Liberty and Property Defence League]] and the [[British Constitution Association]], the ASU was established in 1908 by ''[[Daily Express]]'' editor [[R. D. Blumenfeld]].&lt;ref name="Org"&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th century'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; Avowedly non-political its main membership came from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the ASU campaigned against the social reforms enacted by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[Herbert Henry Asquith]], denouncing these as socialist initiatives.&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt;

===Activities===
The group was active in the election campaigns of [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January]] and [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] when some of its rallies and meetings ended in violence.&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt;  [[Keir Hardie]] was a focus of its activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holman|first1=Bob|title=Keir Hardie Labour's Greatest Hero|date=2010|publisher=Lion Books|location=Oxford|isbn=9780745953540|page=160}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Enjoying a circulation of some 70,000 for its journal around that time, the ASU included a young [[Stanley Baldwin]] amongst its membership.&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt; Other leading members in the early years included [[William Hurrell Mallock]], [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] and [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]].&lt;ref&gt;Markku Ruotsila, ''British and American Anticommunism Before the Cold War'', Routledge, 2001, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The group went on hiatus during the [[First World War]] before being revived initially under the name Reconstruction Society before becoming the Anti-Socialist and Anti-Communist Union, attacking such figures as [[Harold Laski]] and [[Maurice Dobb]] whilst also attempting to prove links between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt; By this time however its role had largely been usurped by the [[British Empire Union]] and with no local branch structure it struggled for influence.&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt; Nonetheless the group claimed that between 1918 and 1922 it organised around ten thousand meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Linehan, ''British Fascism 1918-39: Parties, Ideology and Culture'', Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Although avowedly a free trade movement the ASU found itself linked with the [[fascism|fascist]] movements that began to emerge in the 1920s, largely due to their shared opposition to [[communism]]. Under the presidency of Brigadier-General [[R.B.D. Blakeney]] the [[British Fascists]] (BF) forged links with the ASU with a number of ASU members from military backgrounds joining the BF. Leading ASU figures such as [[George Makgill]], [[John Baker White (British politician)|John Baker White]] and even Blumenfeld became associated with the BF.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dorril, ''Blackshirt: Sir Oswald Mosley &amp; British Fascism'', Penguin Books, 2007, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nesta Webster]], a leading BF ideologue, was also a member of the ASU and wrote and researched a number of their publications.&lt;ref&gt;Julie V. Gottlieb, ''Feminine Fascism: Women in Britain's Fascist Movement'', I.B.Tauris, 2003, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time the chairman of the ASU was [[Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple|Wilfrid Ashley]], who would later also serve as the Chairman of the [[Anglo-German Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="linehan46"&gt;Thomas P. Linehan, ''British Fascism, 1918-39: Parties, Ideology and Culture'', Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Brittain]], who enjoyed a close friendship with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], was a member of the Executive Committee of the ASU.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griffiths, ''Fellow Travellers on the Right'', Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to counter the growing support for socialism among sections of the working class, it also began to advocate some vaguely [[corporatist]] initiatives such as profit-sharing schemes for workers.&lt;ref name="linehan46"/&gt; Generally however the Union disavowed [[fascism]] and did not formally work with any fascist groups.&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt;

===Dissolution===
The group continued until 1948 when it was wound up, turning its assets over to the [[Economic League (UK)|Economic League]].&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt;

The '''Australian Nationalist Party (ANP)''' was a minor [[Australia|Australian]] [[List of political parties in Australia|political party]] that contested the [[Australian federal election, 1958|1958 federal election]]. The ANP unsuccessfully ran five candidates in [[Queensland]]: Noel Condie in the [[division of Bowman]], John Morgan in the [[division of Brisbane]], Mervyn Goldstiver in the [[division of Lilley]], Horace Burge in the [[division of Petrie]], and Ronald Edmonds in the [[division of Ryan]]. The party's objectives included opposition to [[communism]] and socialization, reducing taxes, restoring the proportion of [[England|British]] [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] to 75% of the total, deportation of migrants convicted of certain crimes, increasing [[social services]], restoration of [[full employment]], opposition to salary rises for politicians, and support for states' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaensch|first=Dean|authorlink=Dean Jaensch|last2=Mathieson|first2=David|date=1998|title=A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]]|page=143|isbn=1-86448-421-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Arizona Policy''' (CAP) is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[conservatism|conservative]] [[lobbying]] group based in [[Arizona]]. The organization advocates for the passage of socially conservative policies in the state. It also produces voter guides to encourage its supporters to elect conservative lawmakers.&lt;ref name="dailysun"/&gt; Over 100 bills supported by CAP have been signed into law in Arizona.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

CAP employees co-wrote Arizona's controversial [[Arizona SB 1062|SB 1062]], which would have shielded business owners and employees from lawsuits if they refused service to anyone based on sincerely held religious beliefs. The bill was vetoed by governor [[Jan Brewer]].&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cathi Herrod.jpg|thumb|Cathi Herrod]]
The Center for Arizona Policy was founded by [[Len Munsil]] in 1995; he served as Founding President and General Counsel until 2005.&lt;ref name="ACU"/&gt; The current President is Cathi Herrod, who joined the organization as legal counsel in 1997.&lt;ref name="herrod"/&gt;

CAP receives some of its funding from the [[National Christian Charitable Foundation]], an organization largely funded with money from the [[Hobby Lobby]] craft store company. In 2011 the Foundation awarded $236,250 of the $1.6 million CAP received in grant revenue that year.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

==Legislation==
CAP has supported and lobbied for over 100 bills that have been signed into law in Arizona.&lt;ref name="bills"/&gt; In 2012 alone, 13 CAP-supported bills passed, including a law banning [[abortion]] after 20 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="2012bills"/&gt;

=== Abortion ===
The Center for Arizona Policy opposes legal abortion and has supported legislation to restrict access to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/07/07/arizona-still-has-law-banning-abortion-its-books-supreme-court-anthony-kennedy-donald-trump/760335002/|title=Arizona still has a law banning abortion on the books|work=azcentral|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAP helped to write a bill in Arizona to require that women to explain to their medical providers why they are seeking to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tucson.com/news/local/arizona-bill-would-require-women-to-explain-why-they-want/article_dc12f339-eeaf-5682-979b-ab714f97abe2.html|title=Arizona bill would require women to explain why they want an abortion|last=Services|first=Howard Fischer Capitol Media|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawsuits against anti-abortion laws have cost Arizona taxpayers more than $2 million, but CAP president, Cathi Herrod, stated that the anti-abortion policies "outweigh the losses in court."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tucson.com/ap/state/anti-abortion-laws-have-cost-arizona-millions-in-legal-fees/article_b791a157-55f0-53cb-b240-6fea4f65a579.html|title=Anti-abortion laws have cost Arizona millions in legal fees|last=Press|first=The Associated|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Union Ordinances ===
{{See also|Same-sex marriage in Arizona}}
In 2013, the [[Bisbee, Arizona|City of Bisbee]] announced that it intended to legalize same-sex civil unions within the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-arizona-gaymarriage-idUSBRE93109Y20130402|title=Arizona city poised to pass state's first civil union ordinance|last=Gaynor|first=Tim|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arizona Attorney General, [[Tom Horne]], initially opposed the ordinance, but withdrew a legal challenge after the city adopted an amended version of the ordinance that complied with state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/19/nation/la-na-nn-ff-bisbee-same-sex-civil-unions-20130819|title=Bisbee OKs same-sex civil unions, but only 4 couples say 'I do'|last=Carcamo|first=Cindy|date=2013-08-19|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tucson13.nytimes-institute.com/2013/05/28/with-civil-unions-bisbee-sees-growth/|title=With Civil Unions, Bisbee Sees Growth – Tucson 2013 NYTSJI {{!}} The New York Times Student Journalism Institute - Tucson, Arizona 2013 at the University of Arizona|website=tucson13.nytimes-institute.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Arizona Policy opposed the city's move to offer civil unions and responded with a challenge saying, "If the City of Bisbee enacts a law recognizing a quasi-marital relationship not provided for by Arizona law, it will likely find itself involved in expensive and time-consuming litigation, which it is likely to lose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azpolicy.org/2013/04/02/caps-letter-to-the-bisbee-city-council/|title=CAP's Letter to the Bisbee City Council {{!}} Center for Arizona Policy|date=2013-04-02|work=Center for Arizona Policy|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bisbee, the cities and towns of Clarkdale, Cottonwood, Jerome, Sedona, and Tucson also approved of civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc15.com/news/region-northern-az/other/cottonwood-latest-to-approve-civil-unions|title=Cottonwood latest to approve civil unions|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2013-12-19|work=KNXV|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAP describes acceptance of homosexuality in society as "a deceitful and angry ideology" and supports what it describes as a "biblical value that God has a specific intent for sexuality and that it is only realized in the relationship between one man and one woman within the confines of marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azpolicy.org/2011/06/03/be-encouraged/|title=Be Encouraged {{!}} Center for Arizona Policy|date=2011-06-03|work=Center for Arizona Policy|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===SB 1062===
The Center for Arizona Policy, along with the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]], helped write Arizona Senate Bill 1062, a controversial bill that, if signed into law, would have allowed business owners and employees to refuse to serve anyone based on sincerely held religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; Supporters of the bill claimed it was meant to protect the religious freedoms of Arizonans, while opponents pointed out that it was intended to allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Top aides for Arizona Governor Jan Brewer worked closely with CAP in crafting the language of the bill, but Brewer, in response to boycott threats and other economic pressure from various national groups,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/26/politics/arizona-brewer-bill/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; vetoed it on February 26, 2014, a few days after it passed the state [[Arizona State Senate|Senate]] and [[Arizona House of Representatives|House]].&lt;ref name="brewer"/&gt; CAP and its president Cathi Herrod received a great deal of media attention during the debate over the bill, with several stories highlighting the amount of influence the organization has in Arizona politics.&lt;ref name="dailysun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt;

The '''Coalition of Concerned Citizens''' was a [[New Zealand]] [[Christian right|Christian conservative]] pressure group, and one of several attempts to form pro-censorship, anti-abortion, anti-gay and sex education opponents into a comprehensive social conservative political coalition. Its founders included [[Keith Hay]], [[Peter Tait (mayor)|Peter Tait]], Barry Reed, and [[Bill Subritzky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jesson|first1=Bruce |authorlink1= |first2=Allanah |last2=Ryan |first3=Paul |last3=Spoonley |title=Revival of the Right: New Zealand Politics in the 1980s |edition=1st |publisher=Heinemann Reed |date=1988 |pages=56 |chapter=Chapter 4: Remoralising Politics |isbn=0-7900-0003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CCC was originally formed to fight the New Zealand [[Homosexual Law Reform Act]], although its membership also unsuccessfully tried to defeat [[David Lange]]'s [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] at the [[New Zealand general election, 1987|general election of 1987]], through infiltration of [[New Zealand National Party]] branches.&lt;ref&gt;Jesson, Allanah, and Spoonley, pg. 82-84&lt;/ref&gt; Besides its conservative stance on moral issues, the CCC was also strongly [[anti-Communist]] and pro-Western. It alleged that there was a conspiracy by Communist groups like the pro-[[Moscow]] [[Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP) to infiltrate the Labour Party, the trade unions, and exploit various popular issues like the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|anti-Springbok tour protests]], [[Māori protest movement|Māori biculturalism]], and the [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|anti-nuclear movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Jesson, Allanah, and Spoonley, pg. 90-108&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to perceived Communist influence within these popular causes, Coalition activists and supporters supported maintaining ties with [[South Africa]] and preserving the [[ANZUS]] security alliance with the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;"South Africa&amp;mdash;What is the Truth?," ''Coalition Courier'' 5, no.2 (June/July 1990), pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Reed, "Defence or Pretense?," ''Coalition Courier'', April 1987, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Reed, "The Sovietisation of New Zealand," ''Coalition Courier, June 1987, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; It also opposed the introduction of Māori [[biculturalism]] and [[multiculturalism]] into the education system as 'anti-Christian' for allegedly promoting alternative religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gunn, "Declaring Victory over Humanism," ''Coalition Courier'' March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Solving Race Relations problem," ''Coalition Courier'' 4, no.2 (August 1988), pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jesson, Allanah, and Spoonley, pg.106-07&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Laurie Guy, the coalition was disproportionately dominated by members of the [[Reformed Churches of New Zealand]] and [[Pentecostal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, Laurie: "Evangelicals and the Homosexual Law Reform Debate" ''Stimulus'' (November 2005):13(4):69-77: [http://www.stimulus.org.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; It produced a newsletter called ''Coalition Courier.'' Some of its more moderate membership left and joined the Christian Heritage Party (later renamed [[Christian Heritage New Zealand]], now defunct) after 1989, disgruntled at the group's perceived tendencies toward right-wing extremism. During its existence, the organisation also produced an anti-gay booklet entitled ''The Social Effects of Homosexuality'' (1985), which relied significantly on the work of controversial US psychologist [[Paul Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Worlds in Collision: The Gay Debate in New Zealand, 1960-1984 |last=Guy |first=Laurie |year=2003 |publisher=Victoria University Press |isbn=978-0-86473-438-9 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group ceased to exist in the late 1990s.

==Origin==
[[File:Indiancobra.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The Indian Cobra]]
The term ''cobra effect'' originated in an [[anecdote]] set at the time of [[British Raj|British rule of colonial India]]. The British government was concerned about the number of [[venom]]ous [[cobra]] [[snake]]s in [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name="freak"/&gt; The government therefore offered [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] for every dead cobra. Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse.&lt;ref name="siebert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schwarz"&gt;{{Cite book| last= Schwarz| first=Christian A.|title=NCD Implementation Guide|publisher=Carol Stream Church Smart Resources|year=1996|pages=126 }} Cited in Brickman, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Rat effect ===
A similar incident occurred in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], under French colonial rule. The colonial regime created a bounty program that paid a reward for each [[rat]] killed.&lt;ref name="freak" /&gt; To obtain the bounty, people would provide the severed rat tail. Colonial officials, however, began noticing rats in Hanoi with no tails. The Vietnamese rat catchers would capture rats, lop off their tails, and then release them back into the sewers so that they could procreate and produce more rats, thereby increasing the rat catchers' revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Michael G. |last=Vann |title=Of Rats, Rice, and Race: The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre, an Episode in French Colonial History |journal=French Colonial History |year=2003 |volume=4 |issue= |pages=191–203 |doi=10.1353/fch.2003.0027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Michael G. Vann|Michael Vann]] argues that the cobra example from British India cannot be proven, but that the rats in Vietnam case can be proven, so the term could be changed to the "rat effect".&lt;ref name="freak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freakonomics.com/2012/10/11/the-cobra-effect-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/ |first=Stephen J. |last=Dubner |publisher=Freakonomics, LLC |title=The Cobra Effect: A New Freakonomics Radio Podcast |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collective farming''' and '''communal farming''' are various types of "agricultural production in which multiple farmers run their holdings as a joint enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of collective farm in ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; That type of [[collective]] is often an [[agricultural cooperative]] in which member-owners jointly engage in farming activities. The process by which farmland is aggregated is called '''collectivization'''. In some countries (including the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, [[China]] and [[Vietnam]]), there have been state-run and cooperative-run variants. For example, the Soviet Union had both [[kolkhoz]]y (cooperative-run type) and [[sovkhoz]]y (state-run type), often denoted in English as collective farms and state farms, respectively.

== Pre-20th century history ==
{{main|Communal land|Property|Commons}}
A small group of farming or herding families living together on a jointly managed piece of land is one of the most common living arrangements in all of human history as this has co-existed and competed with more individualistic forms of ownership as well as state ownership since the beginnings of agriculture. Private ownership came to predominate in much of the Western world and is therefore better studied. The process by which Western Europe's communal land and other property became private is a fundamental question behind views of property, namely is it the legacy of historical injustices and crimes? [[Karl Marx]] believed that what he called [[primitive communism]] (joint ownership) was ended by exploitative means he called [[primitive accumulation]]. By contrast, libertarian thinkers say that by the [[homestead principle]] whoever is first to work on the land is the rightful owner.

=== Case studies ===
==== Mexico ====
During the Aztec rule of central Mexico, the country was divided into small territories called ''[[calpulli]]'', which were units of local administration concerned with farming as well as education and religion.  A calpulli consisted of a number of [[clan|large extended families with a presumed common ancestor]], themselves each composed of a number of nuclear families.  Each ''calpulli'' owned the land and granted the individual families the right to farm parts of it.  When the Spanish conquered Mexico they replaced this with a system of ''[[hacienda]]s'' or estates granted by the Spanish crown to Spanish colonists, as well as the  ''[[encomienda]]'', a feudal-like right of overlordship colonists were given in particular villages, and the ''[[repartimiento]]'' or system of indigenous [[forced labor]].

Following the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new constitution in 1917 abolished any remnant of feudal-like rights hacienda owners had over common lands and offered the development of ''[[ejido]]s'': communal farms formed on land purchased from the large estates by the Mexican government.

==== Iroquois and Huron of the North American Great Lakes region ====
{{main|Economy of the Iroquois}}
[[File:Long House Iroquois Allen.jpg|thumb|Latter-day Iroquois longhouse housing several hundred people]]
The Huron had an essentially [[common ownership|communal]] system of land ownership. The French Catholic missionary [[Gabriel Sagard]] described the fundamentals. The Huron had "as much land as they need[ed]."{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=110–111}} As a result, the Huron could give families their own land and still have a large amount of excess land owned communally. Any Huron was free to clear the land and farm on the basis of [[usufruct]]. He maintained possession of the land as long as he continued to actively cultivate and tend the fields. Once he abandoned the land, it reverted to communal ownership, and anyone could take it up for themselves.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=111}} While the Huron did seem to have lands designated for the individual, the significance of this possession may be of little relevance; the placement of corn storage vessels in the [[Native American long house|longhouses]], which contained multiple families in one kinship group, suggests the occupants of a given longhouse held all production in common.{{sfn|Trigger|1969|p=28}}

The Iroquois had a similar communal system of land distribution.  The tribe owned all lands but gave out tracts to the different clans for further distribution among households for cultivation.  The land would be redistributed among the households every few years, and a clan could request a redistribution of tracts when the Clan Mothers' Council gathered.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71–72}} Those clans that abused their allocated land or otherwise did not take care of it would be warned and eventually punished by the Clan Mothers' Council by having the land redistributed to another clan.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}} Land property was really only the concern of the women, since it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men's.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71–72}}

The Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans.  Food from such lands, called ''kěndiǔ"gwǎ'ge' hodi'yěn'tho'', would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}}

==== Russian Empire ====
The ''[[obshchina]]'' ({{lang-rus|общи́на|p=ɐpˈɕːinə}}, literally: "[[commune]]") or ''mir'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|мир}}, literally: "society" (one of the meanings)) or ''Selskoye obshestvo'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|сельское общество}} ("Rural community", official term in the 19th and 20th century) were peasant communities, as opposed to individual farmsteads, or [[khutor]]s, in [[Imperial Russia]]. The term derives from the word о́бщий, ''obshchiy'' (common).

The vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in [[Open field system|communal ownership]] within a mir community, which acted as a village government and a cooperative. Arable land was divided into sections based on soil quality and distance from the village.  Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household.  The purpose of this allocation was not so much social (to each according to his needs) as it was practical (that each person pay his taxes).  Strips were periodically re-allocated on the basis of a census, to ensure equitable share of the land.  This was enforced by the state, which had an interest in the ability of households to pay their taxes.

== Communist collectivization ==
The Soviet Union introduced collective farming in its constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republic]]s between 1927 and 1933. The [[Baltic states]] and most of the [[Central and Eastern Europe|Central and East European countries]] (except [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) adopted collective farming after [[World War II]], with the accession of [[communist regimes]] to power. In Asia ([[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Vietnam]]) the adoption of collective farming was also driven by communist government policies. In most communist countries, the transition to collective farming involved compulsion.

=== Soviet Union ===
{{main|Collectivization in the Soviet Union}}
As part of the [[first five-year plan]], collectivization was introduced in the [[Soviet Union]] by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]] in the late 1920s as a way, according to the policies of socialist leaders, to boost agricultural production through the organization of land and labor into large-scale collective farms ([[kolkhoz]]y). At the same time, Joseph Stalin argued that collectivization would free poor peasants from economic servitude under the ''[[kulak]]s'' (farmland owners).

Stalin resorted to mass murder and wholesale deportation of farmers to [[Siberia]] in order to implement the plan. Millions who remained did not die of starvation, but the centuries-old system of farming was destroyed in a region so fertile it was once called "the [[breadbasket]] of Europe".  The immediate effects of forced collectivization were reduced grain output and almost halved livestock numbers, thus creating major famines throughout the USSR during 1932 and 1933. In 1932–1933, an estimated 11 million people, 3–7&amp;nbsp;million in Ukraine alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faminegenocide.com/resources/hdocuments.htm|title=Holodomor of 1932-33 in Ukraine|author=|date=|website=www.faminegenocide.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; died from [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine]] after Stalin forced the peasants into collectives (Ukrainians call this famine ''[[Holodomor]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424093532/http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was not until 1940 that agricultural production finally surpassed its pre-collectivization levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]]: ''Russia's War'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm]]: ''[[Age of Extremes]]'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivization throughout Moldova was not aggressively pursued until the early 1960s because of the Soviet leadership's focus on a policy of [[Russification]] of [[Moldovans|Moldavians]] into the Russian way of life. Much of the collectivization in Moldova had undergone in Transnistria, in [[Chişinău]], the present-day capital city of Moldova. Most of the directors who regulated and conducted the process of collectivization were placed by officials from Moscow.

=== Romania ===
{{main|Collectivization in Romania}}
In [[Romanian People's Republic|Romania]], land collectivization began in 1948 and continued for over more than a decade until its virtual eradication in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarris and D. Gavrilescu, "Restructuring of farms and agricultural systems in Romania", in: J. Swinnen, A. Buckwell, and E. Mathijs, eds., ''Agricultural Privatisation, Land Reform and Farm Restructuring in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]'', Ashgate, Aldershot, UK, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, force sometimes had to be used to enforce collective agricultural practices. Collective farming in Romania was an attempt to implement the USSR's communist blueprint. Unfortunately, these attempts often fell short. By strictly adhering to this soviet blueprint, the implementation of communism in Romania inevitably created dilemmas and contributions that led to violence. Kligman and Verdery state "The violence collectivization, emerges, then, less, as an abhoration than as a product of sociocultural shaping and of deep problems with how the soviet blueprint came to be implemented... instead of a gradual and integrated process of moving from one form of society to another, Romanian society in the Soviet orbit was being completely rearticulated, a process in which violence was inevitable." &lt;ref name="Kligman, G. 2011"&gt;Kligman, G., &amp; Verdery, K. (2011). Peasants under siege: the collectivization of Romanian agriculture, 1949–1962. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, as Kligman and Verdery explain, "Collectivization brought undeniable benefits to some rural inhabitants, especially those who had owned little or no land. It freed them from laboring on the fields of others, and it increased their control over wages, lending to their daily existence a stability previously unknown to them."  &lt;ref name="Kligman, G. 2011"/&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
''Трудово кооперативно земеделско стопанство'' was the name of collective farms in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].

=== Hungary ===
{{main|Collectivization in Hungary}}
In [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], agricultural collectivization was attempted a number of times between 1948 and 1956 (with disastrous results), until it was finally successful in the early 1960s under [[János Kádár]]. The first serious attempt at [[collectivization]] based on [[Stalinist]] agricultural policy was undertaken in July 1948. Both economic and direct police pressure were used to coerce peasants to join [[cooperative]]s, but large numbers opted instead to leave their villages. By the early 1950s, only one-quarter of peasants had agreed to join cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], ''The Hungarian Economic Reforms 1953–1988'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1955 the drive for collectivization was renewed, again using physical force to encourage membership, but this second wave also ended in dismal failure. After the events of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the Hungarian regime opted for a more gradual collectivization drive. The main wave of collectivization occurred between 1959 and 1961, and at the end of this period more than 95% of agricultural land in Hungary had become the property of collective farms. In February 1961, the Central Committee declared that collectivization had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Swain, ''Collective Farms Which Work?'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

This quick success should not be confused with enthusiastic adoption of collective idealism on the part of the peasants. Still, demoralized after two successive (and harsh) collectivization campaigns and the events of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the peasants were less keen to resist. As membership levels increased, those who remained outside likely grew worried about being permanently left out.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2006}}
In [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], centralized land reforms after World War I allowed for the distribution of most of the land to peasants and the poor, and created large groups of relatively well-to-do farmers (though village poor still existed). These groups showed no support for communist ideals. In 1945, immediately after World War II, new land reform started with the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|new communist government]]. The first phase involved a confiscation of properties of Germans, Hungarians, and collaborators of the Nazi regime in accordance with the so-called [[Beneš decrees]]. The second phase, promulgated by so-called ''Ďuriš's laws'' (after the Communist Minister of Agriculture), in fact meant a complete revision of the pre-war land reform and tried to reduce maximal private property to 150 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 250 ha of any land.

The third and final phase forbade possession of land above 50 ha for one family. This phase was carried out in April 1948, two months after Communists took power by force. Farms started to be collectivized, mostly under the threat of sanctions. The most obstinate farmers were persecuted and imprisoned. The most common form of collectivization was ''[[agricultural cooperative]]'' (in Czech ''Jednotné zemědělské družstvo'', JZD; in Slovak ''Jednotné roľnícke družstvo'', JRD). The collectivization was implemented in three stages (1949–1952, 1953–1956, 1956–1969) and officially ended with implementation of the constitution establishing the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], which made private ownership illegal.

Many early cooperatives collapsed and were recreated again. Their productivity was low since they provided tiny salaries and no pensions, and they failed to create a sense of collective ownership; small-scale pilfering was common, and food became scarce. Seeing the massive outflow of people from agriculture into cities, the government started to massively subsidize the cooperatives in order to make the standard of living of farmers equal to that of city inhabitants; this was the long-term official policy of the government. Funds, machinery, and fertilizers were provided; young people from villages were forced to study agriculture; and students were regularly sent (involuntarily) to help in cooperatives.

Subsidies and constant pressure destroyed the remaining private farmers; only a handful of them remained after the 1960s. The lifestyle of villagers had eventually reached the level of cities, and village poverty was eliminated. Czechoslovakia was again able to produce enough food for its citizens. The price of this success was a huge waste of resources because the cooperatives had no incentive to improve efficiency. Every piece of land was cultivated regardless of the expense involved, and the soil became heavily polluted with chemicals. Also, the intensive use of heavy machinery damaged topsoil. Furthermore, the cooperatives were infamous for over-employment.

In the late 1980s, the economy of Czechoslovakia stagnated, and the state-owned companies were unable to deal with advent of modern technologies. A few agricultural companies (where the rules were less strict than in state companies) used this situation to start providing high-tech products. For example, the only way to buy a PC-compatible computer in the late 1980s was to get it (for an extremely high price) from one agricultural company acting as a reseller.

After the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of Communism]] in Czechoslovakia (1989) subsidies to agriculture were halted with devastating effect. Most of the cooperatives had problems competing with technologically advanced foreign competition and were unable to obtain investment to improve their situation. Quite a large percentage of them collapsed. The others that remained were typically insufficiently funded, lacking competent management, without new machinery and living from day to day. Employment in the agricultural sector dropped significantly (from approximately 25% of the population to approximately 1%).

=== East Germany ===
Collective farms obtained the name [[Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft]] (LPG).

=== Poland ===
{{main|Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic}}
The Polish name of a collective farm was Rolnicza spółdzielnia produkcyjna. Collectivisation in [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] was stopped in 1956, later nationalisation was supported.

=== Yugoslavia ===
{{main article|Collectivization in Yugoslavia}}
Collective farming was introduced as government policy throughout [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after World War II, by taking away land from wealthy pre-war owners and limiting possessions in private ownership first to 25, and later to 10 hectares. The large, state-owned farms were known as "Agricultural cooperatives" ("Zemljoradničke [[Zadruga|zadruge]]" in Serbo-Croatian) and farmers working on them had to meet production quotas in order to satisfy the needs of the populace. This system was largely abolished in the 1950s. See: [[Law of 23 August 1945]] with amendments until 1 December 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:UZWDAViNVr4J:dediserver.eu/hosting/ethnodoc/data/YU19450823-2.pdf+Die+Agrarreform+in+Jugoslavien&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=at&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgQ6hkM0U0aGSo4FHytGeO9haYdav34kySEM5wKdHlw6BZv_ne6l7KxkTYU8ZwUJcIHGXGsvuYgLSDLnuTFsG56zyGB6NSDvWY-ruc24PLJeufP5sK3vuaueb1RkSQcF6smZWpv&amp;sig=AHIEtbRt1zfJs25dwzi_c4WShN1uD_m46Q German translation of the Law of 23 August 1945 with amendments until 1 December 1948.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{main|People's commune|Production brigade|Production team (China)}}
Under the leadership of Mao Zedong (1949–1976), the [[People's Republic of China]] experienced an era of collectivization. Similar to Stalin's ideals, Mao tried to rapidly convert the Chinese economy to a socialist society through industrialization and collectivization, in a period known as, "[[The Great Leap Forward]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/mao-and-great-leap-forwardf&lt;/ref&gt; The era was a disaster for the Chinese people, due to the inability of the farmers to meet quota expectations, which caused "[[The Great Chinese Famine]]," where nearly 30 million people died of hunger.

After the death of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping reformed the collective farming method. From this time, nearly all Chinese crops began to blossom, not just grain.  The reform included the removal of land from rich land owners for use of agricultural land for peasants, but not ownership. This policy increased production and helped reverse the effects of The Great Leap Forward.  The two main reasons why China succeeded was because 1) the government chose to make gradual changes, which kept the monopoly of the Communist Party and 2) because the reform process began from the bottom and later expanded to the top.  Throughout the reform process, the Communist Party reacted positively to the bottom-up reform initiatives that emerged from the rural population. Deng Xiaoping described the reform process as, "fording the river by feeling for the stones." This statement refers to the Chinese people who called for the reforms they wanted, by "placing the stones at his feet" and he would then just approve the reforms the people wanted.  The peasants started their own "household responsibility system" apart from the government.  After Chinese trade was privately deemed successful, all Xiaoping had to do was approve its legalization.  This increased competition between farmers domestically and internationally, meaning the low wage working class began to be known worldwide, increasing the Chinese FDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/research/how-china-won-and-russia-lost?_sm_au_=iVVk5Rjq7ZW33QN6|title=How China Won and Russia Lost|author=|date=|website=hoover.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that Chinese peasants slaughtered massive numbers of draft animals as a response to collectivization, as this would allow them to keep the meat and hide, and not transfer the draft animals to the collectives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shuo|last2=Lan|first2=Xiaohuan|date=2017|title=There Will Be Killing: Collectivization and Death of Draft Animals|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160247|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=58–77|doi=10.1257/app.20160247|issn=1945-7782|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study estimates that "the animal loss during the movement was 12 to 15 percent, or 7.4-9.5 million dead. Grain output dropped by 7 percent due to lower animal inputs and lower productivity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mongolia ===

=== North Korea ===
{{main|Agriculture in North Korea}}
In the late 1990s, the collective farming system [[North Korean famine|collapsed under a strain of droughts]]. Estimates of deaths due to starvation ranged into the millions, although the government did not allow outside observers to survey the extent of the famine. Aggravating the severity of the famine, the government was accused of diverting international relief supplies to its armed forces. Agriculture in North Korea has suffered tremendously from natural disasters, a lack of fertile land, and government mismanagement, often causing the nation to rely on foreign aid as its primary source of food.

=== Vietnam ===
{{main|Land reform in Vietnam}}
The [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] implemented collective farming although ''de jure'' private ownership existed. Starting in 1958 collective farming was pushed such that by 1960, 85% of farmers and 70% of farmlands were collectivized including those seized by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edu.go.vn/pages/hoc-truc-tuyen/ElearningDetail.aspx?docid=3891&amp;sid=0|title=XÂY DỰNG CHỦ NGHĨA XÃ HỘI Ở MIỀN BẮC (Building socialism in the North)|author=|date=|website=go.vn|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivization however was seen by the communist leadership as a half-measure when compared to full state ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/Tieu-diem/2010/1590/Van-de-van-hoa-trong-tu-tuong-Ho-Chi-Minh-ve-phat.aspx|title=Tạp chí Cộng Sản - Vấn đề văn hóa trong tư tưởng Hồ Chí Minh về phát triển đất nước|author=|date=|website=www.tapchicongsan.org.vn|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Fall of Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, [[South Vietnam]] briefly came under the authority of a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]], a [[puppet state]] under military occupation by [[North Vietnam]], before being officially reunified with the North under Communist rule as the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] on 2 July 1976.  Upon taking control, the Vietnamese communists banned other political parties, arrested suspects believed to have collaborated with the United States and embarked on a mass campaign of [[collectivization]] of farms and factories. Private land ownership was "transformed" to subsume under State and collective ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdla.gov.vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1686 Ngành quản lý đất đai Việt Nam: 66 năm phát triển và trưởng thành (Land management in Vietnam, 66 years of development)]&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstruction of the war-ravaged country was slow and serious humanitarian and economic problems confronted the communist regime.

In a historic shift in 1986, the Communist Party of Vietnam implemented [[free-market]] reforms known as {{lang|vi|[[Doi Moi|Đổi Mới]]}} (''Renovation''). With the authority of the state remaining unchallenged, private enterprise, deregulation and foreign investment were encouraged. Land ownership nonetheless is the sole prerogative of the state. The [[economy of Vietnam]] has achieved rapid growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction and housing, exports and foreign investment. However, the power of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] over all organs of government remains firm.

=== Cuba ===
{{main|Agriculture in Cuba}}
In the initial years that followed the [[Cuban Revolution]], government authorities experimented with agricultural and farming production cooperatives. Between 1977 and 1983, farmers began to collectivize into [[CPA (agriculture)|CPA]]s – {{lang|es|Cooperativa de Producción Agropecuaria}} (Agricultural Production Cooperatives). Farmers were encouraged to sell their land to the state for the establishment of a cooperative farm, receiving payments for a period of 20 years while also sharing in the fruits of the CPA. Joining a CPA allowed individuals who were previously dispersed throughout the countryside to move to a centralized location with increased access to electricity, medical care, housing, and schools. Democratic practice tends to be limited to business decisions and is constrained by the centralized economic planning of the Cuban system.

Another type of agricultural production cooperative in Cuba is [[UBPC]] – ''Unidad Básica de Producción Cooperativa'' (Basic Unit of Cooperative Production). The law authorizing the creation of UBPCs was passed on 20 September 1993. It has been used to transform many state farms into UBPCs, similar to the transformation of Russian [[sovkhoz]]es (state farms) into [[kolkhoz]]es (collective farms) since 1992. The law granted indefinite [[usufruct]] to the workers of the UBPC in line with its goal of linking the workers to the land. It established material incentives for increased production by tying workers' earnings to the overall production of the UBPC, and increased managerial autonomy and workers' participation in the management of the workplace.

=== Tanzania ===
The move to a collective farming method in [[Tanzania]] was based on the Soviet model for rural development. In 1967, President [[Julius Nyerere]] issued "Socialism and Rural Development" which proposed the creation of Ujamaa Villages. Since the majority of the rural population was spread out, and agriculture was traditionally undertaken individually, the rural population had to be forced to move together, to farm communally. Following forced migration, incentive to participate in communal farming activities was encouraged by government recognition.

These incentives, in addition to encouraging a degree of participation, also lured those whose primary interests were not the common good to the Ujamaa villages. This, in addition to the Order of 1973 dictating that all people had to live in villages ([[Operation Vijiji]])&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Siri. (2008) ''[http://www.cmi.no/publications/publication/?3008=land-tenure-and-mining-in-tanzania Land Tenure and Mining In Tanzania]''. Bergen: Chr. Michelson Institute, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; eroded the sustainability of communal projects. In order for the communal farms to be successful, each member of the village would have to contribute to the best of their ability. Due to lack of sufficient foreign exchange, mechanization of the labour was impossible, therefore it was essential that every villager contributed to manual labour.

=== Europe ===
In modern [[Europe]] collective farms are very uncommon{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}, although in [[France]] (the [[European Union]]'s largest agricultural producer) [[Cooperative#Worker cooperative|cooperative agriculture]] represents 40% of the national food industry's production and nearly 90 Billion € in gross revenue, covering one out of three food brands in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lacooperationagricole.coop/une-reussite-economique-et-sociale|title=La coopération agricole, un modèle entreprenarial|author=|date=|website=www.lacooperationagricole.coop|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latribune.fr/actualites/economie/france/20140927trib98472bab5/les-grandes-cooperatives-agricoles-ces-entreprises-francaises-en-plein-boom.html|title=Les grandes coopératives agricoles, ces entreprises françaises en plein boom|author=|date=|website=latribune.fr|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[intentional communities]] which practice collective agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Longo Mai]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Camphill movement]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing number of [[community supported agriculture]] initiatives, some of which operate under consumer/worker governance, that could be considered collective farms.

=== India ===
In Indian villages a single field (normally a plot of three to five acres) may be farmed collectively by the villagers, who each offer labour as a devotional offering, possibly for one or two days per cropping season. The resulting crop belongs to no one individual, and is used as an offering. The labour input is the offering of the peasant in their role as priests. The wealth generated by the sale of the produce belongs to the Gods and hence is Apaurusheya or impersonal. ''Shrambhakti'' (labour contributed as devotional offering) is the key instrument for generation of internal resources. The benefits of the harvest are most often redistributed in the village for common good as well as individual need – not as loan or charity, but as divine grace (''prasad''). The recipient is under no obligation to repay it and no interest need be paid on such gifts. Giving and receiving of these sums is done so discreetly and with such subtle grace that any sense of inferiority on the part of the recipients is obviated. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Israel ===
Collective farming was also implemented in [[kibbutz]]im in Israel, which began in 1909 as a unique combination of [[Zionism]] and socialism – known as [[Labor Zionism]]. The concept has faced occasional criticism as economically inefficient and over-reliant on subsidized credit.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Kislev, Z. Lerman, P. Zusman, "Recent experience with cooperative farm credit in Israel", ''[[Economic Development and Cultural Change]]'', 39(4):773–789 (July 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesser-known type of collective farm in Israel is [[moshav shitufi]] (lit. ''collective settlement''), where production and services are managed collectively, as in a kibbutz, but consumption decisions are left to individual households. In terms of cooperative organization, moshav shitufi is distinct from the much more common [[moshav]] (or ''moshav ovdim''), essentially a village-level service cooperative, not a collective farm.

In 2006 there were 40 moshavim shitufi'im in Israel, compared with 267 kibbutzim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.gov.il ''Statistical Abstract of Israel''], Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective farming in Israel differs from collectivism in communist states in that it is voluntary. However, including moshavim, various forms of collective farming have traditionally been and remain the primary agricultural model, as there are only a small number of completely private farms in Israel outside of the moshavim.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico the [[Ejido]] system provided poor farmers with collective use rights to agricultural land.

=== Canada and United States ===
The [[Anabaptist]] [[Hutterites]] have farmed communally since the 16th century. Most of them now live on the prairies of Canada and the northern [[Great Plains]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Hutterites.htm| title=The Hutterian Bretheren|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Constitutional Movement''' was a right wing political group in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was formed in 1979 by [[Andrew Fountaine]] as the '''National Front Constitutional Movement''', a splinter group from the [[British National Front|National Front]]. Offering a more moderate alternative to the NF, the Constitutional Movement claimed to have 2000 members by 1980.&lt;ref&gt;S. Taylor, ''The National Front in English Politics'', London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Within the National Front in the late 1970s there was a growing disaffection with the leadership of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and his associate [[Martin Webster]] and in particular their adherence to [[neo-Nazi]] principles rather than what the critics believed to be the vote-winning alternative of a more [[populism|populist]] British nationalism. Already by 1978 Andrew Fountaine had become the focal point for a number of members of the anti-Tyndall faction and their position was strengthened by the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] in which the NF put forward the greatest number of candidates in its history but failed to make any headway with the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Thurlow, ''Fascism in Britain A History, 1918-1985'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was born in a time of serious division in the British far right and competed with a number of other parties for attention. Such was the confusion at the time that party operations were even based at Excalibur House (London, EC2), which continued to be the HQ of the main NF.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bean]], ''Many Shades of Black: Inside Britain's Far-Right'', London: New Millennium, 1999, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Fountaine had split from the NF in opposition to what he claimed was the increasing [[Nazism]] amongst the leadership, the encouragement of links with violent subcultures such as [[football hooliganism]] and [[Nazi skinhead]]s as well as a strong current of [[homosexuality]] which he claimed existed amongst the leadership.&lt;ref name="Org"&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The new party ambitiously launched itself as an alternative to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and hoped to win votes and members from the right-wing of the Tories.&lt;ref name="Hill91"&gt;R. Hill &amp; A. Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror - Inside Europe’s Neo-Nazi Network'', London: Collins, 1988, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[British Democratic Party]], which broke away from the NF at the time, the party sought to distance itself from the vote-losing open [[Nazism]] that both groups associated with John Tyndall, Martin Webster and the other leaders of the NF.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The Movement produced its own newspaper, ''Frontline News'' as well as a magazine ''Excalibur'', the latter edited by Terry Savage, a veteran of the [[National Labour Party (UK, 1957)|National Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="Bean"/&gt;

==Development==
The party campaigned for the [[Greater London Council election, 1981|1981 GLC election]] although the results proved disappointing and during the course of the campaign their Excalibur House HQ was damaged by a fire and a campaigner, Anthony Donnelly, was murdered in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]].&lt;ref name="Bean"&gt;Bean, ''Many Shades of Black'', p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Following this disastrous election Fountaine announced his retirement from politics, leaving the Constitutional Movement without a strong leader.&lt;ref&gt;R. Weight, ''Patriots: National Identity in Britain 1940-2000'', London: Pan, 2003, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of this campaign, in which the party lost out to both the original NF and the [[New National Front]], saw the party go into decline. Not long after this the party was contacted by Tyndall, [[Ray Hill]] and [[Charles Parker (UK politician)|Charles Parker]] as part of their Committee for Nationalist Unity initiative in which they were aiming to forge a united far-right group from the NNF, Hill's wing of the [[British Movement]] and other groups such as the Constitutional Movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Although the group did not join this initiative it lost Robin May, the main organiser in the [[East End of London]], to Tyndall's group.&lt;ref name="Hill p. 163"&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; A number of party members followed May and joined him in attending the March 1982 meeting at [[Charing Cross Hotel]] in which Tyndall, Parker, Hill, [[Kenneth McKilliam]] and John Peacock announced the conversion of the Committee for Nationalist Unity into the [[British National Party]].&lt;ref name="Hill p. 163"/&gt;

==Disappearance==
The Constitutional Movement changed its name to the '''Nationalist Party''' soon after the formation of the BNP and under this title it contested five seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]]. However the Nationalist Party performed very poorly in this election and the next time the party hit the headlines was when one former member, Richard Franklin, was revealed as a Conservative candidate in local elections in 1983.&lt;ref name="Hill91"/&gt;

The Nationalist Party made its last appearance in a 1984 by-election in the [[Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Southgate]] constituency, with James Kershaw polling only 80 votes in a seat won by [[Michael Portillo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://by-elections.co.uk/enfield84.html By-election result] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329041126/http://by-elections.co.uk/enfield84.html |date=2012-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was gone soon after this, with most of the members joining the British National Party.

'''Equality Alabama''' (EA) is a statewide [[non-profit]] [[civil rights]] organization that advocates for the rights of [[LGBTQ]] people in [[Alabama]].

==Background==
Equality Alabama was formed by the 2002 merger of the '''Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Alabama''' and '''Equality Begins at Home of Central Alabama'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityalabama.org/about/mission.html |title=Mission |work=Equality Alabama |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began to increase its activity prior to the 2005 referendum that banned [[same-sex marriage]] in the state.  Representatives for the organization have stated that the additional visibility was in reaction to increasingly anti-gay legislation being brought forth in the state government.  Proposed, but thus far not enacted, state legislation has included banning the [[LGBT adoption|adoption of children by LGBT people]] and prohibiting libraries from purchasing literature that portrays homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle.&lt;ref name="gadtimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay Rights Group Comes Out In Alabama |author=Phillip Rawls |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nXIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WdwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3826,1997252&amp;dq=equality-alabama&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Gadsden Times |date=August 21, 2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' in 2003, Ken Baker of Equality Alabama told ''[[The New York Times]]'': "Some people in our organization are very concerned about a backlash. We'll deal with it if it happens."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/us/adversaries-on-gay-rights-vow-state-by-state-fight.html Sarah Kershaw, "Adversaries on Gay Rights Vow State-by-State Fight," July 6, 2003], accessed February 5, 2012: "Alabama is considered by gay rights activists to be one of the most resistant states to gay rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Equality Alabama received public criticism for lacking diversity in its leadership and programs — particularly women, racial minorities, and transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hansen|first=Michael|title=LGBT advocates welcome Human Rights Campaign to the South|url=http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/04/lgbt_advocate_welcomes_human_r.html|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=The Birmingham News|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former board member described a situation that arose after discussions about diversity that "turned sour." In the op-ed in ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', Michael Hansen wrote, "The conversation ended with a white man explicating that he was perfectly capable of doing the work on behalf of minorities, women and transgender people."

==Opposition to Sanctity of Marriage Amendment==
In 2005, when the state legislature voted to hold a public referendum on the [[Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment]], Equality Alabama's chair [[Howard Bayless]] said the legislators were "meddling into the lives of families. The government is deciding what our families are and what families are made of, and to me that's unconscionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriage: You decide |author=Phillip Rawls |url=http://archive.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050311/gay.shtml |newspaper=Decatur Daily |date=March 11, 2005 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the referendum, Equality Alabama opened offices in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and sponsored programs to increase LGBT visibility and attempt to sway voters.&lt;ref name="gadtimes"/&gt;  The amendment passed, however, by an 81% margin in favor of forbidding recognition of same-sex marriages and civil unions.&lt;ref name="adfal"&gt;[http://www.domawatch.org/stateissues/alabama/index.html DOMAwatch.org - Alabama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308041706/http://www.domawatch.org/stateissues/alabama/index.html |date=March 8, 2005 }} [[Alliance Defense Fund]]. 2006. Accessed February 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Equality Alabama partners with other [[human rights]] organizations. It is a member of the Alabama Safe Schools Coalition, a coalition dedicated to making Alabama schools into learning environments that are free from discrimination, harassment, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/alabamasafeschoolscoalition/Home |title=Home |work=Alabama Safe Schools Coalition |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality Alabama is also a member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref name="eqfed-members"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/members | title=Member Organizations | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vigil for Victims of Hate and Violence===
The organization cosponsors the annual Vigil for Victims of Hate and Violence.  The event is held to heighten awareness of the lack of [[hate crime]] legislation in Alabama that includes crimes based upon the perception of a person's sexual orientation or their gender.&lt;ref name="tvnews1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay rights advocates rally in Montgomery to expand hate crime law |author=Fred Davenport |url=http://www.waff.com/story/16971590/gay-rights-advocates-rally-in-montgomery-for-a-change-in-the-hate-crime-laws |newspaper=WAFF NBC 48 |date=Feb 20, 2012  |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is usually held on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol]].&lt;ref name="rallynews1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Insight: Equality Alabama announces legislative agenda |author=Joe Openshaw |url=http://blog.al.com/press-register-commentary/2011/02/insight_equality_alabama_annou.html |newspaper=Press-Register |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rallynews2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Annual vigil helps raise awareness of hate crimes |author=Teri Greene |url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20120220/NEWS01/202200313/Annual-vigil-helps-raise-awareness-hate-crimes |newspaper=Montgomery Advertiser |date=February 20, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cosponsors of the event include the Alabama chapter of the [[National Organization for Women]], Alabama Safe Schools Coalition, Immanuel Presbyterian Church of Montgomery, the New Hope [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the Montgomery chapter of [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]], the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], and the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Fellowship of Montgomery.&lt;ref name="rallynews2"/&gt;

A '''family farm''' is generally understood to be a farm owned and/or operated by a [[family]]; it is sometimes considered to be an [[Estate (land)|estate]] passed down by [[inheritance]]. Family farm businesses can take many forms, as most farm families have structured their farm businesses as corporations, limited liability corporations, and trusts, for liability, tax, and business purposes. It is a common misconception that all farms with these business structures are not family farms, when in actuality that is not true. In the United States for example, a 2014 USDA report shows that family farms operate 90 percent of the nation’s farmland, and account for 85 percent of the country’s agricultural production value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2015/01/13/us-farms-large-and-small#more-56211|title=U.S. Farms, Large and Small {{!}} USDA|website=www.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept or definition does not easily translate across languages or cultures, as there are substantial differences in the agricultural traditions and histories  between countries. Thus, [[Agriculture in the United States|in the United States]], a family farm can be of any size, while [[Agriculture in Brazil|in Brazil]], the official definition of a family farm (''agricultura familiar'') is limited to small farms worked primarily by members of a single family.&lt;ref&gt;Farms are those that employ mostly family members, with a maximum of five additional temporary workers. {{cite web |url=http://www.bnb.gov.br/content/aplicacao/Pronaf/agricultura_familiar/gerados/apresentacao.asp |title=Agricultura familiar – apresentação |language=Portuguese |author=Banco do Nordeste |work= |date= |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002064625/http://www.bnb.gov.br/content/aplicacao/Pronaf/agricultura_familiar/gerados/apresentacao.asp |archivedate=2 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farms that would not be considered family farms would be those operated as collectives, non-family corporations, or in other institutionalised forms.

At least 500 million of the world's [estimated] 570 million farms are managed by families, making family farms predominant in global agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/260535/icode/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowder&gt;Lowder, S. K., J. Skoet and S. Singh. 2014. What do we really know about the number and distribution of farms and family farms worldwide? http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3729e/i3729e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
An "informal discussion of the concepts and definitions" in a working paper published by [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] in 2014 reviewed English, Spanish and French definitions of the concept of "family farm". 
Definitions referred to one or more of labor, management, size, provision of family livelihood, residence, family ties and generational aspects, community and social networks, subsistence orientation, patrimony, land ownership and family investment.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, E. and A. P. de la O Campos. 2014. Identifying the "family farm" – An informal discussion of the concepts and definitions. ESA Working Paper 14-10. FAO, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity of definitions reflects national and geographical differences in cultures, rural land tenure, and rural economies, as well as the different purposes for which definitions are coined.

The 2012 [[United States Census of Agriculture]] defines a family farm as "any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator, including relatives who do not live in the operator’s household"; it defines a farm as "any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during a given year."&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. 2015. 2012 Census of Agriculture. Farm typology. Vol. 2. Subject series. Part 10. AC-12-S-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines a "family farm" as one that relies primarily on family members for labour and management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/207544/icode&lt;/ref&gt;

In some usages, "family farm" implies that the farm remains within the ownership of a family over a number of generations.&lt;ref name= Bjørhaug2008&gt;Bjørhaug, H. and A. Blekesaune. 2008. Gender and work in Norwegian family farms. Sociologia ruralis 48: 152–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being special-purpose definitions, the definitions found in laws or regulations may differ substantially from commonly understood meanings of "family farm". For example, In the United States, under federal Farm Ownership loan regulations, the definition of a "family farm" does not specify the nature of farm ownership, and management of the farm is either by the borrower, or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation, co-operative or other entity. The complete definition can be found in the US [[Code of Federal Regulations]] 7 CFR 1943.4.

==History==
[[File:Millstätter Berg Obermillstatt Lammersdorf 2013a.jpg|thumb|[[Dispersed settlement]] landscape in [[Carinthia]].]]
[[File:San Martin de Tor - Seres.jpg|thumb|Mountain farms in [[South Tyrol]].]]
In the [[Roman Republic]], ''[[latifundia]]'', great [[landed estate]]s, specialised  in agriculture destined for export, producing grain, olive oil, or wine, corresponding largely to modern [[industrialized agriculture]] but depending on [[slave labour]] instead of mechanization, developed after the [[Second Punic War]] and increasingly replaced the former system of family-owned small or intermediate farms in the [[Roman Empire]] period. The basis of the latifundia in Spain and Sicily was the ''[[ager publicus]]'' that fell to the dispensation of the state through Rome's policy of war in the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD.

In the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the largely [[Roman villa|self-sufficient villa-system]] of the latifundia remained among the few political-cultural centres of a fragmented Europe. These latifundia had been of great importance economically, until the long-distance shipping of wine and oil, grain and ''[[garum]]'' disintegrated, but extensive lands controlled in a single pair of hands still constituted ''power'': it can be argued that the latifundia formed part of the economic basis of the European social [[feudal system]], taking the form of [[Manorialism]], the essential element of  feudal society,&lt;ref&gt;"Feudal Society", in its modern sense was coined in [[Marc Bloch]]'s 1939–40 books of the same name. Bloch (''Feudal Society'', tr. L.A. Masnyon, 1965, vol. II, p. 442) emphasised the distinction between economic manorialism which preceded feudalism and survived it, and political and social feudalism, or ''seigneurialism''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the organizing principle of rural economy in medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sarris, "The Origins of the Manorial Economy: New Insights from Late Antiquity", ''The English Historical Review'' '''119''' (April 2004:279–311).&lt;/ref&gt;
Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a [[Lord of the Manor]], supported economically from his own direct landholding in a [[manor]] (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the [[peasant]] population under the jurisdiction of himself and his [[manorial court]].  
Manorialism died slowly and piecemeal, along with its most vivid feature in the landscape, the [[open field system]]. 
It outlasted [[serfdom]] as it outlasted feudalism: "primarily an economic organization, it could maintain a warrior, but it could equally well maintain a [[capitalist]] landlord. It could be self-sufficient, yield produce for the market, or it could yield a money rent."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jones, "The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Critical Comment" ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''32'''.4 (December 1972:938–944) p. 938; a comment on D. North and R. Thomas, "The rise and fall of the manorial system: a theoretical model", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''31''' (December 1971:777–803).&lt;/ref&gt; The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the [[French Revolution]]. In parts of eastern Germany, the ''Rittergut'' manors of [[Junker]]s remained until [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwin Spenkuch, "Herrenhaus und Rittergut: Die Erste Kammer des Landtags und der preußische  Adel von 1854 bis 1918 aus sozialgeschichtlicher Sicht" ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft'', '''25'''.3 (July&amp;nbsp;– September 1999):375–403).&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[common law]] of the [[leasehold estate]] relation evolved in [[medieval England]]. That law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a feudal social order. Under the tenant system, a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations, but what is inherited is not the farm's estate itself but the lease on the estate.
In much of Europe, serfdom was abolished only in the modern period, in Western Europe after the [[French Revolution]], in Russia [[Serfdom in Russia|as late as in 1861]].

In contrast to the Roman system of ''latifundia'' and the derived system of manoralism, the [[Germanic peoples]] had a system based on heritable estates owned by individual [[sibb|families or clans]]. 
The Germanic term for "heritable estate, [[:wikt:allodium|allodium]]" was ''*ōþalan'' ([[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:eþel|ēþel]]''), which incidentally was also used as a [[Odal (rune)|rune name]]; the gnomic verse on this term in the [[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]] reads:
:''[Ēðel] byþ oferleof æghwylcum men, gif he mot ðær rihtes and gerysena on brucan on bolde bleadum oftast.'' 
:"[An estate] is very dear to every man, if he can enjoy there in his house  whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity."

In the inheritance system known as [[Salic patrimony]] (also ''[[gavelkind]]'' in its exceptional survival in medieval Kent)
refers to this  [[clan]]-based possession of [[real estate]] property, particularly in [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] context. ''Terra salica'' could not be sold or otherwise disposed; it was not [[alienable]].   
Much of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic Europe]] has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism, where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs, and the Germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family. Historical prevalence of the Germanic system of independent estates or ''Höfe'' resulted in  [[dispersed settlement]] (''Streusiedlung'')  structure, as opposed to the [[village]]-centered settlements of manoralism.

[[File:Beowulf - hofe.jpg|thumb|Mention of "hofe" in ''[[Beowulf]]'']]
In [[German-speaking Europe]], farming estates are known as ''Hof''; 
this German word notably has the meaning of both "farming estate" and "[[court (royal)|royal court]]", in origin referring to the building or hall at the center of any independent estate. 
The recharacterized compound ''Bauernhof'' was formed in the early modern period to designate family farming estates, while ''Meierhof'' designated a manorial estate, and the unmarked term ''Hof'' was increasingly used for the royal or noble court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Christoph Adelung]], [http://lexika.digitale-sammlungen.de/adelung/lemma/bsb00009131_4_0_641 Grammatisch-kritisches Wörterbuch] (1774).&lt;/ref&gt;
The estate as a whole is referred to by the collective ''Gehöft'' (15th century); the corresponding Slavic concept being ''[[Khutor]]''.
''Höfeordnung'' is the German legal term for the inheritance laws regarding family farms, deriving from inheritance under medieval [[Saxon law]]. 
In England, the title of [[yeoman]] was applied to such land-owning commoners from the 15th century.

In the early modern and modern period, the dissolution of manoralism went parallel to the development of [[intensive farming]] parallel to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Mechanization]] enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at [[subsistence farming]], resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms, with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of [[Wage labour|industrial wage-labourers]] and partly emigrating to the [[New World]] or the [[Russian Empire]] (following the [[serfdom in Russia|1861 emancipation of the serfs]]). The family farms established in Imperial Russia were again [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized under the Soviet Union]], but the emigration of European farmers displaced by the Industrial Revolution contributed to the emergence of a system of family estates in the Americas ([[Homestead Act]] 1862).

[[Thomas Jefferson]]'s argument that a large number of family estates are a factor in ensuring the stability of [[democracy]] was repeatedly used in support of subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wesley F. Peterson: ''A Billion Dollars a Day: The Economics and Politics of Agricultural Subsidies''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, 127s.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developed world==

===Perceptions of the family farm===
In [[Developed country|developed countries]] the family farm is viewed sentimentally, as a lifestyle to be preserved for tradition's sake, or as a [[wikt:birthright|birthright]]. It is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in [[agricultural policy]], most commonly in [[France]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]], where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable. In these countries, strange bedfellows can often be found arguing for similar measures despite otherwise vast differences in [[Ideology#Political ideologies|political ideology]]. For example, [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[Ralph Nader]], both candidates for the office of [[President of the United States]], held rural [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]] together and spoke for measures to preserve the so-called family farm. On other economic matters they were seen as generally opposed, but found common ground on this one.

The social roles of family farms are much changed today. Until recently, staying in line with traditional and conservative sociology, the heads of the household were usually the oldest man followed closely by his oldest sons. The wife generally took care of the housework, child rearing, and financial matters pertaining to the farm. However, agricultural activities have taken on many forms and change over time. [[Agronomy]], [[horticulture]], [[aquaculture]], [[silviculture]], and [[apiculture]], along with traditional plants and animals, all make up aspects of today's family farm. Farm wives often need to find work away from the farm to supplement farm income and children sometimes have no interest in farming as their chosen field of work.

Bolder promoters argue that as agriculture has become more efficient with the application of modern [[management]] and new technologies in each generation, the idealized classic family farm is now simply obsolete, or more often, unable to compete without the [[economies of scale]] available to larger and more modern farms. Advocates argue that family farms in all nations need to be protected, as the basis of rural society and social stability.

===Viability===

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, ninety-eight percent of all farms in the U.S. are family farms. Two percent of farms are not family farms, and those two percent make up fourteen percent of total agricultural output in the United States, although half of them have total sales of less than $50,000 per year. Overall, ninety-one percent of farms in the United States are considered "small family farms" (with sales of less than $250,000 per year), and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of U.S. agricultural output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/ersDownloadHandler.ashx?file=/media/862707/eib12c_002.pdf USDA's "U.S. Farms: Numbers, Size, and Ownership"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728124625/http://www.ers.usda.gov/ersDownloadHandler.ashx?file=%2Fmedia%2F862707%2Feib12c_002.pdf |date=2014-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type and size of independently owned operation, some limiting factors are:
* '''Economies of scale''': Larger farms are able to bargain more competitively, purchase more competitively, profit from economic highs, and weather lows more readily through monetary inertia than smaller farms.
* '''Cost of inputs''': fertilizer and other agrichemicals can fluctuate dramatically from season to season, partially based on oil prices, a range of 25% to 200% is common over a few year period.
* '''oil prices''': Directly (for farm machinery) and somewhat less directly (long distance transport; production cost of agrichemicals), the cost of oil significantly impacts the year-to-year viability of all mechanized conventional farms.
* '''commodity futures''': the predicted price of [[commodity]] crops, hogs, grain, etc., can determine ahead of a season what seems economically viable to grow.
* '''technology user agreements''': a less publicly known factor, patented GE seed that is widely used for many crops, like cotton and soy, comes with restrictions on use, which can even include who the crop can be sold to.
* '''wholesale infrastructure''': A farmer growing larger quantities of a crop than can be sold directly to consumers has to meet a range of criteria for sale into the wholesale market, which include harvest timing and graded quality, and may also include variety, therefore, the market channel really determines most aspects of the farm decisionmaking.
* '''availability of financing''': Larger farms today often rely on lines of credit, typically from banks, to purchase the agrichemicals, and other supplies needed for each growing year. These lines are heavily affected by almost all of the other constraining factors.
* '''government economic intervention''': In some countries, notably the US and EU, government subsidies to farmers, intended to mitigate the impact on domestic farmers of economic and political activities in other areas of the economy, can be a significant source of farm income. Bailouts, when crises such as drought or the "[[mad cow disease]]" problems hit agricultural sectors, are also relied on. To some large degree, this situation is a result of the large-scale global markets farms have no alternative but to participate in.
* '''government and industry regulation''': A wide range of quotas, marketing boards and legislation governing agriculture impose complicated limits, and often require significant resources to navigate. For example, on the small farming end, in many jurisdictions, there are severe limits or prohibitions on the sale of livestock, dairy and eggs. These have arisen from pressures from all sides: food safety, environmental, industry marketing.
* '''real estate prices''': The growth of urban centers around the world, and the resulting [[urban sprawl]] have caused the price of centrally located farmland to skyrocket, while reducing the local infrastructure necessary to support farming, putting effectively intense pressure on many farmers to sell out.

Over the 20th century, the people of developed nations have collectively taken most of the steps down the path to this situation. Individual farmers opted for successive waves of new technology, happily "trading in their horses for a tractor", increasing their debt and their production capacity. This in turn required larger, more distant markets, and heavier and more complex financing. The public willingly purchased increasingly commoditized, processed, shipped and relatively inexpensive food. The availability of an increasingly diverse supply of fresh, uncured, unpreserved produce and meat in all seasons of the year (oranges in January, freshly killed steers in July, fresh pork rather than salted, smoked, or potassium-impregnated ham) opened an entirely new cuisine and an unprecedented healthy diet to millions of consumers who had never enjoyed such produce before. These abilities also brought to market an unprecedented variety of processed foods, such as corn syrup and bleached flour. For the family farm this new technology and increasingly complex marketing strategy has presented new and unprecedented challenges, and not all family farmers have been able to effectively cope with the changing market conditions.

===Local food and the organic movement===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
In the last few decades there has been a resurgence of interest in [[Organic food|organic]] and [[free range]] foods. A percentage of consumers have begun to question the viability of [[industrial agriculture]] practices and have turned to organic groceries that sell products produced on family farms including not only meat and produce but also such things as wheat germ [[bread]]s and natural lye [[soap]]s (as opposed to bleached white breads and petroleum based detergent bars). Others buy these products direct from family farms. The "new family farm" provides an alternative market in some localities with an array of traditionally and naturally produced products.

Such "organic" and "free-range" farming is attainable where a significant number of affluent urban and suburban consumers willingly pay a premium for the ideals of "locally produced produce" and "humane treatment of animals". Sometimes, these farms are hobby or part-time ventures, or supported by wealth from other sources. Viable farms on a scale sufficient to support modern families at an income level commensurate with urban and suburban upper-middle-class families are often large scale operations, both in area and capital requirements. These farms, family owned and operated in a technologically and economically conventional manner, produce crops and animal products oriented to national and international markets, rather than to local markets. In assessing this complex economic situation, it is important to consider all sources of income available to these farms; for instance, the millions of dollars in farm subsidies which the United States government offers each year. As fuel prices rise, foods shipped to national and international markets are already rising in price.

===United States===

In 2012, the United States had 2,039,093 family farms (as defined by USDA), accounting for 97 percent of all farms and 89 percent of census farm area in the United States.&lt;ref name=USCensusAg2012&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. 2014. 2012 Census of agriculture. United States summary and state data. Volume 1. Geographic area series. Part 51 AC-12-A-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the predominance of family farms, the types of farming conducted on US family farms are essentially those of US agriculture overall. A USDA survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of US farm production and 85 percent of US gross farm income. Mid-size and larger family farms account for 60 percent of US farm production and dominate US production of cotton, cash grain and hogs. Small family farms account for 26 percent of US farm production overall, and higher percentages of production of poultry, beef cattle, some other livestock and hay.

Several kinds of US family farms are recognized in USDA farm typology:

Small family farms are defined as those with annual gross cash farm income (GCFI) of less than $350,000; in 2011, these accounted for 90 percent of all US farms. Because low net farm incomes tend to predominate on such farms, most farm families on small family farms are extremely dependent on off-farm income. 
Small family farms in which the principal operator was mostly employed off-farm accounted for 42 percent of all farms and 15 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income was $788. 
Retirement family farms were small farms accounting for 16 percent of all farms and 7 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income was $5,002.

The other small family farm categories are those in which farming occupies at least 50 percent of the principal operator’s working time. These are:

Low-sales small family farms (with GCFI less than $150,000); 26 percent of all US farms, 18 percent of total US farm area, median net farm income $3,579.

Moderate-sales small family farms (with GCFI of $150,000 to $349,999); 5.44 percent of all US farms, 13 percent of total US farm area, median net farm income $67,986.

Mid-size family farms (GCFI of $350,000 to $999,999); 6 percent of all US farms, 22 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $154,538.

Large family farms (GCFI $1,000,000 to $4,999,999); 2 percent of all US farms, 14 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $476,234.

Very large family farms (GCFI over $5,000,000); &lt;1 percent of all US farms, 2 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $1,910,454.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppe, R.A. 2014. Structure and finances of U.S. farms: family farm report, 2014 edition. United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service EIB-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family farms include not only sole proprietorships and family partnerships, but also family corporations. Family-owned corporations account for 5 percent of all farms and 89 percent of corporate farms in the United States. About 98 percent of US family corporations owning farms are small, with no more than 10 shareholders; average net farm income of family corporate farms was $189,400 in 2012. (In contrast, 90 percent of US non-family corporations owning farms are small, having no more than 10 shareholders; average net cash farm income for US non-family corporate farms was $270,670 in 2012.)&lt;ref name=USCensusAg2012/&gt;

===Canada===

In Canada, the number of "family farms" cannot be inferred closely, because of the nature of census data, which do not distinguish family and non-family farm partnerships. In 2011, of Canada’s 205,730 farms, 55 percent were sole proprietorships, 25 percent were partnerships, 17 percent were family corporations, 2 percent were non-family corporations and &lt;1 percent were other categories.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada. 2011 Census of Agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt; Because some but not all partnerships involve family members, these data suggest that family farms account for between about 73 and 97 percent of Canadian farms. The family farm percentage is likely to be near the high end of this range, for two reasons. The partners in a [Canadian] farm partnership are typically spouses, often forming the farm partnership for tax reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Family farm partnerships. http://www.mnp.ca/en/media-centre/library/2010/10/1/family-farm-partnerships&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/business/farm-transfer-estate-planning/docs/farm-business-transfer-strategies-2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002185139/http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/business/farm-transfer-estate-planning/docs/farm-business-transfer-strategies-2014.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; family farm succession planning can use a partnership as a means of apportioning family farm tenure among family members when a sole proprietor is ready to transfer some or all of ownership and operation of a farm to offspring. Conversion of a sole proprietorship family farm to a family corporation may also be influenced by legal and financial, e.g. tax, considerations. The Canadian Encyclopedia estimates that more than 90 percent of Canadian farms are family operations.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Encyclopedia.  Farm law. http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/farm-law/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, of Canadian farms with more than one million dollars in annual gross farm receipts, about 63 percent were family corporations and 13 percent were non-family corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada. The financial picture of farms in Canada. http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ca-ra2006/articles/finpicture-portrait-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Analysis of data for 59,000 farms in the 12 member states of the European Community found that in 1989, about three-quarters of the farms were family farms, producing just over half of total agricultural output.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, B. 1993. The myth of the family farm: defining the family farm and assessing its importance in the European Community. J. Rural Studies 9: 359–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, there were approximately 139,900 family farms in Ireland, with an average size of 35.7 hectares per holding. (Nearly all farms in Ireland are family farms.)&lt;ref&gt;Teagasc. Agriculture in Ireland  {{cite web |url=http://www.teagasc.ie/agrifood/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428121110/http://www.teagasc.ie/agrifood/ |archivedate=2015-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ireland and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/key-eu-policy-areas/agriculture/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2000 World Census of Agriculture. Main results and metadata by country. 1996–2005. http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1595e/i1595e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, average family farm income was 25,483 euros in 2012. Analysis by Teagasc (Ireland’s Agriculture and Food Development Authority) estimates that 37 percent of Irish farms are economically viable and an additional 30 percent are sustainable due to income from off-farm sources; 33 percent meet neither criterion and are considered economically vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teagasc.ie/publications/2013/1935/NFSincomeestimates 2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newly industrialized countries==
In Brazil, there are about 4.37 million family farms. These account for 84.4 percent of farms, 24.3 percent of farmland area and 37.5 percent of the value of agricultural production.&lt;ref name=Lowder/&gt;

==Developing countries==
In sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of farms are family owned and worked.&lt;ref name=EPRS&gt;European Parliamentary Research Service. 2014 International Year of Family Farming http://epthinktank.eu/2014/04/14/2014-international-year-of-family-farming/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-Saharan agriculture was mostly defined by [[slash-and-burn]] [[subsistence farming]], historically spread by the [[Bantu expansion]]. 
Permanent farming estates were  established during [[Scramble for Africa|colonialism]], in the 19th to 20th century. 
After decolonisation, white farmers in some African countries have tended to be attacked, killed or evicted, notably [[South African farm attacks|in South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;Peta Thornycroft, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/1337554/Zimbabwe-mobs-widen-attacks-on-white-farmers.html Zimbabwe mobs widen attacks on white farmers], ''The Telegraph'', 15 August 2001.

"In 2000, when Mugabe began to target whites who farmed the land, there were about 4,000 whites owning tobacco, maize, sugar, wheat, and other profitable agricultural holdings. Now there are fewer than 150 white farmers."&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern Africa, "On peasant family farms ..., cash input costs are very low, non‐household labour is sourced largely from communal work groups through kinship ties, and support services needed to sustain production are minimal." On commercial family farms, "cash input costs are high, little non‐family labour is used and strong support services are necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Low, A., P. Akwenye and K. Kamwi. 1999. 2008.

== International Year of Family Farming ==
[[File:Official logo of International Year of Family Farming 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Logo of International Year of Family Farming 2014]]
At the 66th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], 2014 was formally declared to be the "International Year of Family Farming" (IYFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Official Website of the International Year of Family Farming 2014 |url=http://www.fao.org/family-farming-2014/ |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations was invited to facilitate its implementation, in collaboration with Governments, International Development Agencies, farmers' organizations and other relevant organizations of the United Nations system as well as relevant non-governmental organizations.

The goal of the 2014 IYFF is to reposition family farming at the centre of agricultural, environmental and social policies in the national agendas by identifying gaps and opportunities to promote a shift towards a more equal and balanced development. The 2014 IYFF will promote broad discussion and cooperation at the national, regional and global levels to increase awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by smallholders and help identify efficient ways to support family farmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5250">The use of '''fetal tissue in vaccines''' began in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; One of the first medical applications of [[fetus|fetal tissues]] was their use in the production of the first [[polio vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; For example, in the 1950s, scientists at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in [[Sweden]] propagated a [[polio virus]] in fetal cells to make into a polio vaccine. The resulting [[vaccine]] was given to about 2,000 children.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/fact-checking-congress-s-fetal-tissue-report |title=Fact-checking Congress’s fetal tissue report |last=Wadman |first=Meredith |date=2017-01-05 |website=Science |language=en |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tissues are no longer used in polio vaccine development.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Many other vaccines, including those for [[chicken pox vaccine|chicken pox]] and [[rubella vaccine|rubella]], are made using fetal tissue from two pregnancies terminated in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/17/health/fetal-tissue-explainer/index.html |title=How exactly fetal tissue is used for medicine |last=Storrs |first=Carina |date=2015-07-17 |website=CNN |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charo |first=R.

Vaccines that have been or are made using fetal tissue for the propagation of viruses include:

Of these, the vaccines approved for use in the United States include some of those against rabies ([[Imovax]]), rubella, chicken pox, shingles, and adenovirus (as of January 2017).&lt;ref name=science/&gt;
==Ethical issues==
Despite [[Holy See|the Vatican]]'s longstanding and complete opposition to [[abortion]], their [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] concluded in 2005 that parents should allow their children to receive vaccines made from fetal tissue, to protect them from [[infectious disease]]s. The Academy also called for the development of new vaccines that can be made by other means.&lt;ref name="nejm"/&gt; Similarly, the [[National Catholic Bioethics Center]] states on its website that "...one is morally free to use the vaccine regardless of its historical association with abortion. The reason is that the risk to public health, if one chooses not to vaccinate, outweighs the legitimate concern about the origins of the vaccine..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539 |title=What Aborted Fetuses Have to Do With Vaccines |last=News |first=A.

'''Food additives''' are substances added to [[food]] to preserve [[flavor]] or enhance its taste, appearance, or other qualities. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by [[pickling]] (with [[vinegar]]), [[salt]]ing, as with [[bacon]], preserving [[Candy|sweets]] or using [[sulfur dioxide]] as with [[wine]]s. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  Food additives also include substances that may be introduced to food indirectly (called "indirect additives") in the manufacturing process, through [[food packaging|packaging]], or during storage or transport.&lt;ref name=FDAoverview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Food Ingredients and Packaging Terms |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/Definitions/default.htm |publisher=FDA |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en |date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering ==
To regulate these additives, and inform consumers, each additive is assigned a unique number, termed as "[[E number]]s", which is used in [[Europe]] for all approved additives.  This numbering scheme has now been adopted and extended by the ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' Commission to internationally identify all additives,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news
 | last1 = Codex Alimentarius
 | title = Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives.
 | url = http://www.fao.org/tempref/codex/Meetings/CCFAC/ccfac31/INS_e.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of whether they are approved for use.

E numbers are all prefixed by "[[E]]", but countries outside Europe use only the number, whether the additive is approved in Europe or not.
For example, [[acetic acid]] is written as E260 on products sold in Europe, but is simply known as additive 260 in some countries.  Additive 103, [[alkannin]], is not approved for use in Europe so does not have an E number, although it is approved for use in [[Australia]]  and [[New Zealand]].  Since 1987, Australia has had an approved system of labelling for additives in packaged foods. Each food additive has to be named or numbered. The numbers are the same as in Europe, but without the prefix "E".

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) lists these items as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS);&lt;ref&gt;See also "[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/default.htm Food Additives]", Food and Drug Administration website&lt;/ref&gt; they are listed under both their [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] number and FDA regulation under the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]].
* See [[list of food additives]] for a complete list of all the names.

===Categories===
Food additives can be divided into several groups, although there is some overlap because some additives exert more than one effect.  For example, salt is both a preservative as well as a flavor.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Erich Lück and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski "Foods, 3. Food Additives" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a11_561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDAoverview&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Additives &amp; Ingredients - Overview of Food Ingredients, Additives &amp; Colors|url=https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm094211.htm#foodadd|publisher=FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition|accessdate=11 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Acidulents : [[Acidulent]]s confer sour or acid taste. Common acidulents include [[vinegar]], [[citric acid]], [[tartaric acid]], [[malic acid]], [[fumaric acid]], and [[lactic acid]].
;Acidity regulators : [[Acidity regulator]]s are used for controlling the [[pH]] of foods for stability or to affect activity of enzymes.
;Anticaking agents : [[Anticaking agent]]s keep powders such as milk powder from caking or sticking.
;Antifoaming and foaming agents : [[Defoamer|Antifoaming agents]] reduce or prevent foaming in foods.  Foaming agents do the reverse.
;Antioxidants : [[Antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin C]] are preservatives by inhibiting the degradation of food by [[oxygen]].
{{anchor|bulking}}
;Bulking agents : Bulking agents such as [[starch]] are additives that increase the bulk of a food without affecting its taste.
;Food coloring : [[Food coloring|Colorings]] are added to food to replace colors lost during preparation or to make food look more attractive.
;Fortifying agents: [[Vitamin]]s, [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]], and [[dietary supplement]]s to increase the nutritional value
;Color retention agents : In contrast to colorings, [[Colour retention agent|color retention agents]] are used to preserve a food's existing color.
;Emulsifiers : [[Emulsion#Emulsifiers|Emulsifiers]] allow water and oils to remain mixed together in an [[emulsion]], as in [[mayonnaise]], [[ice cream]], and homogenized [[milk]].
;Flavors : [[Flavor]]s are additives that give food a particular taste or smell, and may be derived from natural ingredients or created artificially.
;Flavor enhancers : [[Flavor|Flavor enhancers]] enhance a food's existing flavors.  A popular example is [[monosodium glutamate]].  Some flavor enhancers have their own flavors that are independent of the food.
;Flour treatment agents : [[Flour treatment agent]]s are added to [[flour]] to improve its color or its use in [[baking]].
;Glazing agents: [[Glazing agent]]s provide a shiny appearance or protective coating to foods.
;Humectants : [[Humectant]]s prevent foods from drying out.
;Tracer gas: [[Tracer gas]] allow for package integrity testing to prevent foods from being exposed to atmosphere, thus guaranteeing shelf life.
;Preservatives : [[Preservative]]s prevent or inhibit spoilage of food due to [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]] and other [[microorganism]]s.
;Stabilizers : [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|Stabilizers]], thickeners and gelling agents, like [[agar]] or [[pectin]] (used in [[Fruit preserves|jam]] for example) give foods a firmer texture.  While they are not true emulsifiers, they help to stabilize [[emulsion]]s.
;Sweeteners : [[Sugar substitute|Sweeteners]] are added to foods for flavoring. Sweeteners other than [[sugar]] are added to keep the [[food energy]] ([[calorie]]s) low, or because they have beneficial effects regarding [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Dental caries|tooth decay]], or [[diarrhea]].
;Thickeners : [[Thickening agent]]s are substances which, when added to the mixture, increase its [[viscosity]] without substantially modifying its other properties.
;Packaging : [[Bisphenols]], [[phthalates]], and [[Perfluorinated compound|perfluoroalkyl chemicals]] (PFCs) are indirect additives used in manufacturing or packaging.  In July 2018 the American Academy of Pediatrics called for more careful study of those three substances, along with [[nitrates]] and food coloring, as they might harm children during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Press release: Some Common Food Additives May Pose Health Risks to Children |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Says-Some-Common-Food-Additives-May-Pose-Health-Risks-to-Children.aspx |work=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and regulation==
With the increasing use of [[processed food]]s since the 19th century, food additives are more widely used. Many countries regulate their use. For example, [[boric acid]] was widely used as a food preservative from the 1870s to the 1920s,&lt;ref name=NutInj&gt;{{cite book |author=Bucci, Luke |title=Nutrition applied to injury rehabilitation and sports medicine |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1995 |pages=151 |isbn=0-8493-7913-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rev. Lyman Abbott (Ed.) | title = The Outlook (Vol. 65)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__bt37n7ncQC&amp;q=boric+acid+outlook&amp;dq=boric+acid+outlook&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBWoVChMI59n13MDwyAIVV-NjCh2v2A6V| publisher = Outlook Co. | year = 1900 | pages = 403}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was banned after [[World War I]] due to its toxicity, as demonstrated in animal and human studies. During [[World War II]], the urgent need for cheap, available food preservatives led to it being used again, but it was finally banned in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NutInj/&gt;  Such cases led to a general mistrust of food additives, and an application of the [[precautionary principle]] led to the conclusion that only additives that are known to be safe should be used in foods.  In the United States, this led to the adoption of the [[Delaney clause]], an amendment to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938, stating that no [[carcinogen]]ic substances may be used as food additives.  However, after the banning of [[sodium cyclamate|cyclamates]] in the United States and Britain in 1969, [[saccharin]], the only remaining legal [[artificial sweetener]] at the time, was found to cause cancer in rats.  Widespread public outcry in the United States, partly communicated to Congress by postage-paid postcards supplied in the packaging of [[Sweetened beverage|sweetened soft drinks]], led to the retention of saccharin, despite its violation of the Delaney clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Assessment of technologies for determining cancer risks from the environment | publisher = DIANE publishing | year = 1981 | location = Darby, Pennsylvania, USA | pages = 177 | isbn = 1-4289-2437-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000, saccharin was found to be carcinogenic in rats due only to their unique urine chemistry.&lt;ref name="Whysner-1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Whysner | first1 = J. | last2 = Williams | first2 = GM. | title = Saccharin mechanistic data and risk assessment: urine composition, enhanced cell proliferation, and tumor promotion | journal = Pharmacol Ther | volume = 71 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 225–52 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(96)00069-1| pmid = 8910956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dybing-2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Dybing | first1 = E. | title = Development and implementation of the IPCS conceptual framework for evaluating mode of action of chemical carcinogens | journal = Toxicology | volume = 181-182 | issue = | pages = 121–5 |date=December 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00266-4| pmid = 12505296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperactivity===
Periodically, concerns have been expressed about a linkage between additives and [[hyperactivity]],&lt;ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] published an official shoppers' guidance with which the concerns of food additives and their labeling are mediated.&lt;ref name=crso&gt;{{cite web| last =[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Choosing the Right Stuff - the official shoppers’ guide to food additives and labels, kilojoules and fat content| work =| publisher =| year =2007| url =http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/| doi =| accessdate =3 May 2009| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090514070251/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/| archivedate =14 May 2009| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the EU it can take 10 years or more to obtain approval for a new food additive. This includes five years of safety testing, followed by two years for evaluation by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] and another three years before the additive receives an EU-wide approval for use in every country in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandingfoodadditives.org/pages/Ch3p1.htm|title=Loading...|website=www.understandingfoodadditives.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from testing and analyzing food products during the whole production process to ensure safety and compliance with regulatory standards, [[Trading Standards]] officers (in the UK) protect the public from any illegal use or potentially dangerous mis-use of food additives by performing random testing of food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandingfoodadditives.org/pages/Ch3p2.htm|title=Loading...|website=www.understandingfoodadditives.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been significant controversy associated with the risks and benefits of food additives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-truth-about-seven-common-food-additives|publisher=WebMD|title=The Truth About 7 Common Food Additives|date=17 December 2008|author=Martin Downs, MPH}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Natural additives may be similarly harmful or be the cause of allergic reactions in certain individuals. For example, [[safrole]] was used to flavor [[root beer]] until it was shown to be carcinogenic.  Due to the application of the Delaney clause, it may not be added to foods, even though it occurs naturally in [[sassafras]] and sweet [[basil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fennema, Owen R. |title=Food chemistry |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=1996 |pages=827 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micronutrients===
A subset of food additives, [[micronutrient]]s added in [[food fortification]] processes preserve [[nutrient value]] by providing [[vitamin]]s and [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] to  foods such as flour, cereal, margarine and milk which normally would not retain such high levels. [[Preservative]]s also reduce spoilage from sources such as air, bacteria, fungi, and yeast.&lt;ref&gt;IFIC.

==Science==
Many food additives absorb radiation in the [[ultraviolet]] or [[visible spectrum|visible]] regions of the [[light spectrum|spectrum]]. This [[absorbance]] can be used to determine the concentration of an additive in a sample using external calibration. However, additives may occur together and the absorbance by one could interfere with the absorbance of another. A prior separation stage is necessary and the additives are first separated by [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) and then determined on-line using a UV and/or visible light detector.

'''George Ritzer''' (born October 14, 1940) is an American [[sociologist]], professor, and author who studies [[globalization]], [[metatheory]], patterns of [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]], and modern and postmodern [[social theory]]. His most notable contribution to date is his concept of [[McDonaldization]], which draws upon [[Max Weber]]'s idea of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] through the lens of the [[fast food]] industry. In addition to creating his own theories, Ritzer has also written many general sociology books, including ''Introduction to Sociology'' (2012) as well as ''Essentials to Sociology'' (2014), and modern and postmodern [[social theory]] textbooks. Currently, Ritzer is a Distinguished Professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Ritzer was born in 1940 to a Jewish family in upper Manhattan, New York City. His father and mother were employed as a taxi cab driver and secretary, respectively, in order to support him and his younger brother. Ritzer later described his upbringing as "upper lower class".&lt;ref name=being-nothingness&gt;{{citation|title=Being (George Ritzer) and Nothingness: An Interview

=== Education and early employment ===

George Ritzer graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1958,&lt;ref name=ritzervitae&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|title=Vitae|url=http://georgeritzer.wordpress.com/vitae/|website=georgeritzer.com|publisher=Word Press|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=July 2017}} stating to have "encountered the brightest people I have ever met in my life".&lt;ref name="being-nothingness" /&gt; While at Bronx High School of Science, Ritzer received a New York State Regents Scholarship which would follow him to whichever college he chose to attend.&lt;ref name=being-nothingness /&gt;

Ritzer began his higher education at City College of New York, a free college at the time. His scholarship in addition to the free college tuition proved to be a benefit to the economic positioning of the Ritzer family.&lt;ref name=being-nothingness /&gt; While at CCNY, Ritzer initially planned to focus on business, but he later changed his major to accounting.
After graduating from CCNY in 1962,&lt;ref name="ritzervitae" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=July 2017}} Ritzer decided that he was interested in pursuing business again. He was accepted into the M.B.A. program at the [[University of Michigan Ann Arbor]], where he received a partial scholarship. While at Michigan, his official academic interest was human relations; however, he had many other intellectual hobbies, such as reading Russian novels. Ritzer reported that at Michigan, as he was able to grow and improve as a student. However, during his time at Michigan, he remembers being heavily involved in global events occurring at the time. He reports memories of going to the Michigan Union to watch the happenings of the Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;ref name="being-nothingness"/&gt;

After graduating from The University of Michigan in 1964,&lt;ref name=ritzervitae /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=July 2017}} Ritzer began working in personnel management for the Ford Motor Company; however, this proved to be a negative experience for him. His managers mistakenly hired three people, more than was necessary, for the one job, leaving him idle and unoccupied. As he once said: "[i]f we had two hours of work a day, it was a lot."&lt;ref name="being-nothingness"/&gt; Nevertheless, he was always expected to appear busy. He would constantly wander around the factory for hours observing people working, causing many of the workers and foremen to become hostile towards him. Moreover, Ritzer also found problems within the management structure at Ford. Most of the younger people with advanced degrees defied their less educated authorities. Ritzer said, "I'd like to see a society in which people are free to be creative, rather than having their creativity constrained or eliminated." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=George Ritzer|url=http://georgeritzer.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he found himself constrained and unable to do anything creative while working at Ford, encouraging him to apply to Ph.D. programs.&lt;ref name="being-nothingness"/&gt;

Ritzer enrolled in Cornell University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations Ph.D. program in Organizational Behavior in 1965.&lt;ref name=being-nothingness /&gt; There, his adviser Harrison Trice suggested that he minor in sociology. After a conversation with the head of the department, Gordon Streib, Ritzer realized that he knew nothing about sociology and was then urged to read "Broom and Selznick’s Introduction to Sociology" and found himself enthralled with the subject matter.&lt;ref name=being-nothingness /&gt; He continued to succeed in sociology courses at the graduate level. As a testament to his interest and dedication to the subject, he received an A+ on a 102-page paper he wrote for a course on American society. His professor stated that the paper was "too long not to be good".&lt;ref name=being-nothingness /&gt; This experience as well as out-reading the other sociology students in a small seminar with Margaret Cussler allowed Ritzer to become more confident as a sociology student due to his ability to outwork the competition. He attributed his talent of being able to compete with well-read and experienced sociology students to his work ethic.&lt;ref name="being-nothingness"/&gt;

=== Academic employment ===

After graduating from Cornell in 1968, Ritzer has received various academic appointments throughout his career at universities around the United States and the world:&lt;ref name= "Vita: George Ritzer"&gt;{{citation|title=Vita:  George Ritzer

== Main ideas ==
[[Image:Ritzers integration theory.svg|thumb|right|George Ritzer's macro/micro integration theory of social analysis.]]
Although known as a sociologist, Ritzer never earned a degree in sociology; he was trained in psychology and business.  As Ritzer said in a later interview, "I basically trained myself as a social theorist, and so I had to learn it all as I went."  Despite this challenge, Ritzer found that not being trained in social theory was actually advantageous for him, simply because his reasoning was not limited to a particular theoretical perspective.&lt;ref name="being-nothingness"/&gt; Listed are his biggest accomplishments in social theory:

=== McDonaldization ===
Ritzer's idea of [[McDonaldization]] is an extension of [[Max Weber]]'s (1864–1920) classical theory of the [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of modern society and culture. Weber famously used the terminology "[[iron cage]]" to describe the stultifying, [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] effects of bureaucratized life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farganis|first=James|title=Readings in Social Theory, 6th Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0078111556}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ritzer applied this idea to an influential social system in the twenty-first century: [[McDonald's]]. Ritzer argues that McDonald's restaurants have become the better example of current forms of [[instrumental rationality]] and its ultimately irrational and harmful consequences on people&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, G. ''The McDonaldization of Society''. SAGE Publications, Inc. Thousand Oaks, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Ritzer identifies four rationalizing dimensions of McDonald's that contribute to the process of McDonaldization, claiming that McDonald's aims to increase:&lt;br/&gt;
1. [[Efficiency]]: McDonald's delivers products quickly and easily without inputting an excessive amount of money. The "McDonald's model" and therefore the McDonald's operations follow a predesigned process that leads to a specified end, using productive means.&lt;ref name= McDonaldization20th &gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|title=The McDonaldization of Society: 20th Anniversary Edition|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781452226699|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of the McDonald's model has infiltrated other modern day services such as completing tax forms online, easy weight loss programs, [[The Walt Disney Company]] FASTPASSes, and online dating services, [[eHarmony]] and [[match.com]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt;&lt;ref name="Massey 2012 453–455"&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Garth|title=Readings For Sociology, 7th Edition|year=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393927009|pages=453–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
2. [[Calculability]]: America has grown to connect the quantity of a product with the quality of a product and that "bigger is better".&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt; The "McDonald's model" is influential in this conception due to providing a lot of food for not that much money. While the end products feed into the connection between the quantity and quality of the product, so does the McDonald's production process. Throughout the food production, everything is standardized and highly calculated: the size of the beef patty, the amount of french fries per order, and the time spent in a franchise. The high calculability of the McDonald's franchise also extends over into academics. It is thought that the academic experience, in high school and higher education, can be quantified into one number, the [[GPA]]. Also, calculability leads to the idea that the longer the resume or list of degrees, the better the candidate, during an application process. In addition to academics being affected by the McDonaldization in society, sports, specifically basketball have also been affected. It used to be that basketball was a more laid-back, slow-paced sort of game, yet through the creation of fast-food and McDonald's, a [[shot clock]] was added to increase not only the speed of the game, but also the number of points scored.&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
3. [[Predictability]]: Related to calculability, customers know what to expect from a given producer of goods or services. For example, customers know that every [[Big Mac]] from McDonald's is going to be the same as the next one; there is an understood predictability to the menu as well as the overall experience. In order to maintain the predictability for each franchise, there has to be "discipline, order, systematization, formalization, routine, consistency, and a methodical operation".&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt; The predictability of the McDonald's franchise also appears through the golden arches in front of every franchise as well as the scripts that the employees use on the customers. [[The Walt Disney Company]] also has regulations in place, like dress code for men and women, in order to add to the predictability of each amusement park or Disney operation. Predictability has also extended into movie sequels and TV shows. With each movie sequel, like ''[[Spy Kids 4]]'', or TV show, ''[[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|Law &amp; Order]]'' and its spinoffs, the plot is predictable and usually follow a preconceived model.&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
4. [[Control (management)|Control]]: McDonald's restaurants pioneered the idea of highly specialized tasks for all employees to ensure that all human workers are operating at exactly the same level. This is a way to keep a complicated system running smoothly; rules and regulations that make efficiency, calculability, and predictability possible.&lt;ref name="Massey 2012 453–455"/&gt; Oftentimes, the use of non-human technology, such as computers, is used. The McDonald's food is already "pre-prepared", the potatoes are already cut and processed, just needing to be fried and heated, and the food preparation process is monitored and tracked. The computers tell the managers how many hamburgers are needed at the lunchtime rush and other peak times and the size and shape of the pickles as well as how many go on a hamburger is managed and control.&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt; The control aspect of McDonaldization has extended to other businesses, [[Sylvan Learning]] and phone operating systems, and even birth and death. Every step of the learning process at Sylvan, the U-shaped tables and instruction manuals, is controlled as well as each step of the birthing process, in modern-day hospitals, and the process of dying.&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt;

McDonaldization is profitable, desirable, and at the cutting edge of technological advances. Many "McDonald's" aspects of society are beneficial to the advancement and enhancement of human life. Some claim that rationalization leads to "more egalitarian" societies. For example, supermarkets and large grocery stores offer variety and availability unlike smaller farmer’s markets from generations past. The McDonaldization of society also allows operations to be more productive, improve the quality of some products, and produce services and products at lower cost.&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt; The Internet has provided countless new services to people that were previously impossible, such as checking bank statements without having to go to a bank or being able to purchase things online without leaving the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Garth|title=Readings For Sociology, 7th Edition|year=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393927009|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; These things are all positive effects of the rationalization and McDonaldization of society.

However, McDonaldization also alienates people and creates a disenchantment of the world. The increased standardization of society dehumanizes people and institutions. The "assembly line" feel of fast-food restaurants is transcending many other facets of life and removing humanity from previously human experiences.&lt;ref name="Mann 2007 381–384"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=381–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Massey 2012 456"&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Garth|title=Readings For Sociology, 7th Edition|year=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393927009|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through implementing machines and computers in society, humans can start to "behave like machines" and therefore "become replaced by machines".&lt;ref name=McDonaldization20th /&gt;

=== Consumption ===
An early admirer of [[Jean Baudrillard]]’s ''Consumer Society'' (1970),&lt;ref name=consuming-passion&gt;{{citation|title=A Consuming Passion: An Interview with George Ritzer |last1=Dandaneau |first1=Steve P. |last2=Dodsworth |first2=Robin M. |year=2006 |url=http://www.georgeritzer.com/docs/A%20Consuming%20Passion.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritzer is a leading proponent of the study of [[consumption (sociology)|consumption]].  In addition to ''[[The McDonaldization of Society]]'', the most important sources for Ritzer’s sociology of consumption are his edited Explorations in the ''Sociology of Consumption: Fast Food Restaurants, Credit Cards and Casinos'' (2001), ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption'' (2nd edition 2005, 3rd edition 2009), and ''Expressing America: A Critique of the Global Credit-Card Society'' (1995). Ritzer is also a founding editor, with Don Slater, of [[Sage Publications|Sage]]'s ''[[Journal of Consumer Culture]]''.&lt;ref name="Vita: George Ritzer"/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=July 2017}}

=== Prosumption ===
First coined by [[Alvin Toffler]] in 1980, the term [[Prosumer|prosumption]] is used by Ritzer and Jurgenson,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Production, Consumption, Prosumption : The nature of capitalism in the age of the digital 'prosumer'|last1=Ritzer |first1=George |last2=Jurgenson |first2=Nathan |year=2010 |publisher=Journal of Consumer Culture10:13 |url=http://joc.sagepub.com/content/10/1/13.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; to break down the false dichotomy between production and consumption and describe the dual identity of economic activities. Ritzer argues that prosumption is the primordial form of economic activities, and the current ideal separation between production and consumption is aberrant and distorted due to the effect of both Industrial Revolution and post-WWII American consumption boom. It has only recently become popularly acknowledged that the existence of prosumption as activities on the internet and Web 2.0 resemble prosumption much more so than production or consumption individually. Various online activities require the input of consumers such as Wikipedia entries, Facebook profiles, Twitter, Blog, Myspace, Amazon preferences, eBay auctions, Second Life, etc.
Ritzer argues that we should view all economic activities on a continuum of prosumption with '''prosumption as production''' (p-a-p) and '''prosumption as consumption''' (p-a-c) on each pole.

=== Something vs. nothing ===
According to Ritzer, "Something" is a locally conceived and controlled social form that is comparatively rich in distinctive substantive content. It also describes things as being fairly unusual. "Nothing" is "a social form that is generally centrally conceived, controlled and comparatively devoid of distinctive substantive content" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=396–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nothing" usually aims at the standardized and homogenous, while "something" refers to things that are personal or have local flavor. Examples of "nothing" are [[McDonald's]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Starbucks]], credit cards, and the [[Internet]]. Examples of "something" are local sandwich shops, local hardware stores, family arts and crafts places, or a local breakfast cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ritzer believes that things that embody the "nothing" component of this dichotomy are taking over and pushing "something" out of society. He explains the advantages and disadvantages of both "something" and "nothing" in ''The McDonaldization of Society''.&lt;ref name="Massey 2012 456"/&gt;

=== Globalization ===
In Ritzer's research, [[globalization]] refers to the rapidly increasing worldwide integration and interdependence of societies and cultures.&lt;ref name="Ritzer, G 2004"&gt;Ritzer, G. ''The Globalization of Nothing'', [[Pine Forge Press]], Thousand Oaks, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; This book presents a sophisticated argument about the nature of globalization in terms of the consumption of goods and services. He defines it as involving a worldwide diffusion of practices, relations, and forms of social organization and the growth of global consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "something" vs. "nothing" plays a large part in understanding Ritzer's Globalization. Society is becoming bombarded with "nothing" and Ritzer seems to believe that the globalization of "nothing" is almost unstoppable &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritzer's aforementioned ''The Globalization of Nothing'' (2004/2007) stakes out a provocative perspective in the ongoing and voluminous globalization discourse. For Ritzer, globalization typically leads to consumption of vast quantities of serial social forms that have been centrally conceived and controlled – one [[McDonald's]] hamburger, i.e., one instance of nothing again and again- dominates social life (Ritzer, George. 2004. ''The Globalization of Nothing''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press).
To better understand globalization, it can be broken down into a few characteristics:
* The beginning of global communication through different media like television and the Internet
* The formation of a "global consciousness"&lt;ref name="Mann 2007 381–384"/&gt;

In addition to ''The Globalization of Nothing'', Ritzer has edited ''The Blackwell Companion to Globalization'' (2007), written ''Globalization: A Basic Text'' (2009), and edited an ''Encyclopedia of Globalization'' (forthcoming). Insight into Ritzer's distinctive approach to globalization is available via a special review symposium in the Sage journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]'' (Number 76, February 2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glocalization.asp Glocalization.] Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grobalization ===
In his book ''The Globalization of Nothing'' (2004), Ritzer quotes that globalization consists of [[glocalization]] and grobalization.&lt;ref name="GoN Xiii"&gt;Ritzer, George (2004). The ''Globalization of Nothing.'' Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. Xiii&lt;/ref&gt;
Grobalization, a term coined by Ritzer himself, refers to "imperialistic ambitions of nations, corporations, organizations, and the like and their desire, indeed need, to impose themselves on various geographic areas".&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.73"&gt;Ritzer, George (2004). ''The Globalization of Nothing''. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. p.73&lt;/ref&gt;
As opposite to glocalization, grobalization aims to "overwhelm local".&lt;ref name="GoN Xiii"/&gt; Its ultimate goal is to see profit grow through unilateral homogenization, thus earning its name ''gro''balization. Capitalism, [[Americanization]], and [[McDonaldization]] are all parts of grobalization.&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.73"/&gt;

Grobalization involves three motor forces: [[capitalism]], McDonaldization, and Americanization. Grobalization creates a world where:&lt;br/&gt;
1. Things are more homogenous and ubiquitous.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Larger forces overwhelm the power of people to adapt and innovate in ways that preserve their autonomy.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Social processes are coercive, determining the nature of local communities, which have little room to maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Consumer goods and the media are key forces that largely dictate the nature of the self and the groups a person joins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritzer provides American textbook as an example of grobalization. In his book, ''The Globalization of Nothing'', he quotes that textbooks are "oriented to rationalizing, McDonaldizing, the communication of information."&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.175"&gt;Ritzer, George (2004). ''The Globalization of Nothing''. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Students, rather than evaluating the competing ideas, instead absorb the information given to them. Yet, these textbooks are surprisingly sold out worldwide, only to be slightly revised to reflect local standards.&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.175"/&gt;

=== Glocalization ===
[[Glocalization]] is a combination of the words "[[globalization]]" and "[[localisation (economics)|localization]]" used to describe a product or service that is developed and distributed globally, but is also fashioned to accommodate the user or consumer in a local market, causing the products, or results of glocalization, to vary depending on different locations. The local individuals are able to manipulate their own situation in the world and become creative agents in what products and services are represented in their local environment within the glocalized world.&lt;ref name=Globalization2 /&gt; Ritzer further explains Glocalization as a relatively benign process that is closest to the "something" end of things. It creates variety and heterogeneity within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metatheory ===
[[Metatheory]] can be defined as the attainment of a deeper understanding of theory, the creation of new theory, and the creation of an overarching theoretical perspective. There are three types of metatheorizing: M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, and M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Through the application of the three subsets of metatheory, Ritzer argues that the field of sociology can create a stronger foundation, experience "rapid and dramatic growth", and generally increase not only the knowledge of metatheory but social theory in general.&lt;ref name= Metatheorizing&gt;{{cite journal | title = Metatheorizing in Sociology | first = George | last = Ritzer | journal = [[Sociological Forum]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 1990 | pages = 3–15 | jstor = 684578 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first category of metatheory (M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;), aims at being a means of attaining a deeper understanding of theory. Within the greater category of M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, Ritzer establishes four other subsets: internal-intellectual, internal-social, external-intellectual, and external-social. The internal-intellectual sector of M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; identifies the "schools of thought" and the structure of current sociologists and social theories. The internal-social subtype identifies connections between sociologists and connections between sociologists and society. The last two subsets of M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; are looking more at the macrolevel of sociology than the other two subsets. The third subtype of M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is the external-intellectual view of sociology; it looks at different studies and their concepts, tools, and ideas in order to apply these aspects to sociology. The fourth, and final, subset is external-social where the impact of social theory in a larger societal setting is studied.&lt;ref name= "Metatheorizing" /&gt;

The second (M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), aims at being a prelude to theory development. New social theory is created due to the complex study and interpretation of other sociologists. For example, [[Karl Marx]]'s theories are based on [[Hegel]]'s theories. The theories of the American sociologist, [[Talcott Parsons]], are based on the theories of [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall]].&lt;ref name= "Metatheorizing" /&gt;

The last (M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;), aims at being a source of perspectives that overarch sociological theory.&lt;ref name= "Metatheorizing" /&gt; Influenced by [[Thomas Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), Ritzer has long advocated the view that social theory is improved by systematic, comparative and reflexive attention to implicit conceptual structures and oft-hidden assumptions.&lt;ref name="Ritzer, G. Sociology 1974"&gt;Ritzer, G. ''Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science''. [[Allyn and Bacon]], Boston, 1974,&lt;/ref&gt;

Key works include ''Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science'' (1975), ''Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm'' (1981), ''Metatheorizing in Sociology'' (1991), and ''Explorations in Social Theory: From Metatheorizing to Rationalization'' (2001). See also Ritzer’s edited ''Metatheorizing'' (1992).

=== Modern and postmodern social theory ===
Ritzer is known to generations of students as the author of numerous comprehensive introductions and compendia in social theory. [[Postmodern]] society is a consumer society that invents new means of consumption, such as [[credit cards]], [[shopping malls]], and [[shopping networks]]. Today, "Capitalism needs us to keep on spending at ever-increasing levels to be and remain capitalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=The New Means of Consumption: A Postmodern Analysis|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~s2005.soc.401/ritzer(apr29).pdf|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with several of Ritzer’s other principal works, many are translated into languages as diverse as Chinese, Russian, Persian, Hebrew and Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Vita: George Ritzer"/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=July 2017}}  Key volumes in this genre include ''The Sociological Theory'' (7th edition 2008), ''Classical Sociological Theory'' (5th edition 2008), and ''Modern Sociological Theory'' (7th edition 2008), ''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'' (2 vols. 2005), and ''Postmodern Social Theory'' (1997). For convenient access to many of Ritzer’s substantive contributions to modern and postmodern social theorizing, see ''Explorations in Social Theory: From Metatheorizing to Rationalization'' (2001) as well as more recent work often co-authored with his many students, such as (with J. Michael Ryan) "Postmodern Social Theory and Sociology: On Symbolic Exchange with a ‘Dead’ Theory," in ''Reconstructing Postmodernism: Critical Debates'' (2007).

== Bibliography ==
George Ritzer has published many monographs and textbooks.  He has edited three encyclopedias, including the ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology''. He has written approximately one hundred scholarly articles in respected journals.&lt;ref name="Vita: George Ritzer"/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=July 2017}}

=== ''Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science'' (1975, 1980) ===

Based on his original article appearing in the ''American Sociologist'',&lt;ref&gt;''The American Sociologist'', Vol. 10, No. 3, August 1975 (pp.&amp;nbsp;156–167)&lt;/ref&gt; this book provides a foundation for Ritzer’s other works on [[metatheory]].  The piece applies Thomas Kuhn's idea of scientific [[paradigm]]s to sociology and demonstrating that sociology is a science consisting of multiple paradigms. Ritzer also discusses what implications this has for the field of sociology.&lt;ref name="Ritzer, G. Sociology 1974"/&gt;

=== ''Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm'' (1981) ===

In this book, Ritzer contends that sociology needs an integrated [[paradigm]] in order to add to the extant paradigms noted in ''Sociology:  A Multiple Paradigm Science''. Ritzer proposes an integrated paradigm dealing with the interrelationships between the many levels of social reality.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, G. ''Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm''. Allyn and Bacon, Boston, 1981,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The McDonaldization of Society'' (1993) ===

In this provocative book, George Ritzer explores how Weber's classic thoughts on [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] take on new vitality and meaning when applied to the process of [[McDonaldization]]. He describes this as the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurants are coming to dominate more and more sectors of society in the United States as well as the rest of the world.

Ritzer shows how Weber's central characteristics of rationalized systems - [[efficiency]], [[predictability]], [[calculability]], substitution of non-human for human [[technology]] and control over uncertainty - have found widespread expression in a broad range of organized human activity, including travel, consumer products and services, education, leisure, politics and religion as well as in the fast food industry.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, G. The McDonaldization of Society. SAGE Publications, Inc. Thousand Oaks. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists'' (2003) ===

Guide to thirteen leading social theorists: [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Social exchange theory#History|Richard M. Emerson]], [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Daniel Bell]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Judith Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ritzer | first = George | title = The Blackwell companion to major contemporary social theorists | publisher = Blackwell | location = Maldem, Massachusetts Oxford | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781405105958 }} [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470999912 Online edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The McDonaldization of Society: 20th Anniversary Edition'' (2012) ===
Ritzer's ''McDonaldization of Society'', now celebrating its 20th anniversary, continues to stand as one of the pillars of modern-day sociological thought. By linking theory to 21st-century culture, this book resonates with audiences in a way that few other books do, opening their eyes to many current issues, especially in [[consumption (sociology)|consumption]] and [[globalization]]. As in previous editions, the book has been updated and it offers new discussions of, among others, [[In-N-Out Burger]] and [[Pret a Manger]] as possible antitheses of [[McDonaldization]]. The biggest change, however, is that the book has been streamlined to offer an even clearer articulation of the McDonaldization thesis.  The final chapter also looks at "The DeMcDonaldization of Society", and concludes that while it is occurring on the surface, McDonaldization is alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, G. [http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book237168?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=ritzer&amp;fs=1 ''The McDonaldization of Society''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304074735/http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book237168?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=ritzer&amp;fs=1 |date=2014-03-04 }}, 7th Edition.  SAGE Publications, Inc. Thousand Oaks, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Globalization of Nothing'', Second Edition (2007) ===

''The Globalization of Nothing'', Second Edition emphasizes the processes of [[globalization]] and how they relate to [[McDonaldization]]. As before, this book is structured around four sets of concepts addressing the issues of: "places/non-places," "things/non-things," "people/non-people," and "services/non-services." By drawing upon salient examples from everyday life, Ritzer invites the reader to examine the nuances of these concepts in conjunction with the paradoxes within the process of the globalization of nothing. Critical questions are raised throughout, and the reader is compelled not only to seek answers to these questions, but also to critically evaluate the questions as well as their answers. The current edition features a greater emphasis on the main topic of [[globalization]]: a new first chapter offers an introductory overview of [[globalization]] and globalization theory, outlining the unique ways in which these topics are addressed throughout the text. It also delves into two subprocesses of globalization — "glocalization" and "grobalization."&lt;ref name=Globalization2&gt;Ritzer, G. [http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book229406?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=ritzer&amp;fs=1 ''The Globalization of Nothing''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304062617/http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book229406?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=ritzer&amp;fs=1 |date=2014-03-04 }}, 2nd Edition. SAGE Publications, Inc. Thousand Oaks, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World'', Third Edition (2009) ===

''Enchanting a Disenchanted World'', Third Edition examines Disney, malls, cruise lines, Las Vegas, the World Wide Web, McDonald's, Planet Hollywood, credit cards, and all the other ways we now consume. The current edition was updated to reflect the recent economic recession and the impact of the [[internet]]. Ritzer continues to explore this book’s central thesis: that our society has undergone fundamental change because of the way and the level at which we consume.  The third edition demonstrates how we have created new "cathedrals" of consumption (places that enchant us so as to entice us to stay longer and consume more) while continuing to take [[capitalism]] to a new level. These places of [[consumption (sociology)|consumption]], whether in our homes, the mall, or cyberspace, are in a constant state of "enchanting the disenchanted," luring us through new spectacles because their rational qualities are both necessary and deadening at the same time.  The book also includes a wide range of theoretical perspectives — Marxian, Weberian, critical theory, postmodern theory — as well as a number of concepts such as hyperconsumption, [[implosion (sociology)|implosion]], [[simulation]], and time and space to show the audience how sociological theory can be applied to everyday phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, G. [http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book233896?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=ritzer&amp;fs=1 ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304062620/http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book233896?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=ritzer&amp;fs=1 |date=2014-03-04 }}, Third Edition.

&lt;!-- Per MOS:BOLDTITLE and WP:SBE, neither the article's title nor related text appears in bold. --&gt;A wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Turkey began on 28 May 2013, initially to contest the urban development plan for [[Istanbul]]'s [[Taksim Gezi Park]]. The protests were sparked by outrage at the violent eviction of a [[sit-in]] at the park protesting the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Istanbul%C2%A0-les-Indignes-de-Taksim_a817.html « Istanbul : les Indignés de Taksim »], Laurène Perrussel-Morin, Le Journal International, 29 mai 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, supporting protests and strikes took place across Turkey, protesting a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkey's secularism]]. With no centralised leadership beyond the small assembly that organized the original environmental protest, the protests have been compared to the [[Occupy movement]] and the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 events]]. [[Social media]] played a key part in the protests, not least because [[Media censorship and disinformation during the 2013 protests in Turkey|much of the Turkish media downplayed the protests]], particularly in the early stages. Three and a half million people (out of Turkey's population of 80 million) are estimated to have taken an active part in almost 5,000 demonstrations across Turkey connected with the original Gezi Park protest.&lt;ref name=surreal/&gt; Twenty-two people were killed and more than 8,000 were injured, many critically.&lt;ref name=surreal&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Bellaigue|first=Christopher|title=Turkey: 'Surreal, Menacing…Pompous'|journal=New York Review of Books|date=19 December 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/dec/19/turkey-surreal-menacing-pompous/?pagination=false|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=surreal/&gt;&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/new-report-on-human-rights-violations-during-turkeys-response-to-gezi-park-protests/ "New Report on Human Rights Violations During Turkey’s Response to Gezi Park Protests"], Activist Defense, 4 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sit-in at Taksim Gezi Park was restored after police withdrew from [[Taksim Square]] on 1 June, and developed into a [[protest camp]], with thousands of protesters in tents, organising a library, medical center, food distribution, and their own media. After the Gezi Park camp was cleared by riot police on 15 June, protesters began to meet in other parks all around Turkey and organised [[public forum]]s to discuss ways forward for the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 19 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/group-stands-against-standing-man-in-istanbul-protest-square.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=49111&amp;NewsCatID=341 Group stands against 'standing man' in Istanbul protest square]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[bianet]], 19 June 2013, [http://www.bianet.org/english/youth/147740-every-park-become-gezi-park-in-turkey Every Park Become Gezi Park in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] dismissed the protesters as "a few looters" on 2 June.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Police suppressed the protests with tear gas and water cannons. In addition to the 11 deaths and over 8,000 injuries, more than 3,000 arrests were made. Excessive use of force by police and the overall absence of government dialogue with the protesters was criticized by some foreign countries and international organisations.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR44/022/2013/en|title=Gezi Park Protests: Brutal Denial Of The Rıght To Peaceful Assembly In Turkey|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/gezi-puts-its-mark-on-eu-progress-report.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=56306&amp;NewsCatID=338|title=Gezi puts its mark on EU Progress Report|publisher=[[Hurriyet Daily News]]|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Turkey internet ban protest 2011.jpg|thumb|2011 protests against [[internet censorship]].]]

The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) led by [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] has governed since 2002, winning the [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002]], [[Turkish general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Turkish general election, 2011|2011]] elections by large margins. Under its rule the [[economy of Turkey]] recovered from the 2001 financial crisis and recession, driven in particular by a construction boom.

While construction in Turkey has boomed and has been a major driver for the economy, this has involved little to no local consultation. For example, major construction projects in Istanbul have been "opposed by widespread coalitions of diverse interests. Yet in every case, the government has run roughshod over the projects' opponents in a dismissive manner, asserting that anyone who does not like what is taking place should remember how popular the AKP has been when elections roll around."&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Steven A.|title=How Democratic Is Turkey?|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/06/02/how_democratic_is_turkey|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=3 June 2013|author2=Michael Koplow}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corruption in Turkey|Corruption concerns]] have also been raised, particularly relating to the [[Kanal İstanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Murray]], 2 June 2013, [http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2013/06/talking-turkey/ Talking Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Environmental issues in Turkey|Environmental issues]], especially since the 2010 decision of the government to build additional [[Sinop Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plants]] and the [[Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge|third bridge]], led to continued demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/no-nukes-anti-nuclear-activists-condemn-turkeys-plans-build-second-atomic-plant-1239275 |newspaper=International Business Times |date=6 May 2013 |title=No Nukes: Anti-Nuclear Activists Condemn Turkey's Plans To Build Second Atomic Plant |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black Sea Region]] has seen dozens of protests against the construction of waste-dumps, nuclear and coal power plants, mines, factories and hydroelectric dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey's Tree Revolution – part 2 Everyday I'm chapulling|url=http://www.ejolt.org/2013/06/turkeys-tree-revolution-part-2-everyday-im-chapulling/|accessdate=26 June 2013|publisher=ejolt|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 local musicians and activists in 2012 created a video entitled "Diren Karadeniz" ("Resist, Black Sea"), which prefigured the ubiquitous Gezi Park slogan "Diren Gezi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diren Karadeniz|url=http://www.yurtgazetesi.com.tr/kultursanat/diren-karadeniz-h14568.html|accessdate=3 June 2013|newspaper=Yurt|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's stance on the [[Syrian civil war|civil war]] in Syria is another cause of social tension in the country.&lt;ref name="peker1june"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey Prepares for More Protests |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324412604578518480404254700 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=1 June 2013 |author=Emre Peker |author2=Joe Parkinson |location=Istanbul |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy within progressive communities has been sparked by plans to turn Turkey's former Christian [[Hagia Sophia]] churches (now museums) in [[Trabzon]] and possibly Istanbul into mosques, a plan which failed to gain the support of prominent Muslim leaders from Trabzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Bartholomew-I:-Do-not-transform-Hagia-Sophia-in-Trabzon-into-a-mosque-25568.html|title=Bartholomew I: Do not transform Hagia Sophia in Trabzon into a mosque|newspaper=Asia News|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02x9f5y|title=The world tonight|publisher=BBC|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, structural weaknesses in Turkey's economy were becoming more apparent. Economic growth slowed considerably in 2012 from 8.8% in 2011 to 2.2% in 2012 and forecasts for 2013 were below trend. Unemployment remained high at at least 9% and the current account deficit was growing to over 6% of GDP.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A key issue Erdoğan campaigned for prior to the 2011 election was to rewrite the military-written constitution from 1982. Key amongst Erdoğan's demands were for Turkey to transform the role of President from that of a ceremonial role to an executive presidential republic with emboldened powers and for him to be elected president in the 2014 presidential elections. To submit such proposals to a referendum needs 330 out of 550 votes in the [[Grand National Assembly]] and to approve without referendum by parliament requires 367 out of 550 votes (a two-thirds majority) - The AKP currently holds only 326 seats. As such the constitutional commission requires agreement from opposition parties, namely the CHP, MHP and BDP who have largely objected to such proposals. Moreover, the constitutional courts have ruled that current president [[Abdullah Gül]] is permitted to run for the 2014 elections, who is widely rumoured to have increasingly tense relations and competition with Erdoğan. Furthermore, many members of parliament in the governing AKP have internally also objected by arguing that the current presidential system suffices. Erdoğan himself is currently barred from running for a fourth term as prime minister in the 2015 general elections due to current AKP by-laws, largely sparking accusations from the public that Erdoğan's proposals were stated in light of him only intending to prolong his rule as the most dominant figure in politics. The constitutional proposals have mostly so far been delayed in deliberations or lacked any broad agreement for reforms.

===Events leading up to the protests===
* '''29 October 2012:''' The governor of [[Ankara]] bans a planned [[Republic Day (Turkey)|Republic Day]] march organised by secularist opposition groups. Despite the ban, thousands of people, including the leader of Turkey's largest opposition party [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]] gather at [[Ulus, Ankara|Ulus Square]]. Riot police forces attack the protesters with tear gas and watercannon, despite the fact that there were many children and elderly people in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/29/world/europe/turkey-holiday-clash/ |title=Police, protesters clash at Republic Day march in Turkey |publisher=CNN |date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''19 February:''' A survey conducted by Kadir Has University (incorporating up to 20 000 interviewees from 26 of 81 provinces and having a low margin of error) shows considerable disapproval of Erdoğan's strongly advocated proposed change from a parliamentary system to an American-style executive presidential system by 2014 - 65.8% opposed and 21.2% in support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2013/02/20/Turkey-65-8-oppose-Erdogan-presidential-reform-proposal_8280418.html |title=Turkey: 65.8% oppose Erdogan's presidential reform proposal - Politics - ANSAMed.it |publisher=Ansa.it |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''February–March:''' A large bank in Turkey, [[Ziraat Bank]], changes its name from "T.C. Ziraat Bankası" to simply "Ziraat Bankası", thus omitting the acronym of the Republic of Turkey, T.C., (''Türkiye Cumhuriyeti''). The Turkish Ministry of Health also stops using T.C. in signs. In protest, thousands of people start using TC in front of their names on Facebook and Twitter as a silent protest. Some people believe that the AKP is trying to change the name or the regime of the country while others believe that this omission of the letters TC is a sign of privatization of the Ziraat bank and hospitals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* '''Late March:'''  The [[Turkish flag]] is formally removed from the logo of the [[Grand National Assembly]]. Many view this as a denigration of parliamentary process and the republic.

Residents of Istanbul have long complained that the project is unnecessary and would disfigure the skyline and environment by the logging involved. Even many highly religious lobbies and figures object to the plan, with one religiously conservative intellectual in late 2012 calling such plans a "cheap replica" of the [[Blue Mosque, Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] and wrote to Erdoğan imploring him not to embarrass coming generations with such "unsightly work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Matt |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/29/uk-turkey-mosque-idUSLNE8AS01320121129 |title=In Istanbul, a mosque fit for a sultan |publisher=Reuters |date= 29 November 2012|accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial cause of the protests was the plan to remove [[Gezi Park]], one of the few remaining green spaces in the center of the European side of Istanbul.

With the police abandoning attempts to clear the Gezi Park encampment on 1 June, the area began to take on some of the characteristics associated with the [[Occupy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|title=In Istanbul's Heart, Leader's Obsession, Perhaps Achilles' Heel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/world/europe/in-istanbuls-taksim-square-an-achilles-heel.html|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tents swelled, to the point where a hand-drawn map was set up at the entrance.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;[[Huffington Post]], 6 June 2013, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/turkey-protests-snapshots_n_3396017.html Turkey Protests Snapshots: Yoga, Trash Crews And Barricades]&lt;/ref&gt; Access roads to the park and to Taksim Square have been blocked by protesters against the police with barricades of paving stones and corrugated iron.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]], 8 June 2013, [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/uk-turkey-protests-idUKBRE94U0JA20130607 Stop now, Prime Minister Erdogan tells Turkish protesters]&lt;/ref&gt;

By evening on 4 June there were again tens of thousands in Taksim Square; [[Al Jazeera]] reported that "there are many families with their children enjoying the demonstration that has developed the feeling of a festival."&lt;ref name="AlJazeera4June9.30pm"&gt;Al Jazeera 4 June 2013, c 9.30pm, [http://blogs.aljazeera.com/liveblog/topic/turkey-protests-20176 Turkey Protests Live Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also signs of a developing infrastructure reminding some observers of [[Occupy Wall Street]], with "a fully operational kitchen and first-aid clinic... carved out of an abandoned concession stand in the back of the park," complete with rotas and fundraising for people's travel expenses.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy"&gt;Ben Pomeroy, ''[[The Week]]'', 4 June 2013, [http://theweek.com/article/index/245072/dispatch-from-istanbul-occupy-gezi-park-digs-in Dispatch from Istanbul: Occupy Gezi Park digs in]&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters brought food to donate, and dozens of volunteers organised themselves into four shifts.&lt;ref name="Turgut"&gt;Pelin Turgut, [[Time (magazine)|Time]], 5 June 2013, [http://world.time.com/2013/06/05/live-from-occupied-gezi-park-in-istanbul-a-new-turkish-protest-movement-is-born/ Live from ‘Occupied’ Gezi Park: In Istanbul, a New Turkish Protest Movement Is Born]&lt;/ref&gt;

With 5 June being the [[Lailat al Miraj]] religious holiday, protesters distributed "kandil simidi" (a pastry specific to the holiday), and temporarily declared the park a no-alcohol zone. Celebration of the holiday included a Quran reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 5 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/atypical-day-of-protest-at-gezi-park-with-religious-ceremony-quran-reading-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=48301&amp;NewsCatID=341 Atypical day of protest at Gezi Park with religious ceremony, Quran reading]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Gelderloos]] argues that the camp was a small, [[anarchist community]] that heavily emphasied [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]]. He also argues that large cultural changes occurred within the camp. He argues that the Gezi Park was one of the most successful examples of social activism in recent history, mainly due to its refusal to be represented by political parties, trade unions and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Failure of Nonviolence|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols and humour===
[[File:İstiklâl31may2.jpg|thumb|Graffiti showing the words "At least 3 beers", which parodies the government's regulation of sale of alcohol between 22:00 to 06:00 and Erdoğan's advice of 3 children.]]

One photograph taken by [[Reuters]] photographer Osman Orsal of a woman in a red dress being pepper-sprayed became one of the iconic images of the protests: "In her red cotton summer dress, necklace and white bag slung over her shoulder she might have been floating across the lawn at a garden party; but before her crouches a masked policeman firing teargas spray that sends her long hair billowing upwards."&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]], 3 June 2013, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/03/us-turkey-protests-women-idUSBRE95217B20130603 Woman in red becomes leitmotif for Istanbul's female protesters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lady in Red became a Capulcu|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=10157|work=InEnArt|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orsal himself was later injured by a tear gas canister.&lt;ref name="gvo"&gt;globalvoices.org, 4 June 2013, [http://globalvoices.org/2013/06/04/turkey-a-social-media-chronology-of-occupy-gezi/ Turkey: A Social Media Chronology of Occupy Gezi ]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 the police officer who sprayed pepper gas in the face of "the woman in red" was sentenced to 20 months in jail and to plant 600 trees by a criminal court in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lady in Red became a Capulcu|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=10157|work=InEnArt|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guy Fawkes mask]]s have also been widely used, for example by striking Turkish Airlines cabin crew performing a parody of airline safety announcements referring to the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Statesman]], 6 June 2013, [http://www.newstatesman.com/austerity-and-its-discontents/2013/06/how-occupygezi-could-transform-turkish-society How #OccupyGezi could transform Turkish society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters have also made significant use of humour, both in graffiti and online, in what the [[BBC]] called "an explosion of expression... in the form of satire, irony and outright mockery of the popular leader on Istanbul's streets and social media." It gave as an example a parody of the Turkish auction site [[sahibinden.com]] as "tayyibinden.com", listing Gezi Park for sale.&lt;ref&gt;Jody Sabral and Zeynep Erdim, [[BBC]], 8 June 2013, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22823730 Will Istanbul's protesters have the last laugh?]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of slogans include "Enough! I'm calling the police", as well as pop culture references: "Tayyip – Winter is Coming" (a reference to ''[[Game of Thrones]]'') and "You're messing with the generation that beats cops in GTA." (a reference to [[Grand Theft Auto]]).&lt;ref&gt;lemoustache, buzzfeed.com, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/lemoustache/25-examples-of-the-best-street-humour-from-istanbu-b7x9 25 Examples Of The Best Street Humour From Istanbul, Gezi Park (#occupygezi) Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaman Kayabali, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] blog, 16 June 2013, [http://www.vam.ac.uk/b/blog/posters-stories-va-collection/occupygezi-gezi-protests-turkey #occupygezi: Gezi Protests in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belgin Akaltan, [[Hurriyet Daily News]], 22 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/thats-it-ill-call-the-police.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=49214&amp;NewsCatID=469 That's it, I'll call the police]&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters had previously mocked Erdoğan's recommendation to have at least 3 children and policy of restricting alcohol with the slogan "at least 3 beers" even though this is criticised on social media for Erdoğan's recommendation of having 3 children is his personal view and not a government policy.

Penguins were also adopted as a symbol, referring to CNN Turk's showing a penguin documentary while CNN International provided live coverage of the protests; examples include "We are all penguins" T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], ''[[The Express Tribune]]'', 8 June 2013, [http://tribune.com.pk/story/560640/chapulling-turkish-protesters-spread-the-edgy-word/ 'Chapulling': Turkish protesters spread the edgy word]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio Free Europe]], 5 June 2013, [http://www.rferl.org/content/turkey-protests-penguins-symbol/25008120.html In Turkey, Penguins Become Symbol Of How Media Missed The Story ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Erdoğan's description of the protesters as looters (''{{lang|tr|üç beş çapulcu}}'', "a few [literally: three to five] looters"), demonstrators [[Reappropriation|took up the name as a symbol of pride]], describing their peaceful and humorous civil disobedience actions as [[chapulling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Is Capuling?

Encampments were made in other parks in support of the Gezi protests, including in Ankara's [[Kuğulu Park]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 15 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ankara-stands-solid-kugulu-becomes-symbol-of-resistance.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=48844&amp;NewsCatID=341 Ankara stands solid, Kuğulu becomes symbol of resistance]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Izmir]]'s Gündoğdu Square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 20 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/police-raid-protesters-tents-in-izmir-supporters-released.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=49182&amp;NewsCatID=341 Police raid protesters’ tents in Izmir, supporters released]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the violent clearing of [[Gezi Park]] on 15–16 June by [[riot police]] and [[Turkish Gendarmerie]], [[Beşiktaş JK]]'s supporter group [[Çarşı (supporter group)|Çarşı]], declared the [[Abbasağa Park]], in [[Beşiktaş]] district as the second Gezi Park and called for people to occupy it on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/carsi-2-taksim-ve-2-gezi-parki-abbasagadir-orada-bekleyecegiz/232248 |publisher=T24 |language=Turkish |title=Çarşı: 2.Taksim ve 2.Gezi Parkı Abbasağa'dır, Orada Bekleyeceğiz|date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this call, thousands started to gather at Abbasağa Park, holding [[public forum]]s to discuss and vote on the situation of the resistance and actions to be taken. Shortly after this, democracy forums and meetings spread to many parks in Istanbul and then to the other cities, like [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Mersin]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/world/europe/after-protests-forums-sprout-in-turkeys-parks.html?_r=0 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Sebnem | last=Arsu | title=After Protests, Forums Sprout in Turkey's Parks | date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bianet.org/english/youth/147740-every-park-become-gezi-park-in-turkey|title=Every Park Become Gezi Park in Turkey - Çiçek Tahaoğlu, Yüce Yöney - english|work=Bianet - Bagimsiz Iletisim Agi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

=== Graduations ===
As the protests mostly took place on the beginning of summer, on the time all schools makes their students graduate, the protests and humour have hit hundreds of universities' and high schools' graduations too.

=== Stadiums ===
As lots of fan associations from various parts of Turkey supported and participated in protests actively on the ground and also supported the resistance against AKP government and its various policies, in the stadiums with their chants, clothes, slogans, banners and posters, the stadiums became practical places of Gezi protests and where fans can do even more political expressions than before, mostly opposing to the government and its ideologies. As this continued to happen during the off-season friendly and continental trophy matches, government took lots of precautions with an organising law for stadiums that passed from the assembly with AKP votes, banning to bring politics into stadiums, but soon after the start of the Turkish sports leagues, as most of the fans continued to their protests, this time even more organised and loud, first punishments on the opposing fans and clubs were given, but there were lots of criticism both from Turkish and foreigner experts about the law banning bringing "opposition" into stadiums, not "politics", as some fan groups opened banners that openly support AKP in Konya and supported Morsi of Egypt in Bursa.

===Demonstrations and strikes===

Also in Zeytinburnu, traditionally seen as a conservative working-class neighbourhood to the west of the old city, tens of thousands marched in protest. Among the suburbs that saw demonstrations were Beylikdüzü and Küçükçekmece on the far-western side of the city, Pendik and Kartal at the far east and Ümraniye, Beykoz and Esenler to the North.

Gazi (not to be confused with Gezi Park), a small neighborhood in Istanbul and part of the [[Sultangazi]] district, was one of the major points of counter-protests.

The biggest protests outside Istanbul have been in [[Hatay]] and then in [[Ankara]] and [[Izmir]].&lt;ref name="Antakya"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sendika.org/2013/06/turkiye-direnise-kent-meydanlarina-cadirlar-kurarak-devam-ediyor-il-il-dakika-dakika-eylemler/|title=5 Haziran il Eylemleri/23.03/Antakya|publisher=Sendika.org|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5 Haziran - Antakya"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gezipark.nadir.org/archive_tur.html|publisher=Nadir|title=5 Haziran – Antakya|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=29 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190622/http://gezipark.nadir.org/archive_tur.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duranadam standing man Taksim.svg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[Standing man]]]]

Within 24 hours on 3 June, a [[New York Times]] advertisement led by [[Murat Aktihanoglu]] surpassed its $54,000 crowd-funding target on [[Indiegogo]]. The ad featured demands for "an end to police brutality"; "a free and unbiased media"; and "an open dialogue, not the dictate of an autocrat."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/06/04/full-page-ad-inspired-by-turkish-protests-is-one-of-indiegogos-fastest-campaigns-ever/|title=Full-Page Ad Inspired By Turkish Protests Is One of Indiegogo's Fastest Campaigns Ever|publisher=Forbes|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=10 June 2013|first=Alex|last=Konrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[indiegogo]], [http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/full-page-ad-for-turkish-democracy-in-action-occupygezi-for-the-world--53 Full Page Ad for Turkish Democracy in Action: OccupyGezi for the World]; [https://sites.google.com/a/unsal.com/nyt-ad-survey/ survey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], 5 June 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/whats-happening-in-turkey-occupy-gezi What's happening in Turkey?]&lt;/ref&gt; An early draft sparked debate among Gezi protesters for its references to Atatürk, which was not a common value of the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYT ilanı Taksim eylemcilerini böldü|url=http://www.timeturk.com/tr/2013/06/05/nyt-ilani-taksim-eylemcilerini-boldu.html|accessdate=5 June 2013|publisher=Timetürk|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editing of the final advertisement involved thousands of people, and the ad was published on 7 June. Despite its financing by 2,654 online funders, Erdoğan and his administration blamed a domestic and foreign "bond interest lobby" and ''The New York Times'' for the ad. [http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/full-page-ad-for-turkish-democracy-in-action-occupygezi-for-the-world--53 Full Page Ad for Turkish Democracy in Action: OccupyGezi for the World]

An [[Avaaz]] petition similarly asked for an end to violence against protesters, the preservation of Gezi Park, and of "the remaining green areas in Istanbul."

On 24 July [[The Times]] newspaper published a full-page open letter, drafted and spearheaded by Fuad Kavur, addressed to [[Turkey|Turkish]] PM [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], which condemned the Turkish authorities' heavy-handed crackdown on the Gezi Park protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsworks.org.uk/News-and-Opinion/letter-to-pm-of-turkey-published-in-the-times|title=Letter to PM of Turkey published in The Times|work=newsworks.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was signed by internationally renowned artists and scholars such as [[Sean Penn]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[David Lynch]] and [[Andrew Mango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/penn-sarandon-and-intellectuals-condemn-gezi-crackdown-in-letter-addressed-to-turkish-pm-.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=51364&amp;NewsCatID=338|title=Penn, Sarandon and intellectuals condemn Gezi crackdown in letter to Turkish PM  - POLITICS|work=hurriyetdailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; PM [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] accused The Times of "renting out its pages for money" and threatened to sue the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23474404 | work=BBC News | title=Turkish PM Erdogan threatens to sue Times over open letter | date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing Man/Woman protest===
After the clearing of Gezi Park camp on 15 June a new type of protest developed, dubbed the "Standing Man" or "Standing Woman". A lone protester, Erdem Gündüz, initiated it on 17 June 2013 by standing in Taksim Square for hours, staring at the Turkish flags on the [[Ataturk Cultural Center]]. The Internet distributed images of such protest widely; other persons imitated the protest style and artists took up the theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/06/turkish-protest-has-meme-standing-man/66333/|title=Ohlheiser, Abby, "The Turkish Protests Have a Meme: The Standing Man", The Atlantic, 17 June 2013|author=AbOhlheiser|work=The Wire|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type of [[dilemma action]], the initial Standing Man protest soon inspired others to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Media Award for Standing Man|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=10101|work=InEnArt|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Foundation]] announces 2 May the recipients of the 2014 [[Václav Havel Prize]] for Creative Dissent. The 2014 laureates are Turkish performance artist [[Erdem Gündüz]] - [[Standing Man]] - together with Russian punk protest group [[Pussy Riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Creative Dissent|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=14651|work=InEnArt|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boycott===
An additional form of protest developed under the name "Boykot Listesi", as a [[boycott]] of businesses which had failed to open their doors to protesters seeking refuge from tear gas and water cannon, and of companies such as [[Doğuş Holding]] (owner of [[NTV (Turkey)|NTV]]) which owned media that had not given sufficient coverage of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;sueddeutsche.de, 20 June 2013, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/boykotte-von-jugendlichen-in-der-tuerkei-freiheit-statt-fastfood-1.1701198 Freiheit statt Fastfood ]&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag ''#boykotediyoruz'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;boykotlistesi.com, [http://boykotlistesi.com/ #boykotediyoruz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619144703/http://boykotlistesi.com/ |date=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence and vandalism===
[[File:Güvenlik Anıtı - 6 Jun 13.JPG|thumb|[[Güvenpark]] monument in Ankara after the protests]]

Even though protests were definitely peaceful in the first days and were generally so but in some occasions, there were accusations of violence and vandalism as the protests continued. According to the journalist Gülay Göktürk, "the Gezi Park protesters damaged 103 police cruisers, 207 automobiles, 15 ambulances and 280 buildings and buses in demonstrations across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aydin|first=Tugba|title=Gezi Park, damage and profanity|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-317645-gezi-park-damage-and-profanity.html|newspaper=Today's Zaman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801120703/http://todayszaman.com/columnist-317645-gezi-park-damage-and-profanity.html|archivedate=1 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; though no other sources confirm these figures.

==Responses==

===Government response===
On 29 May, after the initial protests, Erdoğan gave a speech at the [[groundbreaking]] ceremony for the [[Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge]] reiterating his commitment to the redevelopment plan, saying "Whatever you do, we've made our decision and we will implement it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/23390554.asp|title=Başbakan'dan süre pazarlığı|date=29 May 2013|newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |accessdate=1 June 2013|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May Istanbul mayor [[Kadir Topbaş]] stated that the environmental campaign had been manipulated by "political agendas."&lt;ref name="Telegraph1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shrivastava |first=Sanskar |url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2013/06/inside-story-occupy-gezi-movement-turkey.html |title=Inside Story: Occupy Gezi Movement in Turkey; Development Is Not Always Good |work=The World Reporter |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June Erdoğan gave a televised speech condemning the protesters and vowing that "where they gather 20, I will get up and gather 200,000 people. Where they gather 100,000, I will bring together one million from my party."&lt;ref name="Haarezt100k"&gt;{{cite news|title=Erdogan: For every 100,000 protesters, I will bring out a million from my party|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/erdogan-for-every-100-000-protesters-i-will-bring-out-a-million-from-my-party-1.527188|accessdate=2 June 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June he described the protesters as "çapulcular" ("looters").&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 June 2013, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/world/middleeast/turkey-premier-says-protests-will-not-stop-plans-to-demolish-park.html Turkish Leader Says Protests Will Not Stop Plans for Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June Deputy Prime Minister [[Bülent Arınç]] criticised the use of tear gas against demonstrators and stated, "It would have been more helpful to try and persuade the people who said they didn't want a shopping mall, instead of spraying them with tear gas."&lt;ref name="zvi1june"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bar'el|first=Zvi|title=At height of political career, Edrogan's powers put to test|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/at-height-of-political-career-edrogan-s-powers-put-to-test.premium-1.527151|accessdate=1 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June an official tweet summarising new comments by Arınç said "We have been monitoring the non-violent demonstrations with respect."&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]], 4 June 2013, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2401af76-cc31-11e2-9cf7-00144feab7de.html#slide0 Turkish union to join anti-government protests]&lt;/ref&gt; Arınç later apologised for use of "excessive force."&lt;ref name="AlJazeeradespite" /&gt;

On 2 June it was reported that Turkey's President [[Abdullah Gül]] contacted other senior leaders urging "moderation."

===Conspiracy claims===
The government has claimed that a wide variety of shadowy forces were behind the protests. In a speech on 18 June, Erdoğan accused "internal traitors and external collaborators", saying that "It was prepared very professionally... Social media was prepared for this, made equipped. The strongest advertising companies of our country, certain capital groups, the interest rate lobby, organisations on the inside and outside, hubs, they were ready, equipped for this."&lt;ref name="HDN49006"&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 18 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-prime-minister-vows-to-increase-police-force.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=49006&amp;NewsCatID=338 Turkish prime minister vows to increase police force]&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan implicitly included the main opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]] in the category of "internal traitors", claiming that three-quarters of protest participants had voted for the CHP,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According to a survey by GENAR, 74.6% of Gezi Park protesters who voted for a party in the previous elections voted for CHP. {{cite web|url= http://t24.com.tr/haber/geziciler-ile-ilgili-en-kapsamli-anket/231899|title=Geziciler ile ilgili en kapsamlı anket |publisher=T24|language=Turkish|date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accusing CHP leader [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] "of acting like the head of a terrorist organisation by calling on the police not to obey orders."&lt;ref name="HDN49006" /&gt; Erdoğan also claimed that Taksim protests were linked to the [[2013 Reyhanlı bombings|Reyhanlı bombings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/23505720.asp |title=Başbakan Erdoğan: Gezi Parkı mesajı alınmıştır |publisher=Hurriyet |language=Turkish |date=15 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused the CHP of complicity in the bombings, calling on Kılıçdaroğlu to resign.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'', 29 May 2013, [http://english.sabah.com.tr/National/2013/05/29/pm-erdogan-calls-on-opposition-leader-kilicdaroglu-to-resign PM ERDOĞAN CALLS ON OPPOSITION LEADER KıLıÇDAROĞLU TO RESIGN].&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June it was announced that the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organisation]] was investigating foreign elements in the protests. The Foreign Ministry also demanded "a report detailing which efforts these countries took to create a perception against Turkey, which instruments were used in this process, what our embassies did and what were our citizens' reactions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 22 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-intelligence-service-begins-probe-into-foreign-links-of-gezi-park-protests.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=49246&amp;NewsCatID=338 Turkey’s intelligence service begins probe into 'foreign links' of Gezi Park protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July, Deputy Prime Minister [[Besir Atalay]] accused foreign agents and the [[Jewish diaspora]] of orchestrating the protests. "There are some circles that are jealous of Turkey's growth," Atalay said. "They are all uniting, on one side the Jewish Diaspora. You saw the foreign media's attitude during the Gezi Park incidents; they bought it and started broadcasting immediately, without doing an evaluation of the [case]."

[[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] lawmaker and PM Burhan Kuzu accused [[Germany]] of being behind the Gezi protests to stop construction of [[Istanbul]]'s third airport.

Mehmet Eymür, a retired officer from [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|Turkish National Intelligence Organisation]] claimed that [[Mossad]] was behind Gezi protests.

{{Main|Casualties of the Gezi Park protests}}
As protests continued across Turkey, police use of tear gas and water cannons led to injuries running into thousands,&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt; including critical injuries, loss of sight, and a number of deaths. Over three thousand arrests were made.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International" /&gt; Police forces repeatedly used unnecessary and abusive force to prevent and disperse peaceful demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR44/022/2013/en|publisher=Amnesty International|title=Turkey: Gezi Park protests: Brutal denial of the right to peaceful assembly in Turkey|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is estimated that there were 11 fatalities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="muhalefet.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ali Korkmaz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmet Atakan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ulusalkanal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyet1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyet2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 10 June 2013, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-police-admits-suicides-denies-link-to-gezi-park-protests.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=48534&amp;NewsCatID=341 Turkish police admits suicides, denies link to Gezi Park protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media censorship and disinformation==
{{Main|Media censorship and disinformation during the Gezi Park protests}}

Foreign media noted that, particularly in the early days (31 May – 2 June), the protests attracted relatively little mainstream media coverage in Turkey, due to either government pressure on media groups' business interests or simply ideological sympathy by media outlets.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCTurksdeprived"&gt;BBC, 4 June 2013, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22756884 Turks deprived of TV turn to Twitter for protest news]&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC noted that while some outlets are aligned with the AKP or are personally close to Erdoğan, "most mainstream media outlets – such as TV news channels HaberTurk and NTV, and the major centrist daily ''Milliyet'' – are loath to irritate the government because their owners' business interests at times rely on government support. All of these have tended to steer clear of covering the demonstrations."&lt;ref name="BBCTurksdeprived" /&gt; [[Ulusal Kanal]] and [[Halk TV]] provided extensive live coverage from Gezi park.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Welle, 1 June 2013, [http://www.dw.de/solidarity-with-istanbul-protesters-grows-in-turkey-and-abroad/a-16853318 Solidarity with Istanbul protesters grows in Turkey and abroad]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Politics===
According to [[Koray Çalışkan]], a political scientist at Istanbul's [[Boğaziçi University]], the protests are "a turning point for the AKP. Erdoğan is a very confident and a very authoritarian politician, and he doesn't listen to anyone anymore. But he needs to understand that Turkey is no kingdom, and that he cannot rule Istanbul from Ankara all by himself."&lt;ref name="euroankara"&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey protests spread from Istanbul to Ankara|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/05/31/turkey-protests-spread-from-istanbul-to-ankara/|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=31 May 2013|agency=[[Euronews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Çalışkan also suggested that the prospects for Erdoğan's plan to enact a new constitution based on a [[presidential system]], with Erdoğan becoming the first President under this system, might have been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2 June 2013 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/02/turkish-protesters-control-istanbul-square Turkish protesters control Istanbul square after two days of clashes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the AKP's support lying with religious conservatives, some conservative and [[Islamist]] organisations stood against Erdoğan. Groups such as the Anti-Capitalist Muslims and Revolutionist Muslims performed Friday prayers ([[salat]]) in front of the ''mescid çadırı'' (mosque tent) in [[Gezi Park]] on 7 and 14 June, one day before the police eviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gundem.milliyet.com.tr/gezi-parki-nda-ikinci-cuma-namazi/gundem/detay/1722966/default.htm |language=Turkish |title=Gezi Parkı'nda İkinci Cuma Namazı (2nd Friday Salat in Gezi Park) |publisher=[[Milliyet]] |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Gundem/2013/06/07/gezi-parkinda-cuma-namazi |language=Turkish |title=Friday Salat in Gezi Park |publisher=Sabah |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gezihaberleri/23454220.asp |language=Turkish |title=Gezi Parkı'nda ilk Cuma Namazı (First Friday Salat in Gezi Park) |publisher=[[Hürriyet]] |date=8 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of the protests, demonstrations had taken place in [[Mersin]], the city which was to host the [[2013 Mediterranean Games]]. Since Erdoğan was due to speak at the opening ceremony of the games, there was speculation that protesters would take the opportunity to embarrass the government. Just 15 minutes after the tickets went on sale online they were all sold to an anonymous buyer and apparently distributed to various [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.odatv.com/n.php?n=basbakandan-protestoyu-engellemek-icin-imam-formulu-2006131200 |publisher=[[Odatv|Oda TV]] |language=Turkish |title=Başbakandan protestoyu engellemek için imam formülü |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürriyet Mersin Scandal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/23549027.asp |language=Turkish |title=Akdeniz Oyunları'nda Bilet Krizi |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=[[Hürriyet]] |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a boycott by local people of the games, this meant that the stadium was frequently nearly empty. Protesters were prevented from approaching the stadium by riot police, and were evicted from Mersin's Peace Park (''Barış Parkı'') the night before the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sendika.org/2013/06/mersin-baris-meydanindaki-direnis-cadirlari-tayyip-erdogan-gelecek-diye-sokuluyor/ |publisher=sendika.org |title=Mersin Barış Meydanı'ndaki Direniş Çadırları Tayyip Erdoğan Gelecek Diye Sökülüyor! |language=Turkish |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets were used against protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/kent-gundemleri/mersinde-erdogan-protestosuna-polis-saldirisi-haberi-75048 |title=Mersin'de Erdoğan ve Bilet protestosuna polis saldırısı |publisher=SoL |date=20 June 2013 |language=Turkish |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scandals which surrounded the games included: eight Turkish [[Olympic weightlifting|weight-lifters]] found to have [[doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] in their blood and subsequently being disqualified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spor.haberturk.com/olimpiyat/haber/854228-halterde-doping-soku|publisher=[[Habertürk]] (Spor)|title=Halter'de Doping Şoku|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And a van belonging to the Games organisation transporting staff and athletes being seen in front of a [[brothel]] in [[Mersin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sozcu.com.tr/2013/gundem/akdeniz-oyunlari-bitti-ama-genelev-kavgasi-buyuyor.html|title=Akdeniz Oyunları Bitti ama Skandallar Sürüyor ve Genelev Kavgası Büyüyor|publisher=[[Sözcü]]|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727030106/http://sozcu.com.tr/2013/gundem/akdeniz-oyunlari-bitti-ama-genelev-kavgasi-buyuyor.html|archivedate=27 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xn--sportrkiye-eeb.com/haber-23766-akdeniz-oyunlarinda-genelev-skandali.html#.UdSGszvwlQg|title=Akdeniz Oyunları'nda Şimdi de Genelev Skandalı|publisher=SporTürkiye|date=28{{ndash}}29 June 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2020 Summer Olympics Bid===
Istanbul mayor [[Kadir Topbaş]] gave an interview expressing concern that the police's actions would jeopardise [[Istanbul bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics]], saying "As Istanbul's mayor going through such an event, the fact that the whole world watched saddens me.

===Economy===
On 3 June, Istanbul's stock exchange experienced a loss of 10.5% in a single day—the drop was "the biggest one-day loss in a decade."&lt;ref name="stockmarketsbbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22750491 |title=Turkish stock market falls as demonstrations escalate |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Holly Ellyatt |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100764542 |title=Turkish Stocks Drop 10.5% on Fourth Day of Protests |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of [[Borsa Istanbul|BIST 100]] index was the sharpest since August 2011,&lt;ref name="stockmarketsmilliyet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ekonomi.milliyet.com.tr/borsa-sert-dususle-basladi/ekonomi/detay/1717894/default.htm|title=Stock markets in shock|newspaper=Milliyet|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the yield on two-year lira bonds rose 71 basis points to 6.78 percent, the biggest jump since 2005. Turkish central bank had to auction out and buy Turkish Lira`s in order to keep the exchange rate going. Next 11 funds have also dropped due to the Turkish prime minister’s opposing views on freedom and democracy&lt;ref name="stockmarketsbloomburg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkish Yields Surge Most on Record as Protests Hit Lira, Stocks|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-06-03/turkish-bonds-lose-most-since-2008-as-protests-hit-lira-stocks|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=3 June 2013|agency=[[Businessweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June, PM Erdoğan said the redevelopment plans would go ahead despite the protests.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt; Shortly after the comments were broadcast, the Turkish stock markets fell 5%.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], 6 June 2013, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-06/turkish-bonds-slump-while-lira-climbs-as-central-bank-tightens.html Turkish Bonds, Stocks Slump as Erdogan Fails to Calm Investors]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June, Rating's agency [[Moody's]] warned Turkey that ongoing protests would result in significant credit risks, leading "Istanbul's main share index" to fall an additional 1.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Star Lebanon, 11 June 2013, [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2013/Jun-11/219967-moodys-warns-of-risk-from-turkey-protests.ashx Moody’s warns of risk from Turkey protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary block of EU accession talks===

On 25 June 2013 EU foreign ministers backed Germany's proposal to postpone further EU membership talks with Turkey for about four months due to the government's handling of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/24/us-turkey-protests-eu-idUSBRE95N19F20130624|title=Germany proposes delaying EU-Turkey talks over protests|work=Reuters|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This delay raised new doubts about whether Turkey should ever be admitted to the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/eu-delays-latest-round-of-turkish-entry-talks-1.1442056 EU delays latest round of Turkish entry talks - European News | Latest News from Across Europe | The Irish Times - Tue, 25 Jun 2013].

A '''great power''' is a [[sovereign state]] that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess [[military]] and [[economy|economic]] strength, as well as diplomatic and [[soft power]] influence, which may cause [[middle power|middle]] or [[small power]]s to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. [[International relations theory|International relations theorists]] have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.

While some nations are widely considered to be great powers, there is no definitive list of them. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="World history1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fueter|first=Eduard|title=World history, 1815–1930|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1922|location=United States|pages=25–28, 36–44|isbn=1-58477-077-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XeKyv9l-3QEC&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stakes1"&gt;Danilovic, Vesna.

The term "great power" was first used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] era. The "Great Powers" constituted the "[[Concert of Europe]]" and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties.&lt;ref name="British Diplomacy 1813–1815"&gt;Charles Webster, (ed), ''British Diplomacy 1813–1815: Selected Documents Dealing with the Reconciliation of Europe,'' (1931), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; The formalization of the division between [[small powers]]&lt;ref&gt;Toje, A. (2010). The European Union as a small power: After the post-Cold War. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; and great powers came about with the signing of the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814. Since then, the international [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In literature, alternative terms for great power are often world power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/world%20power?s=t|title=the definition of world power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or major power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/major+power?s=t|title=Dictionary – Major power|website=reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these terms can also be interchangeable with [[superpower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/world%20power|title= "world power" on the new Thesaurus.com!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
There are no set or defined characteristics of a great power. These characteristics have often been treated as empirical, self-evident to the assessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of International Politics|last=Waltz|first=Kenneth N|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1979|page=131|isbn=0-201-08349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach has the disadvantage of subjectivity. As a result, there have been attempts to derive some common criteria and to treat these as essential elements of great power status. Danilovic (2002) highlights three central characteristics, which she terms as "power, spatial, and status dimensions," that distinguish major powers from other states. The following section ("Characteristics") is extracted from her discussion of these three dimensions, including all of the citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When the Stakes Are High – Deterrence and Conflict among Major Powers|last=Danilovic|first=Vesna|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-472-11287-6}} [https://www.press.umich.edu/16953/when_the_stakes_are_high]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early writings on the subject tended to judge states by the [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] criterion, as expressed by the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] when he noted that "The test of a great power is the test of strength for war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918|last=Taylor|first=Alan JP|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford|year=1954|page=xxiv|isbn=0-19-881270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers have expanded this test, attempting to define power in terms of overall military, economic, and political capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Organski, AFK – World Politics, Knopf (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Waltz]], the founder of the [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] theory of international relations, uses a set of five criteria to determine great power: population and territory; resource endowment; economic capability; political stability and competence; and military strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Kenneth N.|date=1993|title=The Emerging Structure of International Politics|url=http://www.ir.rochelleterman.com/sites/default/files/Waltz%201993.pdf|journal=International Security|volume=18|issue=2|pages=50|via=International Relations Exam Database|doi=10.2307/2539097|jstor=2539097}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expanded criteria can be divided into three heads: power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status.&lt;ref name="When the Stakes27"&gt;Danilovic, Vesna. "When the Stakes Are High – Deterrence and Conflict among Major Powers", University of Michigan Press (2002), pp 27, 225–230 [https://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472112872-appb.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power dimensions===
[[File:Jebens, Adolf - Leopold von Ranke (detail) - 1875.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold von Ranke]] was one of the first to attempt to scientifically document the great powers.]]
As noted above, for many, power capabilities were the sole criterion. However, even under the more expansive tests, power retains a vital place.

This aspect has received mixed treatment, with some confusion as to the degree of power required. Writers have approached the concept of great power with differing conceptualizations of the world situation, from multi-polarity to overwhelming [[hegemony]]. In his essay, 'French Diplomacy in the Postwar Period', the French historian Jean-Baptiste Duroselle spoke of the concept of multi-polarity: "A Great power is one which is capable of preserving its own independence against any other single power."&lt;ref&gt;contained on page 204 in: Kertesz and Fitsomons (eds) – ''Diplomacy in a Changing World'', University of Notre Dame Press (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

This differed from earlier writers, notably from [[Leopold von Ranke]], who clearly had a different idea of the world situation. In his essay 'The Great Powers', written in 1833, von Ranke wrote: "If one could establish as a definition of a Great power that it must be able to maintain itself against all others, even when they are united, then [[Frederick the Great|Frederick]] has raised Prussia to that position."&lt;ref&gt;Iggers and von Moltke "In the Theory and Practice of History", Bobbs-Merril (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; These positions have been the subject of criticism.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="When the Stakes27"/&gt;

===Spatial dimension===
All states have a geographic scope of interests, actions, or projected power. This is a crucial factor in distinguishing a great power from a regional power; by definition the scope of a [[regional power]] is restricted to its region. It has been suggested that a great power should be possessed of actual influence throughout the scope of the prevailing international system. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], for example, observes that "Great power may be defined as a political force exerting an effect co-extensive with the widest range of the society in which it operates. The Great powers of 1914 were 'world-powers' because Western society had recently become 'world-wide'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World After the Peace Conference|last=Toynbee|first=Arnold J|publisher=Humphrey Milford and Oxford University Press|year=1926|page=4|url=https://archive.org/details/TheWorldAfterThePeaceConference|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suggestions have been made that a great power should have the capacity to engage in extra-regional affairs and that a great power ought to be possessed of extra-regional interests, two propositions which are often closely connected.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Richard J – State Power, World Views, and the Major Powers, Contained in: Stoll and Ward (eds) – Power in World Politics, Lynne Rienner (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status dimension===
Formal or informal acknowledgment of a nation's great power status has also been a criterion for being a great power. As political scientist [[George Modelski]] notes, "The status of Great power is sometimes confused with the condition of being powerful. The office, as it is known, did in fact evolve from the role played by the great military states in earlier periods... But the Great power system institutionalizes the position of the powerful state in a web of rights and obligations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of World Politics|last=Modelski|first=George|publisher=Free Press|year=1972|page=141|isbn=978-0-02-921440-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach restricts analysis to the epoch following the [[Congress of Vienna]] at which great powers were first formally recognized.&lt;ref name="When the Stakes27"/&gt; In the absence of such a formal act of recognition it has been suggested that great power status can arise by implication by judging the nature of a state's relations with other great powers.&lt;ref name="Power in World Politics"&gt;Domke, William K – Power, Political Capacity, and Security in the Global System, Contained in: Stoll and Ward (eds) – Power in World Politics, Lynn Rienner (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

A further option is to examine a state's willingness to act as a great power.&lt;ref name="Power in World Politics"/&gt; As a nation will seldom declare that it is acting as such, this usually entails a retrospective examination of state conduct. As a result, this is of limited use in establishing the nature of contemporary powers, at least not without the exercise of subjective observation.

Other important criteria throughout history are that great powers should have enough influence to be included in discussions of contemporary political and diplomatic questions and exercise influence on the final outcome and resolution. Historically, when major political questions were addressed, several great powers met to discuss them. Before the era of groups like the United Nations, participants of such meetings were not officially named but rather were decided based on their great power status. These were conferences which settled important questions based on major historical events.

[[File:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|''The [[Congress of Vienna]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], 1819]]
Different sets of great, or significant, powers have existed throughout history. An early reference to great powers is from the [[3rd century]], when the Persian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] described [[Roman Empire|Rome]], [[China]], [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], and [[Iran|Persia]] as the four greatest kingdoms of his time.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4376627.stm&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "great power" has only been used in scholarly or diplomatic discourse since the Congress of Vienna in 1815.&lt;ref name="When the Stakes27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="World history, 1815-1920"/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by template List of great powers by date --&gt; The Congress established the [[Concert of Europe]] as an attempt to preserve peace after the years of [[Napoleonic Wars]].

[[Lord Castlereagh]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British foreign secretary]], first used the term in its diplomatic context, in a letter sent on 13 February 1814: "It affords me great satisfaction to acquaint you that there is every prospect of the Congress terminating with a general accord and Guarantee between the Great powers of Europe, with a determination to support the arrangement agreed upon, and to turn the general influence and if necessary the general arms against the Power that shall first attempt to disturb the Continental peace."&lt;ref name="British Diplomacy 1813–1815"/&gt;

The Congress of Vienna consisted of five main powers: the [[Austrian Empire]], [[France]], [[Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] (UK). These five primary participants constituted the original great powers as we know the term today.&lt;ref name="When the Stakes27"/&gt; Other powers, such as [[Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and [[Sweden]], which was a great power during the 17th century, were consulted on certain specific issues, but they were not full participants. [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (its [[Prince-elector|elector]] was also [[George III of the United Kingdom|king of the UK]]), [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] were also consulted on issues relating to Germany.

Of the five original great powers [[Diplomatic recognition|recognized]] at the Congress of Vienna, only France and the United Kingdom have maintained that status continuously to the present day, although France was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and occupied during [[World War II]]. After the Congress of Vienna, the [[British Empire]] emerged as the [[pre-eminent]] power, due to its navy and the extent of its territories, which signalled the beginning of the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' and of [[the Great Game]] between the UK and Russia. The [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] between the Great Powers became a major influence in European politics, prompting [[Otto von Bismarck]] to say "All politics reduces itself to this formula: try to be one of three, as long as the world is governed by the unstable equilibrium of five great powers."&lt;ref name="Bartlett1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=C.

Over time, the relative power of these five nations fluctuated, which by the dawn of the 20th century had served to create an entirely different balance of power. Some, such as the United Kingdom and Prussia (as the founder of the newly formed [[German Empire|German state]]), experienced continued economic growth and political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courses.rochester.edu/stone/PSC272/lectures/05-Pro%20Waltz.ppt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616093235/http://www.courses.rochester.edu/stone/PSC272/lectures/05-Pro%20Waltz.ppt|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-16|title=Multi-polarity vs Bipolarity, Subsidiary hypotheses, Balance of Power|accessdate=2008-12-20|format=PPT|publisher=University of Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/europe/aus-hun.htm|title=European History ''Austria-Hungary 1870–1914''|accessdate=2008-12-20|last=Tonge|first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of [[industrialization]]. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] after the [[Risorgimento]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] after the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the [[United States]] after its [[American Civil War|civil war]]. By the dawn of the 20th century, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna. The [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] was a belligerent alliance of eight nations against the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China. It formed in 1900 and consisted of the five Congress powers plus Italy, Japan, and the United States, representing the great powers at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Rise of Russia1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dallin|first=David|title=The Rise of Russia in Asia|publisher=Read Books|date=2006-11-30|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q5nIUd_mlEcC&amp;pg=PA62|isbn=978-1-4067-2919-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Four were leading architects of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed by [[Germany]]; the Treaty of St. Germain, with [[Austria]]; the Treaty of Neuilly, with [[Bulgaria]]; the Treaty of Trianon, with [[Hungary]]; and the Treaty of Sèvres, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the decision-making of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Italy pulled out of the conference because a part of its demands were not met and temporarily left the other three countries as the sole major architects of that treaty, referred to as the "Big Three".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/treaty_of_versailles.htm|title=The Treaty of Versailles|work=History Learning Site}}, See the part: The attitude towards Germany of the "Big Three"："The "Big Three" were David Lloyd George of Britain, Clemenceau of France and Woodrow Wilson of America."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacMillan1"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacMillan|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret MacMillan|title=[[Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War|Paris 1919]]|publisher=Random House Trade|year=2003|location=United States of America|pages=36, 306, 431|isbn=0-375-76052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boemeke|first=Manfred|author2=Gerald D.

The victorious great powers also gained an acknowledgement of their status through permanent seats at the [[League of Nations]] Council, where they acted as a type of [[Executive (government)|executive]] body directing the Assembly of the League. However, the Council began with only four permanent members – the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan – because the United States, meant to be the fifth permanent member, did not ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]], thus preventing American participation in the League. Germany later joined, and left along with Japan, and the Soviet Union joined.

When [[World War II]] started in 1939, it divided the world into two alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (the [[United Kingdom]] and France at first in Europe, China in Asia since 1937, followed in 1941 by the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States) and the [[Axis powers]] ([[Nazi Germany|Germany]], Italy, and Japan).&lt;ref name="Economics1"&gt;Harrison, M (2000) [https://www.google.com/books?id=ZgFu2p5uogwC&amp;dq=great+powers&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn#PPA1, M1 The Economics of World War II: Six Great Powers in International Comparison], Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Even though the book ''The Economics of World War II'' lists seven great powers at the start of 1939 (the British Empire, the Empire of Japan, France, the Kingdom of Italy, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States), it focuses only on six of them, because France surrendered shortly after the war began.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union controlled Allied policy and emerged as the "Big Three".

Since the end of the World Wars, the term "great power" has been joined by a number of other power classifications. Foremost among these is the concept of the [[superpower]], used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world. It was first coined in 1944 by [[William T. R. Fox]]&lt;ref name="The Superpowers"&gt;''The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union – Their Responsibility for Peace'' (1944), written by [[William Thornton Rickert Fox|William T.R. Fox]]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to him, there were three superpowers: the [[British Empire]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. But after World War II the British Empire lost its superpower status, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] suggested that the United Kingdom, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue its [[foreign policy]] objectives on an equal footing with the new superpowers without sacrificing [[convertibility]] of its [[reserve currency]] as a central goal of policy. – from [[superpower]] cited by {{cite journal|first=Adam|last=Klug|first2=Gregor W.|last2=Smith|title=Suez and Sterling, 1956|journal=[[Explorations in Economic History]]|volume=36|issue=3|year=1999|pages=181–203|doi=10.1006/exeh.1999.0720}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[middle power]] has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence, but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs. [[Regional power]]s are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world.

During the [[Cold War]], the Asian power of Japan and the European powers of the United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] rebuilt their economies. France and the United Kingdom maintained technologically advanced armed forces with [[power projection]] capabilities and maintain large defence budgets to this day. Yet, as the Cold War continued, authorities began to question if France and the United Kingdom could retain their long-held statuses as great powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005274|title=Middle Power|accessdate=2008-12-20|last=Holmes|first=John|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303131625/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005274|archivedate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; China, with the world's largest population, has slowly risen to great power status, with large growth in economic and military power in the post-war period. After 1949, the Republic of China began to lose its recognition as the sole legitimate government of China by the other great powers, in favour of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Subsequently, in 1971, it lost its permanent seat at the UN Security Council to the People's Republic of China.

===Great powers at peace===
According to Joshua Baron, a "researcher, lecturer, and consultant on international conflict", since the early 1960s direct military conflicts and major confrontations have "receded into the background" with regards to relations among the great powers.&lt;ref name="Joshua1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron|first1=Joshua|title=Great Power Peace and American Primacy: The Origins and Future of a New International Order|date=22 January 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=United States|isbn=1137299487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron argues several reasons why this is the case, citing the unprecedented rise of the United States and its [[Hegemony|predominant position]] as the key reason. Baron highlights that since World War Two no other great power has been able to achieve parity or near parity with the United States, with the exception of the Soviet Union for a brief time.&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt; This position is unique among the great powers since the start of the modern era (the 16th century), where there has traditionally always been "tremendous parity among the great powers". This unique period of [[Pax Americana|American primacy]] has been an important factor in maintaining a condition of peace between the great powers.&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt;

Another important factor is the apparent consensus among Western great powers that military force is no longer an effective tool of resolving disputes among their peers.&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt; This "subset" of great powers – France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – consider maintaining a "state of peace" as desirable. As evidence, Baron outlines that since the [[Cuban missile crisis]] (1962) during the Cold War, these influential Western nations have resolved all disputes among the great powers peacefully at the United Nations and other forums of international discussion.&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt;

Referring to great power relations pre-1960, Baron highlights that starting from around the 16th century and the rise of several European great powers, military conflicts and confrontations was the defining characteristic of diplomacy and relations between such powers.&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt; "Between 1500 and 1953, there were 64 wars in which at least one great power was opposed to another, and they averaged little more than five years in length. During this approximately 450-year time frame, on average, at least two great powers were fighting one another in each and every year."&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt; Even during the period of ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (or "the British Peace") between 1815 and 1914, war and military confrontations among the great powers was still a frequent occurrence. In fact, Baron points out that, in terms of militarized conflicts or confrontations, the UK led the way in this period with nineteen such instances against; Russia (8), France (5), Germany/[[Prussia]] (5) and Italy (1).&lt;ref name="Joshua1" /&gt;

China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are often referred to as great powers by academics due to "their political and economic dominance of the global arena".&lt;ref&gt;Yasmi Adriansyah, 'Questioning Indonesia's place in the world', ''Asia Times'' (20 September 2011): 'Though there are still debates on which countries belong to which category, there is a common understanding that the GP [great power] countries are the United States, China, United Kingdom, France and Russia.

They are also the only state entities to have met the conditions to be considered "[[List of states with nuclear weapons|Nuclear Weapons States]]" under the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], and maintain [[List of countries by military expenditures|military expenditures]] which are among the largest in the world.&lt;ref name="SIPRI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=458#|title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2012 (table)|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|format=PDF|accessdate=15 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415232842/http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=458|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no unanimous agreement among authorities as to the current status of these powers or what precisely defines a great power.

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], its UN Security Council permanent seat was transferred to the [[Russian Federation]] in 1991, as its [[successor state]].

This is most notable in areas where the European Union has exclusive competence (i.e. economic affairs). It also reflects a non-traditional conception of Europe's world role as a global "civilian power", exercising collective influence in the functional spheres of trade and diplomacy, as an alternative to military dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Veit Bachmann and James D Sidaway, "Zivilmacht Europa: A Critical Geopolitics of the European Union as a Global Power", ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'', New Series, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Jan., 2009), pp. 94–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is a [[supranational union]] and not a [[sovereign state]] and has its own  foreign affairs and defence policy.

==Hierarchy of great powers==
The political scientist, geo-strategist, and former US [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Zbigniew Brzezinski appraised the current standing of the great powers in his 2012 publication ''Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power''. In relation to great powers, he makes the following points:
{{quote|The United States is still preeminent but the legitimacy, effectiveness, and durability of its leadership is increasingly questioned worldwide because of the complexity of its internal and external challenges. ... The European Union could compete to be the world's number two power, but this would require a more robust political union, with a common foreign policy and a shared defense capability. ... In contrast, China's remarkable economic momentum, its capacity for decisive political decisions motivated by clearheaded and self centered national interest, its relative freedom from debilitating external commitments, and its steadily increasing military potential coupled with the worldwide expectation that soon it will challenge America's premier global status justify ranking China just below the United States in the current international hierarchy. ... A sequential ranking of other major powers beyond the top two would be imprecise at best. Any list, however, has to include Russia, Japan, and India, as well as the EU's informal leaders: Great Britain, Germany, and France.&lt;ref name=Brzezinskiquote/&gt;}}

According to a 2014 report of the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies:
{{quote|Great Powers... are disproportionately engaged in alliances and wars, and their diplomatic weight is often cemented by their strong role in international institutions and forums. This unequal distribution of power and prestige leads to “a set of rights and rules governing interactions among states” that sees incumbent powers competing to maintain the status quo and keep their global influence. In today’s international system, there are four great powers that fit this definition: the United States (US), Russia, China and the European Union (whereby the EU is considered to be the sum of its parts). If we distil from this description of great power attributes and capabilities a list of criteria, it is clear why these four powers dominate the international security debate. The possession of superior military and economic capabilities can be translated into measurements such as military expenditure and GDP, and nowhere are the inherent privileges of great powers more visible than in the voting mechanisms of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), where five permanent members have an overriding veto. The top ten countries ranked on the basis of military expenditures correspond almost exactly with the top ten countries ranked on the basis of GDP with the exception of Saudi Arabia which is surpassed by Brazil. Notably, each country with a permanent seat on the UNSC also finds itself in the top ten military and economic powers. When taken as the sum of its parts, the EU scores highest in terms of economic wealth and diplomatic weight in the UNSC. This is followed closely by the US, which tops the military expenditures ranking, and then Russia and China, both of which exert strong military, economic, and diplomatic influence in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcss.nl/reports/why-are-pivot-states-so-pivotal-the-role-of-pivot-states-in-regional-and-global-security/150/ Why are Pivot states so Pivotal?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211162346/http://www.hcss.nl/reports/why-are-pivot-states-so-pivotal-the-role-of-pivot-states-in-regional-and-global-security/150/ |date=2016-02-11 }}, hcss.nl, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Hard Hat Riot''' occurred on May 8, 1970, in [[New York City]]. It started around noon when about 200 [[construction worker]]s mobilized by the New York State [[AFL–CIO|AFL-CIO]] attacked some 1,000 college and high school [[Student strike of 1970|students and others who were protesting]] the May 4 [[Kent State shootings]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the April 30 announcement by President [[Richard Nixon]] of the [[Cambodian Campaign|U.S. invasion of Cambodia]]. The Hard Hat Riot, breaking out first near the intersection of [[Wall Street]] and [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], soon spilled into [[New York City Hall]], and lasted approximately two hours. More than 70 people, including four policemen, were injured on what became known as "Bloody Friday". Six people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/hardhats/homepage.html Profile of incident], chnm.gmu.edu; accessed April 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On May 4, 1970, [[Kent State shootings|thirteen students were shot]], four of them fatally, at [[Kent State University]] in [[Ohio]] by National Guardsmen as they protested the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] and [[Cambodian Campaign|U.S. incursions into Cambodia]]. As a show of sympathy for the dead students, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Mayor of New York City]] [[John Lindsay]] ordered all flags at [[New York City Hall]] to be flown at half-staff the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Kifner, "4 Kent State Students Killed by Troops", ''New York Times'', May 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[labor movement]] was deeply divided over support for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s Vietnam War policy. [[AFL-CIO]] president [[George Meany]] and most labor leaders in the United States were vehemently [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and thus strongly supported U.S. military involvement in [[Southeast Asia]].

One of the strongest supporters of the President's war policy was [[Peter J. Brennan]], president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an alliance of building and construction unions in the New York City area. He was also president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York, the statewide umbrella group for construction unions. Additionally, he served as the vice president of the New York City Central Labor Council and the New York State AFL-CIO, umbrella groups for all labor unions in these respective areas.&lt;ref name="Mcfadden"&gt;McFadden, [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/04/nyregion/peter-brennan-78-union-head-and-nixon-s-labor-chief.html "Peter Brennan, 78, Union Head and Nixon's Labor Chief"], nytimes.com, October 4, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fink, ''Biographical Dictionary of American Labor'', 1984.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan was a registered Democrat who had lobbied strongly for Democrats through the 1950s and 1960s, but increasingly supported Republican candidates as support for skilled labor unions decreased.&lt;ref name="Mcfadden"/&gt; The building and construction unions were overwhelmingly white, Catholic, [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] and male; large majorities of these supported Nixon's Vietnam policy.&lt;ref name="Foner"&gt;Foner, ''U.S. Labor and the Vietnam War'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Kent State shootings, anti-war protesters announced that they would hold a rally near city hall to commemorate the four dead students. Brennan decided to organize a counter-rally of construction workers to show support for the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]].&lt;ref name="Mcfadden"/&gt;

==The riot==
At 7:30&amp;nbsp;am on May 8, several-hundred anti-war protesters&lt;ref name="tsun"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cS9mAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1137,1676616|title=150,000 New York workers join in pro-Nixon parade|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=May 20, 1970|page=3|location=New York|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; (most of them high school and college students) began holding a memorial at Broad and Wall streets for the four dead students at Kent State. By late morning, the protesters—now numbering more than a thousand—had moved to the steps of [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], gathering in front of the statue of [[George Washington]] which tops the steps. The protesters demanded an end to the war in Vietnam and Cambodia, the release of [[political prisoner]]s in the United States, and an end to military-related research on all university campuses.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigart"&gt;Bigart, [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/09/archives/war-foes-here-attacked-by-construction-workers-city-hall-is-stormed.html "War Foes Here Attacked By Construction Workers"], ''New York Times'', May 9, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, "Hardhats: Construction Workers, Manliness, and the 1970 Pro-War Demonstrations", ''Journal of Social History'', Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:45 am, about 200 construction workers converged on the student rally at Federal Hall from four directions. Nearly all the construction workers carried U.S. flags and signs that read "All the way, USA" and "America, love it or leave it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title "Protesting: 1970 Year in Review"], UPI.com; accessed April 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Their numbers may have been doubled by others who had joined them as they marched toward Federal Hall. A thin and inadequate line of [[New York City Police Department|police]], who were largely sympathetic to the workers' position, formed to separate the construction workers from the anti-war protesters. At first, the construction workers only pushed but did not break through the police line. After two minutes, however, they broke through the police line and began chasing students through the streets. The workers chose those with the longest hair and beat them with their hard hats and other weapons, including clubs and steel-toe boots. Onlookers reported that the police stood by and did nothing.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

Some of the construction workers and counter-protesters moved across City Hall Park toward [[New York City Hall|city hall]]. They mounted the steps, planted their flags at the top of the steps, then attempted to gain entrance. Police on duty at city hall initially barred them, but soon the mob pushed past. A few workers entered the building. A postal worker rushed onto the roof of city hall and raised the U.S. flag there to full mast. When city workers lowered the flag back down to half-mast, a large number of construction workers stormed past the police. Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio, fearing the building would be overrun by the mob, ordered city workers to raise the flag back to full mast.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

Rioting construction workers also attacked buildings near city hall; most were of Irish Catholic extraction and some ripped the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] flags down from a flagpole at nearby [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]]. One group invaded two nearby [[Pace University]] buildings, smashing lobby windows with clubs and crowbars and beating up students. More than 70 people were injured, including four policemen. Most of the injured required hospital treatment. Six people were arrested.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Pjbrennan.jpg|thumb|Peter J. Brennan, U.S. Secretary of Labor during the Nixon and Ford administrations.]]
During a press conference that evening, President Nixon tried to defuse the situation before tens of thousands of students arrived in Washington, D.C. for a scheduled protest rally the next day. Nixon told these protesters that he agreed with what they were trying to accomplish, and defended the recent U.S. troop movements into Cambodia as aiding their goal of peace.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/09/archives/nixon-defends-cambodia-drive-as-aiding-students-peace-aim-says.html "NIXON DEFENDS CAMBODIA DRIVE AS AIDING STUDENTS' PEACE AIM; says pullout will begin soon], nytimes.com, May 9, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Lindsay severely criticized the police for their lack of action.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Carroll, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10A15FB3D5417768FDDA90994DD405B808BF1D3 "Police Assailed by Mayor On Laxity at Peace Rally"], nytimes.com, May 10, 1970, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City Police Department|NYC police]] leaders later accused Lindsay of "undermining the confidence of the public in its police department" by his statements,&lt;ref&gt;David Burnham, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0C17FD395910728DDDAB0994DD405B808BF1D3 5 Police Groups Rebut Critical Mayor], nytimes.com, May 12, 1970, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and blamed the inaction on inadequate preparations and "inconsistent directives" in the past from the mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Kaufman. [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10F12FF3F5D137B93C3A8178ED85F448785F9 "P.B.A BLAMES CITY IN REPLY TO MAYOR ON LAXITY CHARGE; City Hall Directive Called 'Inconsistent' as Guide in Attack by Workers"], ''The New York Times'', May 11, 1970, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, Brennan and officials of other unions claimed the confrontation had been a spontaneous reaction by union workers allegedly "fed up" with violence and [[flag desecration]] by antiwar demonstrators, and denied that anything except fists had been used against the demonstrators. Brennan claimed telephone calls and letters to the unions were 20 to 1 in favor of the workers.&lt;!-- RELEVANCE?? --&gt;&lt;ref name="Perlmutter"&gt;Perlmutter, [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/12/archives/head-of-building-trades-unions-here-says-response-favors-fridays.html "Head of Building Trades Unions Here Says Response Favors Friday's Action; 20-1 Endorsement Cited In Phone Calls and Mail"], nytimes.com, May 12, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; One man, Edward Shufro, of the brokerage firm Rose and Ehrman, saw two men wearing grey suits directing the workers.&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Shufro, of the brokerage firm Rose and Ehrman, watched through binoculars two men in grey suits who, he said, seemed to be directing the workers". See Bigart, "War Foes Here Attacked By Construction Workers", nytimes.com, May 9, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several thousand construction workers, longshoremen and white-collar workers protested against the Mayor on May 11, holding signs reading "impeach the Red Mayor"&lt;ref name="tsun"/&gt; and chanting "Lindsay is a bum".&lt;ref name="BIGART2"&gt;HOMER BIGART [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40C16FD395910728DDDAB0994DD405B808BF1D3 "Thousands Assail Lindsay In 2d Protest by Workers"], nytimes.com, May 12, 1970, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They held another rally May 16, carrying signs calling the mayor a "rat", "commy rat" and "traitor".&lt;ref&gt;Homer Bigart, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20911FD3F5D137B93C4A8178ED85F448785F9 "Thousands in City March To Assail Lindsay on War"], nytimes.com, May 16, 1970, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Lindsay described the mood of the city as "taut".&lt;ref name="BIGART2"/&gt;

The rallies culminated in a large rally on May 20 in which an estimated 150,000 pro-war protesters marched without opposition through the streets of downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref name="tsun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1970-05-21"&gt;Bigart, Homer [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/21/archives/huge-city-hall-rally-backs-nixons-indochina-policies-thousands-at.html?sq=ticker%252Btape&amp;scp=6&amp;st=p Huge City Hall Rally Backs Nixon's Indochina Policies], nytimes.com, May 21, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Some workers in surrounding buildings showed their support by [[ticker tape parade|showering the marchers with ticker tape]].&lt;ref name="NYT_1970-05-21"/&gt;

On May 26, Brennan led a delegation of 22 union leaders to meet with President Nixon at the White House and presented him with a [[hard hat]]. Nixon [[general counsel]] [[Charles Colson]], in charge of developing a strategy to win union support for Nixon in the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], identified Brennan as a friendly labor leader due to his role in organizing the counter-protests of May 8, 16, and 20.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mcfadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semple, "Nixon Meets Heads Of 2 City Unions", nytimes.com, May 27, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan later met privately with Nixon on [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;

Brennan later organized significant labor union political support for Nixon in the 1972 election. Nixon appointed Brennan as his [[United States Secretary of Labor|labor secretary]] after the election as a reward for his support.&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, [https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/09/archives/brennan-reports-labor-leaders-favoring-nixon-are-organizing.html "Brennan Reports Labor Leaders Favoring Nixon Are Organizing"], nytimes.com,  September 9, 1972; Stetson, [https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/28/archives/200-labor-chiefs-in-city-form-nixon-committee.html "200 Labor Chiefs in City Form Nixon Committee"], nytimes.com, September 28, 1972; Naughton, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0615FC35591A7493C2AA178AD95F468785F9 "Construction Union Chief in New York Is Chosen to Succeed Hodgson"], nytimes.com, November 30, 1972; Shabecoff, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FF3859107B93C3A91789D95F468785F9 "Brennan Choice Called Political Move"], nytimes.com, December 1, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan was retained as U.S. Secretary of Labor by President Gerald Ford into 1975 following Nixon's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/04/nyregion/peter-brennan-78-union-head-and-nixon-s-labor-chief.html Peter Brennan obituary], nytimes.com, October 4, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its foundation on 28 December 1885 by [[Allan Octavian Hume|A.O. Hume]], a retired British officer, until the time India gained its independence on 15 August 1947, the '''[[Indian National Congress]]''' was considered to be the largest and most prominent Indian public organization, as well as the central and defining influence of the long [[Indian Independence Movement]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After [[India]] became independent, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] asked the leaders to dissolve [[Indian National Congress]], and to form a new organisation to govern the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/jaya-produces-proof-on-gandhis-intent-to-dissolve-congress/article4573365.ece|title=Jaya produces proof on Gandhi's intent to dissolve Congress|author=|date=|website=thehindubusinessline.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-jayalalithaa-produces-proof-on-gandhis-intent-to-dissolve-congress-1818118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jSXgQYRxfmkC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Betrayal of Gandhi|first=O.

==1885–1952==
[[File:A O Hume.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Allan Octavian Hume]]

Retired British [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) officer [[Allan Octavian Hume]] founded the Indian National Congress (A political party of India (British India to Free India)) in order to form a platform for civic and political dialogue among educated Indians. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], control of India was transferred from the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] to the [[British Empire]]. British-controlled India, known as the [[British Raj]], or just the Raj, worked to try to support and justify its governance of India with the aid of English-educated Indians, who tended to more familiar with and friendly to British culture and political thinking. Ironically, a few of the reasons that the Congress grew and survived, particularly in the 19th century era of undisputed British dominance or [[hegemony]], was through the patronage of British authorities and the rising class of Indians and Anglo-Indians educated in the English language-based British tradition.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Hume embarked on an endeavor to get an organization started by reaching-out to selected alumni of the [[University of Calcutta]]. In an 1883 letter, he wrote that, &lt;blockquote&gt;Every nation secures precisely as good a Government as it merits. If you, the picked men, the most highly educated of the nation, cannot, scorning personal ease and selfish objects, make a resolute struggle to secure greater freedom for yourselves and your country, a more impartial administration, a larger share in the management of your own affairs, then we, your friends, are wrong and our adversaries right, then are Lord Ripon's noble aspirations for your good fruitless and visionary, then, at present at any rate all hopes of progress are at an end[,] and India truly neither desires nor deserves any better Government than she enjoys.&lt;ref name="pattabhi1935"&gt;{{Citation | title=The History of the Indian National Congress | author=B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya | year=1935 | publisher=Working Committee of the Congress | url=https://archive.org/details/TheHistoryOfTheIndianNationalCongress}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May of 1885, Hume secured the [[viceroy#British India|viceroy]]'s approval to create an "Indian National Union", which would be affiliated with the government and act as a platform to voice Indian public opinion. The following 12 October, Hume and a group of educated Indians published "An Appeal from the People of India to the Electors of Great Britain and Ireland" which asked British voters in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 British general election]] to support candidates sympathetic to the positions of Indians. These included opposition to taxation of India to finance British campaigns in Afghanistan, and support for legislative reform in India.&lt;ref name="riddick2006"&gt;{{Citation | title=The History of British India: a chronology | author=John F.

On 28 December 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay, with 72 delegates in attendance. Hume assumed office as the General Secretary, and [[Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee]] of Calcutta was elected President.&lt;ref name="riddick2006" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2014}} Besides Hume, two additional British members (both Scottish civil servants) were members of the founding group, [[William Wedderburn]] and Justice (later, Sir) [[Sir John Jardine, 1st Baronet|John Jardine]]. The other members were mostly Hindus from the [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] and [[Madras Presidency|Madras Presidencies]].&lt;ref name="riddick2006" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} {{clarify|date=November 2018|reason=So, who were the "Hindu" members?

===Policies of Indian National Congress during 1885–1947===

==Economic Policy==

{{Empty section|date=April 2018}}

==Foreign Policy==
Even before [[independence of India]], the [[Indian National Congress]] had well articulated [[foreign policy]] positions. In the words of [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]], a scholar of [[Indian foreign policy]] and an ideologue of [[Indian National Congress]], "Right after the establishment of the Indian National Congress, it started articulating its views on foreign affairs. In its first session in 1885, the Indian National Congress deplored the annexation of upper Burma by British Indian Government." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul Karim|title=India's Foreign Policy: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Paragon International Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-93-83154-06-7|page=5|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Foreign-Policy-Rejaul-Laskar/dp/9383154063/ref=sr_1_1/261-1971629-1050801?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517920514&amp;sr=1-1&amp;refinements=p_27%3ARejaul+Karim+Laskar&amp;dpID=51fv6LnnFYL&amp;preST=_SY264_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muslim Response===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

Many Muslim community leaders, like the prominent educationalist [[Syed Ahmed Khan]], viewed the Congress negatively, owing to its membership being dominated by Hindus. Orthodox [[Hindu]] community and religious leaders were also averse, seeing the Congress as supportive of Western cultural invasion.

The ordinary people of India were not informed of or concerned about its existence on the whole, for the Congress never attempted to address the issues of poverty, lack of health care, social oppression, and the prejudiced negligence of the people's concerns by British authorities. The perception of bodies like the Congress was that of an elitist, then educated and wealthy people's institution.

===Rise of Indian nationalism===
[[File:1st INC1885.jpg|right|300px|thumb|First session of Indian National Congress, Bombay, 28–31, December, 1885.]]
The first spurts of nationalistic sentiment that rose amongst Congress members were when the desire to be represented in the bodies of government, to have a say, a vote in the lawmaking and issues of administration of India. Congressmen saw themselves as loyalists, but wanted an active role in governing their own country, albeit as part of the Empire.

This trend was personified by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], considered by many as the eldest Indian statesman. Naoroji went as far as contesting, successfully, an election to the British House of Commons, becoming its first Indian member. That he was aided in his campaign by young, aspiring Indian student activists like [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], describes where the imagination of the new Indian generation lay.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] was among the first Indian nationalists to embrace ''[[swaraj]]'' as the destiny of the nation. Tilak deeply opposed the British education system that ignored and defamed India's culture, history, and values, defying and disgracing the India culture. He resented the denial of freedom of expression for nationalists, and the lack of any voice or role for ordinary Indians in the affairs of their nation. For these reasons, he considered ''swaraj'' as the natural and only solution: the abandonment of all the British things and to protect the Indian economy from the exploitation of the British, and their biased and discriminatory policies. He was backed by rising public leaders like [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Aurobindo Ghose]], [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]] who held the same point of view. Under them, India's four great states – Madras, Bombay, Bengal, and Punjab region shaped the demand of the people and India's nationalism.

The moderates, led by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Pherozeshah Mehta]], and Dadabhai Naoroji, held firm to calls for negotiations and political dialogue. Gokhale criticized Tilak for encouraging acts of violence and disorder. The Congress of 1906 did not have public membership, and thus Tilak and his supporters were forced to leave the party.

With Tilak's arrest, all hopes for an Indian offensive were stalled. The Congress lost credit with the people. Muslims formed the All India Muslim League in 1906, considering the Congress as completely unsuitable for Indian Muslims.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==World War I: the battle for the soul==
[[File:Annie Besant.png|thumbnail|right|Annie Besant was by far the most prominently involved European in the Indian struggle]]

When the British entered the [[British Indian Army]] into [[World War I]], it provoked the first definitive, nationwide political debate of its kind in India. Voices calling for political independence grew in number.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The divided Congress re-united in the pivotal [[Lucknow]] session in 1916, with efforts of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Tilak had considerably moderated his views, and now favoured political dialogue with the British. He, along with the young [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and Mrs. [[Annie Besant]] launched the [[Home Rule Movement]] to put forth Indian demands for ''Home Rule'' – Indian participation in the affairs of their own country – a precursor to ''Swaraj''. The All India Home Rule League was formed to demand dominion status within the Empire.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

But another Indian man with another way was destined to lead the Congress and the Indian struggle. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] was a lawyer who had successfully led the struggle of Indians in South Africa against British discriminatory laws. Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi looked to Indian culture and history, the values and lifestyle of its people to empower a new '''revolution, with the concept of non-violence, [[civil disobedience]], he coined a term, ''[[Satyagraha]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}'''

===Champaran and Kheda===
{{main|Champaran Satyagraha|Kheda Satyagraha}}
Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi, who later on became more popular as Mahatma Gandhi, had success in defeating the British in Champaran and Kheda, giving India its first victory in the struggle for freedom. Then Indian National Congress had supported that movement; Indians gained confidence in the working of that organization that the British could be thwarted through that organization, and millions of young people from across the country flooded into Congress membership.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===The Battle for the soul===
A whole class of political leaders disagreed with Gandhi. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] all criticized the idea of civil disobedience. But Gandhi had the backing of the people and a whole new generation of Indian nationalists as well as British Raj.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In a series of sessions in 1918, 1919 and 1920, where the old and the new generations clashed in famous and important debates, Gandhi and his young supporters imbued the Congress rank-and-file with passion and energy to combat British rule directly. With the tragedy of the 1919 [[Amritsar Massacre]] and the riots in Punjab, Indian anger and passions were palpable and radical. With the election of Mohandas K.  Gandhi to the presidency of the Indian National Congress, the battle of the party's soul was won, and a new path to India's destiny forged.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Lokmanya Tilak, whom Gandhi had called ''The Father of Modern India'' died in 1920, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale had died four years earlier. [[Motilal Nehru]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and some other stalwarts backed Gandhi as they were not sure that they can lead the people like Tilak and Gokhale. Thus it was now entirely up to Gandhi's Congress to show the way for the nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==The Gandhi era==
[[File:Mahadev Desai and Gandhi 2 1939.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Mohandas Gandhi gave rise to a whole new generation of nationalists, and a whole new form of revolution.]]
{{See also|Mahatma Gandhi|Satyagraha|Gandhism}}

==Expansion and re-organization==
In the years after the World War, the Congress expanded considerably, owing to public excitement after Gandhi's success in Champaran and Kheda. A whole new generation of leaders arose from different parts of India, who were committed Gandhians [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]], [[Narhari Parikh]], [[Mahadev Desai]] — as well as hot-blooded nationalists aroused by Gandhi's active leadership — [[Chittaranjan Das]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], [[S. Srinivasa Iyengar|Srinivasa Iyengar]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Gandhi transformed the Congress from an elitist party based in the cities, to an organization of the people:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*Membership fees were considerably reduced.
*Congress established a large number of state units across India – known as ''Pradesh Congress Committees'' – based on its own configuration of India's states on basis of linguistic groups. PCCs emerged for ''[[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], [[Gujarat]]'' — states that did not yet exist and were spread over hundreds of princely states outside [[British India]].
*All former practices distinguishing Congressmen on basis of caste, ethnicity, religion and sex were eliminated — all-India unity was stressed.
*Native tongues were given official use and respect in Congress meetings – especially ''[[Urdu language|Urdu]]'' renamed by Gandhi as ''[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]'', which was adopted for use by the All India Congress Committee.
*Leadership posts and offices at all levels would be filled by elections, and not by appointments. This introduction of democracy was vital in rejuvenating the party, giving voice to ordinary members as well as valuable practice for Indians in democracy.
*Eligibility for leadership would be determined by how much social work and service a member had done, not by his wealth or social standing.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Social development===
During the 1920s, M.K. Gandhi encouraged tens of thousands of Congress volunteers to embrace a wide variety of organized tasks to address major social problems across India. Under the guidance of Congress committees and Gandhi's network of ashrams in [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], the Congress attacked:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*[[Untouchability]] and caste discrimination
*[[Alcoholism]]
*Unhygienic conditions and lack of sanitation
*Lack of health care and medical aid
*[[Purdah]] and the oppression of women
*Illiteracy, with the organization of national schools and colleges
*Poverty, with proliferating [[khadi]] cloth, [[cottage industries]]
This profound work by M. K. Gandhi impressed the people of India particularly, formations of ashrams, that in later period he was mentioned as Mahatma, Great soul, by way of honor, by people of India.

==Ascendance to power (1937–1942)==
[[File:Katni1.jpg|left|thumb|350px| An old building in [[Katni]] commemorating [[Swaraj|India's freedom]], with statues of [[Nehru]], [[Gandhi]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] ]]

Under the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Congress first tasted political power in the [[Indian Provincial Elections, 1937|provincial elections of 1937]]. It performed very well, coming to power in eight of the eleven provinces where elections were held. Its internal organization bloomed in the diversity of political attitudes and ideologies. The focus would change slightly from the single-minded devotion to complete independence, to also entertaining excitement and theorizing about the future governance of the nation. However, when the Viceroy Lord Linlithgow declared India a belligerent in [[World War II]] without any consultation with the elected representatives of the people, the Congress ministries resigned.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The radical followers of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], believers in socialism and active revolution would ascend in the hierarchy with Bose's 1938 election to the Congress presidency.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Traditionalists===
According to one approach, the traditionalist point of view, though not in a political sense, was represented in Congressmen like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, C.Rajagopalachari, Purushottam Das Tandon, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Maulana Azad, who were also associates and followers of Gandhi. Their organizational strength, achieved through leading the clashes with the government, was undisputed and proven when despite winning the 1939 election, Bose resigned the Congress presidency because of the lack of confidence he enjoyed amongst national leaders. A year earlier, in the 1938 election, however, Bose had been elected with the support of Gandhi. Differences arose in 1939 on whether Bose should have a second term. Jawaharlal Nehru, who Gandhi had always preferred to Bose, had had a second term earlier. Bose's own differences centred on the place to be accorded to non-violent as against revolutionary methods. When he set up his Indian National Army in South-east Asia during the Second World War, he invoked Gandhi's name and hailed him as the Father of The Nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
It would be wrong to suggest that the so-called traditionalist leaders looked merely to the ancient heritage of Indian, Asian or, in the case of Maulana Azad and [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], Islamic civilization for inspiration. They believed, along with educationists like Zakir Husain and E W Aryanayakam, that education should be imparted in a manner that enables the learners also to be able to make things with their own hands and learn skills that would make them self-supporting. This method of education was also adopted in some areas in Egypt. (See Reginald Reynolds, Beware of Africans). Zakir Husain was inspired by some European educationists and was able, with Gandhi's support, to dovetail this approach to the one favoured by the Basic Education method introduced by the Indian freedom movement. They believed that the education system, economy and social justice model for a future nation should be designed to suit the specific local requirements. While most were open to the benefits of Western influences and the socio-economic egalitarianism of socialism, they were opposed to being defined by either model.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==The final battles==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:QUITIN7.JPG|left|thumb|Quit India procession at Bangalore]] --&gt;

The last important episodes in the Congress involved the final step to independence, and the division of the country on the basis of religions.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Quit India===
{{See also|Quit India Movement}}

[[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]], the prominent leader from [[Tamil Nadu]] resigned from the Congress to actively advocate supporting the British war effort.
it was started in 1942.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Indian National Army Trials===
During the [[INA trials]] of 1946, the Congress helped to form the [[INA Defence Committee]], which forcefully defended the case of the soldiers of the [[Azad Hind]] government. The committee declared the formation of the Congress' defence team for the INA and included famous lawyers of the time, including [[Bhulabhai Desai]], [[Asaf Ali]], and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. QUIT INDIA BILL passed on 8 Aug 1942.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Royal Indian Navy Mutiny===
Some members of the Congress initially supported the sailors who led the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]]. However, they withdrew support at the critical juncture, as the mutiny failed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Partition of India===
Within the Congress, the Partition was opposed by [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], [[Saifuddin Kitchlew]], [[Dr. Khan Sahib]] and Congressmen from the provinces that would inevitably become parts of Pakistan. [[Maulana Azad]] opposed partition in principle, but did not wish to impede the national leadership; preferred to stay with Indian side. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Nehru firstspeech.jpg|thumb|250px|Jawaharlal Nehru making his first speech in Independent India]] --&gt;

===Constitution===
In the Assembly and Constitution debates, the Congress attitude was marked by inclusiveness and liberalism. The Government appointed some prominent Indians who were Raj loyalists and liberals to important offices, and did not adopt any punitive control over the Indian civil servants who had aided the Raj in its governance of India and suppression of nationalist activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A Congress-dominated Assembly adopted [[B.R. Ambedkar]], a fierce Congress critic as the chairman of the Constitution draft committee. [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]], a [[Hindu Mahasabha]] leader became the Minister for Industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The Congress stood firm on its fundamental promises and delivered a Constitution that abolished untouchability and discrimination based on caste, religion or gender. Primary education was made a right, and Congress governments made the [[zamindar]] system illegal, created minimum wages and authorized the right to strike and form labor unions.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Leadership change===
In 1947, the Congress presidency passed upon [[Jivatram Kripalani]], a veteran Gandhian and ally of both Nehru and Patel. India's duumvirate expressed neutrality and full support to the elected winner of the 1947, 1948 and 1949 presidential races.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, a tug of war began between Nehru and his socialist wing, and Patel and Congress traditionalists broke out in 1950's race. Nehru lobbied intensely to oppose the candidacy of [[Purushottam Das Tandon]], whom he perceived as a [[Hindu]] revivalist with "problematic" views on Hindu-Muslim relations. Nehru openly backed Kripalani to oppose Tandon, but neglected courtesy to Patel upon the question.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

With Patel's tacit support (especially in Patel's home state of [[Gujarat]], where due to Patel's work, Kripalani received not one vote) Tandon won a tight contest, and Nehru threatened to resign. With Patel's convincing, Nehru did not quit.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, with Patel's death in 1950, the balance shifted permanently in Nehru's favor. Kripalani, C. Rajagopalachari and Tandon were marginalized, and the Congress Party's election fortunes began depending solely on Nehru's leadership and popularity. With the 1952 election sweep, the Congress became India's main political party.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The '''Immigration Department''' ({{zh|t=入境事務處}}, known as 人民入境事務處 before [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|the 1997 transfer of sovereignty]]) of the [[Government of Hong Kong]] is responsible for [[Border control|immigration control]] of Hong Kong. After the People's Republic of China assumed sovereignty of the territory in July 1997, Hong Kong's immigration system remained largely unchanged from its British predecessor model. Residents from [[mainland China]] do not have the [[right of abode]] in Hong Kong, nor can they enter the territory freely, both before and after 1997. There are different regulations that apply to residents of [[Macau]], another Special Administrative Region of China. In addition, [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|visa-free entry]] acceptance regulations into Hong Kong for passport holders of some 170 countries remain unchanged before and after 1997.

In a special arrangement, although Hong Kong's residents of Chinese descent are defined as citizens of the People's Republic of China, as stipulated by the Basic Law, Hong Kong's Immigration Department is independently responsible for issuing [[Hong Kong SAR passport]]s for Hong Kong residents who are also PRC citizens seeking international travel.

==History==
[[Image:Flag of Immigration Department, 1988-1997.gif|thumb|right|300px|Flag of Immigration Department, 1988–1997.]]
[[Image:Badge of Immigration Department, 1988-1997.gif|thumb|right|200px|Badge of Immigration Department, 1988–1997.]]
Prior to the 1950s, immigration to Hong Kong was not controlled by the government of Hong Kong and migrants freely entered Hong Kong. But the end of [[World War II]] the influx of migrants from China to Hong Kong to flee Communist rule resulted in immigration control.

From 1949 to 1961, registration of persons with identification was required under the [[Registration of Persons Ordinance 1949]] and established a '''Commissioner of Registration'''.

Until the establishment of Immigration Department on 4 August 1961, immigration control in Hong Kong was handled by the [[Hong Kong Police Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsscs.gov.hk/reports/en/rcds_pre/report/rcds_pre_eng_ch02.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration Service Ordinance|Immigration Service Ordinance 1961]] created the new department in charge of immigration control.  Later in 1977, the department enlarged its functions to cover registration of persons by amalgamating with the Registration of Persons Office and Director of Immigration also assumed as Commissioner of Registration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immd.gov.hk/a_report/ehtml/chapter03_40a.html Registration of Persons Department]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the department took over from the Registrar General civil registration duties and the Director of Immigration was appointed as Registrar of Births and Deaths, and Registrar of Marriages.

The Department is headquartered in the [[Immigration Tower]] in [[Wan Chai|Wan Chai North]].

== Role ==
[[Image:Immigration Service Institute of Training and Development.jpg|right|thumb|Immigration Centre and Immigration Service Institute of Training and Development in [[Castle Peak Bay]], [[Tuen Mun]]]]
The Department performs the following role.

* Immigration control at the checkpoints ([[Hong Kong International Airport]] as well as Mainland-Hong Kong [[port of entry]])
* HK Resident Affairs (by Division of Registration of Persons)
** Issuing [[Hong Kong Identity Card]] (both permanent and non-permanent)
** Birth registration
** Death certification
** Marriage certification
* Registering/Denouncing [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese citizenship]]
* Naturalization of HK permanent residents who wish to be Chinese citizens
* Issuing [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] to permanent residents who are Chinese citizens
** Under the terms of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law of Hong Kong]] and explanations on implementing the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Nationality Law]], both by PRC lawmakers, the Immigration Department issues the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] and other international travel documents on its own, and is in charge of administering the Nationality Law within its realms. This is a rare exception to the rule that issuing passports and administering nationality-related matters are usually under the purview of an authority of the central/national government of a state.
* Issuing [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]] for HK residents who can obtain neither a national passport nor Hong Kong passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/hktraveldoc.htm|title=Hong Kong Travel Documents|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inquiries in regards to BN(O)s are now made to any British diplomatic missions overseas.

==Crest==
The current crest of the force was adopted in 1997 to replace most of the colonial symbols:

* [[St Edward's Crown]] replace with [[Bauhinia]]
* Laurel wreath remains but badge with wording Immigration Service – HK" replace with an image of [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] is added
* Motto added with wording "Hong Kong Immigration 香港入境處"

== Weapons ==
Instead of the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10]] revolver widely distributed between disciplinary services in Hong Kong, the officers are trained in the use of, and issued, the ASP expandable baton and the Sabre Red pepper spray for self-defence options.

A type of pepper gun is also standard issue equipment for officers stationed at the Immigration Service Institute of Training and Development, due to one incident of arson at the [[Immigration Tower]] in 2000.

He gained national attention for his video recordings of workers at [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) offices in 2009, his arrest and guilty plea in 2010 for entering the federal office of then-U.S. Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] (D-LA) under [[false pretenses]], and the release of videos of conversations with two high-ranking, now former, [[NPR]] executives in 2011.
 
When his videos portraying ACORN workers seemingly aiding a couple in criminal planning hit the 24-hour cable news cycle, the [[U.S. Congress]] quickly voted to freeze funds for the non-profit. The national controversy resulted in the non-profit also losing most of its private funding before investigations of the videos concluded no illegal activity occurred. In March 2010, ACORN was close to bankruptcy and had to close or rename most of its offices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html?_r=0 Acorn on Brink of Bankruptcy, Officials Say], ''The New York Times'', March 20, 2010; accessed July 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the [[California State Attorney General's Office]] and the US [[Government Accountability Office]] released their related investigative reports. The Attorney General's Office found that O'Keefe had misrepresented the actions of ACORN workers in California and that the workers had not broken any laws. A preliminary probe by the [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] found that ACORN had managed its federal funds appropriately.&lt;ref name="huff-acorn-vind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-acorn-vind"/&gt; One of the fired ACORN workers sued O'Keefe for [[Privacy laws of the United States|invasion of privacy]]; O'Keefe issued an apology and agreed to pay $100,000 in a settlement.

O'Keefe gained support from far-right conservative media and interest groups. In 2009, [[Andrew Breitbart]] commissioned him for the option to publish new videos exclusively on [[BigGovernment.com]]. In June 2010, O'Keefe formed a [[501(c)(3) organization]], '''Project Veritas'''.

==Early life and education==
James Edward O'Keefe III was born in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], the elder of two children of James, a [[materials engineer]], and Deborah O'Keefe, a [[physical therapist]]. He has a younger sister.&lt;ref name="political gadfly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NJProfile"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/09/acorn_sting_pimp_is_nj_man_who.html |title=ACORN sting 'pimp' is N.J. man who attended Rutgers University |first=Michael |date=September 17, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Star Ledger]] |location=Newark, N.J. |via=The Star-Ledger Archives |author=Rispoli |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Centurion&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |title=My Right-Wing Degree: How I learned to convert liberal campuses into conservative havens at Morton Blackwell's Leadership Institute, alma mater of Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, Jeff Gannon and two Miss Americas |first=Jeff |last=Horwitz |date=May 25, 2005 |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/2005/05/25/blackwell_9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe grew up in [[Westwood, New Jersey]]. His home was politically "conservative but not rigidly so", according to his father.&lt;ref name="NJProfile"/&gt; He graduated from [[Westwood Regional High School|Westwood High School]], where he showed an early interest in the arts, theater and [[journalism]]. He attained [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], the highest rank in the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shane |first=Scott |title=A Political Gadfly Lampoons the Left via YouTube |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19sting.html |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe started at [[Rutgers University]] in 2002 and majored in philosophy.&lt;ref name="highjinks"/&gt; Beginning in his sophomore year, he wrote a bi-weekly opinion column for ''[[The Daily Targum]]'', the university's student paper. He left the ''Targum'' and founded the ''[[Rutgers Centurion]]'', a conservative student paper supported by a $500 "Balance in the Media" grant from [[Leadership Institute|The Leadership Institute]].&lt;ref name="NJProfile"/&gt;

For his first video, he and other ''Centurion'' writers met with Rutgers dining staff to demand the banning of the cereal [[Lucky Charms]] from dining halls because of its offense to [[Irish American]]s. O'Keefe said the [[leprechaun]] mascot presented a stereotype. He intended to have officials lose either way: to appear insensitive to an [[ethnic]] group, or to look silly by agreeing to ban Lucky Charms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2011/03/18/04 "What the Media Can Learn From James O'Keefe"], onthemedia.org, March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They expected to be thrown out of school,&lt;ref name="targumcharms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4988/absurdities-and-ironies-1.1509376 |title=Absurdities and Ironies |date=April 17, 2005 |work=[[Daily Targum]] |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |author=Walker, Greg |location=Rutgers University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511205851/http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4988/absurdities-and-ironies-1.1509376# |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Rutgers official was courteous, took notes, and said their concerns would be considered. Rutgers staff say the cereal was never taken off the menu.&lt;ref name="NJProfile"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from Rutgers, O'Keefe worked for a year at the [[Leadership Institute]] (LI) in [[Arlington, Virginia]] under media specialist Ben Wetmore, whom O'Keefe calls his mentor.&lt;ref name="highjinks"/&gt; The institute sent him to colleges to train students to start conservative independent newspapers, but, after a year LI officials asked him to leave. According to LI president and founder [[Morton Blackwell]], O'Keefe was "very effective and very enthusiastic" but after a year he was asked to leave because officials felt his activist work threatened the group's nonprofit status by trying to influence legislation.&lt;ref name="highjinks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="political gadfly"/&gt;

O'Keefe has produced and distributed secretly recorded—and at times misleadingly edited—videos and audio files made during staged encounters with targeted entities or individuals.&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;[http://time.com/4536212/james-okeefe-project-veritas-video-democrats/ Everything We Know About the Latest James O'Keefe Video Sting], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Philip Elliott, October 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Detrow |first=Scott |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/19/498587397/sting-video-purports-to-show-democrats-describing-how-to-commit-voter-fraud |title=Sting Video Purports To Show Democrats Describing How To Commit Voter Fraud |date=October 19, 2016 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work takes the form of undercover stings targeted at liberal groups and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Zeke J. |title=Clinton Campaign On Alert For Undercover Conservative Sting |url=http://time.com/4006454/hillary-clinton-video-project-veritas/ |website=Time |accessdate=November 28, 2017 |date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to "embarrass" and "damage" his targets, such as Senator Landrieu and [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]].&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1888_acorn_report.pdf |title=Report of the Attorney General on the Activities of ACORN in California |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=California Dept of Justice |format=PDF |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS5"&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35099552/ns/politics-more_politics/t/lawyer-phone-plot-meant-embarrass-senator Lawyer: Phone plot meant to embarrass senator], ''[[CBS]]'', Patrick Semansky, January 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMM"&gt;[http://www.texasmonthly.com/burka-blog/hannah-giles-no-nellie-bly/ Hannah Giles, No Nellie Bly], ''[[Texas Monthly]] Magazine'', R.G.

In January 2010, O'Keefe began a column on [[Breitbart News|Breitbart]]'s website, BigGovernment.com. Breitbart stated in an interview that he paid O'Keefe a salary for his "[[life rights]]" to gain release of O'Keefe's videos first on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hughhewitt.com/blog/g/3c0f68ec-ee51-42ae-b9ce-a170d352c202 |title=An Interview With Andrew Breitbart About The O'Keefe Arrest |author=Hewitt, Hugh |date=January 26, 2010 |publisher=HughHewett.com |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 O'Keefe formed his own organization, '''Project Veritas''', whose stated mission is "to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical and transparent society."&lt;ref name="about veritas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprojectveritas.com/about |title=About Project Veritas |publisher=TheProjectVeritas.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815082804/http://www.theprojectveritas.com/about# |archive-date=August 15, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
===Planned Parenthood recordings (2008)===
In 2006, O'Keefe met [[Lila Rose]], founder of an anti-abortion group on the UCLA campus.&lt;ref name="to court blacks"/&gt; They secretly recorded encounters in [[Planned Parenthood]] clinics. Rose posed as a pregnant teenager seeking advice (a 15-year-old girl impregnated by a 23-year-old male); they made two videos and released them on [[YouTube]]. In one, a clinic worker in Los Angeles tells Rose "that she could 'figure out a birth date that works' to avoid having PPLA notify police."&lt;ref name="Burchfiel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/node/7436 |publisher=CNS News |date=May 16, 2007 |author=Burchfiel, Nathan |title=Planned Parenthood Threatens to Sue Undercover Activist |accessdate=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, O'Keefe phoned several Planned Parenthood clinics and secretly recorded the conversations. He posed as a donor, asking if his donations would be applied to needs of minority women. When told they could be, he made "race-motivated" comments.&lt;ref name=cnsnews1&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ryan |first=Josiah |title=Planned Parenthood Agreed to Accept Race-Motivated Donations |publisher=CNS News |date=July 7, 2008 |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/node/7753 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By audio recordings, workers at clinics in six other states agreed to accept his donation under similar terms.&lt;ref name="foxnewspp"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Beaucar Vlahos |first=Kelley |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352537,00.html |title=Pastors Accuse Planned Parenthood for 'Genocide' on Blacks |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planned Parenthood of California filed a "cease and desist" order against Lila Rose, charging that she was violating state laws against secret recordings. The order required her to remove the videos from [[YouTube]] and give all the recordings to the organization. She complied through her attorney.&lt;ref name="Burchfiel"/&gt;

After O'Keefe's four audio recordings were publicized in 2008, Planned Parenthood of Ohio issued a public response, saying the worker's words were "a violation of any policy, and it's very upsetting." The CEO said, "Planned Parenthood has a long history of social justice."&lt;ref name=cnsnews1/&gt; Other offices noted the wide variety of services the organization offers to low income communities.&lt;ref name="foxnewspp"/&gt; African-American leaders called for withdrawal of public financing of the organization.&lt;ref name="to court blacks"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dewan |first=Shaila |title=To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 26, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html?th&amp;emc=th |accessdate=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACORN videos (2009)===
&lt;!--This section generally is a synopsis of the important points in the Acorn 2009 undercover videos controversy article, however, as this article is a bio of one of the creators of the controversial videos, it contains additional information relating to how the controversy affected O'Keefe's life. --&gt;
{{main|ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy}}

In September 2009, O'Keefe and his associate, [[Hannah Giles]], published edited hidden camera recordings in which Giles posed as a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and O'Keefe as her boyfriend, a law student, in an attempt to elicit damaging responses from employees of the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN), an advocacy organization for 40 years for persons of low and moderate income.&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"/&gt;

A ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' correspondent {{who|date=June 2017}} reported that O'Keefe "said he targeted ACORN for the same reasons that the political right does: its massive voter registration drives", and "Politicians are getting elected single-handedly due to this organization." ACORN mostly registered people from the [[Latino]] and [[African American]] communities.&lt;ref name="WaPo5"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/17/AR2009091704805.html "Duo in ACORN Videos Say Effort Was Independent"], ''The Washington Post''; accessed April 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos were recorded during the summer of 2009&lt;ref&gt;According to the California Attorney General's investigation report, p. 8, the recordings occurred in ACORN offices in eight cities: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]], and [[San Bernardino]].&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared to show low-level ACORN employees in six cities providing advice to Giles and O'Keefe on how to avoid detection by authorities of [[tax evasion]], [[human smuggling]] and [[child prostitution]].&lt;ref name="political gadfly"/&gt; He framed the undercover recordings with a preface of him dressed in a "pimp" outfit, which he also wore in TV media interviews. This gave viewers, including the media, the impression that he had dressed that way when speaking to ACORN workers. However, he actually entered the ACORN offices in conservative street clothes (the sleeve of his dress shirt is visible on camera).&lt;ref name="TheLens"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thelensnola.org/2010/01/27/okeefe-neither-pimp-nor-journalist |title=O'Keefe: Neither Pimp nor Journalist |last=Mock |first=Brentin |date=January 27, 2010 |work=The Lens |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ACORN employees involved reported his activities to the police after he left.&lt;ref name="cracked"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_20369_5-major-news-stories-that-forgot-to-tell-you-best-part.html |title=Major News Stories That Forgot To Tell You the Best Part |last=Hong |first=Dennis |date=April 8, 2013 |work=Cracked |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe selectively edited and manipulated his recordings of ACORN employees, as well as distorted the chronologies. Several journalists and media outlets have expressed regret for not properly scrutinizing and vetting his work.&lt;ref name="Folk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twisty" /&gt;

On April 10, 2012, the political gossip site Wonkette reported that [[Andrew Breitbart]] had signed a $120,000 contract for "life rights" by O'Keefe and Giles based on the ACORN videos. The contract was paid in monthly increments of $5,000. Giles ultimately received $32,000 before parting ways with Breitbart over what she described in legal depositions as "a conflict of visions". O'Keefe ultimately received $65,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phelan |first=Matthew, and Liz Farkas |title=WONKETTE EXCLUSIVE!

====Reception and lawsuit====
After the videos were released through the fall of 2009, the [[U.S. Congress]] quickly voted to freeze federal funding to ACORN.&lt;ref name=attorney&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/21/acorn-prostitution-videos |title=Congress cuts funding to embattled anti-poverty group Acorn |last=McGreal |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris McGreal |date=September 21, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Census Bureau]] and the [[IRS]] terminated their contract relationships with ACORN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/us/politics/12acorn.html?_r=2&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=acorn&amp;st=cse |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Census Bureau Drops Acorn From 2010 Effort |date=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2009, an external investigation of ACORN was published which cleared the organization of any illegality, while noting that its poor management practices contributed to unprofessional actions by some low-level employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Embattled ACORN orders independent investigation |author=Sharon Theimer |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2009879676_apuscongressacorn.html |accessdate=October 17, 2010 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23brfs-ACORNHIRESFO_BRF.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Acorn Hires Former State Law Enforcer |first=Jim |last=Rutenberg |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=James |first=Frank |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/12/acorn_workers_cleared_of_illeg.html |title=ACORN Workers Cleared Of Illegality By Outside Probe |publisher=NPR |date=December 7, 2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/wendy_kaminer/2009/12/acorn_and_the_ethics_of_leadership.php |title=ACORN and the Ethics of Leadership |author=Kaminer, Wendy |publisher=Atlantic Monthly |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, ACORN announced it would dissolve due to loss of funding from government and especially private sources.&lt;ref name="acorn disbands"&gt;{{cite news |title=ACORN disbanding because of money woes, scandal |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=10173036 |author=Tarm, Michael |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoyt wrote "The videos were heavily edited. The sequence of some conversations was changed. Some workers seemed concerned for Giles, one advising her to get legal help. In two cities, ACORN workers called the police. But the most damning words match the transcripts and the audio, and do not seem out of context."&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Clark (March 20, 2010). [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21pubed.html "THE PUBLIC EDITOR: The Acorn Sting Revisited"], ''The New York Times''; retrieved January 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Attorney General]]'s Office granted O'Keefe and Giles limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing the full, unedited videotapes related to ACORN offices in California.&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"/&gt; The AG's Report was released on April 1, 2010, concluding that the videos from ACORN offices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino had been "severely edited."&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"/&gt; The report found there was no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees nor any evidence that any employee intended to aid or abet criminal conduct. It found that three employees had tried to deflect the couple's plans, told them ACORN could not offer them help on the grounds they wanted, and otherwise dealt with them appropriately. Such context was not reflected in O'Keefe's edited tapes. The AG's Report noted that "O'Keefe stated that he was out to make a point and to damage ACORN and therefore did not act as a journalist objectively reporting a story". It found no evidence of intent by the employees to aid the couple. The report also noted "a serious and glaring deficit in management, governance and accountability within the ACORN organization" and said its conduct "suggests an organizational ethos at odds with the norms of American society. Empowering and serving low-and moderate-income families cannot be squared with counseling and encouraging illegal activities."&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"/&gt;

The AG's report confirmed that ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera, shown in O'Keefe's video as apparently aiding a human smuggling proposal, had immediately reported his encounter with the couple to an American police detective at the time to thwart their plan. Following the AG's report, that employee, who had been fired by ACORN after the video's release, sued O'Keefe and Giles in 2010. He alleged [[invasion of privacy]] and cited a California law that prohibits recordings without consent of all parties involved.&lt;ref name="SanDiegoCityBeat"&gt;{{cite web |last=Maass |first=Dave |title=ACORN worker sues O'Keefe and collaborators |work=[[San Diego CityBeat]] |date=July 9, 2010 |url=http://lastblogonearth.com/2010/07/09/acorn-worker-sues-okeefe-and-collaborators |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the edited videotape which O'Keefe released, Vera appeared to be a willing participant in helping with O'Keefe's plan to smuggle young women into the United States illegally. However, authorities confirmed that Mr. Vera immediately contacted them about O'Keefe and that he had also encouraged O'Keefe to share as much information as possible about his scheme and gather further evidence of O'Keefe's purported illegal activities, which could then be used by prosecutors to bring charges against O'Keefe for attempted [[human trafficking]]. Due to O'Keefe's release of the dubiously edited video, intentionally designed to "prove" that ACORN employees were ready and willing to engage in illicit activities, Mr. Vera lost his job and was falsely accused of being engaged in human trafficking. O'Keefe noted that he "regrets any pain" caused by his reckless actions, though O'Keefe's lawyer dismissed any claimed injury incurred by Vera and stated that the payment was a "nuisance settlement".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2013/03/08/james-okeefe-pays-100000-to-acorn-employee-he-smeared-conservative-media-yawns O'Keefe pays $100,000 to ACORN employee he smeared - conservative media yawns"], forbes.com, March 8, 2013; accessed August 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe moved for [[summary judgment]] in his favor, arguing that the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation that the conversation would be private. In August 2012, the federal judge hearing the case denied O'Keefe's motion for [[summary judgment]]. The judge ruled that O'Keefe had "misled plaintiff to believe that the conversation would remain confidential by posing as a client seeking services from ACORN and asking whether their conversation was confidential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Matt |title=Former ACORN Worker Can Sue Right-Winger on Privacy Claim |publisher=[[Courthouse News Service]] |date=August 14, 2012 |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/08/14/49281.htm |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 2013, O'Keefe agreed to pay $100,000 to former California ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera for deliberately misrepresenting Mr. Vera's actions, and acknowledged in the settlement that at the time he published his video he was unaware that Vera had notified the police about the incident.

On June 14, 2010, the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) published its report finding no evidence that ACORN, or any of its related organizations, had mishandled any of the $40 million in federal money which they had received in recent years.&lt;ref name="huff-acorn-vind"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-atlas/acorn-vindicated-of-wrong_b_612265.html?page=3&amp;show_comment_id=50563828 |title=ACORN Vindicated of Wrongdoing by the Congressional Watchdog Office |author=John Atlas |work=The Huffington Post |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-acorn-vind"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/06/14/congress.acorn/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Preliminary report clears ACORN on funds |author=The CNN Wire Staff |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senator Mary Landrieu (2010)===
O'Keefe and colleagues were arrested in the [[Hale Boggs Federal Complex]] in New Orleans in January 2010 and charged with entering federal property under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony, at the office of United States Senator [[Mary Landrieu]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

In August 2013, O'Keefe revisited the incident by releasing a video entitled: "a confrontation with former U.S. Attorney [[Jim Letten]] on the campus of [[Tulane University]]". Letten is a former Republican U.S. Attorney who [[recusal|recused]] himself from the Landrieu incident because he knew the father of one of the men involved. The video shows Letten accusing O'Keefe of "terrorizing" Letten's wife at their home, of harassing him, and trespassing on the Tulane campus. He called O'Keefe a "coward" and a "spud", and referred to O'Keefe and his companions as "hobbits" and "scum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/08/journalist_provocateur_james_o.html O'Keefe profile], nola.com; accessed February 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NPR video (2011)===
On March 8, 2011, shortly before the US Congress was to vote on funding for National Public Radio ([[NPR]]), O'Keefe released a video of a discussion with Ronald Schiller, NPR's senior vice president for [[fundraising]], and associate Betsy Liley. Raw content was secretly recorded by O'Keefe's partners Ken Larrey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Phelan |first1=Matthew |last2=Farkas |first2=Liz |title=James O'Keefe's Traitorous Former Collaborators Betray Each Other, Like A Bunch Of Traitors |url=http://wonkette.com/474891/james-okeefe%E2%80%99s-traitorous-former-collaborators-betray-each-other-like-a-bunch-of-traitors |publisher=Wonkette |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shaughn Adeleye.&lt;ref name=nprexec&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0311/NPR_exec_tea_party_is_scary_racist.html?showall |date=March 8, 2011 |title=NPR exec: Tea Party is 'scary', 'racist' |first=Keach |last=Hagey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the videos published by O'Keefe, the NPR executives were shown meeting with representatives of a self-described [[Muslim]] charity called the "Muslim Education Action Center" that wished to donate money to NPR.&lt;ref name="Tactics"/&gt; At the meeting, the representatives claimed their charity was affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. NPR responded by stating that Schiller's remarks were presented out of sequence and that he said that he would speak personally, and not for NPR. Schiller said some highly placed Republicans believed the Republican Party had been hijacked by a radical group (the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]) that they characterized as "[[Islamophobic]]" and "seriously racist, racist people", and while Schiller did not disagree, according to NPR, O'Keefe's editing made it appear those were Schiller's opinions. Schiller then says that unlike establishment Republicans, the growing Tea Party movement in the party "is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian — I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move.{{sic}}"&lt;ref name="Folkenflik"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/03/14/134528545/npr-okeefe-inappropriately-edited-video-execs-words-still-egregious NPR: O'Keefe 'Inappropriately Edited' Video; Exec's Words Still 'Egregious'"]; [[NPR]]; Mark Memmott; March 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134525412/Segments-Of-NPR-Gotcha-Video-Taken-Out-Of-Context Elements Of NPR Gotcha Video Taken Out Of Context]; ''[[NPR]]''; David Folkenflik; March 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the edited video, Schiller seems to say he believes NPR "would be better off in the long run without federal funding", explaining that removal of federal funding would allow NPR more independence and remove the widely held misconception that NPR is significantly funded by the public. But on the raw tape, Schiller also said that withdrawing federal funding would cause local stations to go under and that NPR is doing "everything we can" to keep it.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Martha T. |title=NPR sting raises questions about media ethics, influence |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-17-video17_ST_N.htm |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement released before analysis of the longer raw video, NPR said, "Schiller's comments are in direct conflict with NPR's official position ... The fraudulent organization represented in this video repeatedly pressed us to accept a $5 million check with no strings attached, which we repeatedly refused to accept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lithwick |first=Dahlia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/archive/2011/03/10/npr-publishes-e-mails-from-top-staff-stating-problems-with-muslim-group-s-donations.aspx |title=NPR Publishes E-Mails From Top Staff Stating Problems With "Muslim Group's" Offer of $5 Million |publisher=Slate.com |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing the unedited video, Scott Baker, editor-in-chief of [[TheBlaze]], said the NPR executives "seem to be fairly balanced people."&lt;ref name="Folkenflik"/&gt;

Journalists [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]], [[James Poniewozik]], and [[Dave Weigel]] have expressed regret for giving O'Keefe's NPR videos wider circulation without scrutinizing them for themselves.&lt;ref name="Folk"/&gt;

====Reception====
Comparison of the raw video with the released one revealed editing that was characterized as "selective" and "deceptive" by [[Michael Gerson]], opinion writer in ''The Washington Post'', who wrote, "O'Keefe did not merely leave a false impression; he manufactured an elaborate, alluring lie."&lt;ref name="Gerson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gerson |first=Michael |title=The NPR video and political dirty tricks |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-npr-video-and-political-dirty-tricks/2011/03/17/ABbyMym_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine wrote that the video "transposed remarks from a different part of the meeting", was "manipulative" and "a partisan hit-job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poniewozik |first=James |title=Hatchet Job: The Video Hit Piece that Made Both NPR and Its Critics Look Bad |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2059376,00.html#ixzz1H5plETmW |journal=Time |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raw video shows Schiller told the two men "that donors cannot expect to influence news coverage." On the longer tape, he says, "There is such a big firewall between funding and reporting: Reporters will not be swayed in any way, shape or form."&lt;ref name="Folk"/&gt; The broadcast journalist Al Tompkins, who now teaches at the [[Poynter Institute]], noted that Ron Schiller was a fundraiser, not an official affecting the newsroom. He commented on the raw tape: "The message that he said most often—I counted six times: He told these two people that he had never met before that you cannot buy coverage", Tompkins said. "He says it over and over and over again.&lt;ref name="Folk"/&gt;

On March 17, Martha T. Moore of ''[[USA Today]]'' reported: "According to ''The Blaze'' analysis, Ron Schiller's most inflammatory remarks, that Tea Party members are 'seriously racist', were made as he was recounting the views of Republicans he has spoken with—although he does not appear to disagree. It also shows Schiller appearing to laugh about the potential spread of Islamic ''[[sharia]]'' law, when the longer version shows he laughed in reaction to something completely different."&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

Two days later, O'Keefe released a video in which Betsy Liley, senior director of institutional giving at NPR, appeared to have checked with senior management and said MEAC was cleared to make donations anonymously and NPR could help shield donations from government audits, but added that, in order to proceed, additional background information would be required, including an IRS [[Form 990]].&lt;ref name="CNN-Liley"/&gt; Liley advised the caller that NPR executives would investigate them before accepting any large donation, examining tax records and checking out other organizations that have received donations from them.&lt;ref name="CNN-Liley"/&gt; Liley raises the possibility of NPR's turning down substantial gifts and stresses the "firewall" between the revenue-generating part of NPR and its news operation.&lt;ref name="CNN-Liley"&gt;{{cite news |last=CNN Wire Staff |title=Activist releases another recording with an NPR fundraising executive |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2011 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/11/npr.recording/index.html?hpt=Sbin |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPR put Liley on administrative leave. In emails released following the publication of the Liley video, NPR confirmed that the official had consulted appropriately with top management and notified the purported donors of problems with their desired method of donation.&lt;ref name="Weigel"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/archive/2011/03/10/npr-publishes-e-mails-from-top-staff-stating-problems-with-muslim-group-s-donations.aspx Dave Weigel, "NPR Publishes E-Mails From Top Staff Stating Problems With "Muslim Group's" Offer of $5 Million"], Slate.com, August 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Schiller, who had already submitted his resignation back in January so that he could join the [[Aspen Institute]], moved up his resignation after the video release when NPR put him on [[administrative leave]]. CEO [[Vivian Schiller]] (no relation to Ronald Schiller) announced she was resigning, effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/03/what-james-okeefes-latest-video-means-for-npr-funding/72198/ "What James O'Keefe's Latest Video Means for NPR Funding"], ''The Atlantic'', March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/03/tea-party-secret-video-npr-funding-/1 "NPR executive calls Tea Party supporters 'racist'"], ''USA Today''; accessed February 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/08/134358398/in-video-npr-exec-slams-tea-party-questions-need-for-federal-funds?ft=1&amp;f=1001 "In Video: NPR Exec Slams Tea Party, Questions Need For Federal Funds"], NPR.org, March 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Memmott |title=NPR CEO Vivian Schiller resigns |publisher=NPR.org |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/09/134388981/npr-ceo-vivian-schiller-resigns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Russell Adams |title=NPR Executive Cedes New Role at Aspen Institute |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=March 9, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704132204576190563679921804 |accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/npr-executive-caught-calling-tea-partiers-racist "NPR Executive Caught Calling Tea Partiers 'Racist'"], ''New York Times'', March 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Presidential elections (2016)===
A month before the launch of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]],  the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation|Trump Foundation]] donated $10,000 to O'Keefe's Project Veritas. O'Keefe attended, as a guest of the Trump campaign, the final presidential debate, and was later available in the spin room following the Las Vegas event.&lt;ref name="TP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNBC2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo6"&gt;Michelle Ye Hee Lee, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/21/trumps-claim-tying-violence-at-his-rallies-to-the-clinton-campaign/ Trump's claim tying violence at his rallies to the Clinton campaign]; ''[[The Washington Post]], October 21, 2016; ''"Further, the Trump Foundation gave $10,000 to Project Veritas in 2015.

In response to reports alleging a connection between the videos and the Trump campaign, a spokesperson for Project Veritas stated, "We have a multi-million dollar budget and the cost of this video series alone is way up there. The donation Trump provided didn't impact our actions one way or the other."&lt;ref name="WaTimes"&gt;Valerie Richardson,[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/25/dnc-moves-discredit-project-veritas-after-latest-v/ DNC moves to discredit Project Veritas after latest video alleges campaign illegality], ''[[Washington Times]]'', October 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Americans United for Change videos====
On October 18, 2016, O'Keefe released a series of videos on Project Veritas' [[YouTube]] channel titled "Rigging the Election" that apparently showed former national field director [[Scott Foval]] of Americans United for Change discussing planting agitators, including "mentally ill people that we pay to do shit" in front of [[Donald Trump]] rallies to ask questions near reporters, a common practice known as "bird dogging".&lt;ref name="Salon2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MJ3"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/james-okeefe-scott-foval-new-47-percent-story-false James O'Keefe's New Story About the 47 Percent Video is Totally False]; ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''; David Corn; October 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Foval also said "We've been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin' assholes for fifty years and we're not going to stop now." Foval later said he was talking about busing people to rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://isthmus.com/news/news/democratic-operative-scott-foval-says-sting-that-brought-him-down-was-a-fraud/ |title=Scott Foval speaks out about Veritas video |newspaper=[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]] |date=May 18, 2017 |first=Steven |last=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foval went on to discuss the legal consequences of voter fraud: "Let's just say, in theory, if a major investigation came up of major vote fraud that way, how would they prove it? ... If there's a bus involved, that changes the dynamic ... You can prove conspiracy if there's a bus, but if there are cars, it is much harder to prove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/19/two-democratic-operatives-lose-jobs-after-james-okeefe-sting/ |title=Two Democratic operatives lose jobs after James O'Keefe sting |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 19, 2016 |first=David |last=Weigel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accuracy of the videos has been questioned for possibly omitting context, and the unedited raw footage has not been made available.&lt;ref name="NPR4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gauthier |first1=Brendan |title=James O'Keefe releases another Project Veritas video claiming Hillary Clinton campaign is "bird dogging" |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/10/18/james-okeefe-releases-another-project-veritas-video-claiming-hillary-clinton-campaign-is-bird-dogging |accessdate=October 18, 2016 |work=Salon |date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Conservative activist James O'Keefe exposes possible Democratic foul play in video |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/conservative-activist-james-okeefe-exposes-democratic-foul-play-in-video |accessdate=October 20, 2016 |publisher=CBS |date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT5"&gt;Steve Eder and Jonathan Martinoct, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/politics/video-dnc-trump-rallies.html?_r=1 Videos Put Democrats on Defensive About Dirty Tricks]; ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

"While none of the schemes described in the conversations ever took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values of Democracy Partners."&lt;ref name=electreact /&gt; Shortly afterwards, Creamer, who was also featured in the video, said he would end his consulting arrangement with the DNC to avoid becoming a "distraction".&lt;ref name="CBS3"/&gt;

Following the publication of his videos, O'Keefe filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and the DNC, alleging "a criminal conspiracy" involving the Clinton campaign, the DNC and three left-leaning super PACs.&lt;ref name="FEC1"&gt;Mark Hensch, [http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/302178-okeefe-files-fec-complaint-against-clinton-camp-dnc "O'Keefe files FEC complaint against Clinton camp, DNC"], ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', October 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2017, Creamer's firm, Democracy Partners, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Project Veritas, claiming Project Veritas had lied to gain access to the firm and violating anti-wiretapping laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elliott |first=Philip |url=http://time.com/4801721/james-okeefe-lawsuit-democracy-partners |title=James O'Keefe's Targets Sue Undercover Filmmaker for $1 Million |date=June 1, 2017 |journal=Time |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a third video, in which O'Keefe stated that Clinton was behind an illegal public relations gimmick to punish Trump for not releasing his tax returns, the Clinton campaign denied any wrongdoing. Independent campaign finance experts posited the video doesn't support O'Keefe's claims. Clinton said she was aware of the activists dressed as [[Donald Duck]], who were following Donald Trump while asking about his tax returns, and said she was amused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frizell |first1=Sam |title=Hillary Clinton Knew About Donald Duck Stunt But Never Broke Law, Campaign Says |url=http://time.com/4545543/hillary-clinton-donald-duck-trump-veritas |accessdate=October 27, 2016 |journal=TIME |date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2016, O'Keefe posted a fourth video on his Project Veritas Action YouTube channel. The video alleged that liberal groups supporting Hillary Clinton were illegally taking foreign money. The targeted group, Americans United for Change foundation, is a [[501(c)4]] organization and is allowed to legally accept foreign contributions. However, AUC returned the money shortly after the video was released. The group's chief stated, "We returned the money because the last thing we want to be associated with is a character like O'Keefe who has been convicted and successfully sued for his illegal tactics and fraudulent activities."&lt;ref name=TimeFourth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Philip |title=Latest Clinton Sting Doesn't Live Up to Its Hype |url=http://time.com/4547193/hillary-clinton-foreign-money |accessdate=October 31, 2016 |journal=TIME |date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2016 ([[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]), O'Keefe spent some time going around vans that were allegedly "bussing people around to polls in Philadelphia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gauthier |first1=Brendan |title=James O'Keefe is spending Election Day following vans around Philadelphia |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/11/08/james-okeefe-is-spending-election-day-following-vans-around-philadelphia/ |accessdate=December 6, 2016 |work=Salon |date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York City elections official video====
In October 2016, Project Veritas released a video taken at a [[United Federation of Teachers]] holiday party on December 16, 2015. It was secretly recorded by an undercover journalist posing as a political consultant. In the video, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representative from [[Manhattan]] on the [[New York City Board of Elections]], Commissioner Alan Schulkin, was seen saying that there was "all kinds of fraud" in the election system.

Schulkin criticized Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]]'s municipal ID program as a major contributing factor. "He gave out ID cards, de Blasio. That's in lieu of a driver's license, but you can use it for anything. But they didn't vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say, 'I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card.' It's absurd. There is a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud ... This is why I get more conservative as I get older", Schulkin said in the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/11/new_york_city_elections_official_caught_on_video_there_is_a_lot_of_voter_fraud.html |title=New York City Elections Official Caught On Video: "There Is A Lot Of Voter Fraud" |publisher=RealClearPolitics|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not realizing he was being recorded, Schulkin said, "The law says you can't ask for anything. Which they really should be able to do. I think there is a lot of voter fraud." He continued, "Certain neighborhoods in particular, they bus people around to vote. They put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site." At another point in the conversation, Schulkin said, "Oh, there's thousands of absentee ballots. ... I don't know where they came from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2016/10/11/elections-official-caught-on-video-blasting-de-blasios-id-program |title=Elections official caught on video blasting de Blasio's ID program |last=Campanile |first=Carl |date=October 11, 2016 |newspaper=New York Post |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}}

Shortly after the release of the video, Mayor [[Bill de Blasio|de Blasio]] called Schulkin's behavior "entirely inappropriate" and demanded his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2016/10/14/de-blasio-demands-resignation-of-elections-official-who-blasted-id-program |title=De Blasio demands resignation of elections official who blasted ID program |last=Calder |first=Rich |last2=Campanile |first2=Carl |date=October 14, 2016 |newspaper=New York Post |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}}

At a subsequent BOE meeting in October, Schulkin said his remarks had been taken out of context and denied being a racist, but defended his support for a voter ID law. He was told by party leaders at the meeting that he would not be reappointed to another four-year term after his term expired on December 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2016/11/16/elections-official-resigns-after-video-blasting-de-blasios-id-program/ |title=Elections official caught blasting de Blasio's ID program to be replaced |last=Calder |first=Rich |date=November 17, 2016 |newspaper=New York Post |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}}

CNN later published a 13-page plan written by O'Keefe mentor Ben Wetmore.&lt;ref name="defends sex boat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/10/04/james_okeefe_sex_boat_post/index.html |title=James O'Keefe defends "sex boat" prank by saying it wouldn't have been that gross |author=Pareene, Alex |publisher=Salon |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It listed props for the boat scheme, including pornography, sexual aids, condoms, a blindfold and "fuzzy" handcuffs.&lt;ref name=cnn-zamost/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACORN foe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Punking"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2010/09/specials/cnn.caper/index.html |title=Punking' CNN: The following highlights the relevant portions of a 13-page document obtained by CNN outlining a plan to 'punk' CNN |publisher=CNN |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned by CNN, O'Keefe denied he was going to follow the Wetmore plan, as he found parts of it inappropriate.&lt;ref name="ACORN foe"/&gt; Boudreau commented "that does not appear to be true, according to a series of emails we obtained from Izzy Santa, who says the e-mails reveal James' true intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://siu.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/29/our-documentary-takes-a-strange-detour |title=Our Documentary Takes A Strange Detour |author=Boudreau, Abbie |publisher=CNN |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Boudreau incident, Project Veritas paid Izzy Santa a five-figure settlement after she threatened to sue, which included a nondisclosure agreement.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/68628_Page3.html][[Kenneth Vogel]]&lt;span&gt;, "James O'Keefe's plans derailed by infighting, lack of funding"&lt;/span&gt;, Politico.com, November 17, 2011; accessed December 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding decreased from conservative political organizations following this CNN incident.&lt;ref name="Vogel"/&gt;

===New Jersey Teachers' Union video (2010)===
Starting October 25, 2010, O'Keefe posted a series of videos on the Internet entitled ''Teachers Unions Gone Wild.'' At the time, the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) was in negotiations with [[Chris Christie]], the New Jersey governor, over teacher pay benefits and tenure.&lt;ref name="hot seat"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/sunbeam/index.ssf?/base/news-7/128816581231050.xml&amp;coll=9 |title=Video puts NJEA in hot seat |publisher=The Star-Ledger |author=Rundquist, Jeanette and Megan DeMarco |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe obtained one video from recordings made by "citizen journalists", whom he recruited to attend the NJEA's leadership conference. They secretly recorded meetings and conversations with teacher participants.&lt;ref name="hot seat"/&gt; It featured teachers discussing the difficulty of firing a [[tenure|tenured teacher]].

A second video featured a staged phone conversation by O'Keefe with Lawrence E. Everett, assistant superintendent of the [[Passaic, New Jersey]] city schools, in which Everett refused to commit to firing a teacher based upon the purported claim by a parent that the teacher had used the "[[nigger|n-word]]" with his child.&lt;ref name="hot seat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="james digs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.app.com/article/C0/20101026/COMMUNITIES/310260012/James-O-Keefe-targets-NJEA-with-undercover-gone-wild-video |title=Teacher's Union Gone Wild: James O'Keefe digs into NJEA with new 'undercover' video |publisher=Asbury Park Press |first=Jason |last=Method |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third video (October 26, 2010) featured audio of a voice, identified as NJEA Associate Director Wayne Dibofsky, who alleged voter fraud during the 1997 Jersey City mayoral election.&lt;ref name="hot seat"/&gt; The voice of Robert Byrne, Jersey City municipal clerk, was recorded on the same video; he noted that the election was monitored by lawyers for both candidates.&lt;ref name="hot seat"/&gt;

New Jersey's Republican Governor [[Chris Christie]] stated at the time that nothing on the videos surprised him.&lt;ref name="nj.com"&gt;[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/christie_njea_video_james_okee.html "Hidden video by conservative activist James O'Keefe renews NJEA, Gov. Christie dispute"], nj.com; accessed February 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer said the union and its attorneys were discussing their options regarding possible legal action, although no action was ever taken. Wollmer called the videos "a calculated attack on this organization and its members", and described O'Keefe as "flat-out sleazy".&lt;ref name="nj.com"/&gt;

===Medicaid videos (2011)===
In the summer of 2011, O'Keefe released videos of his colleagues' staged encounters purportedly showing Medicaid fraud in offices in six states, including Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Virginia. Following his previous strategy, he sent the releases to conservative outlets over a period of weeks. In July 2011, two conservative groups released a secretly recorded video of an encounter in Maine's Department of Health and Human Services.

In the video, an actor attempted to apply for benefits while hinting that he was a drug smuggler. [[Americans for Prosperity]] and O'Keefe said he had similar recorded videos from offices in Ohio, Virginia and South Carolina, and believed that there was a systemic problem. In Maine, Governor LePage concluded upon further examination of the videos that there was no fraud or intent to commit fraud.&lt;!-- proper wording in line with quote from LePage --&gt;&lt;ref name="portlandpressherald"&gt;Rebekah Metzler,[http://www.pressherald.com/news/sting-video-stirs-fraud-debate-_2011-08-12.html "'Sting' Video Stirs Fraud Debate"], ''Portland Press Herald'', August 12, 2011; accessed September 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chafets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WCSH"&gt;Ken Christian.

Paul LePage regarding the video: "The video in its entirety does not show a person willfully helping someone defraud the welfare system."&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar O'Keefe video posted on the Project Veritas web site purported to show workers at the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services assisting actors posing as drug dealers in applying for benefits. His fourth Medicaid video, apparently filmed in [[Richmond, Virginia]], was released in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VIDEO: MEDICAID STING HITS VIRGINIA CAPITAL CITY - MEDICAID PART IV |url=http://www.theprojectveritas.com/medicaidiv |publisher=Project Veritas |accessdate=May 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530043907/http://www.theprojectveritas.com/medicaidiv# |archive-date=May 30, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[As 'Sean Murphy'], dressed in the same regalia he wore on the New Jersey shoot, [O'Keefe] presented himself to a Medicaid worker in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, S.C.]], as an Irish drug importer and Irish Republican Army member who wanted coverage for 25 wounded comrades who entered the U.S. illegally. The kindly worker spent time photocopying applications and dealing with this improbable applicant. She explained to him that only U.S. citizens are eligible for Medicaid and informed him she was not making any promises that the 25 purported IRA members would qualify. She said he had to abide by the law and told him that she didn't want to know details, because federal law protects patient privacy. "Like I said, someone would have to come here and subpoena our information in order for us to divulge any information, because like I said there's something called the Health Insurance Accountability and Affordability Act—or portability—and anyway it went into effect several years ago, and that's what we follow. It is federal law, and they do threaten high fines—which they don't pay me as much per year as they threaten to fine me—so it is definitely not in my own best interest to divulge anything to anyone because I cannot afford it, I do not want to go to jail."&lt;ref name="Chafets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TPM1"&gt;Ryan J.

====Reception====
The videos received less media attention than earlier O'Keefe efforts. Generally, the state officials and representatives acknowledged potential problems but also took a measured tone in response, to allow time to fully investigate and evaluate the incidents. After viewing the video, Maine governor [[Paul LePage]] thanked the individual who took the video and noted: "The video in its entirety does not show a person willfully helping someone de-fraud the welfare system. It does show a need for further job knowledge and continuous and improved staff training." He also stated that "we would be six months further along in fixing the problem" if he had received the video when it was filmed. LePage directed his agency director to work on correcting the problem.&lt;ref name="WCSH"/&gt;

Ohio media initially reported that "a Franklin County Jobs and Family Service worker was placed on administrative leave and at least one other person was out of work" as a result of the video's release.&lt;ref name="10tv"/&gt; Ben Johnson of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services noted that benefits were never granted in the case, and that the made-up story would have been caught if the application process had proceeded. He said his office would use the video to strengthen staff training. [[Mike DeWine]], Attorney General of Ohio, described the Ohio video as "outrageous" and intended to instruct his state's Medicaid fraud unit to look into the incident.&lt;ref name="10tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2011/07/19/story-columbus-medicaid-fraud.html |title=Ohio's Medicaid Investigated After Undercover Video Released Online &amp;#124; WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio &amp;#124; Columbus News, Weather &amp; Sports |website=10tv.com |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson quote: "Assuming (the video is) accurate, it's unacceptable ... The video is incredibly troubling. I'm less concerned with the filmmakers and what their motivations might have been, and more concerned with making sure we're spending taxpayer money appropriately, that we're rooting out fraud, wherever it is, and that we're running a clean program. The end result of this is we're going to take this video and we're going to use it as a training video."&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the [[Ohio Department of Job and Family Services]], [[Michael B. Colbert|Michael Colbert]], notified county leaders of a mandatory retraining, "to ensure they can identify people trying to defraud the government".&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch&gt;{{cite news |last=Pyle |first=Encarnacion |title=Embarrassing video sting spurs worker training |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/07/21/embarrassing-videostingspurs-worker-training.html |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |newspaper=Columbus Dispatch |date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon investigation by state officials, the Medicaid worker who coached O'Keefe's operative seeking Medicaid for his father and claimed to own a yacht as well as a helipad, on how to hide their (also claimed) ownership of an $800,000 automobile had been placed on paid administrative leave.&lt;ref name="Chafets"&gt;[[Zev Chafets|Chafets, Zev]].

In [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the director of that state's Department of Health and Human Services, Anthony Kreck, said the video filmed in his state "raises concerns about how well trained and supported our staff are to handle outrageous situations." He also expressed concern for the safety of the state employee with the figure ["Sean Murphy"] in the video "who could be interpreted as intimidating" and questioned why security wasn't called.&lt;ref name="Columbus Dispatch 2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Bruce |title=S.C. investigates after conservative group posts Medicaid video |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/07/20/sc-investigation-medicaid-video.html |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |newspaper=Columbus Dispatch |date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hampshire Primary video (2012)===
In January 2012, O'Keefe released a video of associates obtaining a number of ballots for the New Hampshire Primary by using the names of recently deceased voters. He stated that the video showed "the integrity of the elections process is severely comprised {{sic}}."&lt;ref name="abcNH"/&gt; His team culled names from published obituaries, which were checked against public voter roll information. O'Keefe said his team broke no laws, as they did not pretend to be the deceased persons when they asked for the ballots, and they did not cast votes after receiving ballots. One of his associates' attempts was caught by a voting supervisor at the polling station who recognized that the name he gave was of a deceased individual; the associate in question left before police arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20220110fraudulent_voter_stopped_in_nh "Fraudulent voter stopped in New Hampshire"], ''Boston Herald'', January 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception====
Sarah Parnass of [[ABC News]] reported that the video "either exposes why voting laws are too lax or comes close to itself being voter fraud (or both) ..."&lt;ref name="abcNH"/&gt; One media account referred to it as a stunt.&lt;ref name="wsjNH"/&gt; New Hampshire Governor [[John Lynch (New Hampshire)|John Lynch]] said, "I think it is outrageous that we have out-of-staters coming into New Hampshire, coming into our polling places and misrepresenting themselves to the election officials, and I hope that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, if in fact they're found guilty of some criminal act."&lt;ref name="Governor"/&gt; The New Hampshire Attorney General and the US Attorney's Office announced investigations into the video.&lt;ref name="Governor"&gt;[http://www.wmur.com/politics/30200166/detail.html "Group Says It Got Primary Ballots With Dead People's Names; Governor Says Group's Actions Should Be Investigated"], WMUR.com, January 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Hampshire Associate [[Attorney General]] Richard Head said he would investigate the possible weaknesses in the voting system,&lt;ref name="concmon"&gt;[http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/304496/hidden-video-said-to-show-voter-fraud?page=0,0&amp;CSAuthResp=1326416242%3Ah5bbjct77pm4c483vhffsif8a5%3ACSUserId|CSGroupId%3Aapproved%3AA23F19459430CA4BC58C62782903EFBC&amp;CSUserId=94&amp;CSGroupId=1 "Hidden Video Said to Show Voter Fraud"], ''Concord Monitor''; accessed July 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but noted the state did not have a history of known fraud related to person[s] seeking ballot[s] in the name of a dead person or persons.&lt;ref name="abcNH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/james-okeefe-video-purports-to-show-ease-of-voter-fraud-in-n-h-primary |title=James O'Keefe Video Purports to Show Ease of Voter Fraud in N.H.

===Patrick Moran (2012)===
On October 24, 2012 a video was released showing Patrick Moran, son of then-U.S. Congressman [[Jim Moran]] (D-VA), and a field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots, which was proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20076304 |publisher=BBC News |title=US politician's son resigns over 'voter fraud' video |date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person he was speaking with was a conservative activist with O'Keefe's Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation.&lt;ref name="APWashPost25Oct12"&gt;{{Citation |last=Haines |first=Errin |title=Moran's son resigns from campaign amid video furor |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=October 24, 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/jim-morans-son-resigns-campaign-amid-video-furor/2012/10/24/95ea4a56-1e23-11e2-b647-bb1668e64058_story.html |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he did not want to be a distraction during the election, stating:

He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not.&lt;ref name="APWashPost25Oct12"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Arlington County, Virginia]] Police Department was made aware of the video and opened a criminal investigation into "every component" of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlington-va.patch.com/articles/arlington-police-launch-criminal-investigation-into-congressman-s-son?ncid=newsltuspatc00000003#youtube_video-11887030 Arlington Police Looking Into 'Every Component' of Moran Video]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, arlington-va.patch.com, October 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2013, Arlington County announced that the investigation, by its police department in collaboration with the Offices of the Virginia Attorney General and the Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney, had concluded and that no charges would be brought. The County stated: "Patrick Moran and the Jim Moran for Congress campaign provided full cooperation throughout the investigation. Despite repeated attempts to involve the party responsible for producing the video, they failed to provide any assistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UPDATE: Police Investigation of Election Offense Allegations Concludes |publisher=[[Arlington County, Virginia]] |date=January 31, 2013 |url=http://news.arlingtonva.us/update:-police-investigation-of-election-offense-allegations-concludes |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US–Mexico border-crossing (2014)===
In August 2014, O'Keefe dressed up as [[Osama bin Laden]] (who had died 3 years previously) and crossed the US–Mexico border in Texas in both directions to "show that our elected officials were lying to the American people" about border security. The incident was cited by U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] in Congressional hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Markon |first=Jerry |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/08/13/conservative-video-maker-james-okeefe-homeland-security-targeted-me-asked-intrusive-questions |title=Conservative video-maker James O'Keefe: Homeland Security targeted me, asked intrusive questions |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joan Walsh |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/09/16/new_fox_news_paranoia_isis_at_the_border |title=New Fox News paranoia: ISIS at the border! |website=Salon.com |date=September 16, 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempt to solicit voter fraud (2014)===
In October 2014 O'Keefe and his two colleagues attempted to bait staffers for Congressman [[Jared Polis]] (D-CO) and then-U.S. Senator [[Mark Udall]], as well as independent expenditure organizations, into approving voter fraud, according to several staffers who interacted with O'Keefe and his colleagues. Staffers began photographing O'Keefe's crew and advising them that what they were advocating was illegal; one nonprofit said they contacted police.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/colorado-dems-james-okeefe "Colorado Dems: We Caught James O'Keefe and His Friends Trying to Bait Us Into Approving Voter Fraud"], motherjones.com, October 20, 2014; accessed February 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted sting of Open Society Foundations (2016)===
On March 16, 2016, O'Keefe attempted to call [[Open Society Foundations]] under the assumed name of "Victor Kesh", describing himself as attached to "a, uh, foundation"[sic] seeking to "get involved with you and aid what you do in fighting for, um, European values."[sic] O'Keefe forgot to hang up after recording the voicemail, and several more minutes of audio were recorded, revealing that he was attached to [[Discover the Networks]] and planning a series of attempts to create embarrassing videos or other recordings of targeted groups.&lt;ref name="Sting of Myself"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mayer |first1=Jane |title=TRANSCRIPT OF JAMES O'KEEFE'S CALL TO THE OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-transcript-of-james-okeefes-call-to-the-open-society-foundations |accessdate=May 27, 2016 |agency=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CNN undercover videos (2017)===
On June 26, 2017, O'Keefe released a video on [[Project Veritas]]' YouTube channel that showed John Bonifield, a producer of health and medical stories for CNN, saying that CNN's coverage of the Russian investigation was for "ratings" and that the coverage was "mostly bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=American Pravda: 'Project Veritas' Catches CNN Producer Admitting Russia Story Is "Mostly Bullshit," "About Ratings" |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/06/27/american_pravda_project_veritas_catches_cnn_producer_admitting_russia_story_is_bullshit_about_ratings.html |agency=RealClear Politics |date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video identified Bonifield as a supervising producer of CNN, but did not state that he was a supervising producer for CNN Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/lifestyle/style/what-you-dont-see-in-okeefe-video-may-be-as-important-as-what-you-do/2017/06/28/dcb67446-5b7c-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html |title=What the latest James O'Keefe video leaves out |first=Paul |last=Farhi |date=June 28, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, CNN stated: "CNN stands by our medical producer John Bonifield.

On June 30, 2017, O'Keefe released the third part of the undercover videos. Part 3 of the series showed CNN associate producer Jimmy Carr saying that Trump is "fucking crazy" and that "on the inside, we all recognize he is a clown, that he is hilariously unqualified for this, he's really bad at this, and that he does not have America's best interests". Carr also said "This is a man who's not actually a Republican, he just adopted that because that was the party he thought he could win in.

=== Failed attempt to sting ''The Washington Post'' (2017) ===
Starting in July 2017, Project Veritas operative Jaime Phillips attempted to infiltrate ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and other media outlets by joining networking groups related to journalism and left-leaning politics. She and a male companion attended events related to the ''Post'', and their conversations with journalists were sometimes covertly recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reinhard |first1=Beth |last2=Davis |first2=Aaron C. |last3=Tran |first3=Andrew Ba |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/womans-effort-to-infiltrate-the-washington-post-dates-back-months/2017/11/29/ce95e01a-d51e-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html |title=Woman's effort to infiltrate The Washington Post dated back months |date=November 29, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, ''The Washington Post'' reported that several women [[Roy Moore sexual abuse allegations|accused]] Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate [[Roy Moore]] of pursuing them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html |title=A woman approached The Post with dramatic — and false — tale about Roy Moore.

They found a [[GoFundMe]] page in her name that said, "I've accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt [sic] of the liberal [[Mainstream media|MSM]]." After a ''Post'' reporter confronted her with the inconsistencies during a video-recorded interview, Phillips denied that she was working with an organization that targets journalists, and said that she no longer wanted to do the story.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She was seen outside Project Veritas' office in [[Mamaroneck, New York]], with her car remaining at the office's parking lot for more than an hour.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; O'Keefe declined to comment about the woman's apparent connection to Project Veritas.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haag"/&gt; Instead of running a story about Phillips' supposed pregnancy, the ''Post'' published an article about the attempted sting operation. The ''Post'' decided to disclose Phillips' original discussions made off the record, saying they were not obligated to keep them confidential because she had deceived them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hours after the ''Post'' published this story, O'Keefe released a video which he claimed exposed the newspaper's liberal bias.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/27/washington-post-project-veritas-sting-report |title=Washington Post catches woman in apparent rightwing sting, paper reports |date=November 27, 2017 |work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video includes undercover footage of conversations with two ''Post'' employees, national security reporter Dan Lamothe and product director Joey Marburger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cummings |first=William |url=http://www.wusa9.com/ext/news/nation-now/washington-post-claims-activist-tried-to-embarrass-paper-with-false-moore-accusation/65/nationnow/6e6cf675-89ac-4149-a915-9d74d1a2ac21 |title='Washington Post' claims activist tried to embarrass paper with false Moore accusation |publisher=WUSA*9 |date=November 27, 2017 |accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These employees explained to undercover Project Veritas operatives the difference between the news reporting of the ''Washington Post'' (which calls out the Trump administration's missteps while giving "him credit where there's credit" due) and the ''Post''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Op-ed|opinion editorials]]; O'Keefe said that this exposed the ''Washington Post''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s "hidden agenda."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/11/27/16707410/conservative-group-fake-roy-moore-allegation-washington-post|title=A conservative group tried to plant a fake Roy Moore allegation in the Washington Post. It failed.|work=Vox|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe was criticized for his failed sting, and ''The Washington Post'' was praised. [[Rod Dreher]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' praised the ''Post'' and called on conservative donors to stop giving money to O'Keefe's outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/wapo-badly-burns-james-okeefe/|title=WaPo Badly Burns James O'Keefe|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan McLaughlin of the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' said that O'Keefe's sting was an "[[own goal]]" and that O'Keefe was doing a disservice to the conservative movement;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454097/james-okeefe-helps-washington-post|title=James O'Keefe Shoots at The Washington Post and Misses|work=National Review|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Geraghty]] of the ''National Review'' made a similar assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454105/if-james-okeefe-and-project-veritas-tried-get-paper-print-lie-are-they-really-serving|title=If You're Trying to Get a Paper to Print a Lie, Are You Really Serving Truth?|work=National Review|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byron York]] of ''[[The Washington Examiner]]'' said that O'Keefe's "idiocy" was "beyond boneheaded,"&amp;nbsp;and that "O'Keefe really ought to hang it up."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/28/media/washington-post-james-okeefe-sting/index.html|title=James O'Keefe on the defensive after failed anti-Post plot|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Shapiro, the conservative editor in chief of ''[[The Daily Wire]]'', said that the botched sting was "horrible, both morally and effectively."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Conor Friedersdorf]] of ''The Atlantic'' wrote, "If James O'Keefe respected the right-wing populists who make up the audience of Project Veritas ... he would tell them the truth about all of the organizations that he targets.

They're actively courting it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/american-society/conservative-media-james-okeefe-gives-up/|title=How James O'Keefe Exposed the Corruption in Conservative Activist Media|date=2017-11-28|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Chait]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine said that O'Keefe, having set out prove that the ''Post'' was fake news, ended up disproving it. O'Keefe's plot collapsed because it was premised on a ludicrously false worldview, wrote Chait. "The Washington Post does not, in fact, publish unverified accusations just because they're against Republicans." O'Keefe's attempts to prove rampant voter fraud have failed "because voter fraud is not rampant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/conservative-fails-to-prove-washington-post-is-fake-news.html|title=Conservative Tries to Prove Washington Post Is Fake News, Proves Opposite|last=Chait|first=Jonathan|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Jersey Teachers Unions Officials (2018) ===

On May 2, 2018, Project Veritas posted on YouTube a video allegedly showing a New Jersey teachers union administrator discussing a teacher alleged to have struck a student.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2018/05/i_need_to_know_the_truth_so_we_can_bend_the_truth.html|title=Teacher union president suspended after allegedly saying 'I'm here to defend even the worst people'|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher was suspended following the release of the video, pending an investigation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The following day, O'Keefe released a second video allegedly showing another New Jersey teachers union administrator speaking to students about a different alleged incident of a teacher pushing and injuring a student.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2018/05/second_teachers_union_president_target_of_new_vide.html|title=2nd N.J. teachers union prez suspended after undercover video|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, the administrator allegedly boasted of her effort to retain a pension for a teacher who allegedly had sex with a student.

==Reception==
Project Veritas uses methods not employed by reputable journalists, including misrepresenting its operatives' identities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; O'Keefe refers to himself as a "guerrilla journalist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Markon |first1=Jerry |title=Conservative video-maker James O'Keefe: Homeland Security targeted me, asked intrusive questions |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2015/08/13/conservative-video-maker-james-okeefe-homeland-security-targeted-me-asked-intrusive-questions |accessdate=August 27, 2015 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods have stirred debate about what it means to be a journalist and what constitutes good journalistic practice, especially with respect to undercover work.&lt;ref name="journornot"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/brooke_kroeger_on_james_okeefe.php |title=Brooke Kroeger on James O'Keefe and Undercover Reporting: A CJR Podcast |journal=Columbia Journalism Review |publisher=Columbia University Press |last=Kroeger |first=Brooke |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Kenneally and Daniel Frankel reported for [[thewrap.com]] on March 9, 2011 that some of O'Keefe's supporters referred to him as the [[right wing]]'s answer to a long line of left-leaning "hybrid troublemakers who get put on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', like [[Paul Krassner]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]]".&lt;ref name="TimandDan"&gt;Tim Kenneally &amp; Daniel Frankel [http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/who-exactly-video-sting-artist-james-okeefe-25369#: "James O'Keefe, NPR-Slayer, What Kind of Journalist is This?"], thewrap.com, March 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In that same March 2011 report, Marty Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center at the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]], was quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What [O'Keefe] does isn't journalism. It's [[agitprop|agitpop]] [sic], politi-punking, entrapment-entertainment. There is no responsible definition of journalism that includes what he does or how he does it. His success at luring his prey into harming themselves is a measure of how fallible and foolish anyone, including good people, can sometimes be.&lt;ref name="TimandDan"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reporting on allegations that O'Keefe had attempted in 2010 to tamper with Senator Landrieu's office phone system, Jim Rutenberg and Campbell Robertson of the ''New York Times'' posited that O'Keefe practiced a kind of "gonzo journalism" and his tactic is to "caricature the political and social values of his enemies by carrying them to outlandish extremes."&lt;ref name="highjinks"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/us/politics/31landrieu.html?pagewanted=all |title=High Jinks to Handcuffs for Landrieu Provocateur |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |first1=Jim |last1=Rutenberg |first2=Campbell |last2=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Jonathan Seidl of [[TheBlaze]] said of the first NPR video, "the video, in the end, not only raises questions about NPR, but it also raises questions about undercover, gotcha journalism that can sometimes border on entrapment."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Seidl,[http://www.theblaze.com/news/2011/03/08/caught-on-video-npr-exec-bashes-racist-tea-party-and-anti-intellectual-gop "Undercover: NPR Exec Talks 'Racist' Tea Party and 'Anti-Intellectual' GOP, But Is He Kowtowing to Muslim Brotherhood?"], theblaze.com, March 8, 2011; accessed September 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Baker of TheBlaze wrote in March 2011 about the NPR videos, saying that O'Keefe was "unethical" because he calls himself an "investigative journalist" but "uses editing tactics that seem designed to intentionally lie or mislead about the material being presented."&lt;ref name="Tactics"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Scott |title=Does Raw Video of NPR Expose Reveal Questionable Editing &amp; Tactics? |url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2011/03/10/does-raw-video-of-npr-expose-reveal-questionable-editing-tactics/ |publisher=''The Blaze'' |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2011 interview with O'Keefe, NPR journalist [[Bob Garfield]] asked, referring to the ACORN videos, "If your journalistic technique is the lie, why should we believe anything you have to say?"&lt;ref name="Garfield"/&gt; O'Keefe responded that his techniques should be characterized as a form of [[guerrilla theater]]  rather than "lying" – "you're posing as something you're not, in order to capture candid conversations from your subject. But I wouldn't characterize it as, as lying."&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2011/03/18/05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322041955/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2011/03/18/05 |archivedate=March 22, 2011 |publisher=[[NPR]] |title=''On the Media'' Transcript of "James O'Keefe" |date=March 18, 2011 |authorlink=Bob Garfield |first=Bob |last=Garfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Dean Mills, the dean of the [[Missouri School of Journalism]], compared O'Keefe to [[Michael Moore]] and said, "Some ethicists say it is never right for a journalist to deceive for any reason, but there are wrongs in the world that will never be exposed without some kind of subterfuge."&lt;ref name="Chafets"/&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' journalist [[Conor Friedersdorf]] responded that O'Keefe's "mortal sin" wasn't that he misled his subjects, but that he misled his audience by presenting his videos to the public in "less than honest ways that go far beyond normal 'selectivity.'"&lt;ref&gt;Friedersdorf, Conor.

The '''John Howard Society''' is a Canadian non-profit organization that seeks to develop understanding and effective responses to the problem of [[crime]] and [[prison reform]]. It is named after [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], a [[philanthropist]] and early [[England|English]] [[prison reform]]er. This society works with adults, children, and youths to help rebuild their lives.

== History ==

The John Howard Society was created in 1867 by a church group focused on providing spiritual care to prisoners in a Toronto prison. Later in 1874, this group became recognized as the Prisoners Aid Association of Toronto. Also around this time, they discovered more was needed by this group of prisoners than the spiritual care they had been providing. Unfortunately, [[World War I]] had immense effects on the church group and interest in their work decreased.

By 1929, Toronto's chief of police at the time, Chief Draper noted a need to reactivate the work done by the church group thus creating the Citizens Service Association. This association was volunteer operated and assisted prisoners re-entering society in finding housing, clothing and employment.

The idea spread and in 1931 British Columbia saw a similar institution created by Reverend J. Dinnage Hobden under the name we now know it as, the John Howard Society named after John Howard who was a prison reformer living from 1726 until 1790.

In 1946, the Citizens Service Association followed suit and became the John Howard Society of Ontario. Between 1947 and 1960 most other provinces created their own version of the Association. The John Howard Society of Canada was formed in February 1962 when all provinces (excluding Quebec) approved a constitution. In 1980, [[Quebec]] joined and in 1994 the [[Northwest Territories]]. 

Today, John Howard society offices and branches can be found in sixty communities across Canada, in all of the provinces and the Northwest Territories. The John Howard Society has sixty-five offices across Canada which specialize in the reintegration of individuals exiting the prison system back into society. They also work to keep individuals from making decisions that will increase their likelihood of contact with the law. In addition to this, their head office is located in [[Kingston, Ontario]], which is within driving distance of 10 penitentiaries.

=== Today ===

The people who comprise the John Howard Society of today have much the same focus as the original groups with a few additions.  For example, advocating for change in the criminal justice process and public education around the issues of prison conditions, [[criminal law]] and their application are all newer considerations as society and the criminal justice system change.

In addition to working with people in penitentiaries, Societies today also work with adults and youth in correctional facilities that are either federally and provincially operated. These services offer programming for offenders in custody and in the community and also assist those who have been labeled as "at risk" to continue to live or reintegrate into living "within the law".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3460">'''Medicines reconciliation''' is the process of ensuring that a hospital patient's [[medication]] list is as up-to-date as possible. It is usually undertaken by a [[pharmacist]], and may include consulting several sources such as the patient, their relatives or carers, or their [[primary care physician]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], guidelines on medicines reconciliation are provided by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in collaboration with the [[National Patient Safety Agency]].&lt;ref name="NICE NPSA"&gt;National Patient Safety Agency. NICE NPSA medicines reconciliation adults in hospital. Patient Safety Alert, Reference number 1035. Issue date 1 December 2007. London, UK. [http://www.npsa.nhs.uk/corporate/news/guidance-to-improve-medicines-reconciliation/]&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with these, it should be carried out within 24 hours of admission to hospital.

==Importance==

Research has shown that, on average, there is around a 20% discrepancy between medications prescribed on admission to hospital and the true medication list for a given patient.&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;Urban R, Armitage G, Morgan J, et-al.

In [[computer architecture]], the '''memory hierarchy''' separates [[computer storage]] into a hierarchy based on response time. Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by their performance and controlling technologies.&lt;ref name="toyzee" /&gt; Memory hierarchy affects performance in computer architectural design, algorithm predictions, and lower level [[computer programming|programming]] constructs involving [[locality of reference]]. 

Designing for high performance requires considering the restrictions of the memory hierarchy, i.e. the size and capabilities of each component. Each of the various components can be viewed as part of a hierarchy of memories (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) in which each member m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is typically smaller and faster than the next highest member m&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; of the hierarchy. To limit waiting by higher levels, a lower level will respond by filling a buffer and then signaling to activate the transfer.

There are four major storage levels.&lt;ref name="toyzee"&gt;{{cite book

# Main &amp;ndash; the system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and controller cards.
# On-line mass storage &amp;ndash; Secondary storage.
# Off-line bulk storage &amp;ndash; Tertiary and Off-line storage.
This is a general memory hierarchy structuring. Many other structures are useful.  For example, a paging algorithm may be considered as a level for [[virtual memory]] when designing a [[computer architecture]], and one can include a level of [[nearline storage]] between online and offline storage.

The number of levels in the memory hierarchy and the performance at each level has increased over time. The type of memory or storage components also change historically &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/memory-storage/|title=Memory &amp; Storage - Timeline of Computer History - Computer History Museum|author=|date=|website=www.computerhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* [[Offline storage]]

The lower levels of the hierarchy – from disks downwards – are also known as [[tiered storage]]. The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:&lt;ref name="pearson2010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Tony |year=2010 |url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/InsideSystemStorage/entry/the_correct_use_of_the_term_nearline2 |title=Correct use of the term Nearline. |work=IBM Developerworks, Inside System Storage |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Online storage is immediately available for I/O.
* Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.
* Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to bring online.

For example, always-on spinning disks are online, while spinning disks that spin-down, such as massive array of idle disk ([[MAID]]), are nearline. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in a [[tape library]], are nearline, while cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline.

Most modern [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] are so fast that for most program workloads, the [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] is the [[locality of reference]] of memory accesses and the efficiency of the [[CPU cache|caching]] and memory transfer between different levels of the hierarchy{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. As a result, the CPU spends much of its time idling, waiting for memory I/O to complete.  This is sometimes called the ''space cost'', as a larger memory object is more likely to overflow a small/fast level and require use of a larger/slower level. The resulting load on memory use is known as ''pressure'' (respectively ''register pressure'', ''cache pressure'', and (main) ''memory pressure''). Terms for data being missing from a higher level and needing to be fetched from a lower level are, respectively: [[register spilling]] (due to [[register pressure]]: register to cache), [[cache miss]] (cache to main memory), and (hard) [[page fault]] (main memory to disk).

Modern [[programming language]]s mainly assume two levels of memory, main memory and disk storage, though in [[assembly language]] and [[inline assembler]]s in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], registers can be directly accessed. Taking optimal advantage of the memory hierarchy requires the cooperation of programmers, hardware, and compilers (as well as underlying support from the operating system):
*'''Programmers''' are responsible for moving data between disk and memory through file I/O.
*'''Hardware''' is responsible for moving data between memory and caches.
*'''[[Compiler optimization|Optimizing compilers]]''' are responsible for generating code that, when executed, will cause the hardware to use caches and registers efficiently.

Many programmers assume one level of memory.  This works fine until the application hits a performance wall.  Then the memory hierarchy will be assessed during [[code refactoring]].

==Reception==
The book causes a stir as it discussed a subject considered [[taboo]] in a country ruled for [[Political history of Pakistan|half of its time]] since [[Independence of Pakistan|independence]], by Military. The author on the launch of the book said, "Over the past three years a lot of my friends have advised me not to publish this book. They think I have suicidal tendencies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6709583.stm | title=Book reception | publisher=BBC | date=31 May 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Talat Hussain, a retired general and political analyst, said "Ms Siddiqa is a courageous researcher. This area has always been considered a sacred cow in our society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/31/books.pakistan | title=book reception | publisher=The Guardian | date=2007-05-31 | accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motivational leadership''' refers to someone leading others by motivating them to strive for certain goals rather than simply act on orders. The leader tries to create a safe and trusting environment, and ensure the organization is positioned for success in its domain—for example, a company in the marketplace. Some interpret motivational leadership principles as requiring that a leader establish strong ethics, clear vision, definable values, authentic communication, and be genuinely motivated to promote collaboration and a positive working environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howatthr.com/images/pdf/m2/Motivational%20Leadership%20A%20Guide%20to%20Building%20a%20Congruent%20Team.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivational leadership qualities ==

''[[Honesty]]'': A leader must be honest to maintain trust from team members.

''Ability to delegate'': Leaders must identify strengths of team members so they can maximize group potential.

'''Sense of [[humor]]''': Leaders must help maintain organizational morale because negative attitudes spread.

''[[Confidence]]'': A leader must show confidence in all situations, because others feed from this confidence and perform more productively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/peter-economy/7-traits-highly-effective-leaders.html |title=7 Traits of Highly Effective Leaders |publisher=Inc.com |date=2013-08-27 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Commitment'': A leader must show commitment by doing work the others are doing to demonstrate commitment to the team and the mission, and willingness to do “dirty work” if necessary.

''Positive attitude'': Leaders must demonstrate a positive attitude to the group happy and maximize productivity.

''[[Creativity]]'': A leader must be creative to see situations in multiple ways and solve problems more effectively.

''[[Optimism]]'': A leader constantly must be optimistic and have a positive vision because team members feed from that optimism.

''[[Visionary|Vision]]'': Leaders must have a vision, because followers may not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amanet.org/training/articles/How-to-Become-a-Motivational-Leader.aspx |title=How to Become a Motivational Leader |publisher=Amanet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Integrity]]''': To have integrity means that one is truthful with strong morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amanet.org/training/articles/How-to-Become-a-Motivational-Leader.aspx |title=How to Become a Motivational Leader |publisher=Amanet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Becoming a motivational leader ==

Motivation leadership begins with motivating yourself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1000advices.com/guru/leadership_motivational_bt.html |title=Motivational Leadership: BECOMING a MOTIVATIONAL LEADER (Tips by: Brian Tracy) |publisher=1000advices.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders should have motivation and confidence that they can successfully lead a group and also that they are able to approach the group they are leading with good manners

A leader must set goals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1000advices.com/guru/leadership_motivational_bt.html |title=Motivational Leadership: BECOMING a MOTIVATIONAL LEADER (Tips by: Brian Tracy) |publisher=1000advices.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep the group working towards something—but the goals must be achievable, because unrealistic goals hurt morale.

A leader should learn from failures to gain wisdom. Young leaders can only learn so much from past leaders and textbooks, but sometimes must make their own mistakes so they can learn from them.

A leader should accept responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1000advices.com/guru/leadership_motivational_bt.html |title=Motivational Leadership: BECOMING a MOTIVATIONAL LEADER (Tips by: Brian Tracy) |publisher=1000advices.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for not only their actions, but the actions of their group.

When approaching a project, a leader should provide direction to the group to get a task completed in the most efficient manner.

A leader should be trustworthy because the people they lead must trust them to do everything in their power to promote success.

A leader should be authentic rather than pompous. People generally favor leaders who see themselves as a common worker.

To get the most out of a group, a leader should embrace self-expression to harness every group member's inner creativity.

Key to leadership is collaboration with the group to all opinions so everyone has input.

== Motivational leadership in sports ==

'''[[Vince Lombardi]]''': Vince Lombardi was a coach in the National Football League for the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers. After his five year tenure with the Giants, he signed a five year deal to coach the Packers. Lombardi transformed the Packers from a team that had a record of 1-10-1 in 1958, the previous year, to 7-5 in 1959, Lombardi’s first year. Lombardi went on to lead the Packers to three straight and five total league championships. Lombardi’s success was based on how he coached. Lombardi demanded excellence and told players that once they understood themselves, they could add to that and build character, integrity, and dedication. Lombardi had a violent temper, but that only was illustrated due to the passion he had for the game. Lombardi promised that if his players obeyed his rules, they would be winners. Lombardi certainly held up his end of the bargain, winning two Super Bowls with the Packers.

'''Coach Herb Brooks''': Coach Brooks is an iconic figure for his motivational speech before the 1980 championship game in which USA played a championship hockey game against the Soviets. The Soviets were heavy favorites to win and Brooks, in his speech, said that the Soviets would probably win 9 times out of 10. Brooks motivated his team to go out and play as if it was their night, as if they deserved this game. If not for the brilliant and motivating speech by Brooks, who knows if team USA would have defeated the Soviets in 1980.

'''[[Ray Lewis]]''': Ray Lewis had a 17 year career in the National Football League with the Baltimore Ravens. Lewis is known for his devotion to Christianity and his outstanding leadership. He is not only a leader on the field with his teammates, but a leader off the field with charity work for disadvantaged youth.

== Motivational leadership in the workforce ==

'''Motivational Leadership''' is important because it helps to get the most from society. Every team of people or worker needs leadership. Leaders help organize projects to get them completed in the most efficient manner. Leaders have incentives to motivate employees because they help cut costs by working quicker in a positive environment. Additionally, employees increase quality when happy with leadership, and in turn, society is happy because they receive quality products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadership-central.com/importance-of-motivation.html#axzz2iSh4bGlC |title=Importance of Motivation |publisher=Leadership-central.com |date=2013-06-17 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivational leadership in a family ==

Any family figure can be a motivational leader in a family—a brother, sister, cousin, grandparent, or parent. The motivational leader in a family must constantly set good examples and drive other members of the family to be the best that they can. A child that is constantly motivated usually develops their own motivation, and therefore develops a work ethic. Parents must motivate their children, and in some instances older siblings.

[[File:"Attack of the Mutineers on the Redan Battery at Lucknow, July 30th, 1857,.jpg|thumb|Attack of the Mutineers on the Redan Battery at [[Siege of Lucknow|Lucknow, July 30]], 1857]]
'''Mutiny''' is a [[criminal conspiracy]] among a group of people (typically members of the [[military]] or the [[crew]] of any ship, even if they are civilians) to openly oppose, change, or overthrow a lawful authority to which they are subject. The term is commonly used for a [[rebellion]] among members of the military against their superior officers, but it can also occasionally refer to any type of rebellion against authority figures or governances.

During the [[Age of Discovery]], mutiny particularly meant open rebellion against a ship's [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]. This occurred, for example, during [[Ferdinand Magellan|Ferdinand Magellan's]] journeys around the world resulting in the killing of one mutineer, the [[Capital punishment|execution]] of another, and the [[marooning]] of others; on [[Henry Hudson]]'s ''Discovery'' resulting in Hudson and others being set adrift in a boat; and the notorious [[mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']].

==Penalty==
===United Kingdom===
Until 1689, mutiny was regulated in [[Kingdom of England|England]] by ''[[Articles of War]]'' instituted by the monarch and effective only in a period of war. In 1689, the first ''[[Mutiny Acts|Mutiny Act]]'' was passed which passed the responsibility to enforce discipline within the military to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The ''Mutiny Act'', altered in 1803, and the ''Articles of War'' defined the nature and punishment of mutiny until the latter were replaced by the ''Army Discipline and Regulation Act'' in 1879. This, in turn, was replaced by the ''Army Act'' in 1881.

Today the [[Armed Forces Act 2006|Army Act 1955]] defines mutiny as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;Year=1955&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2675303&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2675343&amp;filesize=4221 Army Act (1955) c.18 - Part II Discipline and Trial and Punishment of Military Offences: Mutiny and insubordination], ''The UK Statute Law Database''.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Mutiny means a combination between two or more persons subject to service law, or between persons two at least of whom are subject to service law—
:(a) to overthrow or resist lawful authority in Her Majesty's forces or any forces co-operating therewith or in any part of any of the said forces,
:(b) to disobey such authority in such circumstances as to make the disobedience subversive of discipline, or with the object of avoiding any duty or service against, or in connection with operations against, the enemy, or
:(c) to impede the performance of any duty or service in Her Majesty's forces or in any forces co-operating therewith or in any part of any of the said forces.}}
The same definition applies in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]].

The military law of England in early times existed, like the forces to which it applied, in a period of war only. Troops were raised for a particular service and were disbanded upon the cessation of hostilities. The crown, by prerogative, made laws known as ''Articles of War'' for the government and discipline of the troops while thus embodied and serving. Except for the punishment of desertion, which was made a [[felony]] by statute in the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], these ordinances or Articles of War remained almost the sole authority for the enforcement of discipline until 1689 when the first ''Mutiny Act'' was passed and the military forces of the crown were brought under the direct control of parliament. Even the Parliamentary forces in the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] were governed, not by an act of the legislature, but by articles of war similar to those issued by the king and authorized by an ordinance of the Lords and Commons exercising in that respect the sovereign prerogative. This power of law-making by prerogative was however held to be applicable during a state of actual war only, and attempts to exercise it in time of peace were ineffectual. Subject to this limitation, it existed for considerably more than a century after the passing of the first Mutiny Act.

From 1689 to 1803, although in peace time the Mutiny Act was occasionally suffered to expire, a statutory power was given to the crown to make Articles of War to operate in the [[British Empire|colonies]] and elsewhere beyond the seas in the same manner as those made by prerogative operated in time of war.

In 1715, in consequence of the rebellion, this power was created in respect of the forces in the kingdom but apart from and in no respect affected the principle acknowledged all this time that the crown of its mere prerogative could make laws for the government of the army in foreign countries in time of war.

The Mutiny Act of 1803 effected a great constitutional change in this respect: the power of the crown to make any Articles of War became altogether statutory, and the prerogative merged in the act of parliament. The [[Mutiny Act 1873]] was passed in this manner.

Such matters remained until 1879 when the last Mutiny Act was passed and the last Articles of War were promulgated. The Mutiny Act legislated for offences in respect of which death or penal servitude could be awarded, and the Articles of War, while repeating those provisions of the act, constituted the direct authority for dealing with offences for which imprisonment was the maximum punishment as well as with many matters relating to trial and procedure.

The act and the articles were found not to harmonize in all respects. Their general arrangement was faulty, and their language sometimes obscure. In 1869, a royal commission recommended that both should be recast in a simple and intelligible shape. In 1878, a committee of the House of Commons endorsed this view and made recommendations as to how the task should be performed. In 1879, passed into law a measure consolidating in one act both the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War, and amending their provisions in certain important respects. This measure was called the Army Discipline and Regulation Act 1879.

After one or two years experience finding room for improvement, it was superseded by the Army Act 1881, which hence formed the foundation and the main portion of the military law of England, containing a proviso saving the right of the crown to make Articles of War, but in such a manner as to render the power in effect a nullity by enacting that no crime made punishable by the act shall be otherwise punishable by such articles. As the punishment of every conceivable offence was provided, any articles made under the act could be no more than an empty formality having no practical effect.

Thus the history of English military law up to 1879 may be divided into three periods, each having a distinct constitutional aspect: (I) prior to 1689, the army, being regarded as so many personal retainers of the sovereign rather than servants of the state, was mainly governed by the will of the sovereign; (2) between 1689 and 1803, the army, being recognised as a permanent force, was governed within the realm by statute and without it by the prerogative of the crown and (3) from 1803 to 1879, it was governed either directly by statute or by the sovereign under an authority derived from and defined and limited by statute. Although in 1879 the power of making Articles of War became in effect inoperative, the sovereign was empowered to make rules of procedure, having the force of law, to regulate the administration of the act in many matters formerly dealt with by the Articles of War. These rules, however, must not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Army Act itself, and must be laid before parliament immediately after they are made. Thus in 1879 the government and discipline of the army became for the first time completely subject either to the direct action or the close supervision of parliament.

A further notable change took place at the same time. The Mutiny Act had been brought into force on each occasion for one year only, in compliance with the constitutional theory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
that the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace, unless with the consent of parliament, is against law. Each session therefore the text of the act had to be passed through both Houses clause by clause and line by line. The Army Act, on the other hand, is a fixed permanent code. But constitutional traditions are fully respected by the insertion in it of a section providing that it shall come into force only by virtue of an annual act of parliament. This annual act recites the illegality of a standing army in time of peace unless with the consent of parliament, and the necessity nevertheless of maintaining a certain number of land forces (exclusive of those serving in India) and a body of royal marine forces on shore, and of keeping them in exact discipline, and it brings into force the Army Act for one year.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Sentence====
Until 1998 mutiny and another offence of failing to suppress or report a mutiny were each punishable with death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;Year=1955&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=2675342&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2675303&amp;showAllAttributes=1&amp;hideCommentary=0&amp;suppressWarning=0&amp;versionNumber=1 Army Act (1955) c.18 Part II Discipline and Trial and Punishment of Military Offences], ''UK Statute Law Database''.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 21(5) of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] completely abolished the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty in the United Kingdom]]. (Prior to this, the death penalty had already been abolished for murder, but it had remained in force for certain military offences and [[treason]], although no executions had been carried out for several decades.) This provision was not required by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], since Protocol 6 of the Convention permitted the death penalty in time of war, and Protocol 13, which prohibits the death penalty for all circumstances, did not then exist. The [[UK government]] introduced section 21(5) as a late amendment in response to [[UK Parliament|parliamentary]] pressure.

===United States===
The [[United States]]' [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] defines mutiny thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Art. 94. (§ 894.) 2004 Mutiny or Sedition.

:(a) Any person subject to this code (chapter) who—
::(1) with intent to usurp or override lawful military authority, refuses, in concert with any other person, to obey orders or otherwise do his duty or creates any violence or disturbance is guilty of mutiny;
::(2) with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of lawful civil authority, creates, in concert with any other person, revolt, violence, or other disturbance against that authority is guilty of sedition;
::(3) fails to do his utmost to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition being committed in his presence, or fails to take all reasonable means to inform his superior commissioned officer or commanding officer of a mutiny or sedition which he knows or has reason to believe is taking place, is guilty of a failure to suppress or report a mutiny or sedition.
:(b) A person who is found guilty of attempted mutiny, mutiny, sedition, or failure to suppress or report a mutiny or sedition shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. military law requires obedience only to lawful orders. Disobedience to unlawful orders (see [[Superior orders]]) is the obligation of every member of the [[U.S. military]], a principle established by the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]] following [[World War II]] and reaffirmed in the aftermath of the [[My Lai Massacre]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. However, a U.S. soldier who disobeys an order after deeming it unlawful will almost certainly be court-martialed to determine whether the disobedience was proper. In addition, simple refusal to obey is not mutiny, which requires collaboration or conspiracy to disobedience.

[[Image:National Defense College of the Philippines in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City.png|thumb|right|National Defense College of the Philippines]]

The '''National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP)''' (Filipino: ''Dalubhasaan ng Tanggulang Pambansa ng Pilipinas'') is an educational, training, and research agency of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] located inside Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]].  It is responsible for providing continued and intensive studies of the diverse problems relating to national defense and security.  It is under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]].

==History==
The National Defense College of the Philippines was first conceived in 1957 when the military advisors of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) proposed the setting-up of a SEATO War College in the [[Philippines]].

There were legislative moves to pass a law creating the National Defense College of the Philippines. In the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Congressman Manuel A. Zosa filed the House Bill No. 1420 in 1970 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines and for other Purposes.” Also in the same year, then Congressman [[Ramon Bagatsing]] filed the House Bill No. 1447 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines, Providing an Academic Board, and for Other Purposes.” In the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], Senator Leonardo B. Perez filed the Senate Bill No. 597 proposing an “Act Creating the National Defense College of the Philippines and for other Purposes.” However, these legislative proposals did not reach third reading because [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dissolved the [[Philippine Congress]].

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] subsequently issued Presidential Decree No. 190 in 1973 to formally create the NDCP to "fulfill the need for an institution that will provide for continuing and intensive studies of the diversified problems related to national defense and security." NDCP was then placed under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Office of the Secretary of National Defense]] in 1974 by virtue of P.D. No. 452.

The Academic and Admission Boards were later established to oversee the academic program of the College. To carry out its teaching function, the NDCP draws top experts from the academe and senior officers with command and staff experiences from the major services of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

Lectures by foreign diplomats, technical experts and defense leaders also complement the instruction at the NDCP. The NDCP has managed to grow beyond its modest beginnings to train leaders in the military and civilian bureaucracy in strategic thinking.

On February 22, 1998, the College moved to its new and modern three-story building in the Academic Row, Camp [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]].

==Master in National Security Administration Program==
The '''Master in National Security Administration''' (MNSA) Program is the main academic program of the NDCP. It is a one-year, full-time master's degree course consisting of 39 units earned through various forms of classroom work, case studies, regional security and development studies and academic enhancement travels.

The MNSA curriculum focuses on the various dimensions of [[national security]] management:
# socio-cultural dimension
# political-legal dimension
# economic dimension
# techno-scientific dimension
# environmental dimension
# military dimension

The MNSA is open to military officers, government officials and private sector leaders. Students write a [[national security]]-oriented thesis. Civilian graduates are commissioned [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s or [[Commander]]s in the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] Reserve Force.

==Strategic Research and Special Studies==
===Institute for National Security Studies===
The '''Institute for National Security Studies (INSS)''' administers the research program of the NDCP. It embodies the College's effort to be the center of excellence in strategic thinking on [[national security]] matters in the [[Philippines]] and in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

===Crisis Management Institute===
The '''Crisis Management Institute (CMI)''', formerly the ''Emergency Management Institute of the Philippines (EMIP)'', is envisioned to be the country's center for education, training, and research on [[crisis management]], [[terrorism]], and other [[transnational crime]]s, and as the premier training resource for technical cooperation in emergency management in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

===Defense Management Institute===
The '''Defense Management Institute (DMI)''', formerly the ''Institute for Extramural and Continuing Studies (IECS)'', is envisioned to be the key training institution on certificate and diploma courses on National Security Administration and to be a recognized training institution in the [[Asia-Pacific]].

==Notable alumni==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">The '''National Infrastructure Protection Plan''' (NIPP)  is a document called for by [[Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7]], which aims to unify Critical Infrastructure and Key Resource (CIKR) protection efforts across the country. The latest version of the plan was produced in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/NIPP%202013_Partnering%20for%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20Security%20and%20Resilience_508_0.pdf | title = National Infrastructure Protection Plan | accessdate = 2014-07-15 | format = PDF | publisher = [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NIPP's goals are to protect [[Critical infrastructure#United States|critical infrastructure]] and key [[resource]]s and ensure resiliency.  It is generally considered unwieldy and not an actual plan to be carried out in an emergency, but it is useful as a mechanism for developing coordination between [[Federal government of the United States|government]] and the [[private sector]].  The NIPP is based on the model laid out in the 1998 Presidential Decision Directive-63, which identified critical sectors of the economy and tasked relevant government agencies to work with them on sharing information and on strengthening responses to attack.

The NIPP is structured to create partnerships between Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) from the public sector and Sector Coordinating Councils(SCC) from the private sector for the eighteen sectors DHS has identified as critical.

The '''Nationalist Galicianist Party''' ('''PGN''' or '''PG(N)''', ''Partido Galeguista Nacionalista'' or ''Partido Galeguista (Nacionalista)'' in [[Galician language]]) was a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] party founded in 1984.

==History==
The PGN was founded in 1984, after the decision of the [[Partido Galeguista (1978)|Partido Galeguista]] (PG) to join the [[Galician Coalition]]. A group of fifty militants led by [[Ramón Martínez López]] and [[Manuel Beiras García]] dissatisfied with the decision decided to organize a new [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] [[political party]]. The party didn't present lists to the [[Galician parliamentary election, 1985|Galician elections of 1985]] or to the [[Spanish general election, 1986|general elections of 1986]]. In the [[European Parliament election, 1987 (Spain)|1986 European Parliament elections]] the party ran in a coalition with the [[Basque Nationalist Party]], called the [[Europeanist Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1987/04/23/espana/546127215_850215.html Los partidos vascos irán a las elecciones europeas en coalición con catalanes y gallegos.] [[El País]], 23/04/1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition gained 5,322 votes in [[Galiza]] (0.43% of the Galician vote).

In 1988 the PGN merged with the [[Galician Nationalist Party|PNG]] form the [[Galician Nationalist Party-Galicianist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pasouoquepasou.crtvg.es/content/fusion-do-partido-nacionalista-galego-e-o-partido-galeguista Fusión do Partido Nacionalista Galego e o Partido Galeguista].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1860">'''Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile''' (OSTIV) is a body associated with the [[FAI Gliding Commission]] (IGC).  The FAI IGC oversees the sport of [[gliding]] worldwide and is a department of the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI).

In 1930 the first international soaring organization, ISTUS, (Internationale Studienkommission für den motorlosen Flug) was formed with the objective of the furtherance of development of soaring in science and technical aspects by "exchanging experience and friendly cooperation among the specialists and pilots of all nations engaged in soaring". This objective was continued after World War II by the formation of OSTIV.

OSTIV's aim is also the furtherance of the technical development of soaring by the sharing of experience by [[List of gliders|glider manufacturers]] and [[glider pilot]]s.  It was formed as the successor of ISTUS on 27 July 1948 at [[Samedan]], [[Switzerland]]. Its sections include the Meterorological Panel, the Sailplane Development Panel and the Training &amp; Safety Panel. It publishes the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Technical Soaring]]''.

OSTIV has the right to send observers to the meetings of the FAI Gliding Commission and vice versa. OSTIV's Congresses generally take place at the same time and place as the [[World Gliding Championships]]. The next meeting will take place&lt;ref&gt;http://ostiv.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Benalla]], Australia from 8 to 13 January 2017.

'''Pauline Hanson's One Nation''' ('''PHON''' or '''ONP''', also '''One Nation''' or '''One Nation Party''') is a [[nationalist]], [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] party in [[Australia]]. One Nation was founded in 1997, by [[Australian Parliament|member of parliament]] [[Pauline Hanson]] and her advisors [[David Ettridge]] and [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] after Hanson was disendorsed as a federal candidate for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. The disendorsement came before the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 federal election]] because of comments she made about [[Indigenous Australians]]. Hanson sat as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] for one year before forming Pauline Hanson's One Nation.

Federally, no One Nation candidate has ever been elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (Hanson was already a member of the House when One Nation was formed). However, one candidate from the party was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], and four One Nation senators were elected in the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]]. In state politics, however, One Nation has performed better. At the [[Queensland state election, 1998|1998 Queensland state election]] the party gained more than 22% of the vote in Queensland's [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|legislative assembly]], winning 11 of the 89 seats. David Oldfield was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] as a One Nation candidate, but he was expelled from the party and later formed the unsuccessful splinter group, [[One Nation NSW]]. Three members were elected to the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].

One Nation changed its name back to "Pauline Hanson's One Nation" in June 2015.

At the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 election]] the party polled 4.3 per cent (+3.8) of the nationwide primary vote in the Senate. Only Queensland polled higher for the party than their nationwide percentage − the party polled 9.2 per cent (+8.6) of the primary vote in that state. [[Pauline Hanson]] (QLD) and three other One Nation candidates − [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] (QLD), [[Brian Burston]] (NSW) and [[Rod Culleton]] (WA) were elected to the Senate. Elected to the [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016|3rd Queensland Senate spot]], as per convention Hanson is serving a six-year term while the three other One Nation Senators who were elected in the last half of spots were appointed to three-year terms. Culleton was stripped of his seat in January 2017 after he was declared bankrupt. In March 2017, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruled that Culleton's election to the Senate was invalid in any event because of a criminal conviction in New South Wales. After a court-ordered recount, Culleton was replaced by the second candidate on the WA list, [[Peter Georgiou]].

The party has a strongly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Conservatism in Australia|conservative]] platform. Hanson and other party members have denied claims that the party is racist. Hanson says that "criticism is not racism" about her statements on immigration and race. Hanson has also said that she enjoys the company of other ethnicities and welcomes people to Australia wherever their origin, but does not want other cultures to overly influence Australia. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Overview==
[[Image:Pauline_Hanson_(438351804)_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|One Nation leader [[Pauline Hanson]].]]
One Nation was formed in 1997 by [[Pauline Hanson]], [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] and [[David Ettridge]]. Hanson was an endorsed Liberal Party candidate for the seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley, Queensland]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 federal election]], but was disendorsed by the party shortly before the elections due to comments she made to a local newspaper in [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], Queensland opposing "race-based welfare".&lt;ref name=ABCONtimeline&gt;{{cite news|author=Uma Patel |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-10/timeline-rise-of-pauline-hanson-one-nation/7583230 |title=Pauline Hanson: One Nation party's resurgence after 20 years of controversy |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldfield, a councillor on [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] Council in suburban [[Sydney]] and at one time an employee of Liberal minister [[Tony Abbott]], was the organisational architect of the party.

The name "One Nation" was chosen to signify belief in national unity, in contrast to a perceived increasing division in Australian society allegedly caused by government policies favouring immigrants and [[Australian Aborigine|indigenous Australians]] at the expense of the white Australian majority. The term "One Nation" was last used in Australian political life to describe a tax reform package in the early 1990s by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] (1991–96), whose culturally-cosmopolitan, Asia-centric (internationalist), free-trade, and pro-[[affirmative action]] policies were completely antithetical to what supporters of the later One Nation party formed in the late 1990s stood for.

Arguing that other political parties were out of touch with mainstream Australia, One Nation ran on a broadly populist and protectionist platform. It promised to drastically reduce immigration and to abolish "divisive and discriminatory policies&amp;nbsp;... attached to Aboriginal and multicultural affairs." Condemning multiculturalism as a "threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values", One Nation rallied against liberal government immigration and multicultural policies which, it argued, were leading to "the Asianisation of Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malcolm Farnsworth |url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |title=One Nation's Immigration, Population and Social Cohesion Policy 1998 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=19 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702185221/http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |archivedate=2 July 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also denounced [[economic rationalism]] and [[globalisation]], reflecting working-class dissatisfaction with the neo-liberal economic policies embraced by the major parties. Adopting strong [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies, One Nation advocated the restoration of import [[tariffs]], a revival of Australia's [[manufacturing]] industry, and an increase in support for small business and the rural sector.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, P. 1998. Full Circle. ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', 13 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Nation became subject to a political campaign by Tony Abbott, who established a trust fund called "Australians for Honest Politics Trust" to help bankroll civil court cases against the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/02/1062403506222.html |title=AEC defends handling of Abbott slush fund - National |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2 September 2003 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused of offering funds to One Nation dissident Terry Sharples to support his court battle against the party. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the [[Howard Government]] was "a very big factor" in his decision to pursue the legal attack, but he also claimed to be acting "in Australia's national interest".

The party's greatest appeal was in country areas of [[New South Wales]] and Queensland, the traditional heartlands of the junior partner in the [[Coalition (Australia)|non-Labor Coalition]], the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]]. Indeed, for much of 1997 and 1998, it appeared that One Nation would pass the Nationals.

The party has been involved in [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]],&lt;ref name="bdeo"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300 |title=Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland |author=Trevor Bormann |accessdate=12 June 2014 |date=5 September 2013 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aomp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/archive/federal-election/alliance-of-micro-parties-boosts-odds-for-likes-of-one-nation-or-shooters-and-fishers-gaining-senate-spot-through-preferences/story-fnho52jp-1226713114765 |title=Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences  |author=Alicia Wood |accessdate=12 June 2014 |date=5 September 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Druery claiming that he has been [[white-anting]] One Nation since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='My hand on their electoral throat': Druery on One Nation vendetta |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-04/preference-whisperer-glenn-druery-one-nation-micro-party-deals/8415276|accessdate=5 April 2017|publisher=ABC News|date=4 April 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral performance==
One Nation achieved its peak of support in the [[Queensland state election, 1998|1998 Queensland state election]], at which the party won 22.7% of the vote, behind only Labor. In terms of first-preference votes, One Nation received more than either the Liberals or Nationals; its vote share was high enough to render any attempt to calculate a [[two-party preferred vote]] meaningless. However, since One Nation's vote was spread out across the state, this was only good enough for fourth place in the legislature (behind Labor, the Liberals and Nationals), with 11 of the 89 seats.  This was still enough to deny Labor a majority, as seven of One Nation's seats would have gone to Labor if not for leakage of Coalition preferences. Subsequently, the One Nation contingent in the Queensland Parliament split, with dissident members forming the rival [[City Country Alliance|City-Country Alliance]] in late 1999.&lt;ref name="apg"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States and Territories |last=Wanna |first=John |editor-first=Campbell |editor-last=Moon |editor2-first=Jeremy |editor2-last=Sharman |chapter=Queensland |year=2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0521825075 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37Sel9HEYgUC |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], Hanson contested the new seat of [[Division of Blair|Blair]] after a redistribution effectively split Oxley in half. Hanson lost to [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate [[Cameron Thompson]], and the One Nation candidate in Oxley lost the seat to ALP candidate [[Bernie Ripoll]], but One Nation candidate [[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]] was elected as a senator for Queensland. Hill's eligibility to sit as a senator was successfully challenged (see [[Sue v Hill]] for information on the case) under the [[Australian Constitution]] on the basis that she had failed to renounce her childhood British citizenship, despite being a naturalised Australian citizen. The seat went to the party's [[Len Harris (politician)|Len Harris]] following a recount.

At the [[New South Wales state election, 1999|1999 New South Wales election]], [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]].

In the [[Queensland state election, 2001|2001 Queensland state election]], One Nation won three seats and 8.69% of the primary vote. The City-Country Alliance lost all of its seats, and faded into irrelevance soon afterward.

At the [[Western Australian state election, 2001|2001 state election in Western Australia]], One Nation won three seats in the state's Legislative Council. One Nation did not win any seats in state elections in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] or [[Tasmania]] in the following year.

At the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 federal election]], the party's vote fell from 9% to 5.5%. Hanson failed in her bid to win a Senate seat from Queensland, despite polling a strong 10% of the primary vote. Hanson failed to win a seat in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] at the 2003 state election, where she ran as an independent, with the support of the One Nation party. She polled less than 2% of the vote and withdrew from the party's leadership.

==Internal disputes and initial decline 1998–2012==
Since the 1997 peak, One Nation has been plagued by internal divisions and has split several times. Lawsuits involving ex-members forced Hanson to repay approximately [[A$]]500,000 of public funding won at the 1998 Queensland election amid claims that the party was fraudulently registered. The suits alleged that the party was undemocratically constituted in order to concentrate all power in the hands of three people—Hanson, Ettridge and Oldfield (in particular Oldfield)—and that it technically had only two members: Ettridge and Hanson. Even though Hanson's fraud charges were dropped, the Electoral Commission of Queensland never reimbursed Hanson for the monies that they collected from the claim.

The first Annual General Meeting of the One Nation party was held in April 1999, which critic Paul Reynolds said demonstrated that One Nation lacked organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rutherford|first1=Jennifer|title=One Love Too Many: The Undoing of Pauline Hanson|journal=[[Australian Journal of Politics and History]]|date=June 2001|volume=47|issue=2|pages=192–208|doi=10.1111/1467-8497.00227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, Hanson expelled Oldfield from the party. Oldfield had been accused of abusing his authority, usurping power, and setting up alternative political parties under his control.{{clarify|date=September 2015}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} His expulsion created even more instability in a party which was constantly embroiled in scandal and internal strife. Oldfield engineered a split within the party, creating [[One Nation NSW]], in 2001. The new party took advantage of electoral party registration laws to register itself as a political party under the 'One Nation' name with the NSW electoral commission, and achieved registration in April 2002. This meant that the original One Nation party was unable to gain registration for NSW elections, and that any candidates which that party chose to represent them at state elections could not use the party name. Consequently, the original One Nation could only contest Federal elections in NSW under the 'One Nation' banner, whilst the Oldfield group could present itself as 'One Nation' only at state elections.

Disendorsed One Nation candidate [[Terry Sharples]] accused the party of not having the 500 members needed for registration, and called for the party to be deregistered, which was carried by the Supreme Court. Hanson appealed the verdict but was unsuccessful. Hanson and Ettridge were later charged with electoral fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/research-and-publications/publications/misconduct/the-prosecution-of-pauline-hanson-and-david-ettridge-a-report-on-an-inquiry-into-issues-raised-in-a-resolution-of-parliament.pdf |title=The prosecution of Pauline Hanson and David Ettridge: a report on an inquiry into issues raised in a resolution of Parliament |format=PDF |date=January 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2017 |ISBN=1 876986 21 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Queensland state election, 2004|2004 Queensland election]], One Nation polled less than 5% of the vote and its sole elected representative, [[Rosa Lee Long]], acted as an independent. One Nation attempted to defend its Queensland Senate seat at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], but lost it (effectively to the National Party). Len Harris's Senate term expired on 30 June 2005.

On 8 February 2005, One Nation lost federal party status but was re-registered in time for the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. It still had state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. Subsequently, it created another state party in Western Australia. In the February 2005 [[Western Australian state election, 2005|Western Australian election]], the One Nation vote collapsed.

In the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 South Australian state election]], six One Nation candidates stood for the lower house. Their highest levels of the primary vote was 4.1% in the district of [[electoral district of Hammond|Hammond]] and 2.7% in [[electoral district of Goyder|Goyder]], with the other four hovering around 1%. They attracted 0.8% (7559 votes) of the upper house vote. One Nation consequently won no seats in that election.

In the [[Queensland state election, 2006|2006 Queensland state election]], the party contested four of 89 seats, and its vote collapsed. It suffered a swing of 4.3% to be left with just 0.6% of the vote. Its only remaining seat in the state (and country), [[Electoral district of Tablelands|Tablelands]], was retained with an increased majority by [[Rosa Lee Long]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/qld/2006/results/tabl.htm 2006 Queensland Election. Electorate Results]. Election Results. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved 12 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Tablelands was abolished prior to the [[Queensland state election, 2009|2009 Queensland state election]], with Lee Long failing to win the seat of [[Electoral district of Dalrymple|Dalrymple]].

In the [[Queensland state election, 2012|2012 Queensland state election]] the party unsuccessfully contested six seats. The party received only 2,525 first preference votes (representing 0.1% of the total cast) across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 State General Election – Election Summary|url=http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/state/State2012/results/summary.html#16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321083632/http://ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/state/State2012/results/summary.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 March 2012|publisher=Electoral Commission Queensland|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
During its original period of popularity, One Nation had a major impact on Australian politics. The primary effect at state and federal levels was to split the conservative vote and threaten the National Party's support base.&lt;ref name="apg" /&gt; The appeal of its policies to the National Party's constituency put great pressure on that party. The rapid rise of the party revealed a substantial number of discontented voters dissatisfied with the major parties.

In the prologue to her autobiography ''Untamed and Unashamed'', Hanson cites the Howard government's adoption of her policies as an attempt to win back One Nation voters to the Liberal and National parties, stating "the very same policies I advocated back then&amp;nbsp;... are being advocated today by the federal government".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Pauline. ''Untamed and Unashamed'', JoJo Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-9802836-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hanson's return, re-election as leader==

In 2013, Pauline Hanson rejoined One Nation as a [[wikt:rank and file|rank-and-file]] member, until she unsuccessfully contested the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] for [[New South Wales]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election.]]

Hanson was returned as leader by the One Nation executive in November 2014, following encouragement from One Nation members and support from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-19/pauline-hanson-returns-to-one-nation-helm/5902080|title=Pauline Hanson returns to lead One Nation, plans to contest Queensland election|last=Agius|first=Kym|date=23 November 2014|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She contested the seat of [[Electoral district of Lockyer|Lockyer]] for the party at the January [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015 Queensland state election]], falling only 114 votes short of defeating sitting [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] member [[Ian Rickuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland-state-election-2015/pauline-hanson-misses-out-on-seat-of-lockyer-after-bid-for-recount-rejected/story-fnr8vuu5-1227217793508|title=Pauline Hanson misses out on seat of Lockyer after bid for recount rejected|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|last=Killoran|first=Matthew|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Hanson announced that the party was renamed the original "Pauline Hanson's One Nation" and contested in the Senate for Queensland at the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onenation.com.au/hot-topics/hanson-kicks-off-her-fed-up-tour-tomorrow |title=Hanson Kicks Off her 'Fed Up' Tour Tomorrow |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=25 July 2015 |accessdate=19 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725122658/http://www.onenation.com.au/hot-topics/hanson-kicks-off-her-fed-up-tour-tomorrow |archivedate=25 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 federal comeback==

{{see also|Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016}}
When [[Candidates of the Australian federal election, 2016|candidate nominations]] were announced by the Australian Electoral Commission, the party nominated Senate candidates in all states, 12 candidates for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in Queensland and three in New South Wales.&lt;ref name="2016candidates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm |title=Candidates for the 2016 federal election |date=12 June 2016 |access-date=12 June 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pauline Hanson arranged a "Fed Up" tour that began in July 2015 as part of her re-election campaign, flying in a private plane to Rockhampton prior to a [[Reclaim Australia]] rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pauline Hanson's plane to take flight for Fed Up tour|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/pauline-hansons-plane-to-take-flight-for-fed-up-tour-20150716-gidexh.html|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=Brisbane Times|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; piloted by [[James Ashby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Ashby joins Pauline Hanson's entourage, as her pilot|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2015/07/28/4282015.htm|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=ABC Sunshine &amp; Cooloola Coasts Qld|date=28 July 2015|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 election]] the party polled 4.3 per cent (+3.8) of the nationwide primary vote in the Senate. Only Queensland polled higher for the party than their nationwide percentage − the party polled 9.2 per cent (+8.6) of the primary vote in that state. Assisted by halved Senate [[Droop quota|quotas]] at the [[double dissolution]] election, [[Pauline Hanson]] (QLD) and three other One Nation candidates − [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] (QLD), [[Brian Burston]] (NSW) and [[Rod Culleton]] (WA) − were elected to the Senate. Elected to the [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016|3rd Queensland Senate spot]], as per convention Hanson is serving a six-year term while the three other One Nation Senators who were elected in the last half of spots are serving three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Federal Politics |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/coalition-and-labor-team-up-to-clear-out-crossbench-senators-in-2019-20160812-gqr29k.html |title=Coalition and Labor team up to clear out crossbench senators in 2019: SMH 12 August 2016 |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=12 August 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Nick Xenophon Team]], One Nation now holds the balance of power in the Australian Parliament - no bill opposed by [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] can pass the Senate without the support of at least two One Nation Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/the-outcome-nobody-expected-one-nation-becomes-pivotal-force-in-australian-politics-20160804-gqkzf1.html|date=4 August 2016|title=The outcome 'nobody expected': One Nation becomes pivotal force in Australian politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest result in the House of Representatives was 20.9 per cent of the primary vote in [[Division of Wright|Wright]] (QLD).

On 18 December 2016 [[Rod Culleton]] (WA) left the party after months of legal troubles and party infighting to sit as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] bringing the number of party senators to 3.  Party leader [[Pauline Hanson]] responded that Culleton was a "pain in the backside" and that she was "glad to see the back of him".&lt;ref name="resignation"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knott |first1=Matthew |title='I'm glad to see the back of him': Rod Culleton resigns from Pauline Hanson's One Nation party |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/rod-culleton-resigns-from-pauline-hansons-one-nation-party-20161218-gtdr5j.html |accessdate=18 December 2016 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-18/one-nation-senator-rod-culleton-resigns-from-party/8130848 |title=One Nation senator Rod Culleton resigns from party |work=ABC News |date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 3 February 2017, the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that Culleton's election was invalid due to a conviction for which he was subject to being sentenced at the time of the election, notwithstanding that the conviction was subsequently annulled.  The resulting vacancy was filled by a [[Election recount|recount]] of the votes at the [[Australian federal election, 2016|election]], which resulted in [[Peter Georgiou]] taking the seat and returning the One Nation representation in the Senate to four.

[[Ian McAllister (political scientist)|Ian McAllister]] regards the current version of One Nation to not have much in the way of policy other than an "anti-establishment stance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marr|first1=David|title=Looking back, and angry: what drives Pauline Hanson's voters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/27/looking-back-and-angry-what-drives-pauline-hansons-voters|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=The Guardian Australia|date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Western Australian state election, 2017]], several One Nation candidates either quit or were disendorsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|title='Log off, it's over': One Nation orders candidates back to reality after WA election|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/18/log-off-its-over-one-nation-orders-candidates-back-to-reality-after-western-australia-election|accessdate=25 March 2017|work=The Guardian Australia|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dane Sorensen provided a copy of the party's Western Australian "candidate agreement" form for this election, which all candidates had to sign.

The tape showed that Ashby had supported charging One Nation candidates inflated prices for campaign materials. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-22/ashby-will-bring-hanson-down-in-flames-former-candidate-says/8547994 |title=James Ashby will bring Pauline Hanson 'down in flames', former candidate says |publisher=ABC News |date=22 May 2017 |accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/05/22/07/35/hanson-chief-s-recording-shocking-hinch |title=Leaked recording of One Nation meeting could spark federal investigation |publisher=9news.com.au |date=22 May 2017 |accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2017 the full High Court, as Court of Disputed Returns, ruled that [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] had been ineligible to be elected to the Parliament.

On 13 November 2017 Senator [[Fraser Anning]] took [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]]' position after a recount in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. However, the same day, Senator Anning left the party and became an [[Independent politician|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-13/hanson-says-anning-has-abandoned-one-nation/9144142|title=Hanson says newest senator Fraser Anning has abandoned One Nation|date=2017-11-13|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2018 Hanson announced that One Nation will Back the Turnbull Governments corporate tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-22/pauline-hanson-strikes-deal-on-company-tax-cuts/9576930 |title=One Nation to back company tax cuts in exchange for funding for 1,000 apprentices |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2018-03-22 |accessdate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/pauline-hanson-backs-corporate-tax-cuts/news-story/813cd47c3c084ac01e6611aa29d02aeb |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322082454/http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/pauline-hanson-backs-corporate-tax-cuts/news-story/813cd47c3c084ac01e6611aa29d02aeb |archive-date=22 March 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/mar/22/coalition-labor-greens-company-tax-cuts-senate-marine-parks-politics-live |title=Pauline Hanson's One Nation says it will back Coalition's corporate tax cuts – as it happened |publisher=The Guardian |date=2018-03-22 |accessdate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2018 Senator Brian Burston announced his resignation from the party to sit as an independent, following a month-long clash with Pauline Hanson centred around the Turnbull Government's corporate tax cuts, on which Hanson had reversed her position. This reduced the party to two senators, with Hanson remaining the only member of One Nation elected at the 2016 Federal election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/brian-burston-quits-one-nation-and-hanson-loses-senate-balance-of-power|title=Brian Burston quits One Nation – and Hanson loses Senate balance of power|first=Amy|last=Remeikis|date=13 June 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October, a Senate motion brought by the party stating "it is OK to be white" was defeated 31-28 in a vote. The government expressed regret at the support the vote received, blaming it in an administrative error in which its senators were mistakenly instructed to vote positively. Critics noted that the phrase "it's OK to be white" has been associated with white supremacist rhetoric. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45871407|title='Anti-white' racism: Australia senators blame 'error' for vote|author=&lt;!-- No byline, staff writers --&gt;|date=16 October 2018|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaders==
Unlike the Queensland State Leadership, the changes of the Federal Leadership of the party were largely undocumented (besides the Hanson terms), due to low media attention and confusion of the name of office titles within the party. This list comprises the leaders, most definite, of the party.

'''Progressive war'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Caleb Carr|Caleb, Carr]] (2002). ''The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians: Why It Has Always Failed and Why It Will Fail Again''. Random House, Inc. {{ISBN|0-375-50843-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[military strategy]] in which only enemy [[combatants]] are targeted, and [[non-combatants]] killed or wounded by [[collateral damage]] are kept to a minimum. Its principles were established by Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]], who is considered to be a founder of [[international law]], in his book ''[[De jure belli ac pacis libri tres]]'' ("On the Law of War and Peace: Three Books"), published in 1625. A successful practitioner was [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]], as chief of staff of the [[Prussian Army]] in the 19th century.

The opposite of progressive war is  unlimited war, which includes [[civilians]] as legitimate targets. Unlimited war uses military action against civilians, in the hope of undermining the will to fight by the people and their leaders so that they end their resistance. Examples of unlimited war are [[cluster bomb]]s, the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], the German bombing of British cities during [[the Blitz]], the [[firebombing of Tokyo]] and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

The philosophy of unlimited war is controversial. Many consider it a form of [[terrorism]] in the sense of deliberately attacking noncombatants in the hope of changing their mindset. Such ambiguities between unlimited warfare and terrorist strategies could be the source of why many terrorist groups consider themselves honourable fighters, and many consider the [[US military]] to be terrorists.

[[Guerrilla warfare]] can be considered progressive if it is only enemy combatants that are targeted, but it becomes terrorism when noncombatants are targeted.{{according to whom|date=January 2018}}

'''Project Genoa II''' was a software project that originated with [[DARPA]]'s [[Information Awareness Office]] and the successor to the [[Project Genoa|Genoa]] program. Originally part of DARPA's [[Total Information Awareness]], it was later renamed '''Topsail''' and handed over to [[Disruptive Technology Office|ARDA]] for further development.

1. Cognitive aids that allow humans and machines to "think together" in real-time about complicated problems;

2. Means to overcome the biases and limitations of the human cognitive system;

3. "Cognitive amplifiers" that help teams of people rapidly and fully comprehend complicated and uncertain situations; and,

In 2002, Tom Armour, a veteran of the Genoa project, was selected by [[John Poindexter]] to be the director of the new Genoa II program, a component of [[Total Information Awareness]] (TIA) effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/poindexter.html| title = OVERVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AWARENESS OFFICE  | last = Poindexter| first = John| date = 2 August 2002| website = fas.org| publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]]| access-date = 3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned under the cost of $54 million.&lt;ref name= computerworld/&gt;

In late 2003 TIA was officially shut down by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] due to unfavorable views from the public. Most of its research was salvaged and its components were transferred to other government agencies for development. Genoa II was renamed ''Topsail'' and handed over to the [[National Security Agency]]'s [[Advanced Research and Development Activity]] division for further work.&lt;ref name= donohue&gt;{{cite book| last = Donohue| first = Laura K.| title = The Cost of Counterterrorism: Power, Politics, and Liberty| publisher = Cambridge University Press| date = 14 April 2008| pages = 258| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QpVVPtzu1LUC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781139469579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, the [[Science Applications International Corporation]] signed a $3.7 million contract for work on Topsail.&lt;ref name= harris&gt;{{cite book| last = Harris| first = Shane| title = The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State| publisher = Penguin| edition = reprint| date = 18 February 2010| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kGEMwv0VHL4C&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781101195741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools from the program were utilized in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|war in Afghanistan]] and in other efforts as part of the [[War on Terror]].

In early 2006 a spokesman for the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] said that Topsail was "in the process of being canceled due to lack of funds." When inquired about Topsail in a [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate Intelligence Committee]] hearing that February, both [[National Intelligence Director]] [[John Negroponte]] and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] said they didn't know about the program's status. Negroponte's deputy, former [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA Director]] [[Michael V. Hayden]] said, "I'd like to answer in closed session."&lt;ref name= harris2&gt;[http://shaneharris.com/magazinestories/tia-lives-on/ TIA Lives On], ''[[National Journal]]'', 23 February 2006, retrieved 14 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proscription''' ({{lang-la|proscriptio}}) is, in current usage, a "decree of condemnation to death or banishment" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary (OED)]]'') and can be used in a political context to refer to state-approved murder or banishment. The term originated in [[Ancient Rome]], where it included public identification and official condemnation of declared [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Frank N.

In addition to its recurrences during the various phases of the [[Roman Republic]], it has become a standard term to label:

== Proscription in ancient Rome ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017|talk=|small=}}

=== Origin ===
Proscriptions (Latin ''proscriptio'', plural ''proscriptiones'') initially meant public advertisements or notices signifying property or goods for sale.

During the dictatorial reign of [[Sulla]], the word took on a more sinister meaning. In 82 or 81 BC, Sulla instituted the process of proscription in order to avenge the massacres of [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Gaius Marius the Younger|his son]]. He instituted a notice for the sale of confiscated property belonging to those declared public enemies of the state (modern historians estimate about 520 people were proscribed as opposed to the ancient estimate of 4,700 people) and therefore condemned to death those proscribed, called ''proscripti'' in Latin.

=== Proscription and treason ===
There were multiple reasons why the ancient Roman government may have desired to proscribe or attribute multiple other forms of pain. One of the most prevalent reasons for punishment are treason crimes, also known as [[Law of majestas|lex maiestatis]]. Treason crimes consisted of a very broad and large number of regulations, and such crimes had a negative effect on the government. This list includes, but is not limited to: assisting an enemy in any way, [[Lèse-majesté|Crimen Laesae Majestasis]], acts of subversion and usurpation, offense against the peace of the state, offenses against the administration of justice, and violating absolute duties. Overall, crimes in which the state, emperor, the state’s tranquility, or offenses against the good of the people would be considered treason, and, therefore, would constitute proscription. Some of these regulations are understandable and comparable to safety laws within the United States today; however, others, like violating absolute duties, could very easily be accidents or circumstantial crises that would deserve punishment regardless.

Punishments for treason were quite harsh by today’s standards and were meant to highlight the seriousness and shamefulness of the treason crimes committed. There were a variety of punishments for capital crimes, including death, loss of a freedman’s status, loss of citizenship with a loss of family rights, and a loss of family rights only. Death was a very common punishment and was referred to as [[Summa supplicia|''summum supplicium'']], or the "extreme penalty". The death sentence was often the punishment for all but the mildest forms of treason. [[Julius Caesar]] was an influential framer of the law on [[treason]]. The Interdiction from Water and Fire was a civil excommunication resulting in ultimate exile, which included forfeiture of citizenship and forfeiture of property. Those who were condemned would be deported to an island. Emperor [[Augustus]] frequently utilized this method of exile, as he desired to keep banished men from banding together in large groups. Such punishment was given for only the mildest forms of treason, in comparison to the death penalty, which served for most other treason crimes. Augustus also created the [[prefect]], whose powers included the ability to banish, deport, or send to the mines. The prefect also heard appeals.

=== Proscription of Sulla in 82 BC ===
An early instance of mass proscription took place in 82 BC, when [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] was appointed ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Res publica|rei publicae]] constituendae'' ("Dictator for the Reconstitution of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]"). Sulla proceeded to have the Senate draw up a list of those he considered enemies of the state and published the list in the [[Roman Forum]]. Any man whose name appeared on the list was ''[[ipso facto]]'' stripped of his citizenship and excluded from all protection under law; [[Bounty (reward)|reward money]] was given to any informer who gave information leading to the death of a proscribed man, and any person who killed a proscribed man was entitled to keep part of his estate (the remainder went to the state). No person could inherit money or property from proscribed men, nor could any woman married to a proscribed man remarry after his death. Many victims of proscription were decapitated and their heads were displayed on spears in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]].

Sulla used proscription to restore the depleted [[Aerarium|Roman Treasury (''Aerarium'')]], which had been drained by costly civil and foreign wars in the preceding decade, and to eliminate enemies (both real and potential) of his reformed state and constitutions; the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] knights of the [[Equestrian order|Ordo Equester]] were particularly hard-hit. Giving the procedure a particularly sinister character in the public eye was the fact that many of the proscribed men, escorted from their homes at night by groups of men all named "Lucius Cornelius", never appeared again. (These men were all Sulla's freedmen.) This gave rise to a general fear of being taken from one's home at night as a consequence of any outwardly seditious behaviour.

Sulla's proscription was bureaucratically overseen, and the names of informers and those who profited from killing proscribed men were entered into the public record. Because Roman law could criminalise acts ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'', many informers and profiteers were later prosecuted.

The proscription of 82 BC was overseen by Sulla's [[freedman]] steward [[Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus]], and was rife with corruption.

The proscription lists created by Sulla led to mass terror in [[Rome]]. During this time, "the cities of Italy became theaters of execution." Citizens were terrified to find their names on the lists. Those whose names were listed were ultimately sentenced to death. The executions were brutal and consisted of beheading. Often, the heads were then put on display for the city to see. The bodies of the condemned were often mutilated and dragged before being thrown into the [[Tiber|Tiber River]]. Additionally, those who were condemned lost rights even after their brutal death. Those killed were denied the right to a funeral, and all of their possessions were auctioned off, often to the ones who killed them. Negative consequences arose for anyone that chose to assist those on the list, despite not being listed on the proscribed lists themselves. Anyone who was found guilty of assisting the condemned was [[Capital punishment|capitally punished]].

Families were also punished as a result of being related to one of the proscribed. It was forbidden to mourn the death of a proscribed person. According to [[Plutarch]], the greatest injustice of all the consequences was stripping the rights of their children and grandchildren. While those proscribed and their loved ones faced harsh consequences, the people who assisted the government by killing any person on the proscription list were actually rewarded.

===Proscription of 43 BC===
The proscription of 43 BC was the second major proscription. It began with an agreement in November 43 between the triumvirs [[Augustus|Octavian Caesar]], [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] after two long meetings. Their aim was to avenge [[Julius Caesar]]’s assassination, eliminate political enemies, and acquire their properties. The proscription was aimed at Julius Caesar’s conspirators, such as [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], and other individuals who had taken part in the civil war, including wealthy people, senators, knights, and republicans such as [[Sextus Pompey]] and [[Cicero]]. There were 2,000 names on the list in total, and a handsome reward of 2,500 [[Greek drachma|drachmae]] for bringing back the head of a free person on the list (a slave's head was worth 1,000 drachmae); the same rewards were given to anyone who gave information on where someone on the list was hiding. Anyone who tried to save people on the list was added to the list. The material belongings of the dead victims were to be confiscated. Some of the listed were stripped of their property but protected from death by their relatives in the Triumvirate (''e.g.'', [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]]' brother). Most, however, were killed, in some cases gruesomely. [[Cicero]], his younger brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] (one of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[legatus|legates]]) and [[Marcus Favonius]] were all killed in the proscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html|title=Roman History, Books 46-50 (Loeb Classical Library, Vol. V)|last=Dio|first=Cassius|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=[Earnest Cary, Trans.]|year=1917|isbn=9780674990913|location=Cambridge, MA|section=XLVII|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's head and hands were famously cut off and fastened to the [[Rostra]].

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The nine [[provinces of South Africa]] are governed by '''provincial governments''' which form the second layer of government, between the [[Government of South Africa|national government]] and the [[Municipalities of South Africa|municipalities]]. The provincial governments are established, and their structure defined, by [[Chapter Six of the Constitution of South Africa|Chapter Six]] of the [[Constitution of South Africa]].

The provincial governments are structured according to a [[parliamentary system]] in which the executive is dependent on and accountable to the legislature. In each province the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]] is directly elected by [[proportional representation]], and the legislature in turn elects one of its members as [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] to head the executive. The Premier appoints an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] (a cabinet), consisting of members of the legislature, to administer the various [[government department|departments]] of the provincial administration.

The powers of the provincial governments are circumscribed by the national constitution, which limits them to certain listed "functional areas". In some areas the provincial governments' powers are concurrent with those of the national government, while in other areas the provincial governments have exclusive powers. The constitution prescribes a principle of "co-operative government" whereby the various layers of government must co-ordinate their actions and legislation; it also lays down a series of rules for resolving conflicts between national and provincial legislation.

==Legislature==
[[File:Johannesburg City Hall.jpg|thumb|Johannesburg City Hall, now the seat of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature]]
{{main|Provincial legislature (South Africa)}}
Each province has a [[unicameral]] provincial legislature, varying in size from 30 to 80 members depending on the population of the province. The members of the provincial legislature are elected by [[party-list proportional representation]] for a usual term of five years, although under certain circumstances the legislature may be dissolved before its term expires. By convention elections to the provincial legislatures are held on the same day as elections to the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]]; [[South African general election, 2014|the most recent such election]] was held on 7 May 2014. At that election the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) won a majority in eight of the provinces, while the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) won a majority in the Western Cape.

==Executive==
[[File:Western Cape provincial building.jpg|thumb|7 Wale Street, the seat of the Western Cape provincial government]]
{{main|Premier (South Africa)|Executive Council (South Africa)}}
The head of the provincial executive is the [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]], who is elected by the provincial legislature from amongst its members; frequently the Premier will be the provincial leader of the majority party. The term of office of the Premier is the same as that of the legislature (normally five years) with a [[term limit]] of two terms. The legislature can force the resignation of the Premier by a [[motion of no confidence]]. If the Premiership is vacant and the legislature fails to elect a new Premier within 30 days, the legislature is dissolved and an election is called.

{{Asof|May 2014}} the nine Premiers are:
* [[Premier of the Eastern Cape]]: [[Phumulo Masualle]] ([[African National Congress|ANC]])
* [[Premier of the Free State]]: [[Ace Magashule]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of Gauteng]]: [[David Makhura]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of KwaZulu-Natal]]: [[Senzo Mchunu]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of Limpopo]]: [[Stanley Mathabatha]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of Mpumalanga]]: [[David Mabuza]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of North West]]: [[Supra Mahumapelo]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of the Northern Cape]]: [[Sylvia Lucas]] (ANC)
* [[Premier of the Western Cape]]: [[Helen Zille]] ([[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|DA]])

The Premier appoints an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] (a cabinet) of five to ten members of the provincial legislature. The Members of the Executive Council (or MECs) are responsible for the various [[government department|departments]] of the provincial administration. Because the responsibilities of the provincial governments are limited to those listed in the constitution, the portfolios are quite similar across the provinces. Common MEC portfolios and departmental responsibilities include:
* agriculture
* arts and culture
* [[economic development]]
* education
* [[environmental policy|environmental affairs]]
* [[public finance|finance]]
* [[healthcare|health]]
* [[housing policy|human settlements]]
* local government
* police or [[public safety]]
* [[public works]]
* roads and transport
* [[social welfare|social development]]
* [[sport]] and [[recreation]]
* tourism
Several of these areas may be combined in one department and the portfolio of one MEC.

==Judiciary==
{{see also|High Courts of South Africa}}
South Africa has a single national court system, and the administration of justice is the responsibility of the national government. At present the jurisdictional boundaries of the [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] do not correspond entirely with the provincial boundaries; the Superior Courts Bill currently before Parliament will rationalise the courts so that there is a single High Court division in each province.

The provincial executive does play a role in the selection of High Court judges, as the Premier of a province is ''ex officio'' a member of the [[Judicial Service Commission (South Africa)|Judicial Service Commission]] when it deals with matters relating to a High Court that sits in that province.

==Provincial constitutions==
A provincial legislature can, by a two-thirds majority vote, adopt a constitution for the province; it is not necessary to do so, as the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]] provides a complete structure for provincial government. A provincial constitution must be consistent with the national constitution except that it can provide for different structures and procedures for the executive and the legislature.

The only province that has adopted a constitution is the [[Western Cape]]; in doing so it chose to rename its legislature the Provincial Parliament. It also calls its Executive Council the Provincial Cabinet, and the MECs are called Provincial Ministers.

'''Reformist Centre''', or '''Reformist centre''', is a political term used in various countries around the world to define various kinds of political thought, but always connected with the centre, moderation and [[social progressivism|social reformism]].

==Use of Reformist Centre by the Spanish People's Party==
The [[Spanish People's Party]] is the main political force to use the term Reformist centre.
Reformist Centre is used by the People's Party for defining itself ideologically since the second half of the 1990s, with the intention of including all the ideologies that it affirms to have in its middle: right, conservatism, Christian democracy, and liberalism.

According to the article 2 (Ideology), of the status of the People's Party:

The People's Party defines itself as a political formation of the reformist centre to the service of the general interests of Spain, which has the person as the axis of its political action and social progress as one of its objectives. With clear European vocation and inspiration in the values of freedom, democracy, tolerance and Christian humanism of western tradition, [it] defends the rights of the human being and its inherent rights and liberties; it secures democracy and the rule of law as the basis of social living and coexistence in freedom; it promotes, inside a market economy, territorial solidarity, modernisation and social cohesion as well as equal opportunity and the lead role of society through the participation of the citizens in political life; it advocates for an international community founded in peace and universal respect of the human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/resources/archivos/2008/11/10/1226350131083ESTATUTOS%20PP%20XVI%20CONGRESO.pdf Estatutos del XVI Congreso (Statutes of the 16th Congress)] (''Spanish''), page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

This move on Aznar to use this term is frequently accused of simple marketing of ideas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SRDGPG Charlemagne, Jose Maria Aznar, Spain’s blinkered prime minister, Sep 13th 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; use of an ambiguous term or of being just a right-wing/centre-right answer to [[social democrat]]/[[social liberal]] [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]], trying to give a new moderate and centrist image to the rightist PP, without actually moving it to the centre ([[Javier Arenas (Spanish politician)|Javier Arenas]] described their claim to being centre as '(...) nor equidistance between right and left, nor the intermediate zone between liberalism and extreme socialism. It is an attitude of openness contrary to sectarianism'),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddobTbKHAAIC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Reformist+centre%22+%2B+%22Third+Way%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Reformist%20centre%22%20%2B%20%22Third%20Way%22&amp;f=false The politics of contemporary Spain, Sebastián Balfour, p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of an actual re-ideologisation, adopting some Christian democratic concepts (even inspiring its 1989 program on the [[European People's Party|EPP]]'s program) without actually adopting the ideology,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QJ6x8zmRAaEC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Reformist+centre%22+%2B+%22Spanish+People%27s+Party%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Reformist%20centre%22%20%2B%20%22Spanish%20People's%20Party%22&amp;f=false Christian democratic parties in Europe since the end of the Cold War, Steven Van Hecke, Emmanuel Gerard, p. 52]&lt;/ref&gt; not losing votes from other ideologies in the party.

Similar steps taken by the party include the adoption by the party, since 1996, of [[socialist]] [[Spanish II Republic|II Republic]] politician [[Manuel Azaña]]'s legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es/preview/1994/08/16/pagina-3/34386438/pdf.html España e los Hispanistas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://batiburrillo.redliberal.com/005634.html Batiburrillo: Manuel Azaña, enemigo número uno del liberalismo en la II República, Octubre 26, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use elsewhere==
The term is also used elsewhere, not always in a way synonym to the PP's:
*The [[Andorra]]n [[Reformist Coalition]] (of which the [[New Centre (Andorra)|New Centre]] is a member), also claimed to follow reformist centre politics&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Coalición Reformista|Coalición Reformista - wikipédia, la enciclopédia libre]]&lt;/ref&gt; (it may be seen as a clear influence of the People's Party as Andorra is a neighbour and is culturally very connected to Spain (especially [[Catalonia]]);
*the term reformist centre (or more correctly reformist centre-left) has been used to refers to some politics of [[New Zealand Labour Party|New Zealand's Labour Party]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/02/1067708069039.html?from=storyrhs Peace, justice and politics], The Sydney Morning Herald (3 de Novembre de 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Blairite]] [[New Labour]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.aol.in/video-detail/tony-blairs-10-years-at-10-downing/4063228704 Tony Blair's 10 years at 10 Downing]&lt;/ref&gt; and the elements of the [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Turkish Democratic Left Party]] (Turkish: ''Demokratik Sol Parti'', ''DSP'') which founded the [[New Turkey Party (2002)|New Turkey Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eliamep.gr/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ws09-onis-grigoriadis.pdf Europe and the Impasse of Centre-Left Politics in Turkey: Lesson from the Greek Experience, Politics of Secularism in Turkey], p. 15 [[Mediterranean Programme]], jointly organised with the [[Centre for European Studies (think tank)|CES]]-[[Middle East Technical University|METU]]&lt;/ref&gt; Reformist centre-left may be considered synonymous with the Third Way;
*in Indian politics the terms is sometimes used to refer to centrist who support modernising and secular politics similar to the [[Indian National Congress]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/FE-Editorial-State-it-like-it-is/448269/ FE Editorial : State it like it is], The Financial Express, Saturday, 18 April  03:10 in the morning&lt;/ref&gt;

*during [[South Korea]]'s [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007 Presidential Election]], the current [[Democratic Party (Republic of Korea, 2005)|Democratic Party]] used the name '''Centrist Reformists Democratic Party'''

*In Venezuela, [[COPEI]] has since 2007 refused the right-wing categorization and adopted the self-description of «humanist and reformist centre»&lt;ref&gt;[http://venezuelareal.zoomblog.com/archivo/2007/01/13/copei-cumple-61-anos-con-logo-nombre-y.html Copei cumple 61 años con logo, nombre y colores nuevos, Venezuela Real], 13 de Enero, 2007, 10:19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retroactive use==
The term has been retroactively been used to refer to [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] and such centrist elements of the [[reform movement]]

'''''Republican Party Reptile''''', subtitled ''The Confessions, Adventures, Essays and (Other) Outrages of P. J. O'Rourke'' is a 1987 collection of essays by American satirical writer [[P. J. O'Rourke]].&lt;ref name="NY Times -03May1987 - Lewis Frumkes - Paperbacks; The Beast Above the Surface"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/books/paperbacks-the-beast-above-the-surface.html|title=Paperbacks; The Beast Above the Surface|last=[[Lewis Frumkes]]|date=May 3, 1987|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humorist [[Lewis Frumkes]]' review of the collection, he described it as only occasionally displaying O'Rourke's best writing.&lt;ref name="NY Times -03May1987 - Lewis Frumkes - Paperbacks; The Beast Above the Surface"/&gt;
O'Rourke planned to promote the book at the [[1988 Republican National Convention|1988]] [[Republican National Convention]].  Though he described himself as a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], this was not allowed, reportedly because the GOP did not appreciate O'Rourke's  sense of humor.&lt;ref name="The Bryan Times - 16Aug1998 - People in the News - Book Ban at Convention"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vOAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hFcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3404,4151687&amp;dq=republican-party-reptile&amp;hl=en|title=People in the News - Book Ban at Convention|date=August 16, 1988|work=[[The Bryan Times]]|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the essay that gives its title to the collection O'Rourke describes a "Republican Party Reptile":&lt;ref name="Google Books - Republican Party Reptile"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[P. J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are in favor of: guns, drugs, fast cars, free love (if our wives don't find out), a sound dollar, and a strong military with spiffy uniforms. There are thousands of people in America who feel this way, especially after three or four drinks. If all of us would unite and work together, we could give this country. . . well, a real bad hangover."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The collection includes the article "How to Drive Fast on Drugs While Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink" which had previously been published in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' in 1979, and was later included in the collection ''[[Driving Like Crazy]]''.&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph - 20Sep2009 - PJ O'Rourke: a hellraiser who had to slow down

The '''Swiss children coercion reparation initiative''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Wiedergutmachungsinitiativ'') was a Swiss [[federal popular initiative]] to change the federal constitution,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29765623|title=Switzerland's shame: The children used as cheap farm labour|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=Kavita Puri|language=|date=2014-10-29|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was launched in April 2014.

== Summary ==
In April 2014, the collection of Swiss citizens' signatures started, and at least 100,000 had signed by 1 October 2015. The [[popular initiative]] addressed the fate of forced [[Child labour in Switzerland|child labourers in Switzerland]], the so-called ''[[Verdingkinder]]'', a term formerly used in the Swiss-German language. Another "integration project," related to the so-called "misplaced persons," affected tens of thousands of [[Minor (law)|juvenile]]s, who were placed as labourers at Swiss farms, with low pay. Among them were also [[Yenish people|''Fahrende'' or ''Jenisch'']] juveniles affected by the then Swiss foundation ''[[Kinder der Landstrasse]],'' though not their families.&lt;ref name="woz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/1414/verdingkinder/mehr-als-nur-symbolisch|title=Mehr als nur symbolisch|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 14/2004|author=Adrian Riklin|language=German|date=2014-04-03|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative was actively supported by the [[Beobachter (magazine)|''Beobachter'']] revealed the fates of the ''Verdingkinder''&lt;ref name="beobachter-wiedergutmachung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beobachter.ch/dossiers/dossier-fremdplatziert/artikel/wiedergutmachungsinitiative_das-unrecht-jetzt-korrigieren/|title=Dossier|publisher=[[Beobachter (magazine)|Beobachter]]|author=|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Kinder der Landstrasse'' foundation. The popular initiative, set up by Guido Fluri and other prominent citizens, among them writer [[Lukas Hartmann]],&lt;ref name="beobachter-20153003"/&gt; was supported among others, by the parent organization of the Swiss churches and the association of the Swiss teachers.

== Aims (excerpt) ==
The initiative was started by an inter-political committee and addressed the inadequate measures by the Swiss governmental authorities. It demanded:
* Reparations for the victims of forced [[Child labour in Switzerland|child labourers]] and welfare-driven coercive measures;
* A scholarly review of this dark chapter of Swiss history;
* The creation of a fund of over 500 million Swiss Francs for the purposes of the initiative;

It was pointed out that only severely affected victims obtain redress and that an independent commission should be formed to examine each case individually.&lt;ref name="wiedergutmachung-forderungen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiedergutmachung.ch/home/|title=Wiedergutmachungsinitiative|publisher=wiedergutmachung.ch|author=|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background: ''Verdingkinder'' and ''Kinder der Landstrasse'' ==
''[[Verdingkinder]]'' (literally: "contract children" or "indentured child labourers") were children in Switzerland who were taken from their parents, often due to poverty or for "moral reasons" (usually because their mothers were unmarried and poor), of [[Names of the Romani people|''Gypsy'']]–[[Yeniche people|''Yeniche'' (Swiss German also ''Fahrende'')]] origin&lt;ref name="hds-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D8247.php|title=Jenische|publisher=HDS|author=Hansjörg Roth|language=German|date=2008-03-08|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hds-kinderarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D13909.php|title=Kinderarbeit|publisher=HDS|author=Thomas Guss|language=German|date=2009-10-13|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent to live with new families, often poor farmers who needed cheap labour. 

Many of these children, when they grew to be adults, have come forward to claim they were severely mistreated by their new "families,"&lt;ref name="beobachter-20153003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinderheime-schweiz.ch/de/pdf/interview_lukas_hartmann_grossmutter_war_verdingkind_beobacher_zuerich_20maerz2015.pdf|title=Sie zeigten dem Vormund einfach das schönste Zimmer des Hofs|publisher=[[Der Schweizerische Beobachter]]|author=Interview with [[Lukas Hartmann]]|language=German|date=2015-03-30|accessdate=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; suffering neglect, beatings, and other [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]].

There were [[auction]]s where children were handed over to the farmer asking the least money from the authorities, thus securing cheap labour for his farm and relieving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children. In the 1930s, in the [[Canton of Bern]], about 20% of all agricultural labourers were children below the age of 15.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The actions of the Swiss municipality guardianship authorities were tolerated by the federal authorities until the 1960s. Swiss historian Marco Leuenberger found that in 1930 there were some 35,000 indentured children, while, between 1920 and 1970, more than 100,000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes. Ten thousand former ''Verdingkinder'', women and men in Switzerland, are still alive in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/opinion/slaverys-shadow-on-switzerland.html?_r=0|title=Slavery’s Shadow on Switzerland|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Tony Wild|language=|date=2014-11-10|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supplement of the Swiss Federal Constitution claimed by the initiative ==
The initiative demands that the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] should be amended as follows:&lt;ref name="wiedergutmachung-initiativtex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiedergutmachung.ch/initiative/|title=Initiative|publisher=wiedergutmachung.ch|author=|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Art. 124a Wiedergutmachung für die Opfer von fürsorgerischen Zwangsmassnahmen und Fremdplatzierungen'', literally reparation for the victims of welfare step coercive measures and foreign placements
# The Confederation and the Cantons shall provide for compensation for the injustice, which has suffered particular resident, ''[[Verdingkinder]]'', administrative supplied, or forcibly sterilized forced adopted people and ''Fahrende'' (a Swiss-German term for literally Yeniche people) as a result-driven welfare coercion or foreign placements.
# To provide an independent scientific review of these measures and promote discussion about it to the public.
:''Art. 196 Ziff. 1212. Übergangsbestimmung Zu Art. 124a (Wiedergutmachung für die Opfer von fürsorgerischen Zwangsmassnahmen und Fremdplatzierungen)'', literally Transitional provision to Art. 124a (reparation for the victims of welfare step coercive measures and foreign placements):
# The Swiss Confederation establishes a fund in the amount of 500 million Swiss Frances for the victims of welfare step coercive measures and foreign placements that were done before 1981.
# Eligible are people who were directly affected and hard of such measures. The amount of restitution depends on the sustained injustice. About the payment of benefits, an independent commission has to conclude.
# The fund is dissolved twenty years after its creation. Any residual amount will be refunded proportionately to the depositors.

{{Communism sidebar|expanded=Variants}}
'''World communism''' (also '''international communism''' and '''global communism''') is a form of [[communism]] of international scope. The long-term goal of world communism is a worldwide [[communist society]] that is stateless (lacking any [[state (polity)|state]]), which may be achieved through an intermediate-term goal of either a [[voluntary association]] of [[sovereign state]]s (a global [[Political alliance|alliance]]) or a [[world government]] (a single worldwide state). A series of internationals have worked toward world communism and they have included the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]], the [[Second International]], the Third International (the [[Communist International]] or Comintern), the [[Fourth International]], the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]], the [[World Socialist Movement]] and variant offshoots. These are a quite heterogeneous group despite their common ultimate goal of a stateless and global communist society.

During the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] era, the idea of [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]], which many international communists considered unworkable, became part of the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] and his supporters concluded that it was naive to think that [[world revolution]] was imminent. This caused great disillusionment among many communists worldwide, who agreed with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] that international scope was vital to communist success. Other currents of [[national communism]], especially after [[World War II]], tempered the prewar popularity of international communism. 

The end of the [[Cold War]], with the [[Revolutions of 1989|revolutions of 1989]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], is often called the fall of communism and a broad consensus since then is that any advent of international communism is not likely. Nevertheless, some international communists remain among some factions of [[Maoism|Maoists]], [[left communism|left communists]], some [[Communism in Russia#Contemporary communist parties of the Russian Federation|present-day Russian communist]]s and others. 

== Early era (1917-1944) ==
[[Marxist philosophy]] held that because capitalism had become global (and thus capitalists could be expected to cooperate internationally to maintain dominance in [[class conflict]]), the [[proletariat]] would need to cooperate internationally as well via [[proletarian internationalism]] to avoid continued subjugation via [[divide and rule]] (thus the rallying cry of "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]"). In this view, after a period of international socialism the terminal stage of development of the (future) [[history of communism]] would be world communism. Such theory may treat world communism as a peaceful and prosperous end result, something almost anyone could endorse, but it is the transition to world communism that is contentious. World communism is to be achieved by [[world revolution]], according to a theory that was popular in the period 1917 to around 1933 (at least). World communism is incompatible with the existence of [[nation state]]s because most communists believe that [[nation]]s should unite, whether in [[supranational union]]s of sovereign states or world government, until such time as either [[abolition of the state]] or [[withering away of the state]] would occur because [[governance]] would no longer require state [[institution]]s. In other words, the people of a communist society would be [[self-governance|self-governing]] via [[direct democracy]] so direct that the state would not even exist.

[[File:National Flag of Chinese Soviet Republic.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] which depicts a [[hammer and sickle]] spanning the globe as [[Proletarian internationalism|proletarian internationalists]] believed that one focus of a [[communist revolution]] was to ensure [[World revolution|another successful revolution elsewhere]]&lt;ref name=Oxford1&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=David|editor1-last=Freeden|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Stears|editor2-first=Marc|editor3-last=Sargent|editor3-first=Lyman Tower|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies|date=2015|pages=20-38|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198744337}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Abolition of the state is not in itself a distinctively [[Marxist doctrine]]. It was sometime it was happened by any of the country held by various [[socialist]] and [[anarchist]] thinkers of the nineteenth century as well as some present-day anarchists ([[Libertarianism|libertarians]] are [[anti-statism|anti-statist]] typically in a subtly different sense, in that they support [[small government]] although not absence of [[government]] or [[state (polity)|state]]). The crux here is a text of the [[Friedrich Engels]], from his ''[[Anti-Dühring]]''. It is often cited as "The state is not 'abolished,' it withers away". This is from the pioneer work of [[historical materialism]], a formulation of Marx's idea of a [[materialist conception of history]]. The withering away of the state is a graphic formulation, that has passed into cliché. The translation (Engels was writing in German) is also given as: "The state is not 'abolished'. It dies out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415073127/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm |date=2007-04-15 }}, taken from the Emile Burns translation of the 1894 German third edition, Part III section 2. The passage was not in the first edition of 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Reference to the whole passage shows that this happens only after the proletariat has seized the [[means of production]]. The schematic is therefore revolution, transitional period, ultimate period. Although the ultimate period sounds like a [[utopia]], Marx and Engels did not consider themselves [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]], but rather [[scientific socialism|scientific socialists]]. They considered violence necessary for resistance of [[wage slavery]].

Whereas for Engels the transitional period was reduced to a single act, for Lenin thirty to forty years later it had become extended and "obviously lengthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm "The State and Revolution — Chapter 5"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423131734/http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm |date=2007-04-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same place, he argues strongly that Marx's conception of communist society is not utopian, but takes into account the heritage of what came before.

This gives at least roughly the position on world communism as the Comintern was set up in 1919: world revolution is necessary for the setting up of world communism, but not as an immediate or clearly sufficient event.

== Stalinist and Cold War era (1947-1991) ==
During the Stalinist era, the idea of socialism in one country, which many internationalists considered unworkable, became part of the ideology of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as Stalin and his supporters concluded that the transitional period would indeed be very long and complicated. Advocates of socialism in one country had not abandoned the goal of ultimate world communism, but they considered it naive to think world revolution was imminent. Thus the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved the Third International during World War II. However, Stalin did not intend to implement [[isolationism]] despite this one-country approach. Despite retaining the earlier [[Soviet phraseology|Bolshevik terminology]] equating [[imperialism]] with [[capitalism]] and thus decrying [[empire]], the Soviet Union instead pursued a ''de facto'' [[empire]] of [[satellite state]]s, similar in ways to the [[czarist]] [[Russian Empire]] although Soviet ideology could not admit that, to counter the influence of capitalist countries. It also supported [[revolutionary socialism]] around the world to continue to work toward world communism, however distant it might be. Thus it backed the [[26th of July Movement]] in the [[Cuban Revolution]], the [[North Vietnam]]ese in the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[MPLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]]. The [[domino theory]] of the Cold War was driven by this intent as [[anti-communism|anti-communists]] feared that isolationism by capitalist countries would lead to the collapse of their [[self-defense]].

== Post-Cold War era (1992–present) ==
The [[Chinese economic reform|reform and opening]] of [[China]] and the [[perestroika|restructuring]] and [[glasnost|openness]] of the Soviet Union, although they were quite different, both marked a change of direction away from the [[proselytism|proselytizing]] nature of international communism as Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]] had known it. The end of the Cold War, which brought the revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, is often called the fall of communism and a broad consensus since then is that any advent of international communism is not likely. Nevertheless, some international communists remain among some factions of Maoists, left communists, some present-day Russian communists and others. A recent example of an organization seeking the establishment of world communism is the now-defunct [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]].
