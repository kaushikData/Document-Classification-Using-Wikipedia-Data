      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11719">The '''Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments''' (AGATE) project was a consortium of [[NASA]], the [[FAA]], the [[general aviation]] industry and a number of universities. Its goal was to create a [[Small Aviation Transportation System]] (SATS) as an alternative to short-range automotive trips for both private and business transportation needs. The Small Aviation Transportation System will make many time-sensitive short-haul trips more affordable for business, medical, public safety and recreational pursuits.

== Consortium creation ==
The AGATE Alliance was launched in 1994 and born out of an effort to stem the gradual decline of general aviation innovation in the United States. It played an instrumental role in the forging of joint technology development and testing partnerships between Government, industry and vital non-profit contributors.

The AGATE Alliance was organized as an operating partnership between government, industry, and academia established to develop new ways of reviving the troubled general aviation industry. The partnership is the product of two years of government-industry collaboration. The Alliance, composed of representatives from each partnership sector, has been formed to give the revitalization effort formal structure. It will also leverage and focus resources for higher risk efforts with higher payoffs.

== The decline of general aviation ==
General aviation, defined as all flying except the military services and commercial airlines, had fallen from its position of economic prominence in the late 1970s to record lows in the mid-1980s before recovering in the late 1990s. American GA aircraft production numbers declined down from 18,000 in 1978 to 954 in 1993, an all-time low. Regulatory restrictions, liability claims and a withering of the product innovation pipeline took their toll on the industry, driving up prices and causing some businesses to file for bankruptcy.

== The prescription for change ==
Approximately 70 U.S. aviation-related organizations and companies, including NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), private industry, academia, and non-profit organizations, agreed to reverse these downward trends. Together, this consortium worked to develop safer, more affordable aircraft and user-friendly flight systems that promise to improve pilot training and simplify operations in and near congested airports.

The AGATE Alliance design was generated by the American Technology Initiative, Inc. (AmTech), a California non-profit corporation retained by NASA to organize and operationally support public/private technology alliances. The AGATE Alliance was finalized by negotiations between AmTech staff members, NASA, and the many alliance participants.

A significant first technology step toward an effective partnership was taken in the spring of 1995, with the first meeting of the AGATE Alliance with the government program managers directed by the head of the General Aviation Program Office at the NASA [[Langley Research Center]], Dr. Bruce J. Holmes. Langley was designated as the lead NASA research center for the general aviation program.

== AGATE structure ==
The AGATE Alliance was designed by a team from American Technology Alliances and consisted of two parts: an industry consortium called the "AGATE Alliance Association, Inc" composed of three categories of members from 31 states, 40 principal members from industry, 6 associate members from industry and universities, and 30 supporting members from universities, industry and non-profit organizations, and a NASA General Aviation Program Office (GAPO) that coordinated Federal input from the FAA and DOD. The dual structure created a public/private partnership. It was one of the largest public/private membership alliances in the United States.

The purpose of AGATE was to enable market growth for inter-city transportation in small aircraft. AGATE aimed to make single-pilot, light airplanes more safe, affordable and available as a viable part of the nation's transportation system. AGATE targets trips of 150 to 700 miles - round trips that are too far to complete in a day and too short to efficiently use the hub-and-spoke system.

The Alliance was initiated from a meeting between NASA administrator [[Daniel S. Goldin]] and industry representatives at the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] Convention in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], in AGATE management, as a joint government-industry effort, was initiated in response to the [[Clinton Administration]] and Congress' commitment to "reinventing government."NASA retained American Technology Alliances to design the AGATE Alliance. Paul Masson of American Technology Alliances led a team of five individuals that worked for one year with NASA, the FAA and general aviation industry members to formulate the Alliance. A private sector R&amp;D syndicated partnership model was used in which the AGATE members shared resources and risks to make the market "pie" bigger for everyone. Leadership was also shared. Costs were shared 50/50 between government and industry. The focus was on commercializing advanced concepts through joint ventures in order to produce greater results.

The forming of the Alliance, which had 100+ Members in 31 States at its peak, was also welcomed by the FAA. "General aviation is an integral part of the air traffic system architecture. AGATE is in the right place at the right time to support modernization of the system for GA," said Dr. George F. Donohue, FAA associate administrator for research and systems acquisition.

The Alliance operated under a unique process called the [[Joint Sponsored Research Agreement]] (JSRA). Research conducted under a JSRA permits building collaborative projects in a broader scale than permissible under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and used the stronger reporting and accountability standards of private sector joint research projects. The Alliance, according to Holmes, was unique in the sense that it served as a "blueprint" to map out the Government's research and development support for GA innovation revitalization. It provided industry with more flexibility and gave it the opportunity to take greater risks with higher payoff, faster speed of [[technology transfer]], control of proprietary and shared technologies, and reduced cost and more efficient use of scarce research and development resources.

AGATE was intended to foster revenue growth and job creation in the areas of manufacturing, sales, training, service, support and operations industries within the U.S. small airport infrastructure. The program focuses on the development of new GA technologies including bad weather flight and landing systems, complete with graphic displays of weather and guidance information; emergency coping and avoidance measures that use on-board systems to support decision-making; traffic avoidance systems; systems that reduce the flight planning workload and enhance passenger safety; and systems designed to improve passenger comfort, aircraft performance and efficiency. The success of AGATE will be measured in terms of increases in pilot population, flight hours, airport utilization and new aircraft deliveries.

== Olympic challenge ==
The [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]] provided a rare opportunity to evaluate technologies developed as part of AGATE and, in the process, help transport goods and provide public safety services by helicopter during the July 19 through August 4 Games.

AGATE Alliance members contributed to a government-industry initiative known as the Atlanta Short-haul Transportation System (ASTS), (now called Operation Heli-Star). The ASTS program was responsible for fostering both air and ground transportation during the Olympics and integrating the two into one efficient transportation system.

AGATE Alliance members provided special airborne equipment and ground monitoring stations that enabled the ASTS program to operate safely and efficiently. AGATE's participation in the Atlanta Olympics was managed by the AGATE Flight Systems industry team coordinated by NASA Langley Research Center.

Up to 50 helicopters equipped with AGATE-designed avionics participated, proving communications, navigation and surveillance concepts, some integrated in flight for the first time. The initial plan projected collecting more than 1,400 hours of flight data on operational use and human factors during the Olympic Games.

Most of the critical flight operations were conducted in "uncontrolled" air space outside Atlanta's radar coverage area, hence the need for predetermined flight pathways. While flying over concrete highways on the ground, selected helicopters flew electronic "highways in the sky," shown on an onboard computerized map of the Atlanta area. The composite image was generated on the helicopter using an onboard database and replicated on ground consoles. The pilot saw [[GPS]]-based position updates provided via digital radio data links.

This technology effort aided participating pilots in the safe and efficient conduct of their missions and additionally benefited ground personnel by indicating the precise location of aircraft to facilitate their timely deployment to satisfy high priority transportation and emergency response needs during the Olympics.

== NASA and small businesses integration ==
NASA coordinated small, entrepreneurial general aviation businesses into the AGATE Alliance to match their high rate of innovation with the systems engineering leadership of NASA Langley personnel and the certification experience of major general aviation aircraft manufacturers. NASA's [[Small Business Innovation Research]] (SBIR) program and [[Small Business Technology Transfer]] (STTR) pilot program monitored and adjusted their research topics according to an overall AGATE research roadmap that was annually approved by a joint industry-government Executive Council. The programs offered small businesses the opportunity to transfer NASA and other government-funded research and technology into the marketplace. The SBIR/STTR general aviation programs generated targeted innovations that both supported the NASA general aviation mission and served the nation's efforts in enhancing the general aviation industry innovation capacity. Between 1994 and 2009, NASA awarded an estimated 65 Phase I and 22 Phase II SBIR/STTR awards related to general aviation in excess of $18 million to approximately 50 general aviation companies. The NASA general aviation office offered companies that are awarded NASA SBIR or STTR contracts to participate in the AGATE Alliance as Associate members.

== University participation ==
In presenting the awards for the first [[General Aviation Design Competition]] in 1995, NASA Administrator [[Dan Goldin]] cited the value of engaging US engineering students in "innovative design education in general aviation" and encouraging universities to be partners in creating "a small aircraft transport system for the nation."

The '''Auckland central business district''' ('''CBD'''), also called the '''city centre''' by [[Auckland Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Auckland's city centre|url=http://temp.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/planspoliciesprojects/CouncilProjects/citycentretransformation/Pages/home.aspx|publisher=Auckland Council|accessdate=28 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the geographical and economic heart of the [[Auckland|Auckland metropolitan area]]. The area is made up of the city's largest concentration of skyscrapers and businesses.

The CBD is one of the most densely developed places in New Zealand, with many commercial and some residential developments packed into a space of only {{convert|433|hectare}}.&lt;ref name="teara" /&gt; Bounded by several major motorways and by the harbour coastline in the north, it is surrounded further out by mostly [[suburban]] areas.

==Geography==

Located on the northern shore of a narrow [[isthmus]], the CBD extends from the [[Auckland waterfront]] on the [[Waitematā Harbour]] southwards along [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] and a number of other parallel-running streets. The CBD is generally considered to be bounded by the main motorways that surround all non-harbour sides, with [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] forming the southern and western boundaries, and State Highway 16 / [[Grafton Gully]] forming the eastern boundary.&lt;ref name="GLANCE"/&gt;

The CBD has an area of {{convert|433|hectare}},&lt;ref name="teara" /&gt; similar to the [[Sydney central business district|Sydney CBD]], and twice as large as the CBDs of [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="GLANCE"&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp Auckland's CBD at a glance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624084513/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp |date=24 June 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; The CBD is to a substantial part located on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] of the Waitematā Harbour. For a closer discussion of this aspect, see the [[Commercial Bay]] and [[Auckland waterfront]] articles.

==History==
{{Expand section |talksection=Unreferenced section|date=June 2008|small=no}}
The town of Auckland was created in 1840 with the first European colonisation of the area, marked by an official ceremony on the now non-existent [[Point Britomart]]. The initial centre of the new town was focused on what is now the corner of Shortland and Queen Streets, which was at the shoreline of Commercial Bay. From approximately their junction, the main wharf ran north off the end of Queen Street, with Shortland Street leading up to Fort Britomart and Government House, around which many of the richer people built houses. Shortland Street tended to be the location of the more important businesses and most of the 'luxury' shops of the mid 19th century. The 1850s onwards saw an increasing number of businesses, and especially retail, locating further south along [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], which still to this day forms the 'spine' of the area.

In 1841, one year after the European founding, the census counted approximately 2,000 people, with "mechanics" the largest group at 250, and other groups of note being 150 agricultural labourers, 100 shopkeepers, 100 domestic servants, and 125 "upper class members".&lt;ref name=PROPCENTRAL&gt;{{cite news|title=Auckland Central |newspaper=Property Report - insert to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=5 September 2011|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the remainder of the 19th century, Commercial Bay was progressively filled in, allowing a northward extension of Queen Street and the creation of Fort Street, Customs Street, and Quay Street. The part of Queen Street north of Customs Street is today referred to informally as Lower Queen Street.

As well as being the location of a great many multi-storey warehouses, initially the Lower Queen Street area also contained many manufacturing businesses, though many of these started to move to other areas such as Freeman's Bay, Newton and Parnell, especially if they took up a lot of room (such as timber yards) or created noise or pollution (such as brick yards or foundries). Up until the middle of the 20th century the centre of town still contained a large number of small factories including clothing manufacturers.

The relocation of industries to outlying suburbs became especially pronounced in the 1950s, partly due to incentives made by council planners to create industrial areas in Penrose and Rosebank Road (amongst others) and thus rid the inner city area of noise, pollution and heavy traffic. This was mirrored by the development of suburban shopping malls (the first being [[LynnMall]] in 1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/9294196/Fifty-years-of-the-shopping-mall|accessdate=24 July 2016|title=Fifty years of the shopping mall|date=20 October 2013|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enticed retailers to vacate the inner city as well. Attempts by the council to halt this pattern by constructing numerous public car parking buildings met with varying success. The rise of suburban supermarket and mall shopping that was created in places such as Pakuranga from 1965 onwards has been added to by the appearance of [[Big Box]] retailers in places such as Botany and the North Shore.&lt;ref name="NZHA75"&gt;''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' - McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor). David Bateman, 1997. Plate 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential numbers in the inner city (including the inner suburbs) were also declining in the 20th century from as early as the 1920s. In the two-mile zone surrounding the CBD, there were approximately 70,000 people in 1926, with only around 50,000 in 1966 - a change made even more marked by the development of the remainder of Auckland's population, which grew more than fourfold in the same timeframe.&lt;ref name="NZHA75"/&gt; In the 1990s, only a token population of around 1,400 was still residing within the CBD, though this was to grow substantially with a boom of new apartment buildings around the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;See 'Population' section in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 24,000 apartment units exist as of 2010.&lt;ref name="UPDATE"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Aerial view of Auckland.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the CBD.]]

===Overview===

The CBD of Auckland has been the leading centre of New Zealand's business and economic development for nearly two centuries. The area of today's CBD was the site of the original European settlement of Auckland, oriented along the coastline and then Queen Street, in a southward direction. From those origins, it has grown progressively, and become much more densely built-up, now being an area of high-rise buildings mainly used for commercial and retail uses. It has the highest concentration of arts, culture and higher education institutions and venues in the country.&lt;ref name="ABOUT"/&gt;

Some commentators have noted that the recent decades have not been kind to the aesthetics and the community values of the inner city. The demolishing of many older buildings, often the prerequisite for low-quality or uninspired new office and residential developments, is considered by them to be due to a combination of developers uninterested in long-term outcomes and Council planning direction being too weak.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/466/story.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10437437 Michael Stevens: Leaders stand by as city is desecrated]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Thursday, 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to reverse the decline of aesthetics in the CBD, previous Auckland City Councils and the current unitary [[Auckland Council]] have instigated several urban regeneration schemes. These include the recent redevelopment of [[Aotea Square]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/aoteasquare/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515125213/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/aoteasquare/default.asp |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the upgrade of Saint Patrick's Square in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/stpatrickssquare.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301105138/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/stpatrickssquare.asp |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The area east of the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] is currently undergoing major changes, with the development of new commercial buildings, development of public spaces and restoration of several heritage buildings. Another major regeneration scheme currently underway is the redevelopment of [[Wynyard Quarter]], which involves replacing industrial facilities covering a large portion of the CBD waterfront with residential or commercial buildings and public spaces.

The Auckland CBD is one of the few places in New Zealand that has skyscraper-sized buildings, such as the [[Vero Centre]], [[ANZ Centre, Auckland|ANZ Centre]] or the [[Metropolis (Auckland building)|Metropolis]], with the [[Sky Tower (Auckland)|Sky Tower]] rising above them.

[[File:Khartoum Place1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Khartoum Place]], a pedestrian square in the central CBD]]

===Population===

Residential high-density buildings constructed within the last decade have helped to increase the population living in the CBD to around 40,000 (2010 estimate) from earlier 16,000 (2004 estimate), all being growth from only 1,400 in 1991.&lt;ref name="UPDATE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GLANCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABOUT"&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/aboutcbd.asp About the CBD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807050153/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/aboutcbd.asp |date=7 August 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this growth has been driven by [[immigration to New Zealand]], particularly from Asia, and the CBD is the area in New Zealand with the highest percentage share (32%) of the Asian ethnic group in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/research.asp#peste Auckland City CBD PESTE analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001240/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/research.asp#peste |date=28 September 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; Also striking is the high number of students (both tertiary education and overseas students studying English in one of the many institutes), making up 27% of all residents (2001 Census) and contributing to the relative youth of the city residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/residents.asp Residents of Auckland's CBD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624231937/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/residents.asp |date=24 June 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing population, available services have also changed - from only about one [[superette]] in the early 2000s, this has ballooned to one supermarket and 38 superettes by 2011. In early 2012, two major supermarket chains opened a branch in the city centre, with Countdown opening on Victoria Street in January and New World opening a branch on Queen Street in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10777892|title=Biggest new supermarket opens in Auckland CBD|work=The New Zealand Herald|first=Anne|last=Gibson|date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the population remains highly focused on ethnically diverse, mostly young and childless residents.&lt;ref name=PROPCENTRAL/&gt;

According to an in-depth study of security perception in the Auckland CBD undertaken in 2005, most visitors and locals feel safe visiting and living in the CBD. Police and the Council have in part ascribed these positive feelings to over a dozen safety initiatives undertaken by authorities (from alcohol bans in parts of the CBD to [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] surveillance and street lighting measures). However, in spite of the general perception of the CBD being safe, there was a feeling that crime had risen somewhat in the last five years (whereas in fact numbers had declined). This was considered to be mostly due to a media-driven public image.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release.html?id=2129 Most feel Auckland CBD safe, survey shows] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009221738/http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release.html?id=2129 |date=9 October 2008 }}'' (from a [[New Zealand Police]] press release, Tuesday 4 October 2006.

===Economy===

With 8,500 businesses, the CBD accounts for 18% of all businesses in Auckland City, with the largest being [[Ports of Auckland]], and the largest employment sectors being financial services, business and [[Information communication technology|ICT]] services. The CBD is also the largest employment centre in New Zealand, with around 65,000 jobs, representing 13% of the regional workforce, and 25% of the Auckland City workforce. Around 73,000 people enter the CBD every morning between 7 am and 9 am, 60% of these by car,&lt;ref name="GLANCE"/&gt; while the total 'turnover' is around 270,000 people per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/dayinlife.asp A day in the life of Auckland's CBD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624230648/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/dayinlife.asp |date=24 June 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]]. Accessed 2008-02-18.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 many large corporations were housed in the Auckland CBD. During the same year, an Auckland City report stated that the Auckland CBD, compared to several [[central business district]]s in Australia, had "a broader and more dominant role in its regional economy" compared to the economies of the Australian central business districts.&lt;ref name="AucklandCityReport2003"&gt;"[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/docs/theeconomyofcbd%20.pdf The Economy of Auckland’s Central Business District] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222053333/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/docs/theeconomyofcbd%20.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }}." City of Auckland. September 2003. Executive Summary (5/77). Retrieved on 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBD remains attractive to shops, partially due to the very high pedestrian numbers on the main shopping streets like Queen Street, where footfalls are estimated to be up to 10 times as high as on Broadway in [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]], seen as Queen Street's closest rival.&lt;ref name=PROPCENTRAL/&gt;

Auckland CBD has a higher share of employment in large firms than other areas in Auckland. Over half of the large firms in Auckland CBD are in office-based sectors (such as property and business services and finance and insurance) and are in the Downtown and Waterfront areas of the CBD. In 2004 Auckland CBD had 72,540 employees and 9125 businesses. 2006 Auckland CBD had 78,444 employees and 9,461 businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/economy.asp CBD facts and figures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423024155/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/economy.asp |date=23 April 2009 }}."

===Education===

There are significant educational institutions located in the Auckland CBD, notably the [[University of Auckland]] and the [[Auckland University of Technology]]. The CBD also has many of the English language schools for foreigners which form a significant part of Auckland's education business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument Survey of English Language Providers - Year ended March 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234407/http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument |date=27 September 2007 }} (from [[Statistics New Zealand]].

== Transport ==
[[File:Auckland Ferry Terminal from Harbour.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ferry Building from the harbour]]
The CBD, with its substantial employment, and increasing number of residents, contains the main public transport hubs of the city. These services are concentrated around the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] (rail and buses) and the nearby [[Auckland Ferry Terminal]], both near the [[Auckland waterfront]]. Many bus services travel the length of the CBD along the main streets, in particular via the bus lanes on Albert Street and the [[Central Connector, Auckland|Central Connector]] [[bus priority]] route. In 2010, around 33,000 people entered the CBD via public transport every day.&lt;ref name="CITYSCENEAUG2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report looks into the state of our city |newspaper=CityScene|date=29 August 2010 |publisher=Auckland City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, much of the transport to and around the CBD post-1950s was by private vehicles, partly because the CBD provides numerous parking buildings&lt;ref name="NZHA75"/&gt; and parking spaces associated with office buildings, and is almost totally surrounded (and easily accessible) by motorways.

[[Auckland Council]] has begun the construction phase of the [[City Rail Link]]. Once completed, it will connect the [[Britomart Transport Centre|Britomart]] transport hub more directly to the [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] in the vicinity of [[Mount Eden Train Station]] by way of a tunnel running under the CBD. Two new stations will be constructed, one at [[Aotea Square]] and one on [[Karangahape Road]], and the existing stations at each end of the link, Britomart and Mount Eden, will receive substantial upgrades.

The main street of the CBD is [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], which was upgraded between 2006 and 2008 to modernise it and make it more pedestrian friendly. 
In 2009, the former Auckland City Council proposed the redevelopment of several CBD streets into [[shared space]]s, with the goal of improving pedestrian and cyclist amenity by slowing down vehicle traffic while retaining the possibility for car access - compared to a [[pedestrian mall]] which allows no motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/auckland-new-copenhagen-102761 Auckland: the new Copenhagen?]". ''[[National Business Review]]''. 25 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Auckland Council is continuing this project. Darby Street, Lorne Street, Fort Street, Jean Batten Place, and Fort Lane have been converted into shared spaces since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/en/planspoliciesprojects/councilprojects/sharedspaces/Pages/home.aspx |accessdate=24 July 2016|title=Council projects |publisher=Auckland Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of Federal Street between Wellesley Street West and Victoria Street West has also been made shared space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/263877/auckland%27s-side-streets-too-%27car-centric%27|accessdate=28 July 2017|title=Auckland's side streets too 'car-centric'|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Benjamin Bowring Gammell''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]], commonly known as '''Bill Gammell''' (born 29 December 1952) is a businessman and former Scottish International rugby player.

==Early life==
Bill Gammell was born in [[Edinburgh]], and was the son of an investment banker, who was invited at an early age to join Edinbugh's [[Ivory &amp; Sime]] (which was started in the late 1800s with the formation of the British Assets Trust.) Gammell attended Edinburgh's exclusive [[Fettes College]] where he was friends and debating partners with future British [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].  The two have remained close friends.  After Fettes, Gammell attended the [[University of Stirling]] where he obtained a BA in Economics and Accountancy.

==Rugby==
Gammell played [[rugby union]] at county level and for the [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scottish national team]].  A tall [[Wing (rugby union)|wing]]er, he earned five international caps, and played in the game against [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] in 1977 in [[Tokyo]] when he scored four tries in the Scots' 74-9 victory.

Gammell scored two tries on his debut for Scotland, against Ireland at Murrayfield in 1977.

==Business career==
After his rugby career was ended by injury, Gammell followed his father into business.  Using [[venture capital]], he founded [[Cairn Energy]] in Edinburgh.  The company invested in several unsuccessful oilfields in the [[United States of America|US]] before making a modest strike in the [[Pennsylvania]] oilfield. Gammell was appointed Cairn's Chief Executive on its initial listing in 1989. In the mid 1990s he led the company in a radical reallocation of its assets, moving out of US and [[North Sea]] oil and gas concerns and into neglected fields in South Asia. The company's fortunes soared in 2004, when a field it had bought in 2001 (for [[USD|$]]7.5 million) from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] in the [[India]]n province of [[Rajasthan]] was found to contain close to 1.1 billion barrels of oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cairn's Indian oil find comes in at the top end of City Forecasts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2894182/Cairns-Indian-oil-find-comes-in-at-the-top-end-of-City-forecasts.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Sylvia |last=Pfeifer |date=5 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; catapulting it into the [[FTSE 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cairn joins the big time and pledges to go it alone|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2894437/Cairn-joins-the-big-time-and-pledges-to-go-it-alone.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Christopher |last=Hope |date=8 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gammell was paid an annual salary of £552,000 for his role as chief executive at Cairn Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Gammell: Executive Profile &amp; Biography |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=11765902&amp;ric=CNE.L |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 July 2011 Gammell assumed the role of non-executive chairman.

Gammell's father invested in US oil company [[Bush-Overbey]], owned by future US President [[George H. W. Bush]].  The two families became friends, with [[George W. Bush]] spending the summer at the Gammell's farm in Scotland.  George W. attended Bill Gammell's wedding in [[Glasgow]] in 1983.  The two have remained close friends.  When George W. Bush assumed the Presidency, both he and Blair reportedly called their mutual friend Gammell to ask his opinion of the other.

Bill Gammell a director of the [[Scottish Institute of Sport]] and Artemis AiM VCT plc., and in 2004 he was awarded UK [[Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award|Entrepreneur of the Year]]. In the 2006 honours list, Gammell was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] "for services to Industry in Scotland",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4569572.stm|title=Queen honours star-studded Scots|last=|first=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 he was elected a Fellow of [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|the Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=RSE Welcomes 60 New Fellows|date=15 February 2017|publisher=[[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|url=https://www.rse.org.uk/rse-welcomes-60-new-fellows/|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gammell received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2007/people_awards.html|title = Annual Review 2007 : Principal's Review|website = www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-03-29|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305032855/http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2007/people_awards.html|archivedate = 5 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, biologics are regulated via different pathways than other small molecule drugs and [[medical devices]].&lt;ref name="pmid18958946"&gt;{{cite journal | author = United States Food and Drug Administration | title = Supplemental applications proposing labeling changes for approved drugs, biologics, and medical devices.

The term '''biopharmacology''' is sometimes used to describe the branch of pharmacology that studies biopharmaceuticals.

==Major classes==
[[File:FreshFrozenPlasma.JPG|thumb|right|120px|[[Blood plasma]] is a type of biopharmaceutical directly extracted from living systems.]]

===Extracted from living systems===
Some of the oldest forms of biologics are extracted from the bodies of animals, and other humans especially. Important biologics include:

* [[Whole blood]] and other blood components
* [[organ transplantation|Organs]] and [[tissue transplant]]s
* [[Stem cell therapy]]
* [[Antibodies]] for [[passive immunization]] (e.g., to treat a [[virus]] infection)
* [[Breast milk|Human breast milk]]
* [[Fecal microbiota transplant|Fecal microbiota]]
* [[Human fertilization|Human reproductive cells]]

Some biologics that were previously extracted from animals, such as insulin, are now more commonly produced by [[recombinant DNA]].

===Produced by recombinant DNA===
{{see also|Biologics for immunosuppression}}

As indicated the term "biologics" can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine. However, in most cases, the term "biologics" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:
# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) "[[growth hormone]]" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.
# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are "custom-designed" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.
# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.

Biologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of €7,000–14,000 per patient per year.

Older patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175–180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic "human" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]]. Sometimes referred to as rHI, under the [[trade name]] [[Humulin]], was developed by [[Genentech]], but licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company]], who manufactured and marketed it starting in 1982.

Major kinds of biopharmaceuticals include:
*Blood factors ([[Factor VIII]] and [[Factor IX]])
*Thrombolytic agents ([[tissue plasminogen activator]])
*[[Hormones]] ([[insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, gonadotrophins)
*Haematopoietic growth factors ([[Erythropoietin]], [[colony stimulating factors]])
*[[Interferons]] (Interferons-α, -β, -γ)
*[[Interleukin]]-based products (Interleukin-2)
*[[Vaccines]] ([[Hepatitis B]] surface [[antigen]])
*[[Monoclonal antibodies]] (Various)
*Additional products ([[tumour necrosis factor]], therapeutic enzymes)

Research and development investment in new medicines by the biopharmaceutical industry stood at $65.2 billion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Vaccines===
{{Main article|Vaccine}}
Many vaccines are grown in tissue cultures.

===Gene therapy===
[[Viral gene therapy]] involves artificially manipulating a [[virus]] to include a desirable piece of genetic material.

==Biosimilars==
{{Main article|Biosimilars}}

With the expiration of numerous [[patents]] for [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster biologics]] between 2012 and 2019, the interest in biosimilar production, i.e., follow-on biologics, has increased.&lt;ref name=biosimilars&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calo-Fernández B, Martínez-Hurtado JL | title = Biosimilars: company strategies to capture value from the biologics market | journal = Pharmaceuticals | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1393–408 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 24281342 | pmc = 3816668 | doi = 10.3390/ph5121393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[small molecules]] that consist of chemically identical [[active ingredients]], biologics are vastly more complex and consist of a multitude of subspecies. Due to their heterogeneity and the high process sensitivity, originators and follow-on biosimilars will exhibit variability in specific variants over time, however the safety and clinical performance of both originator and biosimilar biopharmaceuticals must remain equivalent throughout their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="pmid21478841"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiestl M, Stangler T, Torella C, Cepeljnik T, Toll H, Grau R | title = Acceptable changes in quality attributes of glycosylated biopharmaceuticals | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 310–2 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21478841 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamanna WC, Holzmann J, Cohen HP, Guo X, Schweigler M, Stangler T, Seidl A, Schiestl M | title = Maintaining consistent quality and clinical performance of biopharmaceuticals | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 369–379 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29285958 | doi = 10.1080/14712598.2018.1421169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Process variations are monitored by modern analytical tools (e.g., [[liquid chromatography]], [[immunoassays]], [[mass spectrometry]], etc.) and describe a unique design space for each biologic.

Thus, biosimilars require a different regulatory framework compared to small-molecule generics. Legislation in the 21st century has addressed this by recognizing an intermediate ground of testing for biosimilars. The filing pathway requires more testing than for small-molecule generics, but less testing than for registering completely new therapeutics.&lt;ref name="biosimilars2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nick C | title = The US Biosimilars Act: Challenges Facing Regulatory Approval | url = http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26030/The_US_Biosimilars_Act__Challenges_Facing.1.aspx | journal = Pharm Med | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–152 | year = 2012 | doi=10.1007/bf03262388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[European Medicines Agency]] introduced an adapted pathway for biosimilars, termed [[biosimilar|''similar biological medicinal products'']]. This pathway is based on a thorough demonstration of "comparability" of the "similar" product to an existing approved product.&lt;ref name="EMA1"&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Medicine_QA/2009/12/WC500020062.pdf | title = Questions and answers on biosimilar medicines (similar biological medicinal products) | access-date = 2014-10-11 | author = EMA | date = 2008-10-30 | publisher = European Medicines Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product.&lt;ref name=" biosimilars2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlwww.gpo.gov"&gt;{{Federal Register|75|61497}}; {{cite web | url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-10-05/pdf/2010-24853.pdf | title = Approval Pathway for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products | author = United States Food and Drug Administration | work = Public Hearing; Request for Comments | date = 2010-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major hope linked to the introduction of biosimilars is a reduction of costs to the patients and the healthcare system.&lt;ref name = biosimilars /&gt;

==Commercialization==
When a new biopharmaceutical is developed, the company will typically apply for a [[patent]], which is a grant for exclusive manufacturing rights. This is the primary means by which the developer of the drug can recover the investment cost for development of the biopharmaceutical. The [[United States patent law|patent laws]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] differ somewhat on the requirements for a patent, with the European requirements are perceived as more difficult to satisfy. The total number of patents granted for biopharmaceuticals has risen significantly since the 1970s. In 1978 the total patents granted was 30. This had climbed to 15,600 in 1995, and by 2001 there were 34,527 patent applications.&lt;ref name="scientific_thomson_2006"&gt;{{cite web | first=Luke |last=Foster| title=Patenting in the Biopharmaceutical Industry&amp;mdash;comparing the US with Europe| url=http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/| access-date=2006-06-23 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316164416/http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 2006-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the US had the highest IP (Intellectual Property) generation within the biopharmaceutical industry, generating 37 percent of the total number of granted patents worldwide, however, there is still a large margin for growth and innovation within the industry. Revisions to the current IP system to ensure greater reliability for R&amp;D (research and development) investments is a prominent topic of debate in the US as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth and Policies Behind Biopharmaceutical Innovation|url=https://www.phrma.org/press-release/new-report-reveals-growth-trajectories-and-top-policy-factors-affecting-biopharmaceutical-innovation-and-growth|website=phrma.org|publisher=PhRMA|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood products and other human derived biologics like breast milk, have highly regulated or very hard to access markets, therefore, customers generally face a supply shortage for these products due to their nature and often institutions housing these biologics, designated as 'banks', cannot distribute their product to customers effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2012/06/27/blood-money-the-guys-who-trade-your-blood-for-profit/#2ec937e46884|title=The Guys Who Trade Your Blood For Profit|last=Carlyle|first=Erin|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, banks for reproductive cells are much more widespread and available due to the ease of which [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] and [[egg cell]]s are able to be used for fertility treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spermdonorsaustralia.com.au/|title=Sperm Donors Australia {{!}} Donate Sperm|website=www.spermdonorsaustralia.com.au|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large-scale production ==
Biopharmaceuticals may be produced from microbial cells (e.g., [[Escherichia coli|recombinant ''E. coli'']] or yeast cultures), mammalian cell lines (see [[cell culture]]) and plant cell cultures (see [[plant tissue culture]]) and [[moss]] plants in [[bioreactor]]s of various configurations, including [[photo-bioreactors]].&lt;ref name="pmid17701058"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Decker EL, Reski R | title = Current achievements in the production of complex biopharmaceuticals with moss bioreactors | journal = Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17701058 | doi = 10.1007/s00449-007-0151-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important issues of concern are cost of production (low-volume, high-purity products are desirable) and microbial contamination (by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[mycoplasma]]). Alternative platforms of production which are being tested include whole plants ([[plant-made pharmaceuticals]]).

=== Transgenics ===
{{main article|Pharming (genetics)}}
A potentially controversial method of producing biopharmaceuticals involves [[transgenic]] organisms, particularly plants and animals that have been [[genetically modified]] to produce drugs. This production is a significant risk for the investor, due to production failure or scrutiny from regulatory bodies based on perceived risks and ethical issues. Biopharmaceutical crops also represent a risk of cross-contamination with non-engineered crops, or crops engineered for non-medical purposes.

One potential approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk, blood, or urine. Once an animal is produced, typically using the [[Microinjection#Pronuclear injection|pronuclear microinjection]] method, it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome.&lt;ref name="pmid11017040"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dove A | title = Milking the genome for profit | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = 1045–8 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11017040 | doi = 10.1038/80231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such drug manufactured from the milk of a genetically modified [[goat]] was [[ATryn]], but marketing permission was blocked by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Phillip B. C. Jones | title=European Regulators Curdle Plans for Goat Milk Human Antithrombin | url=http://www.isb.vt.edu/articles/apr0603.htm | access-date=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was reversed in June 2006 and approval was given August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5041298.stm |title=Go-ahead for 'pharmed' goat drug |access-date=2006-10-25 |format= | work=BBC News | date=2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==

===European Union===

In the [[European Union]], a '''biological medicinal product'''&lt;ref name="urlec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2003_63/dir_2003_63_en.pdf | title = Commission Directive 2003/63/EC amending Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use | author = The Commission of the European Communities | work = Official Journal of the European Union | date = 2003-06-25 | page = L 159/62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the active substance(s) produced from or extracted from a biological (living) system, and requires, in addition to physico-chemical testing, biological testing for full characterisation. The characterisation of a biological medicinal product is a combination of testing the active substance and the final medicinal product together with the production process and its control. For example:
* Production process – it can be derived from biotechnology or from other technologies. It may be prepared using more conventional techniques as is the case for blood or [[Blood plasma|plasma]]-derived products and a number of vaccines.
* Active substance – consisting of entire microorganisms, mammalian cells, nucleic acids, proteinaceous, or [[polysaccharide]] components originating from a microbial, animal, human, or plant source.
* Mode of action – therapeutic and immunological medicinal products, [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]] materials, or [[cell therapy]] materials.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], biologics are licensed through the biologics license application (BLA), then submitted to and regulated by the FDA's [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER) whereas drugs are regulated by the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]]. Approval may require several years of [[clinical trials]], including trials with human volunteers. Even after the drug is released, it will still be monitored for performance and safety risks. The manufacture process must satisfy the FDA's "Good Manufacturing Practices", which are typically manufactured in a [[clean room]] environment with strict limits on the amount of airborne particles and other microbial contaminants that may alter the efficacy of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kingham|first1=Richard|last2=Klasa|first2=Gabriela|last3=Carver|first3=Krista | name-list-format = vanc |title=Key Regulatory Guidelines for the Development of Biologics in the United States and Europe|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|pages=75-88|url=https://www.cov.com/-/media/files/corporate/publications/2013/10/chapter4_key_regulatory_guidlines_for_the_development_of_biologics_in_the_united_states_and_europe.pdf|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bureaucrat''' is a member of a [[bureaucracy]] and can compose the administration of any organization of any size, although the term usually connotes someone within an institution of [[government]]. 

The term ''bureaucrat'' derives from "[[bureaucracy]]", which in turn derives from the French "bureaucratie" first known from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bureaucrat|title=bureaucrat - definition of bureaucrat in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bureaucratic work had already been performed for many centuries. In countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], bureaucrats are known to be the officers that run the government at ministerial levels as well at district levels.

Bureaucrats play various roles in modern society, by virtue of holding administrative, functional, and managerial positions in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Hegelan|first1=Abdelrahman|title=Bureaucracy and Development in Saudi Arabia|jstor=4326973|work=The Middle East Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lankov|first1=Andrei|title=The North Korean bureaucracy is here to stay|url=http://www.nknews.org/2014/10/the-north-korean-bureaucracy-is-here-to-stay/|accessdate=13 August 2015|agency=NKNews.org|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} They carryout the day-to-day implementation of enacted policies for central government agencies, such as postal services, education and healthcare administration, and various regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Are the Bureaucrats?|url=http://www.ushistory.org/gov/8c.asp|website=US History American Government|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of bureaucrats==
{{norefs|section|date=March 2018}}
Bureaucrats can be split into different categories based on the system, nationality, and time they come from.
# Classical – someone who starts at a low level of public work and does not have to express opinions of their own in their professional capacities. They follow policy guidelines and gain increasing ranks within the system. Tax collectors, government accountants, police officers, fire fighters, and military personnel are examples of classical bureaucrats.
# American bureaucrats – these are different from other types because they operate within a [[republican form of government]], and the political culture traditionally seeks to limit their power. 
# Chinese bureaucrats, also called “[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin bureaucrats]]” – Mandarins were important from 605 to 1905 CE.  The [[Zhou dynasty]] is the earliest recording of Chinese bureaucrats. There was a 9 rank system, each rank having more power than the lower rank. This type of bureaucrat went on until the [[Qing dynasty]]. After 1905 the Mandarins were replaced by modern civil servants. In 1949 the Communist Party took over China and by their theory all people were bureaucrats who worked for the government.
# European – originally referred to as “Mandarins” stemming from the Chinese word for government employee. Bureaucracy didn’t catch on in Europe very much due to the many different governments in the region, and constant change and advancement, and relative freedom of the upper class. With the translation of [[Confucian]] texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a [[meritocracy]] reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancien regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz, Bill. (1996). ''The expansion of England: race, ethnicity and cultural history''. Psychology Pres; {{ISBN|0-415-06025-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE"/&gt; The implementation of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy, followed the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 which was influenced by of the ancient Chinese [[imperial examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|work=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was modeled on the imperial examinations system and  [[Scholar-official|bureaucracy]] of China based on the suggestion of Northcote–Trevelyan Report.&lt;ref name="Bodde"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], China argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution [[meritocratic]].&lt;ref name="Bodde"/&gt; In 1958, though, after the formation of the European Union the job of the Bureaucrat became extremely important to help organize and govern such a large and diverse community. In 1961 the term [[Eurocrat]] was coined by [[Richard Mayne (administrator)|Richard Mayne]], a journalist at the time. A Eurocrat is a bureaucrat of the European Union.
# Modern Bureaucrat - Bureaucrats gained increasingly negative reputations throughout the second half of the 20th century. As populations grow it becomes harder for bureaucratic systems to work because it often involves a lot of paperwork, which increases processing times, which eventually will be nearly impossible to manage. The digital age and the Internet has revolutionized Bureaucrats and the modern Bureaucrat has a different skill set than before. Also, the internet lowers the corruption levels of some Bureaucratic entities such as the Police Force due to social media and [[pro–am]] journalism..

==Attributes of bureaucrats==
German sociologist [[Max Weber]] defined a bureaucratic official as the following:&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite book
|author =[[Max Weber]]
|title=Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft
|pages=650–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* He is personally free and appointed to his position on the basis of conduct.
* He exercises the authority delegated to him in accordance with impersonal rules, and his loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of his official duties.
* His appointment and job placement are dependent upon his technical qualifications.
* His administrative work is a full-time occupation.
* His work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.
* He must exercise his judgment and his skills, but his duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority. Ultimately he is responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice his personal judgment if it runs counter to his official duties.
* Bureaucratic control is the use of rules, regulations, and formal authority to guide performance. It includes such things as budgets, statistical reports, and performance appraisals to regulate behavior and results.

As an academic, [[Woodrow Wilson]], later a US President, professed in his 1887 article ''The Study of Administration'':&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Woodrow Wilson]]
|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=465
|title=The Study of Administration
|work=Political Science Quarterly
|volume=2

|date= June 1887
|pages=197–222
|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But to fear the creation of a domineering, illiberal officialism as a result of the studies I am here proposing is to miss altogether the principle upon which I wish most to insist. That principle is, that administration in the United States must be at all points sensitive to public opinion. A body of thoroughly trained officials serving during good behavior we must have in any case: that is a plain business necessity. But the apprehension that such a body will be anything un-American clears away the moment it is asked. What is to constitute good behavior? For that question obviously carries its own answer on its face. Steady, hearty allegiance to the policy of the government they serve will constitute good behavior. That policy will have no taint of officialism about it. It will not be the creation of permanent officials, but of statesmen whose responsibility to public opinion will be direct and inevitable. Bureaucracy can exist only where the whole service of the state is removed from the common political life of the people, its chiefs as well as its rank and file. Its motives, its objects, its policy, its standards, must be bureaucratic. It would be difficult to point out any examples of impudent exclusiveness and arbitrariness on the part of officials doing service under a chief of department who really served the people, as all our chiefs of departments must be made to do. It would be easy, on the other hand, to adduce other instances like that of the influence of [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein]] in Prussia, where the leadership of one statesman imbued with true public spirit transformed arrogant and perfunctory bureaux into public-spirited instruments of just government.}}

'''Business rule mining''' is the process of extracting essential intellectual business logic in the form of [[Business rule|Business Rules]] from packaged or [[Legacy software]] applications, recasting them in natural or formal language, and storing them in a source rule repository for further analysis or [[Forward_engineering#MDA_approach|forward engineering]]. The goal is to capture these legacy business rules in a way that the business can validate, control and change them over time. 

== Overview ==
Business rule mining supports a [[Business rules approach]], which is defined as a formal way of managing and automating an organization's business rules so that the business behaves and evolves as its leaders intend. 

It is also commonly conducted as part of an [[Software modernization|application modernization]] project evolving legacy software applications to [[service oriented architecture]] (SOA) solutions, transitioning to packaged software, redeveloping new in-house applications, or to facilitate knowledge retention and communication between business and [[Information technologies|IT]] professionals in a [[Software maintenance|maintenance]] environment.

== Alternative Approaches ==
Alternative approaches to rule mining are manual and automated. 

A manual approach involves the hand-writing of rules on the basis of subject matter expert interviews and the inspection of [[source code]], [[Batch processing|job flows]], [[data structure]]s and observed behavior. 

Manually extracting rules is complicated by the difficulty of locating and understanding highly interdependent logic that has been interwoven into millions of lines of software code.  

An automated approach utilizes repository-based software to locate logical connections inherent within applications and extract them into a predetermined business rules format.

With automation, an effective approach is to apply semantic structures to existing applications.  By overlaying business contexts onto legacy applications, rules miners can focus effort on discovering rules from systems that are valuable to the business.  Effort is redirected away from mining commoditized or irrelevant applications.  

Further, best practices &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rule_Mining_Best_Practices best practices]&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with various tool-assisted techniques of capturing programs’ semantics speeds the transformation of technical rules to true business rules.  Adding business semantics to the analysis process allows users to abstract technical concepts and descriptors that are normal in an application to a business level that is consumable by a rules analyst. 

System integrators, software vendors, rules mining practitioners, and in-house development teams have developed technologies, proprietary methodologies and industry-specific templates for application modernization and business rule mining.

'''Clive Ian Calder''' (born 13 December 1946) is a South African-born British [[billionaire]] record executive and businessman primarily known for co-founding the [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba Group]] with [[Ralph Simon]], and its subsidiary [[Jive Records]].

==Early life==
Calder was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, and grew up there, off [[Louis Botha Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izwi.com/emigretalent/onfolio-files/Clive%20Calder.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415160551/http://www.izwi.com/emigretalent/onfolio-files/Clive%20Calder.htm |date=15 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Calder started his first record company in 1971 in South Africa.  By 1975 they had relocated to London and had begun [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba]] as an artist and producer management company.  By 1978 Zomba had expanded to include publishing, and opened offices in New York City.  In 1981 they formed their first record label [[Jive Records|Jive]] and Calder began to create a name for Jive as an important outlet for hip hop and rap. 

Jive's success was followed by [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]] in 1988 and countless others throughout the nineties.  After an unspecified "ethical disagreement," Calder bought Simon's stake in Zomba and became the sole owner in 1990. In the late nineties, Jive expanded its success to include teen pop phenomenons such as [[Backstreet Boys]], [[*NSYNC]] and [[Britney Spears]], all of which topped the charts. In 2002 he sold [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba]] for US$2.74 billion to the German-based media group [[Bertelsmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html|title=History of Zomba Records Ltd. – FundingUniverse|work=fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was offered a position within the [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], he instead chose to stay on temporarily as an advisor during the integration period, but left the business in 2003. The Zomba Label Group, which had been founded by BMG as parent for all Zomba labels in 2004, was integrated with all its labels into [[RCA/Jive Label Group|BMG Label Group]] in 2007, while at the same time the Zomba brand ceased to exist. In 2009 the group was renamed as RCA/Jive Label Group under [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], in October 2011 [[Jive Records]], as well as the whole Jive brand, was discontinued, with their most artists being moved to [[RCA Records]] and partly to [[Epic Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-peter-edge-tom-corson-on-the-shuttering-1005394732.story|title=RCA's Peter Edge, Tom Corson on the Shuttering of Jive, J and Arista|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Calder is married, with two children, and lives in the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7482">'''Costică Canacheu''' (born  October 15, 1958) is a [[Romania]]n politician and businessman. A participant in the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], he has started his political career as a member of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), representing its successor, the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD) to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]]. Additionally, Canacheu is an activist supporting the official recognition of [[Aromanians]] as an [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]], being a founding member of the Aromanian Community Association ({{lang-ro|Asociaţia Comunităţii Aromânilor din România}}, ACAR) and the Aromanian Cultural Society (''Societatea Culturală Aromână''; [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]: ''Sutsata Culturala Armâneascâ'').

== Biography ==

Born to an Aromanian family in [[Budești]], [[Călăraşi County]], Canacheu graduated from the Electro-Energetic High School in [[Bucharest]], and worked as a [[technician]] between 1978 and 1989.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=250&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2004&amp;pag=0&amp;idl=1 Profile at the Chamber of Deputies site]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 2000, he was head of the Administrative Board for a Bucharest-based private enterprise, SC Neico Grup SA.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;

He was an active participant in the Bucharest protests that led to the fall of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] [[Communist Romania|Communist government]] (December 1989),&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="braileanu22"&gt;{{ro icon}} Răzvan Brăileanu, [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=765&amp;nr=2004-01-28 "Disidenţă, revoluţie, GDS" ("Dissidence, Revolution, GDS"), interview with Radu Filipescu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065106/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=765&amp;nr=2004-01-28 |date=2007-10-08 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the establishment of the FSN during February 1990, serving as a member of the FSN-based administration (CFSN, later CPUN) in [[Sector 1 (Bucharest)|Sector 1]] of the capital, and later as a member of the FSN Directory Council.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; In the [[Romanian legislative election, 1990|1990 election]], Canacheu won a seat in the [[Parliament of Romania|Constituent Assembly]] for Bucharest.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt; In this capacity, he notably initiated a legislative project regarding parliamentary control over intelligence agencies (namely, [[Serviciul Român de Informaţii]], SRI) and their archives.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, Canacheu was among a group of former revolutionaries who, citing concerns that granting revolutionary certificates and privileges had become an instrument of [[Political corruption|corruption]], formed the [[non-governmental organization]] ''Asociaţia Revoluţionarilor fără Privilegii'' (the Association of Non-Privileged Revolutionaries); other members include [[Ion Caramitru]], [[Dan Pavel]], [[Victor Rebengiuc]], and [[Radu Filipescu]].&lt;ref name="braileanu22" /&gt;

'''David Gamkrelidze''' or '''Davit Gamqrelidze''' ({{lang-ka|დავით გამყრელიძე}}) (born April 2, 1964 in [[Tbilisi]]), is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[politician]], leader of the [[New Right (Georgia)|New Rights Party of Georgia]], [[Parliament of Georgia|Member of Parliament]] since 1999, member of committee for defense and security, Chairman of the [[Centre-Right]] [[Rightist Opposition|Opposition]] Group in the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. He also contested the [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|2008 Georgian presidential election]] and came fourth with the 4.02% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cec.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=33&amp;info_id=4051 cec.gov.ge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929155654/http://www.cec.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=33&amp;info_id=4051 |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

David Gamkrelidze was born on April 2, 1964 in a family of [[Geologist]], [[Academician]] of [[Georgia’s Academy of Sciences]] and one of the most distinguished representatives of Georgian geological school Erekle Gamkrelidze and of Ia Gobronidze. His grandfather, Academician Petre Gamkrelidze was one of the founders of Georgian geological school.

David Gamkrelidze graduated from the Tbilisi 55th secondary school. In 1982 he became student of [[Tbilisi State Medical University]], Faculty of Pediatrics. He was a distinguished student, holder of Tarkhnishvili Scholarship, member of the Student’s Medical Council. He was a frequent participant of various students’ international conferences and Olympiads.

Since 1988 the “National movement” gained significant momentum among the majority of Georgian citizens; especially among the youth. The Georgian citizens began to demand independence and the country unraveled in massive protest demonstrations. In this hectic time, David Gamkrelidze, along with his friends, established the Christian-Democratic Association, which later was renamed into the Christian-Democratic Union.

David Gamkrelidze took active part in the March–April 1989 protest demonstrations against the [[Soviet Army]].

Right after the tragic events of April 9, 1989 several organizations were established, the Rustaveli Society among them, of which David Gamkrelidze was a member.

In the spring of 1989, with the purpose of coordinating the National Liberation Movement, the National Forum was established. The participants of the forum were Gia Chanturia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Irakli Batiashvili and others. The Christian-Democratic Union was represented at the Forum by David Gamkrelidze and Irakli Kakabadze. In June of the same year, the first delegation of the National Liberation Movement traveled to Paris to celebrate the Independence Day of Georgia at the invitation from the Georgian Diaspora living there. David Gamkrelidze was a member of the delegation as well.

==Entrepreneurship==

After the collapse of the [[Communist]] regime in 1990 and Georgia’s eventual re-gaining of independence, David Gamkrelidze concluded he had exhausted his function in the National Liberation Movement and moved to entrepreneurial activities. Along with his friends, he established the first ever insurance company in Georgia, the Aldagi. Very soon, Aldagi became the flagman of the insurance industry in Georgia. In 1999, David Gamkrelidze, as the President of Aldagi, was named among the ten most successful businessmen of Georgia.

==Political activity==

In 1998 he was elected member of the [[Tbilisi City Assembly]], local governing authority of the capital of Georgia.

For the then ruling party (Citizens’ Union of Georgia), in order to win the general elections badly needed a certain number of successful people in its electoral party list. David Gamkrelidze, who did not hold the membership of this party, agreed to take part in the elections along with other businessmen .

On October 31, 1999 David Gamkrelidze became member of the Parliament of Georgia. At the first session sitting, he got elected as chairman of the Healthcare and Social Issues Committee. Gradually, David Gamkrelidze and his friends realized that the ruling party did not actually care for their professionalism and commitment to the matters of national importance. The period of disenchantment began, which reached its peak in the spring of 2000. That was right after the ruling party presented to the Parliament the budget for ratification in 1999 and demanded from the majority of the party to endorse it.

David Gamkrelidze and Levan Gachechiladze resigned in sign of protest and called for creation of a committee that would investigate the budget deficit of 1999.

On May 17, 2000 a special commission was formed with David Gamkrelidze at the chairmanship to investigate the budget deficit of 1999. In six months, David Gamkrelidze presented to the Parliament a conclusion and said the whole truth as to what the reason for the 1999 drastic budget deficit in actuality was.

On September 8, 2000 with the purpose to overcome the critical situation prevalent in the country and in order to raise public awareness in this regard, 35 professionals established a public organization – the “New Movement”. David Gamkrelidze was one of its founders and an active member.
On September 17, 2000 the “New Faction” Group was formed in the Parliament. David Gamkrelidze was elected chairman of the group.
The “New Faction”, despite of its smallness, significantly changed the situation in the Parliament. It truly said a totally different and new word in Georgia’s politics.

==New Rights party==
On June 15, 2001 on the basis of the “New Faction”, New Movement and Georgian Neo-Conservative Party, a political party was created. The party was called the New Rights of Georgia. The founding congress elected David Gamkrelidze as its co-chairman.

In a year since its founding, the New Rights reached very high results for a party which was only a year’s old. On June 2, 2002 the New Rights won the first place in the local elections all across Georgia, and the third place on Tbilisi level. David Gamkrelidze contributed significantly to the success of the party. He personally headed the party’s election campaign. After winning the local elections, the party began to prepare for the upcoming parliamentary elections.

In September, 2002 David Gamkrelidze and his colleagues submitted to the Parliament of Georgia a decree regarding Georgia’s accession to NATO as a foreign policy priority, declaration was unanimously adopted. This was the first open statement about Georgia’s willingness to join NATO.

On June 27, 2003 at the Party 2nd Congress David Gamkrelidze was unanimously elected as chairman and leader.

The results of the parliamentary elections of November 2, 2003, in which the New Rights overcame the 7-percent threshold, were abolished. New general elections were called. There was very little time left before the March 28, 2004 elections. The revolutionary sentiments were gaining momentum. Therefore, everyone inside and outside of the country was sure that none of the opposition parties would be able to succeed. From the so-called non-revolutionary parties, only the New Rights were able to overcome the 7-percent barrier. They made a coalition with another party of centre-right orientation, the Industrials and consequently successfully overcame the 7-percent threshold. David Gamkrelidze was in charge of the Industrial’s and New Right’s election campaign on March 28, 2004 as well.

In April, 2004 David Gamkrelidze became member of the Parliament second time.

Currently, he is heading the Right Opposition Group; he is also member of the Defence and Security Committee as well as member of the Delegation to NATO Parliamentary Assembly. His opinion, as one of the most successful opposition leaders, is widely taken into account in the Western political circles.

On June 3, 2006 David Gamkrelidze was re-elected as the New Rights Party chairman at the 3rd Party Congress.

==January 2008 presidential elections==
On November 24, 2007 on the 4th Extraordinary Congress of the New Rights Party David Gamkrelidze was nominated as a candidate for early Presidential elections to be held on January 5, 2008. His candidature officially supported by four political parties (New Rights Party, Industrialists, National Democrats and Christian Democrats). He advocates the establishment of a constitutional monarchy through a referendum (''see also [[Monarchism in Georgia]]'').

==Family==
David Gamkrelidze has a wife, Marina Madichi and two children – Erekle and Nino.

He speaks Georgian, Russian and English.

'''Drummond Company, Inc.''' is a privately owned company based in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], United States, involved in the mining and processing of coal and coal products as well as oil and real estate.

==History==
[[Image:IMG 0474.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belt conveyor]] for coal transportation owned and operated by Drummond Company, located between the city of [[Santa Marta]] and the town of [[Ciénaga, Magdalena|Cienaga]] by the [[Caribbean sea]] in [[Colombia]].]]
The company was founded in [[Jasper, Alabama]] in 1935 by [[Heman Edward Drummond]], an Alabama coal miner.&lt;ref name="halloffame"&gt;[http://aehof.eng.ua.edu/members/drummond-company-inc/ State of Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame: DRUMMOND COMPANY INC.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/companies/drummond/ America's Largest Private Companies: #162 Drummond], ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ronnieblaircloseknit"&gt;Ronnie Blair, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19850512&amp;id=O61NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0vsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3825,5090847&amp;hl=en 'The Drummonds: Close-Knit, Self-Made Men'], Lakeland Ledger, May 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond started mining on land he inherited from his family; he used mules to drag coal out of the mines.&lt;ref name="halloffame"/&gt; When Drummond died in 1956, the company remained family-owned.&lt;ref name="halloffame"/&gt;

In 1970, the company signed a contract to sell coal to Japanese steel companies.&lt;ref name="forbesgarry"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/garry-drummond/ Forbes: Garry Drummond]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=July 2015}}

By 2009, the [[United States Department of Justice]] had not found sufficient evidence and ruled in favor of the company, concluding that it had never supported any action of illegal groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semana.com/mundo/estados-unidos/articulo/corte-federal-eeuu-falla-favor-drummond-dos-demandas-sindicatos-colombianos/109758-3 Corte Federal de EE.UU falla a favor de Drummond dos demandas de sindicatos colombianos]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2013, the company employed a workforce of 6,600, with annual sales of US$3 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; It was inducted into the [[Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="halloffame"/&gt;

In 2015, the Drummond Company sued attorneys Terrence P. Collingsworth and William R. Scherer, the advocacy group International Rights Advocates (IRAdvocates), and Dutch businessman [[Albert van Bilderbeek]], one of the owners of [[Llanos Oil]], accusing them of violating the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] by alleging that Drummond had worked alongside [[Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia]] to murder labor union leaders within proximity of their Colombian coal mines, which Drummond denies.&lt;ref name="alcomkentsued"&gt;Kent Faulk, [http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2015/04/drummond_sues_those_claiming_c.html Drummond sues those claiming coal company involved in Colombian deaths], ''The Birmingham News'', April 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, David Roberson, previously the company's vice-president of government affairs, was sentenced to "two-and-a-half years in prison, followed by one year of supervised release", and fined $25,000 for his July 2018 convictions, alongside those of attorney Joel Iverson Gilbert (formerly, a partner active in [[Balch &amp; Bingham]]'s Environmental and Natural Resources section), on "six criminal charges each relating to a scheme intended to stop expansion of a toxic cleanup site in Jefferson County by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]", through a bribe to former basketball player, then state legislator [[Oliver Robinson]] (who was also convicted), through use of his [[nonprofit organization]], The Oliver Robinson Foundation. Roberson maintained that he "trusted Joel" [Gilbert] and "never thought we were bribing Oliver Robinson."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2018/10/former-balch-lawyer-sentenced-to-federal-prison.html Hrynkiw, Ivana] "Former Drummond V.P. and Balch lawyer sentenced to federal prison", AL.com, Advance Local Media LLC., October 23, 2018.

[[File:ERP Modules.png|500px|thumb|right|Diagram showing some typical ERP modules]]

'''Enterprise resource planning''' ('''ERP''') is the integrated management of core business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology.

ERP is usually referred to as a category of business-[[management]] software — typically a suite of integrated [[application software|application]]s—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from these many [[business sector|business]] activities.

ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated  view of core business processes using common [[database]]s maintained by a [[database management system]]. ERP systems track business resources—cash, [[raw material]]s, [[production capacity]]—and the status of business commitments: orders, [[purchase order]]s, and [[payroll]]. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, [[accounting]], etc.) that provide the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JEIM-03-2015-0024|title=Antecedents of ERP systems implementation success: a study on Jordanian healthcare sector|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=549|last=Almajali|first=Dmaithan|date=|website=|publisher=Emeralad|access-date=|accessdate=January 6, 2016|doi=10.1108/JEIM-03-2015-0024|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Radovilsky |first=Zinovy |editor-last=Bidgoli |editor-first=Hossein |year=2004 |title=The Internet Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |page=707 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACfBmYiNaTcC&amp;pg=PA707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise system software is a multibillion-dollar industry that produces components supporting a variety of business functions. IT investments have become the largest category of capital expenditure in United States-based businesses over the past{{which|date=November 2015}} decade. Though early ERP systems focused on large enterprises, smaller enterprises increasingly use ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubina Adam, Paula Kotze, Alta van der Merwe. 2011. Acceptance of enterprise resource planning systems by small manufacturing Enterprises. In: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, edited by Runtong Zhang, José Cordeiro, Xuewei Li, Zhenji Zhang and Juliang Zhang, SciTePress, p. 229 - 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The ERP system integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. However, developing an ERP system differs from traditional system development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaul | first1 = L. | last2 = Tauber | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = CSFs along ERP life-cycle in SMEs: a field study | url = | journal = Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems | volume = 112 | issue = 3| pages = 360–384 | doi=10.1108/02635571211210031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ERP systems run on a variety of [[computer hardware]] and [[Computer network|network]] configurations, typically using a [[database]] as an [[information repository]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Gartner Group first used the abbreviation ERP in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2583660/e-commerce/extended-erp-technology-reborn-in-b2b.html|title=Extended ERP technology reborn in B2B|last=InfoWorld|first=Heather Harreld,|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Vision of Next Generation MRP II", Scenario S-300-339, Gartner Group, April 12, 1990{{Third-party-inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend upon the capabilities of [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), and the later [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last= Anderegg |first= Travis |title= MRP/MRPII/ERP/ERM&amp;nbsp;— Confusing Terms and Definitions for a Murkey Alphabet Soup |url= http://wiki.wlug.org.nz/EnterpriseSpeak |accessdate= September 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.erp.com/component/content/article/324-erp-archive/4407-erp.html |title= ERP|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[computer-integrated manufacturing]]. Without replacing these terms, ERP came to represent a larger whole that reflected the evolution of application integration beyond manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheilds |first=Mureell G. |title=E-Business and ERP: Rapid Implementation and Project Planning |year=2005 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all ERP packages developed from a manufacturing core; ERP vendors variously began assembling their packages with finance-and-accounting, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], and human-resource components. By the mid-1990s ERP systems addressed all core enterprise functions. Governments and non–profit organizations also began to use ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=SI |last=Chang |author2=Guy Gable |author3= Errol Smythe |author4= Greg Timbrell  |conference= International Conference on Information Systems |title= A Delphi examination of public sector ERP implementation issues |pages= 494–500 |publisher= [[Association for Information Systems]] |year= 2000 |location= Atlanta |url= http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359640.359793|accessdate= September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==

ERP systems experienced rapid growth in the 1990s. Because of the [[year 2000 problem]] and the introduction of the [[euro]] that disrupted legacy systems, many companies took the opportunity to replace their old systems with ERP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thin Enterprise Resource Planning |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |location=Boston |edition=Second |isbn=0-619-21663-8 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP systems initially focused on automating [[back office]] functions that did not directly affect [[customer]]s and the public. [[Front office]] functions, such as [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), dealt directly with customers, or [[electronic business|e-business]] systems such as [[e-commerce]], [[e-government]], e-telecom, and [[e-finance]]—or [[Supply chain management|supplier relationship management]] (SRM) became integrated later, when the internet simplified communicating with external parties.&lt;ref name="HaymanERP00"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ERP in the Internet Economy |journal=Information Systems Frontiers |author=Hayman, L. |volume=2000 |issue=2 |pages=137–139 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1026595923192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ERP II" was coined in 2000 in an article by Gartner Publications entitled ''ERP Is Dead—Long Live ERP II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=B. Bond, Y. Genovese, D. Miklovic, N. Wood, B. Zrimsek, N. Rayner, ERP Is Dead — Long Live ERP II; GartnerGroup RAS Services, SPA-12-0420 4 October 2000 
|url=http://www.sunlike.com.cn/internet/onlineerp/images/Long%20live%20ERPII%20By%20Gartner%20Group.pdf |accessdate=February 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=ERP: What you need to ask before you buy |url=http://www.projectauditors.com/Papers/Buying_An_ERP_System/ERP_Purchasing_the_right_ERP_package_3.php |publisher=projectauditors.com |accessdate=April 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes web–based software that provides real–time access to ERP systems to employees and partners (such as suppliers and customers). The ERP II role expands traditional ERP resource optimization and [[transaction processing]]. Rather than just manage buying, selling, etc.—ERP II leverages information in the resources under its management to help the enterprise collaborate with other enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/bae/people/holderness/readings/ERP_is_Dead--Long_Live_ERP_II.pdf |title=The Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG—Exceptional Problem Solvers |publisher=Uncg.edu |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ERP II is more flexible than the first generation ERP. Rather than confine ERP system capabilities within the organization, it goes beyond the corporate walls to interact with other systems. Enterprise application suite is an alternate name for such systems. ERP II systems are typically used to enable collaborative initiatives such as [[Supply chain management|supply chain management (SCM)]], [[Customer relationship management|customer relationship management (CRM)]], and [[Business intelligence|business intelligence (BI)]] among business partner organizations through the use of various [[Electronic business|e-business technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles Møller|date=August 1, 2005|title=ERP II: a conceptual framework for next‐generation enterprise systems?|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17410390510609626|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=18|issue=4|pages=483–497|doi=10.1108/17410390510609626|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruhi|first=Umar|date=July 1, 2016|title=An experiential learning pedagogical framework for enterprise systems education in business schools|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811716300222|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|volume=14|issue=2|pages=198–211|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2016.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers now make more effort to integrate mobile devices with the ERP system. ERP vendors are extending ERP to these devices, along with other business applications. Technical stakes of modern ERP concern integration—hardware, applications, networking, supply chains. ERP now covers more functions and roles—including [[decision making]], stakeholders' relationships, [[standardization]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[globalization]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaul | first1 = L. | last2 = Tauber | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Critical Success Factors in Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Review of the Last Decade | doi = 10.1145/2501654.2501669 | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 45 | issue = 4| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
ERP  systems typically include the following characteristics:
* An integrated system 
* Operates in (or near) real time
* A common database that supports all the applications
* A consistent look and feel across modules
* Installation of the system with elaborate application/data integration by the Information Technology (IT) department, provided the implementation is not done in small steps&lt;ref&gt;Sheilds, Mureell G., E-Business and ERP: Rapid Implementation and Project Planning. (2001) John Wiley and Sons, Inc. p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deployment options include: [[on-premises]], cloud hosted, or [[SaaS]]

==Functional areas==
An ERP system covers the following common functional areas. In many ERP systems, these are called and grouped together as ERP modules:
* [[Finance &amp; Accounting]]: [[General Ledger]],  [[Fixed assets|Fixed Assets]], [[Accounts Payable|payables]] including vouchering, matching and payment,  [[Accounts Receivable|receivables]] Cash Management and collections, [[cash management]],  [[Consolidation (business)|Financial Consolidation]]
* [[Management Accounting]]: [[Budgeting]], Costing, [[cost management]], [[activity based costing]]
* [[Human resources]]: [[Recruitment|Recruiting]], [[training]], [[Schedule (workplace)|rostering]], [[payroll]], [[Employee benefit|benefits]], [[Pensions|retirement and pension plans]], [[Diversity (business)|diversity management]], [[retirement]], [[Employee exit management|separation]]
* Manufacturing: [[Engineering]], [[bill of materials]], work orders, [[scheduling]], [[capacity utilization|capacity]], [[workflow management system|workflow management]], [[quality control]], manufacturing process, manufacturing projects, manufacturing flow,  [[product life cycle management]]
* Order Processing: [[Order to cash]], order entry, credit checking, [[pricing]], available to promise, [[inventory]], [[shipping]], sales analysis and reporting, sales commissioning.
* [[Supply chain management]]: Supply chain planning, supplier scheduling, [[product configurator]], [[order to cash]], [[purchasing]], [[inventory]], claim processing, [[warehousing]] (receiving, putaway, [[Order picking|picking]] and [[Packaging and labeling|packing]]).
* [[Project management]]: Project planning, resource planning, project costing, [[work breakdown structure]], [[Invoice|billing]], time and expense, performance units, activity management
* Customer relationship management: Sales and marketing, commissions, service, customer contact, [[call center]] support&amp;nbsp;— CRM systems are not always considered part of ERP systems but rather Business Support systems (BSS).
* Data services : Various "self–service" interfaces for customers, suppliers and/or employees

=== GRP ===
Government resource planning (GRP) is the equivalent of an ERP for the [[public sector]] and an  integrated office automation system for government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;
Yunliang, Xiongtao, Qing, Jing and  Ning (2010) "Design of E-Government Information Management Platform Based on SOA Framework", 2010 First International Conference on Networking and Distributed Computing, Hangzhou, doi:10.1109/ICNDC.2010.42.&lt;/ref&gt; The software structure, modularization, core algorithms and main interfaces do not differ from other ERPs, and ERP software suppliers manage to adapt their systems to government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Kern and Havenhand (2000) "ERP Critical Success Factors: an exploration of the contextual factors in public sector institutions", Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Gable, Smythe and Timbrell (2000) "A Delphi examination of public sector ERP implementation issues" Proceedings of ICIS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebrahim | first1 = Zakareya | last2 = Irani | first2 = Zahir | year = 2005 | title = E‐government adoption: architecture and barriers | url = | journal = Business Process Management Journal | volume =  11| issue = 5| pages =  589–611| doi = 10.1108/14637150510619902 | citeseerx =10.1.1.453.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both system implementations, in private and public organizations, are adopted to improve productivity and overall business performance in organizations, but comparisons (private vs. public) of implementations shows that the main factors influencing ERP implementation success in the public sector are cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Wingreen, Maryam  and Hritik (2014) "An Investigation into Enterprise Resource Planning Implementation Success: Evidence from Private and Public Sector Organizations", [http://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2014/339 PACIS 2014/339].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2860.pdf Shafqat, Enhong and Faisal (2012)], "Enterprise Resource Planning - 'real blessing' or 'a blessing in disguise': an exploration of the contextual factors in public sector"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coelho | first1 = Cunha | last2 = Meirelles | first2 =  | year = 2015 | title = The client-consultant relationship in the implementation of ERP in government: exploring the dynamic between power and knowledge | url = | journal = DGO | volume =  | issue = | pages = 140 | page =  | doi = 10.1145/2757401.2757405 | isbn = 9781450336000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
* [[Database transaction|Transactional database]]
* Management portal/[[dashboard (business)|dashboard]]
* People
* Software

==Best practices==
Most ERP systems incorporate [[best practice]]s. This means the software reflects the vendor's interpretation of the most effective way to perform each business process. Systems vary in how conveniently the customer can modify these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Ellen and Wagner, Brett."Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning" 3rd.ed.Course Technology Cengage Learning.Boston, Massachusetts.2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, best practices reduced risk by 71% compared to other software implementations.&lt;ref&gt;"Enhanced Project Success Through SAP Best Practices&amp;nbsp;– International Benchmarking Study". {{ISBN|1-59229-031-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of best practices eases compliance with requirements such as [[IFRS]], [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], or [[Basel II]]. They can also help comply with de facto industry standards, such as [[electronic funds transfer]]. This is because the procedure can be readily codified within the ERP software and replicated with confidence across multiple businesses who share that business requirement.&lt;ref name="IngolfoEstab11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Establishing Regulatory Compliance for Software Requirements |journal=Conceptual Modeling - ER 2011 | last1=Ingolfo | first1=S. | last2=Siena | first2=A. | last3=Mylopoulos | first3=J. |pages=47–61 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24606-7_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSITSys"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metricstream.com/insights/IT_sys_val.htm |title=IT Systems Validation for SOx and Regulatory Compliance |work=Insights |publisher=MetricStream, Inc |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity to plant floor information==
ERP systems connect to real–time data and transaction data in a variety of ways. These systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator]]s, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.

'''Direct integration'''—ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.

'''Database integration'''—ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.

'''[[Enterprise appliance transaction module]]s (EATM)'''—These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system–specific program interfaces ([[Api|APIs]]). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off–the–shelf solution.

'''Custom–integration solutions'''—Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom–integrated solutions typically run on [[workstation]] or server-class computers.

==Implementation==
ERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.&lt;ref name="tech-faq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/erp.shtml |title=ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) |publisher=Tech-faq.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes—consulting, customization, and support.&lt;ref name="tech-faq.com" /&gt; Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project. Modular ERP systems can be implemented in stages. The typical project for a large enterprise takes about 14 months and requires around 150 consultants.&lt;ref name="carl.sandiego.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Critical Issues Affecting an ERP Implementation |url=http://carl.sandiego.edu/gba573/critical_issues_affecting_an_erp.htm |publisher=Auerbach Publications |work=Information Systems Management |volume=16 |issue=3 |page=7 |year=1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103032912/http://carl.sandiego.edu/gba573/critical_issues_affecting_an_erp.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small projects can require months; multinational and other large implementations can take years.&lt;ref name="SankarImplement06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVS9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Implementation Strategies for SAP R/3 in a Multinational Organization: Lessons from a Real-World Case Study |last1=Sankar |first1=C. |last2=Rau |first2=K.-H. |publisher=Cybertech Publishing |page=8 |year=2006 |isbn=9781591407782 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PelphreyDirecting15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJO9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Directing the ERP Implementation: A Best Practice Guide to Avoiding Program Failure Traps While Tuning System Performance |author=Pelphrey, M.W. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=92–111 |year=2015 |isbn=9781482248425}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mass customization|Customization]] can substantially increase implementation times.&lt;ref name="carl.sandiego.edu" /&gt;

Besides that, information processing influences various business functions e.g. some large corporations like [[Wal-Mart]] use a [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] inventory system. This reduces inventory storage and increases delivery efficiency, and requires up-to-date data. Before 2014, Walmart used a system called Inforem developed by [[IBM]] to manage replenishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitywire.com/node/31165 |title=Wal-Mart slow to roll out new replenishment system |publisher=Thecitywire.com |location=Arkansas |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process preparation===
Implementing ERP typically requires changes in existing business processes.&lt;ref&gt;Turban et al. (2008). ''Information Technology for Management, Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy''. Massachusetts: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., pp. 300–343. {{ISBN|978-0-471-78712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor understanding of needed process changes prior to starting implementation is a main reason for project failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. | last2 = Vessey | first2 = I. | title = Managing the Next Wave of Enterprise Systems: Leveraging Lessons from ERP | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly Executive | volume = 2 | issue = 1| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties could be related to the system, business process, infrastructure, training, or lack of motivation.

It is therefore crucial that organizations thoroughly analyze business processes before they implement ERP software. Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:
* Linking current processes to the organization's strategy
* Analyzing the effectiveness of each process
* Understanding existing automated solutions&lt;ref&gt;King. W., "Ensuring ERP implementation success," ''Information Systems Management'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf, Y., A. Gunasekaran, and M. Abthorpe, "Enterprise Information Systems Project Implementation: A Case Study of ERP in Rolls-Royce," ''International Journal of Production Economics'', 87(3), February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP implementation is considerably more difficult (and politically charged) in decentralized organizations, because they often have different processes, business rules, data semantics, authorization hierarchies, and decision centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Requirements Engineering for Cross-organizational ERP Implementation: Undocumented Assumptions and Potential Mismatches | first1=Maya |last1=Daneva |author2=Roel Wieringa |author2-link=Roel Wieringa |publisher=University of Twente |url=http://www.vital-project.org/papers/Daneva-Wieringa-Camera-Ready-RE-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may require migrating some business units before others, delaying implementation to work through the necessary changes for each unit, possibly reducing integration (e.g., linking via [[Master data management]]) or customizing the system to meet specific needs.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Davenport 1998"&gt;Thomas H. Davenport, "Putting the Enterprise into the Enterprise System", ''Harvard Business Review'', July–August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential disadvantage is that adopting "standard" processes can lead to a loss of [[competitive advantage]]. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Turban et al. (2008). ''Information Technology for Management, Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy''. Massachusetts: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 320. {{ISBN|978-0-471-78712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Dehning|Dehning, B.]] and T.Stratopoulos, 'Determinants of a Sustainable Competitive Advantage Due to an IT-enabled Strategy,' Journal of Strategic Information Systems, Vol. 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Configuration===
Configuring an ERP system is largely a matter of balancing the way the organization wants the system to work with the way it was designed to work. ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting—[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO or LIFO]]—to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Davenport 1998"/&gt;

===Two tier enterprise resource planning===

Two-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company’s customers. Each independent center or subsidiary may have its own [[business model]]s, [[workflow]]s, and [[business process]]es.

Given the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.&lt;ref name="ferdows"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferdows | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Making the most of foreign factories | url = | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 73–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model—separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems. Since these smaller companies' processes and workflows are not tied to main company's processes and workflows, they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations.&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;Gill, R. (2011). "The rise of two-tier ERP." ''Strategic Finance'', 93(5), 35-40, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that affect enterprises' adoption of two-tier ERP systems include:
* Manufacturing globalization, the economics of sourcing in emerging economies
* Potential for quicker, less costly ERP implementations at subsidiaries, based on selecting software more suited to smaller companies
* Extra effort, (often involving the use of [[Enterprise application integration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/system-centric-bpms.html#Back-End_EAI |title=Technical Workflows |publisher=[[CEITON]] |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is required where data must pass between two ERP systems&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Nigel (2010).[http://www.gartner.com/id=1412121 "Two-Tier ERP Suite Strategy: Considering Your Options."] Gartner Group. July 28, 2010. Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-tier ERP strategies give enterprises agility in responding to market demands and in aligning IT systems at a corporate level while inevitably resulting in more systems as compared to one ERP system used throughout the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kovacs | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Paganelli | first2 = P. | year = 2003 | title = A planning and management infrastructure for large, complex, distributed projects&amp;nbsp;— beyond ERP and SCM | url = http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~sa_hashemi/My Teachings/MS-CEIT-Supply Chain Management/W-Selected Papers for class seminars-last/scm-pm-A planning and management infrastructure for large%2C complex%2Cdistributed projects-beyond ERP and SCM.pdf| journal = Computers in Industry | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 165–165 | doi=10.1016/s0166-3615(03)00034-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customization===
ERP systems are theoretically based on industry best practices, and their makers intend that organizations deploy them "as is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraemmerand|first=P.|title=ERP implementation: an integrated process of radical change and continuous learning|journal=Production Planning &amp; Control|year=2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=228–248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vilpola|first=Inka Heidi|title=A method for improving ERP implementation success by the principles and process of user-centred design|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=47–76|doi=10.1080/17517570701793848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERP vendors do offer customers configuration options that let organizations incorporate their own business rules, but gaps in features often remain even after configuration is complete.

ERP customers have several options to reconcile feature gaps, each with their own pros/cons. Technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software, writing a homegrown module to work within the ERP system, or interfacing to an external system. These three options constitute varying degrees of system customization—with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain.&lt;ref name="Fryling 2010 391–421"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Estimating the impact of enterprise resource planning project management decisions on post-implementation maintenance costs: a case study using simulation modelling|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=391–421|doi=10.1080/17517575.2010.519785|bibcode=2010EntIS...4..391F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, there are non-technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered ERP feature set. Key differences between customization and configuration include:

* Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).
* The software is designed to handle various configurations, and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.
* The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.
* Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre–defined "hooks" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting. Other customizations (e.g., those involving changes to fundamental data structures) are overwritten during upgrades and must be re-implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yakovlev|first=I.V.|title=An ERP implementation and business process reengineering at a Small University|journal=Educause Quarterly|year=2002|volume=2|pages=52–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customization advantages include that it:
* Improves user acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Total Cost of Ownership, System Acceptance and Perceived Success of Enterprise Resource Planning Software: Simulating a Dynamic Feedback Perspective of ERP in the Higher Education Environment|year=2010|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database|isbn=978-1-109-74428-6|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offers the potential to obtain competitive advantage vis-à-vis companies using only standard features

Customization disadvantages include that it may:
* Increase time and resources required to implement and maintain&lt;ref name="Fryling 2010 391–421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZRqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Modern ERP: Select, Implement, &amp; Use Today's Advanced Business Systems |author=Bradford, M. |pages=107–108 |year=2015 |isbn=9781312665989 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hinder seamless interfacing/integration between suppliers and customers due to the differences between systems&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15" /&gt;
* Limit the company's ability to upgrade the ERP software in the future&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15" /&gt;
* Create over reliance on customization, undermining the principles of ERP as a standardizing software platform

===Extensions===
ERP systems can be extended with third–party software, often via vendor-supplied interfaces.&lt;ref name="BendolyStrat05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOHQvgpeNYC&amp;pg=PA95 |title=Strategic ERP Extension and Use |last1=Bendoly |first1=E. |last2=Jacobs |first2=F.R. |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=95 |year=2005 |isbn=9780804750981 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeonERP08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95QiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171 |title=ERP Demystified |author=Leon, A. |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |pages=170–171 |year=2008 |isbn=9780070656642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions offer features such as:&lt;ref name="LeonERP08" /&gt;
* product data management
* product life cycle management
* customer relations management
* [[data mining]]
* e-procurement

===Data migration===
[[Data migration]] is the process of moving, copying, and restructuring data from an existing system to the ERP system. Migration is critical to implementation success and requires significant planning. Unfortunately, since migration is one of the final activities before the production phase, it often receives insufficient attention. The following steps can structure migration planning:&lt;ref name="RamaswamyData07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.ittoolbox.com/white-papers/backoffice/erp/data-migration-strategies-in-erp-4620/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030160728/http://research.ittoolbox.com/white-papers/backoffice/erp/data-migration-strategies-in-erp-4620/ |title=Data Migration Strategy in ERP |author=Ramaswamy, V.K. |publisher=Information Technology Toolbox, Inc |date=27 September 2007 |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identify the data to be migrated.
* Determine the migration timing.
* Generate data migration templates for key data components
* Freeze the toolset.
* Decide on the migration-related setup of key business accounts.
* Define [[data archiving]] policies and procedures.

Often, data migration is incomplete because some of the data in the existing system is either incompatible or not needed in the new system. As such, the existing system may need to be kept as an archived database to refer back to once the new ERP system is in place.&lt;ref name="RamaswamyData07" /&gt;

===Advantages===
The most fundamental advantage of ERP is that the integration of myriad business processes saves time and expense. Management can make decisions faster and with fewer errors. Data becomes visible across the organization. Tasks that benefit from this integration include:&lt;ref name="MeerBest05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YaMB6tOd5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Best Practices in ERP Software Applications |author=Meer, K.H. |pages=59 |year=2005 |isbn=0595345131 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sales forecasting, which allows [[inventory optimization]].
* Chronological history of every transaction through relevant data compilation in every area of operation.
* [[Order tracking]], from acceptance through fulfillment
* Revenue tracking, from [[invoice]] through cash receipt
* Matching [[purchase order]]s (what was ordered), inventory receipts (what arrived), and [[cost]]ing (what the vendor invoiced)

ERP systems centralize business data, which:
* Eliminates the need to synchronize changes between multiple systems—consolidation of finance, marketing, sales, human resource, and manufacturing applications
* Brings legitimacy and transparency to each bit of statistical data
* Facilitates standard [[Product naming convention|product naming/coding]]
* Provides a comprehensive enterprise view (no "islands of information"), making real–time information available to management anywhere, anytime to make proper decisions
* Protects sensitive data by consolidating multiple security systems into a single structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katherine |last=Walsh |url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/216940/The_ERP_Security_Challenge |title=The ERP Security Challenge |work=CSOonline |publisher=CXO Media Inc |date=January 2009 |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===

* ERP can improve quality and efficiency of the business. By keeping a company's internal business processes running smoothly, ERP can lead to better outputs that may benefit the company, such as in customer service and manufacturing.
* ERP  supports upper level management by providing information for decision making.
* ERP creates a more agile company that adapts better to change. It also makes a company more flexible and less rigidly structured so organization components operate more cohesively, enhancing the business—internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=James|title=Management Information Systems(MIS)|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Irwin|location=New York|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ERP can improve data security in a closed environment. A common control system, such as the kind offered by ERP systems, allows organizations the ability to more easily ensure key company data is not compromised. This changes, however, with a more open environment, requiring further scrutiny of ERP security features and internal company policies regarding security.&lt;ref name="SheSecurity07"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems |journal=Information Systems Security |last1=She |first1=W. |last2=Thuraisingham |first2=B. |volume=16 |pages=152–163 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10658980701401959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ERP provides increased opportunities for [[collaboration]]. Data takes many forms in the modern enterprise, including documents, files, forms, audio and video, and [[email]]s. Often, each data medium has its own mechanism for allowing collaboration. ERP provides a collaborative platform that lets employees spend more time collaborating on content rather than mastering the learning curve of communicating in various formats across distributed systems.&lt;ref name="LeonERP08" /&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* Customization can be problematic. Compared to the best-of-breed approach, ERP can be seen as meeting an organization’s lowest common denominator needs, forcing the organization to find workarounds to meet unique demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Joanna |url=http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/audio-best-of-breed-vs-erp-whats-higher-ed-today/ |title=AUDIO &amp;#124; Best-of-Breed vs. ERP: What’s Best for Higher Ed Today? |publisher=The EvoLLLution |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Business process re-engineering|Re-engineering business processes]] to fit the ERP system may damage competitiveness or divert focus from other critical activities.
* ERP can cost more than less integrated or less comprehensive solutions.
* High ERP [[switching cost]]s can increase the ERP vendor's negotiating power, which can increase support, maintenance, and upgrade expenses.
* Overcoming resistance to sharing sensitive information between departments can divert management attention.

== Postmodern ERP ==
The term "postmodern ERP" was coined by [[Gartner]] in 2013, when it first appeared in the paper series "Predicts 2014".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2633315/predicts--rise-postmodern-erp|title=Predicts 2014: The Rise of the Postmodern ERP and Enterprise Applications World|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gartner's definition of the postmodern ERP strategy, [[Legacy system|legacy]], [[Monolithic system|monolithic]] and highly customized ERP suites, in which all parts are heavily reliant on each other, should sooner or later be replaced by a mixture of both cloud-based and on-premises applications, which are more loosely coupled and can be easily exchanged if needed.

The basic idea is that there should still be a core ERP solution that would cover most important business functions, while other functions will be covered by specialist software solutions that merely extend the core ERP. This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3171517/postmodern-erp-strategy-bestofbreed-approach|title=Postmodern ERP Strategy Is Not a Best-of-Breed Approach|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to software implementation, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.

There is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP [[On-premises software|on-premises]]. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.

The main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enterprise-resource-planning.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/5-factors-facilitating-the-transition-to-the-postmodern-erp-era-nid-7292-cid-96.html|title=5 Factors Facilitating the Transition to the Postmodern ERP Era|newspaper=CIOReview|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional [[Application Integration Architecture|integration]] challenges for the central IT.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Giancarlo Livraghi'''  (25 November 1927 – 22 February 2014) was an Italian author and advertising executive.

Born in [[Milan]] and graduated in philosophy at the [[University of Milan]], while studying he had started working as a reporter, an editor and a bibliographer. His first full-time job began in 1952, when he joined as a [[copywriter]] in the CPV agency (Italian headquarters of Colman, Prentis and Varley) becoming a short time later the creative director of the agency. He worked for many major Italian and international companies of the advertising industry, also holding institutional positions.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vittorio Pasteris|title=È morto Giancarlo Livraghi, uno dei grandi della pubblicità e della Rete italiana|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/02/27/e-morto-giancarlo-livraghi-uno-dei-grandi-della-pubblicita/895856/|accessdate=10 October 2014|newspaper=[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a scholar, starting from the 1990s Livraghi studied and analyzed in several publications the values of human communication via [[internet]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;  He was co-founder, with [[Andrea Mazzucchi]], and first president of ALCEI, initially conceived as the Italian branch of [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALCEI|url=http://www.alcei.it/|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Groton Iron Works''' was a company formed in 1917 to build cargo ships for the [[United States Shipping Board]] during [[World War I]].  The company owned two shipyards: one in [[Noank, Connecticut]] for wooden ships; and the other in [[Groton, Connecticut]] for steel ships.&lt;ref name="Shipbuilding History"/&gt;  The focus of this article is the [[Groton, Connecticut]] yard.

==Early property ownership==
In 1916, Harry C. Rowe sold his 30-acre estate at Eastern Point to [[Charles W. Morse]].&lt;ref name="Rowe"/&gt; [[Charles W. Morse]] was president of United States Steamship Company,&lt;ref name="Morse 1088"/&gt; which was the parent company of '''Groton Iron Works''' and Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation.&lt;ref name="Morse 1237"/&gt; 4,993 shares of the 5,000 total shares of '''Groton Iron Works''' stock was owned by United States Steamship Company.&lt;ref name="CLXXIII"/&gt; Qualifying shares were owned by the following: four shares by C.W. Morse and his three sons; one by Mr. Guggenheim; one by Mr. Loft; one unknown.&lt;ref name="CLXXIIV"/&gt; $3,500,000 was spent to construct '''Groton Iron Works''', which employed 3,600 men.&lt;ref name="CXXXVI"/&gt;

==Groton Iron Works officers==
E.A. Morse, President &lt;ref name="Morse 1122"/&gt;

H.F. Morse, Vice President &lt;ref name="Morse 1131"/&gt;

B.W. Morse, Secretary &lt;ref name="Morse 1061"/&gt;

==Steel cargo ship contracts==
[[Emergency Fleet Corporation]] contract #57 S.C. for six 8,800 dead-weight ton steamers was signed 11 August 1917.&lt;ref name="CW Morse Contracts"/&gt;

[[Emergency Fleet Corporation]] contract #225 S.C. for six 9,400 dead-weight ton steamers was signed 20 April 1918.  Three were eventually canceled due to the end of the war.&lt;ref name="CW Morse Contracts"/&gt;

==Subsequent property uses==
[[File:Victory Yard Aerial.jpg|thumb|The yard in 1943]]
On 23 July 1922, the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] leased the property for use as a [[locomotive]] repair facility.&lt;ref name="Leases Groton Iron Works"/&gt;

On 30 January 1926, [[Hickman Sea Sled]] announced the lease of the jointer shop building.&lt;ref name="Sea Sled"/&gt;

On 25 January 1927, Atlantic Coast Fisheries purchased the northern section of the property from Boston Iron and Metal Company,&lt;ref name="Boston Iron"/&gt; to fillet, freeze and package haddock.  In 1929 they purchased the remaining property, then sold some to [[Shell Oil Company]] for the construction of a distributing center with seven tanks.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Coast"/&gt;

In January, 1941, a syndicate headed by Alfred Holter purchased most of the property, intending to build freighters for Britain.&lt;ref name="Time Holter"/&gt; Purchase price was $550,000 cash.&lt;ref name="Petersburg Holter"/&gt;

On 5 February 1942, the US Navy purchased the property from Alfred Holter and [[Shell Oil Company]] for $222,000 using condemnation proceedings.&lt;ref name="US Navy"/&gt; $9.5 million was spent to construct the [[Victory Yard]], where [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] began building submarines on 22 July 1942.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; On 3 November 1943 a Federal Court Committee awarded an additional $203,000 to the former owners.&lt;ref name="Federal Court"/&gt;

On 13 January 1945, [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] announced that $3,000,000 will be spent to convert the [[Victory Yard]] to manufacture 105mm shells.&lt;ref name="Lewiston Shells"/&gt;

'''Horace Finaly''' (30 May 1871, [[Budapest]] – 19 May 1945, New York City) French banker, was director general of the [[BNP Paribas|Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas]] ([[Paribas]]) between 1919 and 1937. It imposed its policy and philosophy of its business by the enormous power which had directed the bank.

== Biography ==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 93 - Finaly 01.jpg|thumb|Family Chapel Hugo Finaly.]]
He was born on 30 May 1871 in [[Budapest]] and studied at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] and passed a law degree in Paris University. He died in New York on 19 May 1945, but his remains are to [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, not far from where he was one of the gentlemen of the time.

== History ==
As early as the 1920s, the concept of using hot water and alkali catalysts to produce oil out of biomass was proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of Oil from Plant Material|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2573/309|journal = Science|date = 1944-04-21|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17737216|pages = 309–312|volume = 99|issue = 2573|doi = 10.1126/science.99.2573.309|first = E.|last = Berl|bibcode = 1944Sci....99..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the foundation of later HTL technologies that attracted research interest especially during the 1970s oil embargo. It was around that time that a high-pressure (hydrothermal) liquefaction process was developed at the Pittsburgh Energy Research Center (PERC) and later demonstrated (at the 100&amp;nbsp;kg/h scale) at the Albany Biomass Liquefaction Experimental Facility at Albany, Oregon, US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; In 1982, Shell Oil developed the HTU™ process in the
Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Other organizations that have previously demonstrated HTL of biomass include Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg, Germany, SCF Technologies in Copenhagen, Denmark, EPA’s Water Engineering Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, and Changing World Technology Inc. (CWT), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Today, technology companies such as [http://www.licella.com.au Licella/Ignite Energy Resources] (Australia), [http://www.altacaenerji.com/en/ Altaca Energy] (Turkey), [http://steeperenergy.com/ Steeper Energy] (Denmark, Canada), and [http://nabrosenergy.in/ Nabros Energy] (India) continue to explore the commercialization of HTL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://task39.org/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf|title = The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels|date = July 2014|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = A report by IEA Bioenergy Task 39|author1=Sergios Karatzos |author2=James D.

== Chemical reactions ==
In hydrothermal liquefaction processes, long carbon chain molecules in biomass are thermally cracked and oxygen is removed in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (dehydration) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (decarboxylation). These reactions result in the production of high H/C ratio bio-oil. Simplified descriptions of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions can be found in the literature (e.g. Asghari and Yoshida (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in sub-critical water over heterogeneous zirconium phosphate catalysts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621506003363|journal = Carbohydrate Research|date = 2006-10-16|pages = 2379–2387|volume = 341|issue = 14|doi = 10.1016/j.carres.2006.06.025|first = Feridoun Salak|last = Asghari|first2 = Hiroyuki|last2 = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snåre et al.

==Process==
Most applications of hydrothermal liquefaction operate at temperatures between 250-550&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and high pressures of 5-25 MPa as well as catalysts for 20–60 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although higher or lower temperatures can be used to optimize gas or liquid yields, respectively.&lt;ref name="ToorReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Saqib Sohail|last2=Rosendahl|first2=Lasse|last3=Rudolf|first3=Andreas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|journal=Energy|date=May 2011|volume=36|pages=2328–2342|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these temperatures and pressures, the water present in the biomass becomes either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the conditions, and acts as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst to facilitate the reaction of biomass to bio-oil.

The exact conversion of biomass to bio-oil is dependent on several variables:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Feedstock composition
* Temperature and heating rate
* Pressure
* Solvent
* Residence time
* Catalysts

===Feedstock===

Theoretically, any biomass can be converted into bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction regardless of water content, and various different biomasses have been tested, from forestry and agriculture residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|page=27707-27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sewage sludges, food process wastes, to emerging non-food biomass such as algae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview"/&gt; The composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and lignin in the feedstock influence the yield and quality of the oil from the process.

===Temperature and Heating Rate===
Temperature plays a major role in the conversion of biomass to bio-oil. The temperature of the reaction determines the depolymerization of the biomass to bio-oil, as well as the repolymerization into char.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ideal reaction temperature is dependent on the feedstock used, temperatures above ideal lead to an increase in char formation and eventually increased gas formation, while lower than ideal temperatures reduce depolymerization and overall product yields.

Similarly to temperature, the rate of heating plays a critical role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.

===Pressure===
Pressure (along with temperature) determines the super- or subcritical state of solvents as well as overall reaction kinetics and the energy inputs required to yield the desirable HTL products (oil, gas, chemicals, char etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Residence Time===
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a fast process, resulting in low residence times for depolymerization to occur. Typical residence times are measured in minutes (15 to 60 minutes); however, the residence time is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including feedstock, solvent ratio and temperature. As such, optimization of the residence time is necessary to ensure a complete depolymerizaiton without allowing further reactions to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Catalysts===
While water acts as a catalyst in the reaction, other catalysts can be added to the reaction vessel to optimize the conversion.&lt;ref name="DuanCatalyst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Peigao|last2=Savage|first2=Phillip E.|title=Hydrothermal Liquefaction of a Microalga with Heterogeneous Catalysts|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=2011|volume=50|pages=52–61|doi=10.1021/ie100758s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used catalysts include water-soluble inorganic compounds and salts, including KOH and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as transition metal catalysts using [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Palladium|Pd]], [[Platinum|Pt]], and [[Ruthenium|Ru]] supported on either [[carbon]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] or [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. The addition of these catalysts can lead to an oil yield increase of 20% or greater, due to the catalysts converting the protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose into oil. This ability for catalysts to convert biomaterials other than fats and oils to bio-oil allows for a wider range of feedstock to be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental Impact==
Biofuels that are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction are [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon neutral]], meaning that there are no net carbon emissions produced when burning the biofuel. The plant materials used to produce bio-oils use photosynthesis to grow, and as such consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The burning of the biofuels produced releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but is nearly completely offset by the carbon dioxide consumed from growing the plants, resulting in a release of only 15-18 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh or energy produced. This is substantially lower than the releases rate of fossil fuel technologies, which can range from releases of 955 g/kWh (coal), 813 g/kWh (oil), and 446 g/kWh (natural gas).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recently, Steeper Energy announced that the [[Emission intensity|Carbon Intensity (CI)]] of its Hydrofaction™ oil is 15 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ according to [http://www.ghgenius.ca/ GHGenius model] (version 4.03a), while diesel fuel is 93.55 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steeperenergy.com/news/milestones-and-activities|title = Milestones &amp; Activities|date = Q3 2015|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Steeper Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal liquefaction is a clean process that doesn't produce harmful compounds, such as ammonia, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, or SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead the [[heteroatom]]s, including nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, are converted into harmless byproducts such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inorganic acids that can be neutralized with bases.

==Compare with Pyrolysis and other [[Biomass to liquid|BtL]] technologies==
The HTL process differs from [[pyrolysis]] as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgwater|first1=A.V|last2=Peacocke|first2=G.V.C|title=Fast pyrolysis processes for biomass|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=March 2000|volume=4|pages=1–73|doi=10.1016/s1364-0321(99)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211001691|journal = Energy|date = 2011-05-01|pages = 2328–2342|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013|first = Saqib Sohail|last = Toor|first2 = Lasse|last2 = Rosendahl|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/au-hl020613.php|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction -- the most promising path to a sustainable bio-oil production|last = AARHUS UNIVERSITY|first = |date = 6 Feb 2013|work = |access-date = 3 Sep 2015|via = http://www.eurekalert.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian Randle''' (born 7 July 1949) is a [[Jamaica]]n publisher. He is the founder of an eponymous independent publishing company whose main focus is on [[English-language]] readers.

== Life ==
Randle was born in [[Hanover Parish|Hanover]] on [[Jamaica]] in 1949. He read for a Special Honours degree in history at the Mona campus of the [[University of the West Indies]], Jamaica, and later for an MSc in international politics at the [[University of Southampton]] UK on a Commonwealth scholarship. After his academic study he worked many years for British publishers until he set up his own firm, '''Ian Randle Publishers''' (IRP). This start made him the first English-language publisher of scholarly books in the [[Caribbean]]. Later, his firm became a model for particularly the [[Africa]]n book scene.&lt;ref name="PCF2012"&gt;Prince Claus Fund (June 2012), [http://www.princeclausfund.org/files/docs/2012%20PCF%20JR%20English.pdf ''Report from the 2012 Prince Claus Awards Committee'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;Ellington, Barbara (10 October 2005), [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20051010/business/business1.html "The Monday Interview: Ian Randle - 'Booking' date with destiny"], ''Jamaica Gleaner''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Howard (18 September 2011) [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110918/arts/arts1.html "Small company doing big things..."], ''Jamaica Gleaner''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first Randle focused on [[history]] and the [[social science]]s, which allowed young academics to publish their findings locally. As a result, the region became less dependent on writers from the [[United Kingdom]], the colonizer of Jamaica until 1962.&lt;ref name="PCF2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt; In later years Randle expanded the range of books to include biography, culture, cookery, and sports, while producing texts for undergraduate-level students and the upper levels of the Caribbean secondary school system. His list contains the most comprehensive offerings on the [[Regional Integration Movement]] and on the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM). His published list contains over 350 printed titles and some electronic editions.

The direction of the firm is now in the hands of Randle's daughter Christine, while he himself has continued in fields such as marketing, public relations and consultancy.&lt;ref name="PCF2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

In 2000 Randle helped establish the Caribbean Publishers Network (CAPNET) and became its first president, serving for two two-year terms, during which he established links with the international publishing community and with publishers in Africa through the sister organization APNET. During this period Randle contributed regularly to the University of Denver Publishing Institute delivering the annual lecture on international publishing and presenting papers in a variety of international publishing and education fora.

== Recognition ==
His pioneering work was recognized by the government of Jamaica when he was conferred with the [[Order of Distinction]] in 2002. In 2012 Randle was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] from the [[Netherlands]] for his contribution to Caribbean intellectual property and for championing independent local publishing and self-representation in other post-colonial contexts.&lt;ref name="PCF2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://televisionjamaica.com/Programmes/SmileJamaica.aspx/Videos/21296 "Jamaica Selected for Prince Claus Award"], Jamaica Television, 3 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, the Caribbean magazine ''Tallawah'' included him on the list of most influential Jamaicans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallawahmagazine.com/2012/09/news-notes-publisher-ian-randle-to.html "Publisher Ian Randle to receive prestigious Dutch-based award"], ''Tallawah'' magazine, 27 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he received an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree from the University of the West Indies, St Augustine campus in [[Trinidad]], for his contribution to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the Caribbean. In the same year, he received the Trailblazers Award from the Book Industry Association of Jamaica. &lt;ref&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20170322/local-publisher-signs-historic-agreement-university-guyana "Local Publisher Signs Historic Agreement With University Of Guyana"], ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 22 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the '''informed consumer''' is a fundamental one in the [[law of the European Union]].  Since the general Resolution of 1975, one of the primary objectives of the [[European Community]], and then the [[European Union]], has been the provision of information to [[consumer]]s.  The rationale is that market actors who are informed have a greater capacity to understand the importance of their market actions and choices, and are enabled in making better choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital Markets in the Age of the Euro|editor1=Guido Ferrarini |editor2=Klaus J. Hopt |editor3=E. Wymeersch |pages=133|author=Guido Alpa|chapter=Trading On-line and Consumer Protection|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2002|isbn=9789041117373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to the European Union, "Information is a deciding factor for consumers when making their [[consumer choice|choices]] and affects both consumer interests and their confidence in the products and services circulating within the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Information|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/consumer_information/index_en.htm|website=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/consumer_information/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer expectation ==

The consumers expect to get fair treatment in the [[market place]] and avoid unscrupulous or sharp business dealings.
They envisage a fair market environment that facilitates and supports several consumer rights:

* The consumer must get a fair chance of choosing from the range of goods and services available in the market place.
* The consumer must be provided with complete, unambiguous and explicit knowledge about the products. The information must contain details regarding the contents of the product, [[safety warning]]s and product care instructions.
* The information should be written in plain and understandable language, which is self-explanatory. Also, the text should be readable in terms of the size and type of font.
* The consumers expect just and equitable [[pricing]] of the commodities. Fair price is equal to a reasonable [[profit margin]] added to the real cost of manufacturing of product or service (with no exorbitant mark-up cost). Information about the related costs of the product must be brought to the knowledge of the consumer.
* The consumers also have the right to indiscriminate prices, that is paying the same price as other customers, without any discrimination.
* Consumers also expect to get a communication channel for enquiry and complaints about the product or service. They want effective redressal and remedies to loss, such as implementation of legal regulations and prosecution to law violations .

With the advent of [[electronic media]] in marketing, and the mass information storage capacity of computers, [[consumer privacy]] has become a great concern. Hence, consumers want to ensure privacy of information. The consumers want to be able to cast off the invasive marketing methods, and threat of entry into the private system of consumers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurme|first1=Sally Balch|title=Consumer Protection|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Consumer_Product_Safety_Act.aspx|website=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Consumer_Product_Safety_Act.aspx|accessdate=27 October 2014|ref=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Consumer_Product_Safety_Act.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Consumer information is the most important element for [[consumer protection]] and policy decisions. It is the solution to issues ranging from online transactional threats, [[behavioural targeting]], loss of privacy and other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helberger|first1=Natali|title=Form matters: informing consumers effectively|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|website=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708062650/http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A consumer must treat every purchase as an important Investment. Making an uninformed investment in the stock market can result in huge financial losses to consumer, the similar rule applies to daily purchases. Being an informed consumer is advantageous to the economy, market and consumers .
An informed consumer is capable of making sensible decisions, gains an insight about a product prior to its purchase. This insight equips the consumer with the data to arrive at an evidence based conclusion.

===Higher-quality investments===

* With almost every purchase, comes a variety of other options to choose from. This is where the information plays an important role. Information enables the customers to differentiate the quality products from non- quality ones and purchase durable goods that sustains for a longer period.

===Safe investments===

* Information about products facilitates safe purchases.  With the production taking place in bulk quantities, there maybe instances that the product bores certain manufacturing defects. Recognizing these defects can prevent the customer from financial injury or loss. The product and brand reviews and consumer forums online can be instrumental in educating the customers about them. This should essentially be considered while making big purchases like electronic products and vehicles.

=== Money-saving investments ===

* Consumer often suffers from the danger of being misled by the sales professionals, especially the ones paid commission. These sales personnel are paid commission proportionate to their sales. These sales person are capable of enticing the consumer to buy the most expensive options. Information about your potential purchases can help in saving money and ensure a smarter purchase.

=== Ethical investments ===

* A consumer must never deal with the company indulging in unethical practices. One must check for things like animal testing and experimentation, labour abuse, or donations to a superficial NGO before taking the decision of engaging with the company.

===Responsible investment===

It is the responsibility of the consumer to get all the information about the potential purchase and associated background before making a decision to buy it. "Getting armed with information about the consequences of your purchase doesn't just make an informed consumer, it makes a Responsible consumer."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Lauren|title=Why Is it Important to Be an Informed Consumer?|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov|website=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of information==

Transparent information about the terms and conditions associated with the product or service can facilitate a plenty of '''regulatory requirements''' to redress the consumer related grievances. Primarily, complete information will level the information asymmetries, improve '''consumer's decision- making''' capability vis-à-vis the seller's complex knowledge about the product they are selling.
Consumer information also harmonises and solve consumer problems, '''create awareness''' and '''guide their behaviour'''. Another important objective that is achieved by informing the consumer is impact on Competitive policy. This will enable the traders and service providers to give greater information to consumers about their product, educate them about the product quality and other specifications.
In addition to the compliance to the legal obligations, the business firms also have their '''planned, tactical and important business- related reasons''' behind informing the consumer. The business organisation ensure consumer's '''expectation management''' by equipping them with certain knowledge about the commodity.
Many times, business face '''disincentive by providing information''' to the consumers, as it might harm the marketability and attractiveness of their product. This indicate the power gained on being an Informed consumer.
The economic analysis indicates that information asymmetry to consumer is a major ground for market failure, causing the consumer to make irrational decisions. Thus, unbiased information can solve the market problems by equipping the customers with appropriate information and thereby ensuring healthy market practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helberger|first1=Natali|title=Form matters: informing consumers effectively|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|website=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708062650/http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of information ==

Consumers derive their information from multiple sources. The following are the sources from where a consumer gathers the desired knowledge about the product:
* Governments issue public information for the consumers
* Regulatory authorities, review and testing services and comparison  sites
* Social networks (friends, family, children, acquaintance etc.)
* Suppliers of the products or services.
* the media
Consumer derives information from a variety sources, each source illustrating its own interest, skills and resources . However, it is essential  for the consumers to recognise their personal interests and make a judicious decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helberger|first1=Natali|title=Form matters: informing consumers effectively|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|website=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708062650/http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customer know-hows==
# ''Know who you are dealing with'':  Don't do business with any company that won't provide its name, street address, and telephone number. 
#''Protect your personal information'': Share credit card or other personal information only when you're buying from a company you know and trust. 
#''Take your time'': Resist any urge to "act now" despite the offer and the terms. Once you turn over your money, you may never get it back. 
#''Read the small print'': Get all promises in writing and review all the documents carefully before you pay any money or sign a contract. 
#''Never pay for a "free" gift'': Throw away any offer that asks you to pay for a gift. If it's free or a gift, you shouldn't have to pay for it. Free is free. 
#''Know the risks before you spend your money'': When it comes to investments, every potentially high-profit investment is high-risk. That means you could lose your investment – all of it.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to be an Informed Consumer|url=http://www.ftc.gov|website=www.ftc.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market shift ==
The influx of electronic media and abundance of available information has triggered a complete transformation of the market orientation. There has been a transition in the "traditional [[customer engagement]]", whereby the model of teaching the customer about the product or service has changed to knowledge- ridden customers who know exactly where they want to spend their money. The digital invasion has initiated an exploration drive in the consumers, turning the consumers into 'Informed Consumers'. This trend can be substantiated by the research led by the firm Forrester that suggests "buyers are often between 70 and 90 percent of the way through the sales process before they ever engage a vendor". This evolution in the market- orientation is a challenge for the existing and the emerging businesses. Following are the steps to take advantage of changes in, market:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Daniel|title=How to Sell to the Informed Consumer|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-newman/how-to-sell-to-the-inform_b_5309839.html|website=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-newman/how-to-sell-to-the-inform_b_5309839.html|accessdate=29 October 2014|ref=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-newman/how-to-sell-to-the-inform_b_5309839.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Know your customer
#Get discovered/Stay in public view
#Utilize grassroots tactics

== Challenge for marketers ==
Consumers are becoming web-savvy, mobile enabled data sifters, who attain complete knowledge about the product prior to even stepping in the store.

To deal with highly informed consumers, the marketer must do the following:
* Be prepared that the consumer has knowledge about the product and manoeuvre it into something useful.
* Be the source of comprehensive knowledge to the consumers.

With the increase in the variety of sources for consumer education, it is important for the marketer to enter the sales process at an early stage. The marketer must move ahead of the curve and make sure  to bring some value to the customer’s  purchase beyond just fulfilling his/her need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Court|first1=David|title=The consumer decision journey|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey|website=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey|publisher=McKinsey &amp; company|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EU legislation ==
EU consumer policy is designed to
* protect you against serious risks and threats that you cannot tackle on your own
* enable you to make choices based on clear, accurate and consistent information
* safeguard your consumer rights, enabling you to resolve disputes with traders quickly and efficiently
* ensure your rights keep pace with economic and social change – especially in the food, energy, financial, transport and digital markets.
In an efficient, integrated EU economy underpinned by EU-wide rules, you must be able to trust that your rights as a consumer will be upheld in the event of any problems when purchasing goods and services in other EU countries.
At an annual cost of just 5 cents per person, the EU's consumer protection programme for 2014–2020, is designed to enforce consumer laws throughout the single market, giving you a high level of legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/cons/index_en.htm||title=EU Legislation on consumer protection |website=http://europa.eu/pol/cons/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
* According to the "2013 Edelman Trust Barometer", an online survey of 26,000 general population respondents across 26 countries, 35% of those identified as "the informed public" need to hear company information three times to believe it, while another 29% need to hear it 4–5 times more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Deck: 2013 Edelman Trust Barometer|url=http://www.slideshare.net/EdelmanInsights/global-deck-2013-edelman-trust-barometer-16086761|website=http://www.slideshare.net|publisher=edelman trust barometer|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The study also looks at how consumers place their trust in corporations of different sizes. In the US, 86% of informed consumers trust small businesses, while just 55% trust big businesses. A similar gap is apparent in the UK (78% vs. 48%), but the opposite is true in China, where 89% trust big businesses compared to 65% for small businesses.
In fact, whereas informed publics in developed countries are more trusting of small than big businesses (76% vs. 53%), emerging market respondents placed more trust in big businesses (79% vs. 70%). Overall, small businesses are slightly more trusted than big businesses (70% vs. 62%).
Looking at company types, the study finds that trust in media companies rose from 52% of informed publics globally in 2012 to 57% this year. Within the US, trust in media companies crossed into the majority, increasing from 45% to 51%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5285">The  '''Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas''' (IMEF) ({{lang-en|Mexican Institute of Financial Executives}}) was founded in 1961 as a private [[nonprofit organization]] for finance executives in [[Mexico]]. This institute has representation groups in its major cities, a total of 20 groups work with a national structure whom are responsible for representing the [[Finance|Financial Management]] sector in the public and private sector of Mexico who in turn, are part of the 17 national technical committees of the institute. 

Considered as IMEF subdivisions, there are chapters created by the institute in an effort to link the younger generations of future financial executives in the country; these are [[IMEF Universitario]] and [[IMEF Nueva Generación]].

The Mexican Institute of Financial Executives (IMEF) is a founding member of the [[International Association of Financial Executives Institutes (IAFEI)|International Association of Financial Executives Institutes]] (IAFEI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iafei.org/index.php/site/what_is_iafei/iafei_by_laws |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312234040/http://www.iafei.org/index.php/site/what_is_iafei/iafei_by_laws |archivedate=2011-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and takes credit for some serious and renowned variety of print media with both Mexican and international authors. Since 1984, the IMEF has awarded several participants in its research investigation contest and most recently since 2003 in conjunction with [[Deloitte]] the [[Premio Internacional IMEF-Deloitte]]

==History==

On September 21, 1961, the Mexican Institute of Financial Executives (IMEF) was created as an organization dedicated to the technical development of its associates in the financial area, based on the professional excellence and human quality. The affiliated members of the IMEF have been, throughout the years, the financial management leaders of Mexico's major enterprises and bovernment institutions in both public and private sectors, and a distinguished group of academics and researchers highly committed to the economic and financial challenges of Mexico and Latin America.
 
The foundation of the institute is established by the influence, leadership and significance of its partners since 1961 who have contributed to strengthen the Institute and its position in Mexico. In the years 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2012 IMEF was host of the annual [[IAFEI World Congress]].

==Mission==

On March 21, 2018, Larian launched a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to acquire [[Toys "R" Us]] after news broke out of them declaring bankruptcy. Larian posted $200 million of his own money to get the campaign running, and a goal of $1 billion was set. According to the campaign description, all the money raised would be used in the formulation of a bid to acquire some of the company's assets throughout the bankruptcy process. The campaign has a deadline of May 28, 2018, [[Memorial Day]]. Any donations from supporters of the campaign would only be donations and would not result in donors receiving equity in any potential acquisition of the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gofundme.com/helpsavetoysrus&lt;/ref&gt; Larian ultimately ditched the GoFundMe campaign after generating less than $60,000 by April 6th. On April 13th, Larian placed a bid of $890 million USD. Of the $890 million, $675 million is to buy 274 Toys R Us stores in the US, and $215 million to acquire 82 Canadian stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cosgrove|first=Jaclyn|title=Toy mogul Isaac Larian ditches GoFundMe campaign and bids $890 million for Toys R Us stores|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-toys-r-us-larian-20180413-story.html|accessdate=14 April 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kvadraturen''' is the city center of [[Kristiansand]] in [[Vest-Agder]] county, [[Norway]], with a population of 6,750 (2015). The borough is made up of the centre together with the harbour to the south and the more rural district of "[[Eg (Kristiansand)|Eg]]" to the north. Kvadraturen is the [[administrative centre]] of the municipality of Kristiansand as well as the administrative centre of [[Vest-Agder County Municipality|Vest-Agder county]], but is far smaller in area than the other boroughs in the municipality, such as the borough of [[Grim (Kristiansand)|Grim]] to the north and west, and the borough of [[Lund (Kristiansand)|Lund]] to the east.

Kvadraturen is the location of the [[Kristiansand Cathedral]] and the nearby commercial, pedestrian street is [[Markens gate]].  The city harbour is located along the [[Kristiansandsfjorden]] and the island of [[Odderøya]].  The borough has three malls and three high schools. The closest public junior high is "Grim Skole" and the closest elementary is Tordenskjoldsgate Skole and is the only remanding elementary in Kvadraturen.  The [[Sørlandet Hospital Kristiansand]] is also located in the borough, in the district of Eg.

The main city centre was established as a city on 5 July 1641 by [[King Christian IV]].  The city became a self-governing municipality under the [[formannskapsdistrikt]] law on 1 January 1838.  On 1 July 1921, a neighboring part of the municipality of [[Oddernes (municipality)|Oddernes]] (population: 2,164) was transferred from Oddernes to the city of Kristiansand.  During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the [[Schei Committee]]. On 1 January 1965, the city of Kristiansand (population: 27,100) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of [[Randesund (municipality)|Randesund]] (population: 1,672), [[Oddernes (municipality)|Oddernes]] (population: 18,668), and [[Tveit (municipality)|Tveit]] (population: 2,802) to form a new, larger municipality of Kristiansand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyrå]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung==
In 2009 Lutz Aengevelt was interviewed by [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] and was posed the following questions;

" Is the competition among [[brokers]] during this difficult time actually just down to the [[price]]?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/1.827867|title=Lutz und Wulff Aengevelt: "Wir reden den Markt nicht schön"|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|last=GmbH|date=7 August 2009|website=FAZ.NET|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Of course, competition is hard boned, but that does not take place on the commission rates, but on the evidence of achievement. One should also not overlook the fact that part of the competition is no longer there. Some have withdrawn from the sample transaction business, it is now known as the [[Asset Management]] and others are [[insolvent]]." - then going on to reiterate the fact that Aengevelt Immobilien has zero debt which is a pivotal aspect of their success and solidified infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/|title=SPIEGEL ONLINE - Aktuelle Nachrichten|first=Jakob|last=Augstein|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2017|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Kevin O'Leary''' (born 20 March 1961) is an Irish businessman and the Chief Executive Officer of [[Ryanair]]. He is one of Ireland's wealthiest businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/|title=Rich list | work=The Times | location=London | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Michael O'Leary was born 20 March 1961, the second in a family of six, in [[Kanturk]] in [[County Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=48721542211 |title=Information on "Facebook" |publisher=Facebook.com |date=20 March 1961 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{disputed inline|date=July 2017}} He was educated at [[Clongowes Wood College]], [[County Kildare]]. In 1979, he began a four-year Bachelor in Economic and Social Studies programme at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He graduated from Trinity in 1983 and then worked as a trainee with Stokes Kennedy Crowley (later known as [[KPMG]]), studying the Irish tax system. He left after two years in 1985, setting up profitable newsagents in [[Walkinstown]] and [[Terenure]], Dublin.

While at Stokes Kennedy Crowley, O'Leary had met [[Tony Ryan]], head of [[Guinness Peat Aviation]], a leasing company (GPA). Ryan was one of KPMG's clients and O'Leary advised Ryan on his personal income tax affairs. In 1987, Ryan hired O'Leary as his personal financial and tax advisor, where Ryan's main interest was in GPA. [[Ryanair]] was established around this time and originally followed a traditional business model, but quickly began to lose money. Subsequently O'Leary was sent to the USA to study the novel [[Southwest Airlines]] business model. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Ryanair career==
Under O'Leary's management, Ryanair further developed the [[low-cost carrier|low-cost model]] originated by [[Southwest Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Maier, Business 2.0 Magazine staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/04/01/8372814/index.htm |title=A radical Fix for Airlines: Make Flying Free, '&amp;#39;'Forbes'&amp;#39;', 1 April 2006 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary may have described the inauguration of the ancillary revenue movement during a 2001 interview in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Flying for Free on Ryanair", 13 May 2001, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; "The other airlines are asking how they can put up fares. We are asking how we could get rid of them." 

The business model envisioned by O'Leary uses receipts from on board shopping, internet gaming, car hire and hotel bookings to replace the ticket revenue from selling airline seats. Savings are also made by negotiating discounts with airports for reduced landing fees. In many cases, regional airports have made no charges so as to secure flights that bring passengers and wealth into their area.

The deregulation of Ireland's major airports and a transformation of traditional full-service airlines are among his demands.&lt;ref name="rteeamon"&gt;RTÉ radio 10 February 2007, in "Conversations with Eamon Dunphy"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/story.asp?j=5286&amp;cat=news Irish Post: Ryanair chief hints of possible departure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014654/http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/story.asp?j=5286&amp;cat=news |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, O'Leary unveiled plans to develop a ''Ryanair [[Israel]]'' to operate extensive flights to and from Israel and a large network of European cities. The plans include the establishment of a large hub in Israel.&lt;ref name="RyanairIsrael"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli market beckons Ryanair|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/225083355|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=''Irish Sun.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and reputation==
O'Leary has a reputation for loose talk in the airline industry and among its regulators. Many press articles have often described him as arrogant, and prone to making comments which he later contradicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/29/Monti-Amt?page=4 |title=Die Festung wankt: Europas mächtige Wettbewerbshüter verurteilen Microsoft und stoppen Fusionen.

In 2007, he was forced to retract a claim that Ryanair had cut emissions of carbon dioxide by half over the previous five years; the claim should have been that emissions 'per passenger' had been cut by half.&lt;ref&gt;“Ryanair retracts emissions claim”, 29 January 2007, at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6310571.stm  news.bbc.co.uk]; last accessed 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary has been reported to have impersonated a journalist in an attempt to find information passed on to a newspaper following a safety incident on a Ryanair flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duggan |first=Barry |url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=498833&amp;issue_id=5125 |title=Ryanair staff were menacing: passenger – National News, Frontpage – Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108154700/http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=498833&amp;issue_id=5125 |archivedate=8 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion he has apologised for personal attacks under threat of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0508/1224269952195.html |title=Sat, May 08, 2010 – O'Leary in court apology to union official |publisher=The Irish Times |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been criticized by a judge for lying, who said he was lucky not to be found guilty of contempt of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0326/ryanair.html |title=Judge criticises Michael O'Leary for lying – RTÉ News |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, he called concerns about climate change "complete nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://fd.nl/ondernemen/1196165/topman-ryanair-zorg-over-klimaatverandering-is-complete-onzin?s_cid=671 Topman Ryanair: Zorg over klimaatverandering is 'complete onzin'], Financieel Dagblad (a Dutch financial newspaper), 10 April 2017. Accessed on 10 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference discussing Ryanair's planned intercontinental service [[RyanAtlantic]], O'Leary jokingly described the airline's planned business class travel experience as featuring "whores and rum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b5e_1214473286 |title=Free Oral Sex to Business Class Customers on Ryanair says CEO |publisher=LiveLeak.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he said that his company is against any long-haul transatlantic services, stating that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The low-cost model only really works for short-haul flights [...] If we started flying farther afield, we'd have to do something stupid like introducing what I call a 'rich class' to make it pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/723867/Eindhoven-haven't-you-always-wanted-to-go.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Eindhoven: haven't you always wanted to go? | first=Adrian | last=Bridge | date=2 April 2002 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, more than a decade later, in 2013 he said, while at the [[Paris Air Show]], that he wanted to sell cheap flights from the U.S. to Europe for as low as 10 euros ($13) or $10, if conditions were right. He said that he needed a fleet of at least 30 twin-aisle aircraft and access to ports (e.g. major U.S. and European cities, in the airline industry there are so called slots or sometimes gates, often regulated by law, and without obtaining them it is impossible to have regular service to airports). Despite his claims in 2002, there were so called budget airliners in the past – for example [[Laker Airways]] flights from London to New York in the late 1970s or long-hauls at budget-fares on other continents like AirAsiaX in Malaysia and the Australian Jetstar Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ryanair-wants-launch-flights-between-us-europe-aims-jump-growth-rate-will-return-13-billion-1315549|title=Ryanair Wants To Launch Flights Between US And Europe, Aims For Jump In Growth Rate And Will Return $1.3 Billion To Shareholders: CEO Michael O’Leary|author=Nat Rudarakanchana|date=20 June 2013|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to the decision to close European airspace in April 2010 over worries about the [[Volcanic ash|ash]] plume from [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|an erupting Icelandic volcano]] he said "there was no ash cloud. It was mythical. It's become evident the airspace closure was completely unnecessary." One study concluded that serious structural damage to aircraft could have occurred if passenger planes had continued to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Connor |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/steve-connor-airspace-closure-due-to-ash-cloud-fears-was-right-move-2629069.html |title=Steve Connor: Airspace closure due to ash cloud fears 'was right move' – Analysis, Opinion |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 26 April 2011|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists and the industry as a whole remain unconvinced, however.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

In May 2014 O'Leary was highly critical of a 24-hour strike by [[Aer Lingus]] [[Flight attendant|cabin crew]], staged on 30 May 2014. Aer Lingus, whose biggest shareholder at the time was O'Leary's company Ryanair, had to cancel 200 flights and disrupt travel plans for 200,000 people. O'Leary accused Aer Lingus of "mismanagement" of its employee relations, called for the sacking of a board member, and said the striking employees should be punished by having their discount travel incentives withdrawn for a year.&lt;ref name="AerLingus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Striking Aer Lingus cabin crew should be punished says airline shareholder|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/222467203/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Striking-Aer-Lingus-cabin-crew-should-be-punished-says-airline-shareholder|accessdate=31 May 2014|publisher=Irish Sun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Bilderberg Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bilderbergmeetings.org/participants2015.html|title=Participants - Bilderberg Meetings|work=bilderbergmeetings.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary was to attend the [[Bilderberg Group]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secretive in Telfs-Buchen, Austria 11-14 in June this year|url=http://bilderbergmeetings.org/meeting_2015.html|work=bilderbergmeetings.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ryanair chief asked to join select conference reputed to truly govern international affairs|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/secretive-bilderberg-group-sets-sights-on-michael-o-leary-1.2119343|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=27 February 2015|first=Arthur|last=Beesley|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stockholm Centrals staty 2006l.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Statue of Nils Ericson in front of [[Stockholm Central Station]]]]
'''''Friherre'' Nils Ericson''' (31 January 1802 &amp;ndash; 8 September 1870) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[engineer]] (as was his younger brother [[John Ericsson]], who emigrated to England and then the USA). He became a prominent Swedish canal and railway builder.

Born Nils Ericsson, he was raised to the untitled nobility by king [[Oscar I of Sweden]] in 1854, and with this he reverted to a spelling of his surname with only one "s". In 1859 he was made a [[Freiherr#Swedish title|Friherre]] (equivalent to English [[Baron]]), the 403rd such elevation to Sweden's titled nobility.

==Background==
John and Nils were born in [[Långbanshyttan]], [[Värmland]], Sweden and received no formal education, but were taught the rudiments of mechanics from an early age by their father, Olof Ericsson.{{sfn|Church|1890|p=17}} Olof worked as the superintendent of a [[mining|mine]] in Värmland until he lost money in speculations and had to move his family to [[Forsvik]], [[Västergötland]], in 1810. There Olaf became a director of blastings during the excavation of Sweden's [[Göta Canal]] (built 1810-1832). He secured permission for his sons to draw in the office of the draughtsmen of the canal company, where they also learned to draw maps, and he persuaded Lieutenant Brandenburg of the Navy Mechanical Corps to teach them the art of shading and 'finishing off' mechanical drawings before they were in their teens.{{sfn|Church|1890|p=15}}

Their extraordinary skills were noted by [[Baltzar von Platen (1766-1829)|Baltzar von Platen]], the architect of the Göta Canal, and they were soon dubbed cadets of mechanics of the [[Swedish Navy]] and engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. When two engineers sent to England by Count Platen to obtain information about canal construction returned in 1815 and began to instruct a number of cadets of the Swedish Corps of Mechanical Engineers, the Ericsson brothers were among them; Nils being then twelve years old and John eleven.{{sfn|Church|1890|p=18}}

==Career==
In 1823 Nils Ericson joined the Engineering corps of the [[Swedish Army]] as a second lieutenant, but in 1830 he transferred to the Navy Mechanical Corps (where he eventually advanced to the rank of colonel in 1850). In 1833 he married a daughter of Count von Schwerin in [[Östergötland]].

Between 1830 and 1850 Nils Ericson planned and directed the construction of the canals at Stallbacka, [[Säffle]], [[Karlstad]] and Albrektsund. He also led the construction of the [[Saimaa Canal]] in [[Finland]] (constructed 1845-52), the reconstruction of the [[Trollhätte Canal]] in [[Trollhättan Municipality]] and the [[floodgate]] at [[Stockholm]]. In 1845, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

After 1850 he was primarily occupied with the design and construction of the Swedish state-owned railway system. At the same time he led the planning of the [[Dalsland Canal]] while construction there was being led by his son Werner.

Sweden started building railways later than many other European countries, having hesitated under heavy debate for several years because of the costs and other issues. Following the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]'s decision in 1854, Erikson was chosen to lead the project of building the main lines (stambanorna). There was also a decision that, for military reasons, the railways should avoid the coasts as much as possible.

His proposal was that the line between Gothenburg and Stockholm ([[Western Main Line]], ''Västra stambanan'') should run south of Lake [[Mälaren]] to avoid competition with shipping. He also proposed that the line between [[Malmö]] and Stockholm ([[Southern Main Line]], ''Södra stambanan'') should go north via Nässjö to meet up with Western Main Line at [[Falköping]] until the Western's eastward construction reached [[Katrineholm]], where a better junction could be built with a southern line heading directly to Nässjö.  This line was called Eastern Main Line (''Östra stambanan'') but has in modern times been defined to be part of the Southern Main Line.  Ericson's proposal also included the railway between Stockholm and [[Ånge]] ([[Northern Main Line]], ''Norra stambanan'') and [[Main Line Through Upper Norrland]] (''Stambanan genom övre Norrland'') which runs between [[Bräcke]] and [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]]. A railway between [[Oslo]] and [[Laxå]] ([[Värmland Line|Northwestern Main Line]], ''Nordvästra stambanan'') was also planned, to connect with Western Main Line.

The first parts of the Western and Southern lines were opened in 1856. Ericson resigned in 1862 when all of the Western line opened, and in 1864 the Southern line was opened in its entirety. Northwestern line was opened in 1871, Eastern line in 1874, Northern line in 1881 and the line through Upper Norrland in 1894. When Ericson resigned in 1862 his authority was divided between two agencies (the Building Bureau and the Traffic Bureau) until the formation of Kungliga Järnvägsstyrelsen (the Royal Railway Committee) in 1888.

Ericson died in Stockholm in 1870, aged 68, and lies buried in Stockholm's Northern Cemetery ([[Norra begravningsplatsen]]).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PearlStarr.jpg|thumb|right|Pearl Starr (right) with two unidentified women]] --&gt;
'''Rosie Lee Reed''' (September 1868 &amp;ndash; July 6, 1925), better known as '''Pearl&amp;nbsp;Starr''', was an [[United States|American]] [[pimp|bordello owner]] and [[businesswoman]] in [[Arkansas]], the first child of [[Belle Starr]], the reputed "Bandit Queen" of the [[American Old West]], and Jim Reed, Belle's first husband.

==Early life==
Pearl Starr was born in [[Rich Hill, Missouri|Rich Hill]], [[Missouri]]. As a small child, she moved often before her outlaw father died in a gunfight when she was six. Her mother then married a [[Cherokee]] named Sam Starr, and settled beside the [[Canadian River]] in the [[Indian Territory]] at a place called [[Younger's Bend]]. Starr was twenty-one when her mother, Belle Starr, was murdered.

Belle Starr claimed that Pearl was the daughter of the outlaw [[Cole Younger]].  While no official record exists, pictures of a young Pearl Starr show an uncanny resemblance to Cole Younger.  Her parentage may always be in doubt.

Most historical writers accept that Starr gave birth to an illegitimate daughter named Flossie in April 1887, when she was 18. Belle Starr sent her daughter away to relatives to have her baby.

In 1888 Starr's brother, Edwin, was found in possession of stolen property and was shot by his accomplice.  What became of Starr's daughter is unknown, but in the summer of 1888 Starr returned alone to her mother's house at Younger's Bend to care for her brother.

==Prostitution==
Edwin's case went to trial in July 1889. He was found guilty and sent to prison. About this time Starr married Will Harrison, but the couple were divorced in 1891. Capitalizing on the [[dime novel]] fame of Belle, Pearl Reed changed her name to Pearl Starr at this time. She became a prostitute in [[Van Buren, Arkansas|Van Buren]], [[Arkansas]], ostensibly to make money for the purpose of getting her brother out of prison. She eventually put together a defense team that managed to secure a presidential pardon for Edwin in 1893. 

Starr moved to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]] and established her own [[bordello]]. Located on "the Row," Fort Smith's waterfront street of [[gambling]] halls, [[Bar (establishment)|saloons]] and bordellos, the house was identified with a bright red star surrounded by lighted pearls. The parlor featured a talented [[piano]] player, good [[whiskey]] and supposedly the "most beautiful girls west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]." Business prospered and Pearl purchased additional brothels, besides investing in saloons and other property.

Starr had another illegitimate daughter in 1894 and named her Ruth. Starr married Arthur Erbach in 1897 and had a son with him in 1898. Her new husband and son died of [[malaria]] within a year's time. Both are buried in the Oak Cemetery in Fort Smith. By 1902, she was living with Dell Andrews and though not married to him had another daughter, Jennette, in November.

The only time Starr was implicated in a crime was in 1911. After a burglary at a general merchandise store in Fort Smith, police found several stolen items hidden at Starr's Winslow home. She was found guilty of robbery and sentenced to a year in the [[Arkansas State Penitentiary]]. Posting $2000 bail, Starr's attorneys appealed the case to the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], which overturned the verdict.

==Last years==
In 1916 the city of Fort Smith began enacting ordinances making prostitution illegal. For some time, Starr's activities were overlooked, but she was eventually arrested. The charges were dropped on the understanding that Starr would leave the community. In 1921, at age 53, she left for [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]], [[Arizona]]. She died there on July 6, 1925 and was buried in Calvary Cemetery.

==Flossie Starr's account==
Starr's daughter Flossie was credited with writing a two-part article for the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' Sunday editions on April 30 and May 7, 1933.

'''Richard Melbourne Hurlburt''' (born April 25, 1950) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician. He represented the electoral district of [[Yarmouth (provincial electoral district)|Yarmouth]] in the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] from 1999 to 2010.

==Biography==
In June 1999, he barely escaped with his life when his light plane crashed into a lake in Yarmouth County. He said he would have drowned if it had not been for a passenger who dragged him from the wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngnews.ca/Business/2010-02-10/article-799022/QuickSketch-of-Nova-Scotia-Conservative-Richard-Hurlburt/1|title=QuickSketch of Nova Scotia Conservative Richard Hurlburt|publisher=The News|date=February 10, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurlburt was a Yarmouth County municipal councillor for 11 years and was warden of Yarmouth County for 5 years.

He was a member of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservatives]]. Until the cabinet of Premier [[Darrell Dexter]] was sworn in on June 19, 2009, Hurlburt served as Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations.

===Expenses scandal===
Hurlburt resigned from the legislature on February 9, 2010, following [[Nova Scotia Parliamentary Expenses Scandal|revelations]] that he had spent his constituency allowance on a generator and a 40" television, which together cost over $11,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hurlburt-resigns-amid-spending-flap-1.912084|title=Hurlburt resigns amid spending flap|publisher=CBC News|date=February 9, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought sanctuary in Florida citing "severe depression" where he was visited by his son and his lawyer, Martin Pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.ca/content/news-archive|title=Hurlburt reported close to collapse in Florida|publisher=Shelburne County Today|date=February 18, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2011, it was announced that Hurlburt was among four people facing criminal charges in connection with the RCMP investigation into 2010s MLA expense scandal. Hurlburt was charged with fraud exceeding $5,000, breach of trust by a public officer, and 3 counts of uttering a forged document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mla-spending-probe-in-n-s-gets-4-charged-1.998239|title=MLA spending probe in N.S. gets 4 charged|publisher=CBC News|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2012, Hurlburt's lawyer said his client would plead guilty to fraud and breach of trust. In exchange, three charges of uttering forged documents were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-MLA Hurlburt will plead guilty over expense scandal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ex-mla-hurlburt-will-plead-guilty-over-expense-scandal-1.1221970|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2012, Hurlburt pleaded guilty to fraud and breach of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurlburt pleads guilty in N.S. spending scandal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hurlburt-pleads-guilty-in-n-s-spending-scandal-1.1187508|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2012, Hurlburt was sentenced to 12 months of house arrest, followed by 12 months of probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former N.S. cabinet minister gets house arrest|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/former-n-s-cabinet-minister-gets-house-arrest-1.1257996|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bull-dog Sauce Case ([http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=02&amp;hanreiNo=35027&amp;hanreiKbn=01 株主総会決議禁止等仮処分命令申立て却下決定に対する抗告棄却決定に対する許可抗告事件]) is a Supreme Court of Japan case that resulted in a landmark decision regarding hostile takeover defense plans (such as the "[[poison pill]]").  The Court held that such plans do not necessarily violate the principle of shareholder equality under Japanese statutes, even if they result in discriminatory treatment some shareholders; however, such decisions must be made by shareholders themselves, acting in the company's best interest; they cannot be made by management to protect itself.  The Bull-dog Sauce case arose from the first use of a poison pill by a Japanese company,&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 2. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the Supreme Court's first ruling on the subject of takeover defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 13. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual Background==

The  Bull-Dog Sauce Co., Ltd. is a Japanese company engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of food seasonings and sauces; it also owns and leases apartments and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.google.com/finance?q=TYO:2804 BULL-DOG SAUCE CO., LTD.] on Google Finance&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel Partners LLC is an American hedge fund with offices in New York and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=23113 Steel Partners LLC] at BusinessWeek.com.  The main [http://www.steelpartners.com/  Steel Partners site] provides no information about the company, however the [http://www.spjsf.jp/english.html  Steel Partners Japan site] contains ample information about the company's activities in Japanese and English&lt;/ref&gt;  It has invested in several Japanese companies that manufacture food and beverage products, including Bull-Dog Sauce, [[House Foods]], [[Sapporo Brewery|Sapporo]], and [[Nissin Foods]]; the fund frequently becomes the largest shareholder of a target company and then attempts a takeover or is vocally critical of the company's management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS47905+07-Apr-2008+BW20080407 "Steel Partners Submits to House Foods Corp. Suggestions to Improve Corporate Value"], Reuters, 2008-04-07; [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/26/business/sapporo.php "Sapporo rejects takeover bid from Steel Partners"], International Herald Tribune, 2008-02-26; [http://money.aol.com/news/articles/_a/steel-partners-urges-nissin-to-improve/n20080402021409990015 "Steel Partners Urges Nissin to Improve Operations, Efficiency; Offers Recommendations to Enhance Corporate Value"], AOL Money &amp; Finance, 2008-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;  As of August 2007, Steel Partners held stakes in about 30 Japanese companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto080720072149128123&amp;page=2 "Steel Partners loses final court appeal"], Financial Times, 2007-08-07&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2007, Sapporo Holdings Ltd. shareholders voted two-thirds in favor of [[poison pill]] takeover defense measures in response to a takeover threat from Steel Partners.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20070330a1.html "Sapporo investors approve poison pill"], Japan Times, 2007-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Background==

===Nippon Broadcasting Case===

The Tokyo District Court and Tokyo High Court rulings both cited the Tokyo High Court's 2005 Nippon Broadcasting Case ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=03&amp;hanreiNo=11&amp;hanreiKbn=02   Full text of the case](in Japanese).  For a general overview of the case, see  Osaki, Sadakazu, "Regulation of Japan's Capital Markets and the Battle of Control of Nippon Broadcasting System" . Nomura Capital Market Review, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 17-24, Summer 2005 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=872248; or Milhaupt, Curtis J., [http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Milhaupt-Web.pdf "In the Shadow of Delaware? The Rise of Hostile Takeovers in Japan"], 105 Colum. L. Rev. 2171 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the High Court ruled that a board of directors was generally ''not'' allowed to issue discriminatory stock warrants to prevent a shareholder from effecting a hostile takeover.  However, The High Court noted an important exception: a board of directors ''was'' allowed to discriminate against a shareholder if that shareholder possessed a "abusive motive" (濫用目的).  (This language was echoed in the High Court's ruling in the Bull-Dog Sauce Case, in which the High Court found Steel Partners to be an "abusive acquirer" (濫用的買収者);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=01&amp;hanreiNo=34950&amp;hanreiKbn=03 Full text of the Tokyo High Court decision], in Japanese&lt;/ref&gt; see below.)  The High Court laid out four examples of clearly abusive motives: (1) [[greenmail]]; (2) "scorched earth" tactics (e.g. pillaging intellectual property); (3) aiming to use the target company's assets to pay off the bidding company's debts; (4) aiming to sell off assets to produce a large one-time dividend.&lt;ref&gt;Milhaupt, Curtis J., [http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Milhaupt-Web.pdf "In the Shadow of Delaware? The Rise of Hostile Takeovers in Japan"], 105 Colum. L. Rev. 2171, 2193-4 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unocal===

''[[Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co.|Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum]]'', 493 A.2d 946 (Del. 1985) was a 1985 Delaware Supreme Court case that established standards for determining the acceptability of takeover defense tactics such as the poison pill.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Gilson, Ronald J., "Unocal Fifteen Year Later (and What We Can Do About It)" . Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 491-513, Nov. 2001 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=333041&lt;/ref&gt;  At the core of the ''Unocal'' decision is the so-called proportionality test: a takeover defense is legitimate if the takeover bid presents a threat to the company, and the defense is proportionate to the threat.&lt;ref&gt;Gilson, Ronald J., "Unocal Fifteen Year Later (and What We Can Do About It)" at page 496. Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 491-513, Nov. 2001 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=333041&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tokyo High Court's ruling in the Nippon Broadcasting Case (see above) has been called a "Unocal rule with Japanese characteristics."&lt;ref name="columbialawreview.org"&gt;Milhaupt, Curtis J., [http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Milhaupt-Web.pdf "In the Shadow of Delaware? The Rise of Hostile Takeovers in Japan"] at page 2172, 105 Colum. L. Rev. 2171 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, in the Nippon Broadcasting Case, both sides referenced ''Unocal'' in their briefs to the trial court.&lt;ref name="columbialawreview.org"/&gt;  The influence of ''Unocal'' was similarly seen in all three courts' rulings in the Bull-Dog Sauce Case &lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 14"&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 14. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of case==

*May 2007: Steel Partners was the largest shareholder of Bull-Dog Sauce with 10.25% of shares.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;
*May 18: Steel Partners initiated a tender offer at ¥1,584 per share with the intention of acquiring 100% of Bull-Dog Sauce stock.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;  It was widely suggested that Steel Partners would attempt [[greenmail]]&lt;ref&gt;"However, the court also made an exception when [a poison pill] might be allowed: to fend off a would-be greenmailer—which many in Japan believe Steel Partners to be. (Steel Partners insists it doesn't engage in greenmail...."[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2007/gb20070618_584050.htm "Lichtenstein Takes on Japan Inc."], Businessweek, 2007-06-18&lt;/ref&gt; or hope for the appearance of a [[White knight (business)|white knight]],&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt; a strategy that had previously proven profitable.&lt;ref&gt;"When Steel Partner's bid for an instant noodle maker was trounced by a white knight, the fund was still able to sell its shares for a 24 per cent premium to the level it was prepared to pay." [http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto060720071502049270 "Japanese takeovers"], Financial Times, 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 7: Bull-Dog Sauce announced that it opposed the tender offer on the grounds that it could possibly harm the common interests of shareholders. At the same time, Bull-Dog Sauce's management proposed changes in the corporate charter and the issuance of stock warrants (the poison pill) at the general shareholders' meeting on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 2-3. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 13: Steel Partners responded by seeking an injunction from the Tokyo District Court prohibiting the directors of Bull-Dog Sauce from passing a resolution on stock warrants and blocking issuance of the stock warrants.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 4. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 15: Steel Partners changed the terms of its tender offer, raising the price to ¥1,700 and pushing the expiration date back from 28 June to 10 August.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*June 19: Steel Partners withdrew the portion of the injunction requesting prohibition of the stock warrant resolution.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*June 24:  At the general shareholders' meeting, the Bull-Dog Sauce's proposals to change the corporate charter and issue stock warrants were both approved with 83.4% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*June 28: The Tokyo District Court rejected Steel Partners' request for an injunction blocking Bull-Dog Sauce's takeover defense.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*July 9: The Tokyo High Court rejected Steel Partners' appeal, upholding the Tokyo District Court's denial of Steel Partners' injunction request.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 7. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 7: The Supreme Court rejected Steel Partners' appeal, upholding the decisions by the Tokyo District Court and the Tokyo High Court to deny Steel Partners' motions.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 12. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court Decision==

===Findings===

The following were among the Supreme Court's findings:&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at pages 13-14. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
# The principle of shareholder equality, as codified in Article 109-1 of the Company Law, requires that a company treat shareholders fairly based on the type and number of shares they hold.  However, if there is a risk that the acquisition of management control by a particular shareholder would harm the company's interests or the common interests of shareholders, discriminatory treatment of said shareholder aimed at preventing such acquisition is not a violation of the principle of shareholder equality unless said treatment is unreasonable.
# The question of whether the acquisition of management control by a particular shareholder harms the common interests of shareholders "should be decided by the shareholders themselves, to whom the company's interests ultimately inure, and that decision should be respected unless the general shareholders' meeting was procedurally unfair, the facts upon which the decision was predicated prove to be nonexistent or false, or are there is some other important fault that renders the decision unjustified."
# Steel Partners had the opportunity to express its opinion at the general shareholders' meeting, and it was able to receive compensation that approximated the value of the stock warrants. As such, the stock warrants were not unreasonable or contrary to the principle of shareholder equality.
# A takeover defense plan (such as a poison pill) need not be laid out by management prior to a takeover attempt in order to be fair.
# Stock warrants that discriminate against certain shareholders with the aim of supporting the company's management or retaining control in shareholders who support said management is blatantly unfair. The present case does not meet that description, however.

===Validation of Tokyo District Court Ruling===

The Supreme Court's ruling was viewed as a clear expression of preference for the District Court's ruling that the identity of the decisionmaker determines the legitimacy of a takeover defense: shareholders are generally legitimate, whereas managers are generally not.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 14"/&gt;  See points (2) and (5) in above section "Findings".  The District Court in turn had relied on the earlier Nippon Broadcasting Case to support these rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 5. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;  See above section "Legal Background."

===Rejection of Tokyo High Court Ruling===

The Supreme Court did not adopt the Tokyo High Court's ruling that a discriminatory stock warrant may be used because a hostile bidder is an "abusive acquirer."&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 15. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031 ;  "オしたがって，抗告人関係者が原審のいう濫用的買収者に当たるといえるか否

Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;  See above section "Legal Background."

==Impact==

The Supreme Court decision was widely seen as a validation of the legality of the poison pill takeover defense scheme under Japanese law.&lt;ref&gt;See E.G. [https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/08/bulldog-steel-partners-markets-equity-cx_jc_0808markets03.html Japan High Court Keeps Bull-Dog Sauce From Steel Partners' Jaws], Forbes.com, 2007-08-08; [http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto080720072149128123&amp;page=2 "Steel Partners loses final court appeal"], Financial Times, 2007-08-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Supreme Court did not validate the Tokyo High Court's finding that Steel Partners was an "abusive acquirer," the High Court's derogatory label received significant attention in the press and the business community.&lt;ref&gt;"The ruling sent shudders through a foreign investing community fearful that their rights will be compromised if they seek to influence the management of Japanese companies, who have reacted with hostility to efforts by foreigners to bring American-style activism to bear to increase shareholder value."[https://www.forbes.com/2007/07/10/bulldog-steel-ruling-markets-equity-cx_vk_0710markets4.html "Open Wide For Your Poison Pill, Steel Partners"], Forbes.com, 2007-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Bull-Dog Sauce estimated a consolidated net loss of 1.7 billion yen for the full year to March, largely as a result of the fight against Steel Partners. Bull-Dog's market capitalization shrank by 45%, from 32.2 billion yen in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2008/03/10/steel-partners-sapporo-markets-equity-cx_vk_0310markets02.html "Steel Partners Moderates Its Approach To Sapporo"], Forbes.com, 2008-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2008, Sapporo shareholders voted to renew the company's poison pill takeover defense plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=a15xWi2z1ajc&amp;refer=japan "Sapporo, Facing Steel Offer, Renews Takeover Defense"], Bloomberg.com, 2008-03-28&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, Steel Partners sold its remaining stake in Bull-Dog Sauce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUST25213320080418 "Steel Partners exits Japan's Bull-Dog after fight"], Reuters, 2008-04-17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Klein''' (15 November 1923{{spaced ndash}}20 November 2014) was a [[Polish Brazilian|Polish-Brazilian]] [[business magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] who founded the [[Casas Bahia]] chain of department stores in [[Brazil]], building them into the top retailer in the country. This along with his tendency to use massive warehouses for his goods, including the largest single warehouse in South America, led him to be known in the 1990s as the "[[Sam Walton]] of Brazil".&lt;ref name="idch"&gt;From the [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5202/is_2004/ai_n19123371  International Directory of Company Histories, Volume 75] by Robert Halasz (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Casas Bahia, Klein's family became one of the [[List of Brazilians by net worth|wealthiest families in Brazil]]. In 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him 78th richest person in Brazil with a personal net worth of $835 million, while his son, [[Michael Klein (businessman)|Michael]], was ranked 87th with $723 million.&lt;ref&gt;Antunes, Anderson (9 September 2013).

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Klein was born in [[Zaklików]], the third of nine children. At 19, Klein worked as a joiner at the time of the [[Nazi]] German invasion of Poland in [[World War II]], when he was taken to the [[Maidanek]] [[concentration camp]] along with his father. His mother and five younger siblings were sent to the extermination camp of [[Treblinka]].&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;Miriam Jordan (11 June 2002). "Down Market: A Retailer in Brazil Has Become Rich By Courting Poor --- Payments of $14 a Month Add Up for Samuel Klein, Sao Paulo's Sam Walton", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (Eastern edition; pg. A1).&lt;/ref&gt; He was later transported to [[Auschwitz]] in 1944. He escaped from the soldiers on 22 July 1944; in his own words, "I didn't know where I was going, but I was certain to get far from the group." He spent the night in the fields, where some [[Christian]] Poles, also fugitives, helped him flee. He managed to return to his old house, which was ruined, and worked on a small farm in the area in exchange for food.&lt;ref name=Samuel&gt;{{br}} [http://institucional.casasbahia.com.br/empresa/samuel-klein "Samuel Klein"] (in Portuguese). ''Casas Bahia''. Retrieved  20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he met his sister Sezia (Esther) and brother Solomon (who lives today in [[New York City]]).  The Klein brothers then went to [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]], and were able to find their father alive. Klein lived in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], until 1951, where he met Chana, his future wife. &lt;ref name=Samuel/&gt;

===Brazil and Casas Bahia===
Klein's father went to Brazil, together with his sister Esther. He himself wanted to emigrate to the [[United States]], but the immigration quota was full. So he joined his father and sister, making his way to Brazil via [[Bolivia]], and settled with his family in [[São Caetano do Sul]] in greater [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=Samuel/&gt;

===Economic success and recent work===
The rapid growth of the organization, and Klein's role in building it into a regional economic force were the subject of one of the case studies in [[C. K. Prahalad]]'s ''[[Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;C. K. Prahalad. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RPSG4JxAZzYC&amp;pg=PT230 Casas Bahia: Retail for the poor] (via Google Books) in ''The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits'', [[Wharton School of Business|Wharton School Publishing]] (2009), pp. 207-18; {{ISBN|978-0-13-700927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein guarded the company's finances, keeping control of all expenses within his immediate family, although in 1997 he opened the company's books to the public to secure promissory notes for the year.&lt;ref name="idch"/&gt; He later passed control of Casas Bahia to his son Michael, who was its [[CEO]] as of 2009, and retired in Brazil. In 2009, Samuel Klein sold Casas Bahia to [[Grupo Pão de Açúcar]]. [[Via Varejo]] was soon formed through the mergers of Casas Bahia with Ponto Frio and Extra Eletro, both owned by Grupo Pão de Açúcar. The Klein family owned a 47% stake in Via Varejo, which is worth $2 billion today.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Brendan &amp; Cuadros, Alexander, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-15/hidden-billionaires-in-plain-sight-emerge-as-stocks-rise.html "Hidden Billionaires in Plain Sight Emerge As Stocks Rise"], Bloomberg.com, 15 March 2012; retrieved 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
Samuel Klein was also a philanthropist. The systematic murder of 6 million Jews in Europe by Germans, also part of his personal history and experience, weighed heavily on his mind, and led him to be at the forefront of the establishment and strengthening of many Jewish organizations in São Paulo where he lived. He was the largest annual donor to Chabad/Lubavitch's boys' school and Lubavitch Yeshiva (estimated at ~$500,000 per year) in the Bom Retiro neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2007 he purchased the large property for the two schools, which had been previously paying rent. He is also a major donor to the Renaissance School (Colégio Renascença) in Bom Retiro. In recent years he gave in excess of $20 million to a wider range of those in need both in São Paulo and abroad. This included assisting young people in São Paulo with grants to set up small businesses.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Serving suggestion''' is a [[disclaimer]] used on [[food packaging]]. The phrase is used as legal [[fine print]] with a picture of the product.  The picture attempts to portray the manufacturer's food in the most favorable or appetizing way possible, sometimes including other foods that the package does not contain. For example, the labeling on a box of [[cereal]] may feature a picture of a cereal bowl filled with that cereal, milk and a fruit [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], or a jar of [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] may picture a [[hot dog]] in a bun with mustard on it. The serving suggestion may portray the [[serving size]] of the food used, but just as often a much larger serving is shown as part of the [[marketing]] of the item. As a disclaimer a serving suggestion also serves to remove any legal obligation on the part of the manufacturer to provide the other items pictured with their product.
In Ireland this is an illegal practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Image:Silicongulflogo.png|thumb|Silicon Gulf seal]]'''Silicon Gulf''' is a [[nickname]] for [[Davao City]] and extends to the [[Davao Region]], at Southern Mindanao, [[Philippines]]. The nickname refers to the growing number of [[information technology]] and IT enabled services ([[ITES]]) companies sprouting in the area. The name was adapted from [[Silicon Valley]], referring to the [[high tech]] cluster in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in [[northern California]].

Davao Region is one of the [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]] of the [[Philippines]], on the southeastern portion of [[Mindanao]]. Davao Region consists of four [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] — [[Compostela Valley]], [[Davao province|Davao]], [[Davao del Sur]], and [[Davao Oriental]]. The region encloses the [[Davao Gulf]] and its regional center is Davao City.

Silicon Gulf is part of the [[Philippine Cyber Corridor]].

==Origin==
The Silicon Gulf Initiative was officially announced on October 6, 2006, by [[Reuters Digital Vision Program]] fellow Jason Banico, who coined the nickname, during the ICT Davao, Inc. launch at the Royal Mandaya Hotel in Davao City. Aimed at addressing the region's [[Brain drain]] problem, the initiative emphasized radical collaboration between [[government]], [[academia]] and [[industry]] in harnessing technical talent and information-oriented manpower as the key driving force in transforming the city from an agricultural/industrial [[economy]] to a knowledge-based one.

The primary objective of the Silicon Gulf Initiative is to build Davao City's [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) capacity through developing talent in the areas of "technopreneurship", IT project management, and core technical skills.

'''Social movement unionism''' ('''SMU''') is a trend of theory and practice in contemporary trade unionism.  Strongly associated with the labour movements of developing countries, social movement unionism is distinct from many other models of trade unionism because it concerns itself with more than organizing workers around workplace issues, pay and terms and conditions. It engages in wider political struggles for human rights, social justice and democracy. Social movement unionism grew out of political struggles in developing countries and was theorized as a distinct industrial relations model in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waterman|first=Peter|title=Social-Movement Unionism: A New Union Model for a New World Order|jstor=40241259|work=Review (Fernand Braudel Center)|publisher=Fernand Braudel Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, trade unions are not distinct from social movements and form part of a wider ecosystem of political activism that includes faith groups, civic and residents' organizations and student groups. These are usually organized into democratic umbrella organizations along a [[popular front]] model. The umbrella organization generally has a programme or manifesto that all affiliates commit themselves to.

A prime example of social movement unionism is the link between the trade union federation [[Cosatu]] and the wider anti-[[apartheid]] struggle through the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] in [[South Africa]] in the 1980s. More recently, Cosatu has successfully campaigned with the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] for access to medication for [[HIV]]-[[Aids]]. Social movement unionism is also a feature of the industrial relations of Brazil and the Philippines.

SMU is widely considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scipes|first=Kim|title=Understanding the New Labor Movements in the "Third World":  The Emergence of Social Movement Unionism, a New Type of Trade Unionism|url=http://www.labournet.de/diskussion/gewerkschaft/smu/The_New_Unions_Crit_Soc.htm|work=Critical Sociology|publisher=Sage|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to be a highly dynamic and successful model, as evidenced by the success against apartheid and for treatment access, and by the fact that countries practising this model have generally reversed the trend of trade union decline experienced in the developed world. For instance, union density grew in South Africa by 130% between 1985 and 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=ILO|title=ILO Highlights Global Challenge to Trade Unions|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/press-and-media-centre/news/WCMS_008032/lang--en/index.htm|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a period of steep decline in many developed countries.
 
In the developed world, SMU is strongly associated with the [[organizing model]] of [[trade union]]ism, and overlaps with [[community unionism]].  SMU attempts to integrate workers, trade unions and the labour movement into broader coalitions for social and economic justice. Thus, in principle, unions and other organizations support each other in what are seen as mutually beneficial goals.

The campus [[living wage]] work of unions, which have frequently worked with chapters of United Students Against Sweatshops, are an example of the principle in practice.  Similarly, the 'Teamsters for Turtles' (as their T-shirts had it) at Seattle signalled a willingness of sections of the labour movement to engage with environmental concerns.

Other prominent examples include the relationship between [[Reclaim the Streets]] and the Liverpool Dockers (UK) during their [[Liverpool Dockers' Strike|strike in the late 1990s]]; and the relationship between the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]] and progressive US students during the [[Boot the Bell]] campaign. Various labour–environmental coalitions also fit this social movement model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a912901178 ''Uniting to Win: Labor-Environmental Alliances'', by Dan Jakopovich]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Union initiatives ==
{{See also|Social justice}}
Union support for [[social justice]] causes can come from  within the scope of their respective [[collective bargaining|collective agreements]]. [[Trade unions|Union]]s are increasingly demanding that new collective agreements contain clauses that are intended to further social justice. The inclusion of social justice support in a negotiated contract, compels all parties to support these causes in a legally binding way.

This may extend to funding the education of [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] union members in various social justice issues (i.e. [[fair trade]] policies, anti-poverty initiatives, anti-[[globalization]] campaigns and race, gender and human rights issues, etc.) and financial or technical support for non-union causes. Generally speaking, social movement unionism advocates greater levels of [[democracy]] and equality for all people, regardless of union membership.

===Collective bargaining===

During contract negotiations or [[collective bargaining]], some unions are pushing for the inclusion of various social justice clauses to be added to the [[Contract|collective agreement]]. One example of this may be a demand that a percentage of future wages be transferred to a fund to be used to effect social justice issues nationally or internationally on behalf of the union membership. Another example is a recent trend of demanding a portion of hourly wages to be deferred to a paid education leave (PEL) fund, to allow union members to leave the work place for a period of time, at no loss of pay, so they can attend social justice seminars and educational programs. These demands are forwarded as proposals to the employer during collective bargaining negotiations.

'''Stevens Thomson Mason''' (October 27, 1811{{spaced ndash}}January 4, 1843) was an American politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Michigan|first Governor]] of [[Michigan]] from 1835 to 1840.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.gunstonhall.org/library/masonweb/p22.htm#i1098 |title = Stevens Thomson Mason |date =  |accessdate = March 8, 2009 |publisher = Gunston Hall |author = Gunston Hall |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090525053137/http://www.gunstonhall.org/library/masonweb/p22.htm#i1098 |archivedate = May 25, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PG"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://politicalgraveyard.com/families/10855.html |title = Mason family of Virginia |date = June 16, 2008 |accessdate = March 8, 2009 |publisher = The Political Graveyard |author = The Political Graveyard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming to political prominence at an early age, Mason was appointed his territory's acting Territorial Secretary by [[Andrew Jackson]] at 19, becoming the acting territorial governor soon thereafter in 1834 at  22. As territorial governor, Mason was instrumental in guiding Michigan to statehood, which was secured in 1837. A member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], he was elected as Michigan's first state governor in 1835, where he served until 1840. Elected at 23 and taking office at 24, Mason was and remains the youngest [[Governor (United States)|state governor]] in American history.

==Early life in Virginia and Kentucky==
Mason was born near [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]], into a politically powerful family.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; His great-grandfather, [[Thomson Mason]] (1733–1785), was chief justice of the Virginia supreme court and younger brother of [[George Mason]] (1725–1792), who took part in the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; His grandfather, [[Stevens Thomson Mason (Virginia)|Stevens Thomson Mason]] (1760-1803), was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from Virginia from 1794 until his death. His uncle, [[Armistead Thomson Mason]] (1787–1819), was also a U.S. Senator from Virginia.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; In addition, his uncles by marriage, [[Benjamin Howard (Missouri)|Benjamin Howard]] (1760–1814) and [[William T. Barry|William Taylor Barry]] (1784–1835), both served in the [[Kentucky]] [[Kentucky General Assembly|House of Representatives]] and were [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] from Kentucky.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; Howard was also Governor of the [[Louisiana Territory|Louisiana (Missouri) Territory]] (1810–1812) and the [[Missouri Territory]] (1812–1813). Barry served as a U.S. Senator from Kentucky (1814–1816), then had a long career in a number of Kentucky government positions, and ultimately became [[United States Postmaster General|U.S. Postmaster General]] (1829–1835).

In 1812, Mason's father, [[John Thomson Mason (1787–1850)|John Thomson Mason]] (1787–1850), left the Mason family stronghold in Virginia to attempt to make his own fortune in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In 1817, President [[James Monroe]] appointed the elder Mason [[United States Marshals Service|United States marshal]].&lt;ref name=QTSHA/&gt; While his business ventures were a complete failure and the family became nearly broke in the 1820s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-17451_18670_18793-52864--,00.html |first = Patricia J. |last = Baker |title = Stevens Thomson Mason |date = August 2, 2010 |accessdate = April 18, 2011 |publisher = Michigan Department of History, Arts and Libraries }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a lawyer and [[land agent]] from an influential family, and went on to become an important figure in the [[Texas Revolution]].&lt;ref name=QTSHA&gt;{{cite magazine |title = General John Thompson Mason |last = Rowland |first = Kate Mason |date = January 11, 1908 |work = Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association |volume = 11 |issue = 3 |page =  |pages =  |url = http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v011/n3/article_1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and politics in Michigan Territory==
John Mason was appointed Secretary of the Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs in 1830 by President [[Andrew Jackson]]. Young Stevens was more politically savvy than his father and helped to protect him from schemes launched by anti-Jackson forces. This gained him notice from the territorial governor, [[Lewis Cass]]. In 1831, President Jackson sent the elder Mason on a mission to Mexico and named Stevens to replace his father as Secretary, at the age of nineteen before he could even vote. At about the same time, Governor Cass became Jackson's [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. As the territorial secretary traditionally served as acting governor, young Mason held that role until [[George Bryan Porter]], who was named to replace Cass in August 1831, arrived in Detroit in 1832.  As it turned out, Porter was frequently absent and Mason was, for all practical purposes, the acting governor during this time, leading to his nickname of the "Boy Governor". Porter died of cholera in Detroit in 1834, and so Mason was once again Acting Governor of the Michigan Territory.

Mason was influential in petitioning for Michigan statehood. When the first petition in 1832 was not acted upon by the U.S. Congress, Mason commissioned a territorial census. When the census was completed in 1834, it determined that 86,000 people lived in the lower peninsula, more than the 60,000 required for statehood by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. A dispute over a strip of land, the Toledo Strip, claimed by both Michigan and [[Ohio]] led to the [[Toledo War]]. President Jackson appointed [[Benjamin Chew Howard]] of [[Baltimore]] and [[Richard Rush]] of [[Philadelphia]] to arbitrate the dispute, but Mason was not satisfied with the proposal and refused to back down. Not wanting to alienate his political support in Ohio, President Jackson removed Mason as territorial secretary in August 1835 and appointed [[John S. Horner|John S. ("Little Jack") Horner]] as his replacement.

==First governor of the state of Michigan==
{{See also|History of railroads in Michigan#The state fiasco}}
[[File:FARMER(1884) p164 ELECTION SCENE - FIRST STATE ELECTION.jpg|thumb|Mason stood for election in 1835 for the first governor of the state of Michigan]]
Although replaced by Horner, Mason was still popular in Michigan. Voters approved a constitution on October 5, 1835 and elected Mason as governor. However, the U.S. Congress refused to recognize Michigan as a state until the dispute with Ohio was resolved.

In 1836, facing financial difficulties due to Michigan not being recognized as a state, Mason agreed to a compromise reached by the U.S. Congress and agreed to cede the disputed land to Ohio in exchange for the western two-thirds of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] (Michigan already included the eastern third). A convention in September 1836 refused to go along with Mason, but Mason finally prevailed in a second convention in December 1836. On January 26, 1837, Michigan was admitted to the Union.

In 1835, Mason had initiated an ambitious [[internal improvements]] program, which included development of three railroads and two canals (one of which was the [[Clinton-Kalamazoo Canal]]). Mason was re-elected in 1837, but the state's economy soon began to suffer from the effects of the [[Panic of 1837]]. Earlier in 1837, Mason had negotiated to fund the internal improvements program through the sale of $5,000,000 in bonds. This arrangement fell apart in 1837 and following bankruptcies by both the company building the canal and the bank backing the loans, the state was left with over $2,000,000 in bad debt. During his business trips to New York to finance his internal improvements program, Mason became acquainted with Julia Phelps and the two married on November 1, 1838.

In early 1838, Mason led the state militia in helping to thwart the [[Patriot War]], an attempt by irregulars to invade and annex parts of Canada. The schooner ''Ann'' was seized by the Patriots on January 8 and sailed down to [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. Mason, along with a detachment of 200 militiamen, pursued them in two steamships. A hundred Canadian militia also followed in the steamer ''Alliance''. Mason met with the Patriot leaders at Gibraltar, but the captured steamship ''Ann'' continued on toward [[Fort Malden]] on the Canadian shore. On January 9, the Patriots began shelling Fort Malden and the town of [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]] from the ''Ann''. The Canadian militia took up positions in the town while the Patriots moved 300 men onto the Canadian [[Bois Blanc Island (Ontario)|Bois Blanc Island]] opposite the town. The Canadian militia opened fire on the schooner when it tried to reach the island. The Canadians shot several of the ship's crew and damaged the sails and rigging. The ship drifted until it ran aground, at which point the Canadian militia boarded it, encountered no resistance, and captured the crew. The remaining Patriot forces quit Bois Blanc for the safety of the American side of the river.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8d8BAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15 |title = The Patriot War |first = Robert B. |last = Ross |year = 1890 |publisher = The Detroit Evening News and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Patriots were wounded, a few killed, and the Canadians captured 300 muskets, 2 cannon, 10 kegs of gunpowder and various accoutrements.&lt;ref&gt;Col. Radcliff's report to Lt. Gov. Sir George Arthur, quoted in {{harvp|Ross|1890|page = 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions of the so-called "Patriots" were charged in the U.S. as a violation of the [[Neutrality Act of 1794|Neutrality Act]].

Rather than risking a contentious campaign and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat in the elections of 1839, Mason instead decided to give up politics and attempt a private law practice. His successor as governor, an old political rival, [[William Woodbridge]], was determined to place the blame for Michigan's financial mess on Mason, and charged Mason with corruption related to the $5,000,000 loan. Mason attempted to defend himself, but his reputation was ruined.

==Retirement and death in New York==
[[File:Stevens T Mason Monument.JPG|thumb|right|Renovated Stevens T. Mason Monument in 2011]]
In 1841, Mason left Michigan for New York City, where his wealthy father-in-law, Thaddeus Phelps, lived. Mason tried to establish a law practice there, but struggled to build a clientele. He caught [[pneumonia]] in the winter of 1842 and died at the age of thirty-one during the night of January 4, 1843, though his date of death is sometimes listed as January 5.

Mason was initially interred at [[New York Marble Cemetery]],&lt;ref name=Marble&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.marblecemetery.org/intframes3.htm |title = LIST OF INTERMENTS |accessdate = September 6, 2009 |publisher = New York Marble Cemetery |author = New York Marble Cemetery }}&lt;/ref&gt; but on June 4, 1905, his remains were brought from New York to Detroit, accompanied by his sister Emily Mason, then age 92; his daughter, Mrs. Dorothy Mason Wright; three grandsons; and several grand-nephews and great-grandchildren. Services were conducted by Rev. David M. Cooper, who had known Mason as governor, 70 years earlier. Other notable attendees included then governor, [[Fred M. Warner]], and the mayor of Detroit, [[George P. Codd]]. His remains were interred at [[Capitol Park Historic District|Capitol Park]], the site of the old [[Michigan State Capitol#First state capitol|Michigan Capitol]].&lt;ref name=Caitlin&gt;{{harvp|Caitlin|2005|pp= 398–399}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a bronze statue of Mason on a granite pedestal was erected over the grave.  The statue was created by sculptor [[Albert Weinert]] and depicted the young Mason in a confident pose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=165 |title = The Monuments of Detroit |work = [[The Detroit News]] |date = September 5, 1999 |first = Pat |last = Zacharias |accessdate = October 28, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120708060651/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=165 |archivedate = July 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2009, officials announced that the park would be reconfigured and the monument moved several yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michigan History gets a polish in Capitol Park revamp |work = The Detroit News |date = September 3, 2009 |first = Neil |last = Rubin |accessdate = October 27, 2010 |url = http://detnews.com/article/20090903/OPINION03/909030382/Michigan-history-gets-a-polish-in-Capitol-Park-revamp }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But when the crews began to excavate the site, they discovered no grave.  After four days of searching, the vault containing the remains was located on June 29, 2010, a few yards south of its original site.  It was believed the grave was moved from its 1905 location in 1955 to make room for a bus terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=C4&amp;Date=20100701&amp;Category=NEWS&amp;ArtNo=7010801&amp;Ref=PH&amp;Profile=1318&amp;Params=Itemnr=1 |title = 'Boy Governor' Mason unearthed |work = [[Detroit Free Press]] |date = July 1, 2010 |first = Dan |last = Austin |accessdate = October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 199th anniversary of his birth, October 27, 2010, Mason was reburied for the fourth time in a newly built vault in the pedestal beneath the bronze statue designed by Albert Weinert. Mason's great-great-great grandnephew, who resides in [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile, Michigan]], witnessed the reinterment.  The current Dean of the [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Detroit|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]], where funeral services were held for Mason in 1843, officiated at the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Caitlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Detnews&gt;{{cite news |title = Michigan's first governor buried again |work = The Detroit News |date = October 27, 2010 |author = Micki Steele |accessdate = October 28, 2010 |url = http://www.detnews.com/article/20101027/METRO/10270384/1361/Michigan-s-first-governor-to-be-re-interred-today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michigan's first governor reburied |url = http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2010/10/29/Michigans-first-governor-reburied/UPI-46031288384911/ |date = October 29, 2010 |agency = [[UPI]] |accessdate = April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the reinterment, Mason's remains were transported to Lansing where they lay in state in the [[Michigan State Capitol|Capitol Building]].  Mason was only the third Michigan governor to lie in state in the Capitol.&lt;ref name="mprn"&gt;{{cite news |author = Bob Allen |title = Coffin of Michigan's First Governor on Display in Lansing |date = October 25, 2010 |publisher = [[Interlochen Public Radio]] |url = http://ipr.interlochen.org/ipr-news-features/episode/10589 |accessdate = January 23, 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019092831/http://ipr.interlochen.org/ipr-news-features/episode/10589 |archivedate = October 19, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his other accomplishments, Mason created an educational system and relocated the [[University of Michigan]] to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]].

==Plot summary==
The story follows Michelle Darnell, a titan of industry who is sent to prison for [[insider trading]], denounced by her former lover, Renault, who still holds a heavy grudge towards her for their breakup, after getting a promotion a few years ago. After doing her time, Michelle emerges, ready to rebrand herself as America's latest sweetheart, but not everyone she steamrolled is not so quick to forgive and forget. With nowhere to go and no one to scam, Michelle is forced to move in with former assistant Claire and her young daughter, Rachel. Now at her lowest point, Michelle wastes no time in devising a winner-take-all plan to rebuild her empire.

==Cast==

'''''The Peter Pyramid''''' ( {{ISBN|0-04-440057-8}} ) is a book published in 1986 by Dr. [[Laurence Peter|Laurence J. Peter]], who also wrote ''[[Peter Principle|The Peter Principle]]'' published in 1969.

In this book he turns his attention to proliferating [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], burgeoning officialdom and does for the system what the [[Peter Principle]] did for the individual.

With a host of unfortunate examples for real life, Dr. Peter shows how major organizations are constructed upside down, with the point of operation all but invisible beneath the bulk of a top-heavy administration.

Cutting through the red tape he suggests, with humour and wisdom, dozens of ways to simplify meaningless complexity and stop the current procession of the bland leading the bland.

'''Venture Café''' is a nonprofit hosting community-focused events and programs which support early-stage entrepreneurs.

There are currently eight Venture Cafés in cities across the Midwest, South, and Northeastern regions of the United States, and in Tokyo, Japan, and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Each Venture Café is independently managed and runs the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. Recently, Venture Café Providence recently was announced through a partnership with the city of Providence.&lt;ref name="wpri-vencaf"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/mayor-elorza-nonprofit-leaders-launch-innovation-partnership/1432204478 | first=Dan | last=McGowan | date=10 September 2018 | accessdate=5 October 2018 | title=Mayor Elorza, nonprofit leaders launch innovation partnership }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Venture Café Boston ==

The Venture Café was originally conceived as a restaurant located in the CIC in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe-hottest"&gt;{{cite web |title=How a failed restaurant became Cambridge’s hottest Thursday spot|work=Boston Globe |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/06/21/this-could-hottest-place-town-thursday-night-and-beer-free/so61lJpjP7HcZLXTCEGvcK/story.html|first=Scott|last=Kirsner|date= 21 June 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant failed to attract investment and was reimagined as a gathering for the entrepreneurial community based on the book Venture Café by Teresa Esser.&lt;ref name="venture-name"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venture Café’s mission is connecting innovators to make things happen.|work=Venture Cafe Official Website |url=http://venturecafeglobal.org/about/|date= 24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venture Café Kendall launched in 2009 bringing together hundreds of entrepreneurs each week for the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. 

== Venture Café St. Louis ==

In 2014, Venture Café expanded to the [[Cortex Innovation Community]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, to bring together the emerging startup community.&lt;ref name="stltoday-cambridge"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Innovation Center opens at Cortex|work=St. Louis Post Dispatch |url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/building-blocks/cambridge-innovation-center-opens-at-cortex/article_202c0df4-dbbb-567e-aec8-32ee0a9eff35.html|first=Tim|last=Bryant|date= Sep 29, 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the St. Louis location prompted the launch of Venture Cafés in other cities and ultimately the creation of Venture Café Global Institute, a public benefit corporation based in both St. Louis and Boston.&lt;ref name="silicon-venture"&gt;{{cite web |title=T-REX and Venture Cafe STL are changing St. Louis’ startup landscape|work=Silicon Prairie News |url=http://siliconprairienews.com/2018/03/t-rex-venture-cafe-changing-st-louis-startup-landscape/|first=Christine|last=McGuigan|date=2 March 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the City of Boston and Venture Café Kendall opened District Hall, a free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs, including an event venue, restaurant and coffee shop. In 2018, as part of St. Louis Cortex District's new 4220 Duncan building anchored by Microsoft, Venture Cafe launches Innovation Hall in St. Louis based upon Boston's District Hall.&lt;ref name="nextstl-innovationhall"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cortex Unveils New 4220 Duncan Building|work=NextSTL |url=https://nextstl.com/2018/05/cortex-unveils-new-4220-duncan-building/|first=Jason |last=Deem |date=10 May 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The St. Louis location will also be the first to launch the Education Hub, also known as EdHub STL, a program supporting and bringing together innovators in education to benefit youth access to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venture Cafe St. Louis To Open Innovation Hall At Cortex|url=http://eqstl.com/venture-cafe-st-louis-open-innovation-hall-cortex/|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; EdHub STL is inspired by the Forward Through Ferguson report which calls for an innovation education hub to address the region's most entrenched educational issues.&lt;ref name="fwdthruferguson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Create an Innovative Education Hub|work=Forward Through Ferguson |url=https://forwardthroughferguson.org/calls-to-action/innovative-education-hub/|date= 24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
=== Thursday Gathering ===
The flagship program of Venture Café, is the Thursday Gathering, a weekly, community-focused event that provides opportunities for new and experienced entrepreneurs the ability to exchange ideas and support. The Thursday Gathering includes several free educational sessions aimed at entrepreneurs to learn how to start and run a business. The Gatherings are intentionally informal allowing for more opportunity to engage in creative and speculative ideas and look for collaborators, co-founders, mentors, or investors.&lt;ref name="venture-name" /&gt;

=== Civic Innovation Centers ===
