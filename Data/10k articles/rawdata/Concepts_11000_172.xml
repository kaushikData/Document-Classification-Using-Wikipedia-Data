In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}

Vol. I.|last=Tillich|first=Paul|date=1951-01-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S. Lewis|source=The Abolition of Man}}

[[I. K. Taimni]] says:
{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

'''Alaveteli''' is [[free and open source software]] by [[mySociety]] to help citizens write [[Freedom of Information request]]s and automatically publish any responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaveteli.org/about-2/ |title=About « Alaveteli – international Right to Know software |publisher=Alaveteli.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaveteli is described as "a project to create a free, standard, internationalised platform for making Freedom of Information (FOI) requests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/credits Credits], WhatDoTheyKnow.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaveteli.org/about-2/|title=Alaveteli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alaveteli is funded by the [[Open Society Foundations|Open Society Institute]] and the [[Hivos|Hivos Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mysociety.org/about/funding/|title=Funding / mySociety|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It started life as the software running [[mysociety#whatdotheyknow|WhatDoTheyKnow]], a UK site that publishes responses to FOI requests. The original WhatDoTheyKnow code was written primarily by [[Francis Irving]] while working for mySociety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/about#credits |title=About |publisher=WhatDoTheyKnow |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaveteli is named after [[Alaveteli, Finland|Alaveteli]] in [[Finland]] where [[Anders Chydenius]] who was an early campaigner&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120305004359/http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf The World's First Freedom of Information Act]&lt;/ref&gt; for Freedom of Information worked as a curate. Alaveteli is the name for the software rather than a public facing website or brand.

People who run sites on the Alaveteli platform are also invited to become part of a community, with support and tips shared via a message board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alaveteli-users|title=Google Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regular conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mysociety.org/projects/freedom-of-information/alaveteli/alavetelicon-2015/|title=AlaveteliCon 2015 / mySociety|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative free and open source software that are used to operate FOI-request portals include Froide, which&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/stefanw/froide|title=stefanw/froide|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://FragDenStaat.de FragDenStaat.de] in [[Germany]] and [https://FragDenStaat.at FragDenStaat.at] in [[Austria]] are based on, and [[MuckRock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/MuckRock/muckrock/|title=MuckRock/muckrock|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used for MuckRock and FOIA Machine in the United States.

'''Allowable Strength Design''' (ASD) is a term used by the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] (AISC) in the 14th Edition of the Manual of Steel Construction.

Allowable '''Stress''' Design philosophy was left unsupported by AISC after the 9th edition of the manual which remained an acceptable [[reference design]] standard in evolving [[building code]]s (e.g. [[International Building Code]] by the [[International Code Council]]). This presented problems since new research, engineering concepts and design philosophy were ignored in the minimum requirements and references in the aging 9th edition. As a result, structures that were code compliant based on design using the [[Permissible stress design|Allowable Stress Design]] methods may not have been code compliant if reviewed with the [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) requirements - particularly where the LRFD procedures explicitly defined additional analysis which was not explicitly defined in the Allowable Stress Design procedures.

AISC's Allowable '''Strength''' Design applies a quasi-[[safety factor]] approach to evaluating allowable strength. Ultimate strength of an element or member is determined in the same manner regardless of the load combination method considered (e.g. ASD or LRFD). [[Design load]] combination effects are determined in a manner appropriate to the intended form of the analysis results. ASD load combinations are compared to the ultimate strength reduced by a factor (omega) which provides a mathematical form similar to Allowable Stress Design resolved with a safety factor.

This AISC Allowable Strength Design does not attempt to relate capacity to elastic stress levels. Therefore, it is inappropriate to refer to the procedure or philosophy as either Allowable Stress or Permissible Stress Design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3481">An '''autonomous agent''' is an ''intelligent agent'' operating on an owner's behalf but without any interference of that ownership entity. An [[Intelligent agent]], however appears according to a multiply cited statement in a no longer accessible [[IBM]] white paper as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intelligent agents are software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence or autonomy, and in so doing, employ some knowledge or representation of the user's goals or desires.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an agent is a system situated in, and part of, a technical or natural environment, which senses any or some status of that environment, and acts on it in pursuit of its own agenda. Such an agenda evolves from [[drive theory|drives]] (or programmed [[objective (goal)|goals]]). The agent acts to change part of the environment or of its status and influences what it sensed.

Non-biological examples include [[intelligent agent]]s, [[autonomous robot]]s, and various [[software agent]]s, including [[artificial life]] agents, and many [[computer virus]]es. Biological examples are not yet defined.

== Agent appearance ==
Lee et al. (2015) post safety issue from how the combination of external appearance and internal autonomous agent have impact on human reaction about autonomous vehicles. Their study explores the humanlike appearance agent and high level of autonomy are strongly correlated with social presence, intelligence, safety and trustworthy. In specific, appearance impact most on affective trust while autonomy impact most on both affective and cognitive domain of trust where cognitive trust is characterized by knowledge-based factors and affective trust ls largely emotion driven &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jae-Gil|date=Summer 2015|title=Can Autonomous Vehicles Be Safe and Trustworthy?

==Concept==
In  [[Sanskrit]], the word avatar ([[wikt:अवतार#Sanskrit|अवतार]] ''{{IAST|avatāra}}'') is derived from [[wiki:अव-तर#Sanskrit|अव-तर]] ''{{IAST|ava-tara}}'' (lit. to move/cross below, i.e. descend) and literally means "that which descends". In Hinduism, an avatar refers to deliberate descent of a [[deity]] to Earth, or a descent of the [[Supreme Being]].

The idea is to develop a [[spaceplane]] vehicle that can [[takeoff|take off]] from conventional airfields. Its [[liquid air cycle engine]] would collect air in the [[atmosphere]] on the way up, [[Liquefaction|liquefy]] it, separate [[oxygen]] and store it on board for subsequent flight beyond the atmosphere. The Avatar, a [[reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicle]], was first announced in May 1998 at the [[Aero India]] 98 exhibition held at Bangalore.

Avatar is projected to weigh 25 tons, of which 60% of that mass would be [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel.&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; The oxygen required by the vehicle for combustion in outer space would be collected from the atmosphere during takeoff, thus reducing the need to carry oxygen during launch.&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; The notional specification is for a [[Maximum takeoff weight|payload]] weighing up to {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on}} to [[low Earth orbit]] and to withstand up to 100 launches and reentries.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt;

If built, Avatar would take off [[HTHL|horizontally]] like a conventional airplane from a conventional airstrip using [[Ramjet|turbo-ramjet]] engines that burn hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; During this cruising phase, an on-board system would collect air from the atmosphere, from which liquid oxygen would be separated and stored and used to burn the stored hydrogen in the final flight phase to attain orbit. The vehicle would be designed to permit at least one hundred launches and [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentries]].&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt;

==Feasibility study==
The Avatar concept study was commissioned by India's [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"/&gt; India's Space Agency [[ISRO]] has no connection with the project.&lt;ref name="Avatar is DRDO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/usq251.pdf |title=AVATAR Project |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408110239/http://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/usq251.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=116544&amp;lsno=15|title=AVATAR Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Air Commodore Raghavan Gopalaswami, who headed the study, made a presentation on the [[spaceplane]] at the global conference on propulsion at Salt Lake City, United States on July 10, 2001.&lt;ref name="Gujarat 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delhi 2001"/&gt; Gopalaswami said the idea for Avatar originated from the work published by the [[RAND Corporation]] of the United States in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015353.pdf|title=Report of the Horizontal Launch Study|date=June 2011|publisher=[[NASA]]|format=PDF|quote=Last year of effort: 2001|work=DARPA|accessdate=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8047">In [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], the [[Sanskrit]] term '''Bīja''' ({{lang|sa|बीज}}) ([[Japanese language|Jp]]. 種子 shuji) ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] 种子 zhǒng zǐ), literally [[seed]], is used as a metaphor for the origin or cause of things and cognate with [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]].

==Buddhist theory of karmic seeds==
Various schools of Buddhist thought held that karmic effects arose out of seeds that were latent in an individual's [[mindstream]] or psycho-physical continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert Gethin describes the theory thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I perform an action motivated by greed, it plants a 'seed' in the series of [[Dharma#Buddhism|dharmas]] [phenomena] that is my mind. Such a seed is not a thing in itself - a dharma but merely the modification or 'perfuming' of the subsequent flow of dharmas consequent upon the action. In the course of time this modification matures and issues in a particular result, in the same way as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately, but only after the 'modifications' of the shoot, stem, leaf, and flower.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, Rupert. The Foundations of Buddhism, page 222.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Sautrantika]] school held such a theory as did the [[Mahasamghikas]] and the early Mahasisakas.&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte; Pruden. Karmasiddhiprakarana, 1987, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sautrantika Sthavira Srilata held a conception of "subsidiary element" (''anudhatu'' or *''purvanudhatu'') which also corresponds to this theory of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The seed theory was defended by the Buddhist philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] in his [[Abhidharmakosha]] who mentions that is the view of the “old teachers” (''purvacarya'').&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also present in the ''Viniscayasamgrahani'' of the [[Yogacarabhumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Kritzer, Robert. SAUTRANTIKA IN THE ABHIDHARMAKOSABHASYA&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bashyam Vasubandhu connects the Sautrantika theory of seeds with the notion of the latent defilements or [[anusaya]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sautrantikas define [[anusaya]]s as [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] in the state of seeds and say that they are not separate [[dravya]]s (substances). Anusayas are dormant, i.e., not actualized, while paryavasthanas (active defilements) are awakened.&lt;ref&gt;Kritzer, Robert. SAUTRANTIKA IN THE ABHIDHARMAKOSABHASYA, page 364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, the ''Nyayanusara'' of Sanghabhadra states that the theory had different terms to refer to "seeds":

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are certain masters who give different names to these seeds, each according to his own understanding. Some call them subsidiary elements (''anudhatu''), others call them impressions (''vasana''); still others call them capability (''samarthya''), non-disappearance (''avipranasa''), or accumulation (''upacaya'').&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA:
A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory is considerably extended in the [[Consciousness-only]] teachings of the [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism. According to this theory, all experiences and actions produce ''bīja'' as impressions, stored in the [[alaya]] (storehouse) consciousness.  The external world is produced when the seeds "perfume" this consciousness.

==In Tantra==
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism and [[Hinduism]], the term ''bīja'' is used for mystical "seed syllables" contained within [[mantra]]s.  These seeds do not have precise meanings, but are thought to carry connections to spiritual principles.  The best-known ''bīja'' syllable is [[Om]], first found in the Hindu scriptures the [[Upanishads]].

Khanna (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;21) links mantras and [[yantra]]s to [[thoughtform]]s:

{{quote|Mantras, the Sanskrit syllables inscribed on yantras, are essentially 'thought forms' representing divinities or cosmic powers, which exert their influence by means of sound-vibrations.|&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Madhu (2003). ''Yantra:  The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity. '' Inner Traditions.  {{ISBN|0-89281-132-3}}  &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-89281-132-8}}. p.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some tantric traditions, the Bija of the '[[Varnamala (disambiguation)|Varnamala]]' (Sanskrit; English: "garland of letters"; which may be rendered as alphabet) are understood as aniconic representations and sound embodiments of the [[matrikas]] (a group of goddesses).

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the seed syllables corresponding to the [[Three Vajras]] are: a white ''oṃ'' (enlightened body), a red ''āḥ'' (enlightened speech) and a blue ''hūṃ'' (enlightened mind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rinpoche|first=Pabongka|title=Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment|publisher=Wisdom Books|year=1997|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bön]] tradition of Tibet, it's a little different: a white ''āḥ'', a red ''oṃ'' and a blue ''hūṃ''.

Bijas are often the vehicle of [[esoteric transmission]] of [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]] to a '[[tertön]]' (Tibetan; English: "revealer of terma"), such as that experienced by [[Dudjom Lingpa]].&lt;ref&gt;*Lingpa, Dudjom; Tulku, Chagdud; Norbu, Padma Drimed; Barron, Richard (Lama Chökyi Nyima, translator); Fairclough, Susanne (translator) (1994, 2002 revised). ''Buddhahood without meditation: a visionary account known as 'Refining one's perception' (Nang-jang)'' (English; Tibetan: ''ran bźin rdzogs pa chen po'i ranźal mnon du byed pa'i gdams pa zab gsan sñin po''). Revised Edition. Junction City, CA, USA: Padma Publishing. {{ISBN|1-881847-33-0}} p.xx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross cultural correlates==
[[Guruwari]] of the [[Indigenous Australian]] peoples is an interesting cross cultural correlate and may be cognate.{{check|date=August 2017}}&lt;!-- Highly suspect claim --&gt;  See also [[gankyil]] of the [[Vajrayana]] tradition which is cognate with [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]].  In the respected fieldwork published in ''Aboriginal Men of High Degree'', [[A.P. Elkin]] cites what he in his professional opinion is evidence that traders from [[Indonesia]] brought fleeting contact of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] to areas near modern-day [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]].&lt;ref name=Elkin&gt;[[Elkin, A.P.]]. ''Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition''. 1973. [[Inner Traditions]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditions of [[Mantrayana]] were also evident in Indonesia, e.g. [[Candi Sukuh]]. And it is in the Vajrayana and Mantrayana traditions of [[esoteric transmission]] where bija take precedence. Indeed, bija defines Mantrayana. Elkin interpreted a link between [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] culture and Buddhist ideas such as [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name=Elkin/&gt; He argued this link could have been brought through contact with Macassan traders.&lt;ref name=Elkin/&gt; There was also speculation due to reports of [[China|Chinese]] relics appearing in northern Australia dating to the 15th century, although it may have been brought much later through trade rather than earlier exploration. Elkin cited linguistic commonalities of certain far northern Australian indigenous words and lexical items and ancient southern Indian [[Dravidian languages]]. There are also documented analogues and marked similarities in their kinship systems.{{check|date=August 2017}}

Park|Park Foundation]], the Reva and David Logan Foundation, Democratie en Media, [[Goldsmiths]], [[University of London]], and several smaller private trusts.

In 2009, the CIJ was instrumental in helping to found the [[Bureau for Investigative Journalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/|publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent, foundation-supported producer of in-depth reporting in defence of the public interest.

In 2012, the CIJ instituted a programme of active pro bono assistance, counselling and defence to whistleblowers and those who have exposed crimes and wrongdoing in their workplace.

The CIJ recently launched a programme on information security, organising workshops for journalists, researchers and lawyers on encryption, Tor, OTR and other protective technologies. In 2014, the organisation also began a series of conferences which bring together journalists, technologists and hacktivists to forge alliances against [[mass surveillance]] and censorship. These events are titled the CIJ Logan Symposia.

[[File:Colette Dowling 1989.jpg|thumb|Colette Dowling in 1989]]
The '''Cinderella complex''' was first described by [[Colette Dowling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cinderella Complex: Women's Hidden Fear of Independence |author=Colette Dowling |date=1981 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-73334-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a book on women's fear of [[independence]] – an unconscious desire to be taken care of by others. The complex is said to become more apparent as a person grows older. &lt;ref&gt;Weaver, R. (2017). Psychology Behind the Cinderella Complex. Retrieved January 27, 2017, from http://www.empowher.com/mental-health/content/psychology-behind-cinderella-complex?page=0,1&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is named after the [[fairy tale]] character [[Cinderella]]. It is based on the idea of femininity portrayed in that story, where a woman is beautiful, graceful, polite, supportive, hardworking, independent, and maligned by the females of her society, but she is not capable of changing her situations with her own actions and must be helped by an outside force, usually a male (i.e., the [[Prince Charming|Prince]]).

==Criticism==
This [[phenomenon]]  or [[syndrome]] becomes particularly significant with regard to the question of why women may choose to stay in dysfunctional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;THE CINDERELLA SYNDROME. (1981, March 21). Retrieved January 27, 2017, from https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/magazine/the-cinderella-syndrome.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense==
Others point to [[Ronald Fairbairn]]'s concept of mature dependency,&lt;ref name=v120&gt;[[Judith Viorst]] (2010) ''Necessary Losses''. Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|1439134863}}. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; to challenge cultural disparagement of dependency in favor of an ideal of isolated independence.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips (1994) ''On Flirtation''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674634403}}. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carol Gilligan]]'s championship of a web of connections as a feminist goal,&lt;ref name=v120/&gt; rather than the solitary male hero, is also invoked to defend the Cinderella complex's tendency to define the self in terms of a mate/settled relationship.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Corsini (1999) ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|158391028X}}. p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

In the movie ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Teri Garr]] tells [[Dustin Hoffman]] during their break-up at the end of the movie, "I read the Cinderella Complex, I know I'm responsible for my own orgasm! I don't care, I just don't like being lied to!" &lt;ref name="tootsie"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=[[Sydney Pollack]] (Director) | date=Dec 1, 1982 | title=Tootsie | medium=Motion picture | location=Manhattan, NY | publisher=Warner Bros, Columbia Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' episode 4 "[[Revenge and Remorse (The Guilty Alibi)|Revenge and Remorse]]", [[Joyce Brothers]] gets advice from the shoe shine man Johnny about how to treat the Cinderella Complex: "Tell them to get in touch with their unconscious feelings and to share in the growth process with their partner"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">In [[mathematics]], '''contour sets''' [[Generalization|generalize]] and [[Formal system|formalize]] the everyday notions of
*everything superior to something
*everything superior or equivalent to something
*everything inferior to something
*everything inferior or equivalent to something.

== Formal definitions ==
Given a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] on pairs of [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s of [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq~\subseteq~X^2&lt;/math&gt;
and an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;

The '''upper contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''lower contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to them:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''strict upper contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; being ''in this way'' related to any of them:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~(y\succcurlyeq x)\land\lnot(x\succcurlyeq y)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''strict lower contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to them without any of them being ''in this way'' related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~(x\succcurlyeq y)\land\lnot(y\succcurlyeq x)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The formal expressions of the last two may be simplified if we have defined
:&lt;math&gt;\succ~=~\left\{ \left(a,b\right)~\backepsilon~\left(a\succcurlyeq b\right)\land\lnot(b\succcurlyeq a)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
so that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' related to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the strict upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the strict lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Contour sets of a function ===
In the case of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; considered in terms of relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleright&lt;/math&gt;, reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the implied relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\triangleright f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Arithmetic ===
Consider a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the relation [[Inequality (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;]].  Then
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''greater than or equal'' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''greater'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''less than or equal'' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''less'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider, more generally, the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\ge f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
Then
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(y)\ge f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(y)&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It would be ''technically'' possible to define contour sets in terms of the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\le f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
though such definitions would tend to confound ready understanding.

In the case of a real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; (whose arguments might or might not be themselves real numbers), reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\ge f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the arguments to &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; might be [[Tuple|vector]]s, and that the [[Mathematical notation|notation]] used might instead be
:&lt;math&gt;[(a_1 ,a_2 ,\ldots)\succcurlyeq(b_1 ,b_2 ,\ldots)]~\Leftarrow~[f(a_1 ,a_2 ,\ldots)\ge f(b_1 ,b_2 ,\ldots)]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Economic ===
In [[economics]], the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; could be interpreted as a set of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods and services]] or of possible [[Outcome (game theory)|outcomes]], the relation &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; as ''strict [[preference]]'', and the relationship &lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq&lt;/math&gt; as ''weak preference''.  Then
* the upper contour set, or '''better set''',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Economic Exchange and Social Organization: The Edgeworthian Foundations of General Equilibrium Theory|last = Robert P. Gilles|first = |publisher = Springer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyahaTvMB3cC&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;ots=4CelGh9izH&amp;dq=%22better%20set%22%20economics&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22better%20set%22%20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''at least as desired'' as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''more desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set, or '''worse set''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''no more desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''less desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Such preferences might be captured by a [[utility]] function &lt;math&gt;u()&lt;/math&gt;, in which case
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(y)\ge u(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(y)&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x)\ge u(y)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x)&gt;u(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Complementarity ==
On the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[total order]]ing of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the upper contour set is the strict lower contour set.
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the complement of the strict upper contour set is the lower contour set.
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

In a general sense, the '''design load''' is the maximum amount of something a system is designed to handle or the maximum amount of something that the system can produce, which are very different meanings. For example, a [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a design load of 20 tons is designed to be able to lift loads that weigh 20 tons or less. However, when a failure could be catastrophic, such as a crane dropping its load or collapsing entirely, a [[factor of safety]] is necessary. As a result, the crane should lift about 2 to 5 tons at the most. 

In [[structural design]], a design load is greater than the load which the system is expected to support. This is because engineers incorporate a [[safety factor]] in their design, in order to ensure that the system will be able to support at least the expected loads (called [[specified loads]], despite any problems with construction, materials, etc. that go unnoticed during construction.

A [[heater]] would have a general design load, meaning the maximum amount of heat it can produce. A bridge would have a specified load, with the design load being determined by engineers and applied as a theoretical load intended to ensure the actual real-world capacity of the specified load.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10010">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[differential topology]], the '''double tangent bundle''' or the '''second tangent bundle''' refers to the [[tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|(''TTM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'')}} of the total space ''TM'' of the [[tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} of a [[differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]] ''M''
.&lt;ref&gt;J.M.Lee, ''Introduction to Smooth Manifolds'', Springer-Verlag, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''TTM'' → ''TM''. Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second tangent bundle arises in the study of [[Connection (vector bundle)|connections]] and second order ordinary differential equations, i.e., [[spray (mathematics)|(semi)spray structures]] on smooth manifolds, and it is not to be confused with the [[jet bundle|second order jet bundle]].

== Secondary vector bundle structure and canonical flip ==

Since {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} is a vector bundle on its own right, its tangent bundle has the [[secondary vector bundle structure]] {{nowrap|(''TTM'',(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM''),}} where {{nowrap|(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;:''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TM''}} is the push-forward of the canonical projection {{nowrap|''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''M''.}}
In the following we denote

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM, \qquad X = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM
&lt;/math&gt;

and apply the associated coordinate system

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi \mapsto (x^1,\ldots,x^n,\xi^1,\ldots,\xi^n)
&lt;/math&gt;

on ''TM''. Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at ''X''&amp;isin;''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
(\pi_{TM})^{-1}_*(X) = \Big\{ \ X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^k}\Big|_\xi
\ \Big| \ \xi\in T_xM \ , \ Y^1,\ldots,Y^n\in\R \ \Big\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The double tangent bundle is a [[double vector bundle]].

The '''canonical flip'''&lt;ref&gt;P.Michor. ''Topics in Differential Geometry,'' American Mathematical Society, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a smooth involution ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' that exchanges these vector space structures
in the sense that it is a vector bundle isomorphism between {{nowrap|(''TTM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'')}} and {{nowrap|(''TTM'',(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'').}} In the associated coordinates on ''TM'' it reads as

:&lt;math&gt;
j\Big(X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}\Big|_\xi\Big)
= \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_X + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}\Big|_X.
&lt;/math&gt;

The canonical flip has the property that for any ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''M'', 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial f} {{\partial t} {\partial s}} = j \circ \frac {\partial f} {{\partial s} {\partial t}}
&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''s'' and ''t'' are coordinates of the standard basis of '''R''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that both partial derivatives are functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ''TTM''.

This property can, in fact, be used to give an intrinsic definition of the canonical flip.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fisher and H. Turner Laquer, Second Order Tangent Vectors in Riemannian Geometry, J. Korean Math. Soc. 36 (1999), No. 5, pp. 959-1008&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is a submersion
''p'': J&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,M) &amp;rarr; ''TTM'' given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
p([f])=\frac {\partial f} {{\partial t} {\partial s}} (0,0)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' can be defined in the space of two-jets at zero because only depends on ''f'' up to order two at zero. We consider the application:
:&lt;math&gt;
J: J^2_0(\mathbb{R}^2,M) \to J^2_0(\mathbb{R}^2,M) \quad / \quad J([f])=[f \circ \alpha]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;alpha;(''s'',''t'')= (''t'',''s''). Then ''J'' is compatible with the projection ''p'' and induces the canonical flip on the quotient ''TTM''.

== Canonical tensor fields on the tangent bundle==

As for any [[vector bundle]], the tangent spaces {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')}} of the fibres ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' of the tangent bundle {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} can be identified with the fibres ''T''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' themselves. Formally this is achieved though the '''vertical lift''', which is a natural vector space isomorphism
{{nowrap|vl&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''&amp;rarr;''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')}} defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
(\operatorname{vl}_\xi X)[f]:=\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}f(x,\xi+tX), \qquad f\in C^\infty(TM).
&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical lift can also be seen as a natural vector bundle isomorphism
{{nowrap|vl:(&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''TM''&amp;rarr;''VTM''}}
from the pullback bundle of {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} over {{nowrap|''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''M''}} onto the vertical tangent bundle

:&lt;math&gt;
VTM:=\operatorname{Ker}(\pi_{TM})_* \subset TTM.
&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical lift lets us define the '''canonical vector field'''

:&lt;math&gt;
V:TM\to TTM; \qquad V_\xi := \operatorname{vl}_\xi\xi,
&lt;/math&gt;

which is smooth in the slit tangent bundle ''TM''\0. The canonical vector field can be also defined as the infinitesimal generator of the Lie-group action

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb R\times (TM\setminus 0) \to TM\setminus 0; \qquad (t,\xi) \mapsto e^t\xi.
&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the canonical vector field, which can be defined for any vector bundle, the '''canonical endomorphism'''

:&lt;math&gt;
J:TTM\to TTM; \qquad J_\xi X := \operatorname{vl}_\xi(\pi_{TM})_*X, \qquad X\in T_\xi TM
&lt;/math&gt;

is special to the tangent bundle. The canonical endomorphism ''J'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\operatorname{Ker}(J)=VTM, \qquad \mathcal L_VJ= -J, \qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY],
&lt;/math&gt;

and it is also known as the '''tangent structure''' for the following reason. If (''E'',''p'',''M'') is any vector bundle
with the canonical vector field ''V'' and a (1,1)-tensor field ''J'' that satisfies the properties listed above, with ''VE'' in place of ''VTM'', then the vector bundle (''E'',''p'',''M'') is isomorphic to the tangent bundle {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} of the base manifold, and ''J'' corresponds to the tangent structure of ''TM'' in this isomorphism.

There is also a stronger result of this kind &lt;ref&gt;D.S.Goel, ''Almost Tangent Structures'', Kodai Math.Sem.Rep. '''26''' (1975), 187-193.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if ''N'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold and if there exists a (1,1)-tensor field ''J'' on ''N'' that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\operatorname{Ker}(J), \qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY],
&lt;/math&gt;

then ''N'' is diffeomorphic to an open set of the total space of a tangent bundle of some ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'', and ''J'' corresponds to the tangent structure of ''TM'' in this diffeomorphism.

In any associated coordinate system on ''TM'' the canonical vector field and the canonical endomorphism have the coordinate representations

:&lt;math&gt;
V = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}, \qquad J = dx^k\otimes\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== (Semi)spray structures ==

A [[Spray (mathematics)|Semispray structure]] on a smooth manifold ''M'' is by definition a smooth vector field ''H'' on ''TM''&amp;nbsp;\0 such that ''JH''=''V''. An equivalent definition is that ''j''(''H'')=''H'', where ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the canonical flip. A semispray ''H'' is a [[Spray (mathematics)|spray]], if in addition, [''V'',''H'']=''H''.

Spray and semispray structures are invariant versions of second order ordinary differential equations on ''M''. The difference between spray and semispray structures is that the solution curves of sprays are invariant in positive [[Parametrization|reparametrizations]]{{jargon-inline|reason=What makes a reparametrization positive?|date=September 2015}} as point sets on ''M'', whereas solution curves of semisprays typically are not.

== Nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds ==

The canonical flip makes it possible to define nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds as follows. Let
:&lt;math&gt;
T(TM\setminus 0) = H(TM\setminus 0) \oplus V(TM\setminus 0)
&lt;/math&gt;
be an [[Ehresmann connection]] on the slit tangent bundle ''TM''/0 and consider the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;
D:(TM\setminus 0)\times \Gamma(TM) \to TM; \quad D_XY :=  (\kappa\circ j)(Y_*X),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the push-forward, ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the canonical flip and &amp;kappa;:''T''(''TM''/0)&amp;rarr;''TM''/0 is the connector map. The mapping ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is a derivation in the module &amp;Gamma;&amp;nbsp;(''TM'') of smooth vector fields on ''M'' in the sense that

* &lt;math&gt;D_X(\alpha Y + \beta Z) = \alpha D_XY + \beta D_XZ, \qquad \alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;D_X(fY) = X[f]Y + f D_XY, \qquad \qquad \qquad f\in C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

Any mapping ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; with these properties is called a '''(nonlinear) covariant derivative'''
&lt;ref&gt;I.Bucataru, R.Miron, ''Finsler-Lagrange Geometry'', Editura Academiei Române, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on ''M''.
The term ''nonlinear'' refers to the fact that this kind of covariant derivative ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; on is not necessarily linear with respect to the direction ''X''&amp;isin;''TM''/0 of the differentiation.

Looking at the local representations one can confirm that the Ehresmann connections on (''TM''/0,&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''TM''/0&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'') and nonlinear covariant derivatives on ''M'' are in one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, if ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is linear in ''X'', then the Ehresmann connection is linear in the [[secondary vector bundle structure]], and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; coincides with its linear covariant derivative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">[[Image:rock droppings.jpg|thumb|''Rock Drop'', by Drop Artists, 1962, (simulation)          Lawrence Kansas]]

In 1961, filmmaker [[Gene Bernofsky]] and artist [[Clark Richert]], art students from the [[University of Kansas]], developed an art concept they called '''Drop Art''' or '''droppings'''. Informed by the "[[happenings]]" of [[Allan Kaprow]] and the impromptu performances a few years earlier of [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Buckminster Fuller]] at [[Black Mountain College]], Drop Art began when Richert and Bernofsky started painting rocks and dropping them from a loft roof onto the sidewalk of Lawrence Kansas's main drag — watching the reactions of passersby. Early Drop Art included such pieces as ''Egg Drop'' and ''Pendulum'' (pictured) .

Drop Art eventually led to the creation of [[Drop City]], an experimental artist's community founded in 1965 near Trinidad, Colorado. The intention was to create a live-in work of Drop Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">'''Drumming out''' is the historical act of being [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorably dismissed from military service]] to the sound of a drum. In modern figurative usage, in which the term is sometimes altered to "drub[bing/bed/etc.] out," it may refer to any act of expulsion or dismissal in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/drummed+out|title=Drum|publisher=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Drumming out of the French army (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|alt=Satirical cartoon of depicting Napoleon being drummed out|Satirical cartoon representing Napoleon's exile to Elba.]]
==Origin==
One of the earliest recorded references to drumming out occurs in [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Moral Essays]]'', 3rd epistle, 1731–1733: "Chartres was a man infamous for all manner of vices. When he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat; he was next banished Brussels, and drummed out of Ghent, on the same account."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbBXAAAAYAAJ|publisher=books.google.com|title=The Works of Alexander Pope, Esq: Moral essays|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also occurs in a figurative sense in [[Thomas Amory (author)|Thomas Amory]]'s  1766 ''Life of John Buncle'': "They ought to be drummed out of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/124700.html|publisher=phrases.org.uk|title=Drummed out of the army|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolutionary War==
The earliest known discharge of an American soldier involved the drumming out of [[Lieutenant]] [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin]] for attempted [[sodomy]] in March of 1778 during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The diary of Lieutenant James McMichael contains a record of the sentence being carried out: 

{{blockquote|"March 15. — I this morning proceeded to the grand parade, where I was a spectator to the drumming out of Lieut. Enslin of Col. Malcom's regiment. He was first drum'd from right to left of the parade, thence to the left wing of the army; from that to the centre, and lastly transported over the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]] with orders never to be seen in Camp in the future. This shocking scene was performed by all the drums and fifes in the army—the coat of the [[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]] was turned wrong side out."&lt;ref&gt;James McMichael, ''[https://archive.org/stream/pennsylvaniaarc22penngoog#page/n231/mode/1up/search/enslin Pennsylvania Archives (Second Series)]'', William Henry Egle, ed., v.15, Harrisburg, PA: E.K. Meyers, State Printer, 1890. p.&amp;nbsp;217&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The sentencing order, approved by [[George Washington]], called for Enslin to be drummed out, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington Drummed Out Soldier for 'Infamous Crime' of Attempted ‘Sodomy’|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/george-washington-drummed-out-soldier-infamous-crime-attempted-sodomy|website=CNS News|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
[[American Civil War]] officers drummed out of service might have their heads shaved and their uniforms [[Cashiering|stripped of insignia]] and be paraded in front of their comrades.  Fellow officers were forbidden to touch the person being dishonorably discharged, but in more than one case after the war had ended, a drummed-out man was found dead after receiving a beating from his former comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/crimespunishments2.htm|publisher=floridareenactorsonline.cm|accessdate=2008-09-10|title=Crimes And Punishments In The Civil War|author=Robert Niepert|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813114136/http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/crimespunishments2.htm|archivedate=2009-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When someone was being drummed out, the tune "Rogue's March" would be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1861/june/albany-new-york.htm|accessdate=2008-09-11|title=Civil War Harper's Weekly, June 1, 1861|work=[[Harper's Weekly]]|quote=Drumming out Albany volunteers who refused to take the oath.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
The opening to the 1965 NBC series [[Branded (TV series)|''Branded'']] used the ceremony in its opening credits.

In the 1983 film [[The Lords of Discipline (film)|''The Lords of Discipline'']], one of the main characters is dismissed from the fictional Carolina Military Institute in such a ceremony.

In the ''[[Married... With Children]]'' episode "All-Nite Security Dude," Al is drummed out of his position as school security guard.

In season 4 episode 2 of AMC series ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'' a soldier's wife is drummed out of camp and loses her privileges as a camp follower for refusing to wash clothes for the army.

[[File:Indra, Chief of the Gods LACMA M.69.13.4 (1 of 5).jpg|thumb|Indra, the king of Devas, who are [[supernatural beings]] residing in Dyuloka]]
'''Dyuloka''' is a [[Sanskrit]] term for "heavenly world". It appears in the Vedic text ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', in verses 16.6.1.8–9 as well later texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0500/mw__0533.html Dyuloka], Monier Monier-Williams, English Sanskrit Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 500&lt;/ref&gt; Its root is ''Dyu'' (द्यु) which in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' means "heaven, shining, sky".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0500/mw__0532.html Dyu], Monier Monier-Williams, English Sanskrit Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 499&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_६.५१ 6.51.5], Rigveda, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in the ''[[Upanishads]]'', where it connotes "sky or heaven", as in sun lighting it up. For example, in the commentary to the [[Yajnavalkya]]-[[Gargi]] dialogue of section 6.2 in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'', Radhakrishnan translates ''Dyuloka'' as heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/PrincipalUpanishads/129481965-The-Principal-Upanishads-by-S-Radhakrishnan#page/n315/mode/2up/search/yonder Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], S. Radhakrishnan, George Allen &amp; Unwin, verse VI.2.9, page 312&lt;/ref&gt;

In another context, ''Dyuloka'' is the realm of existence ([[samsara]]) where souls are reborn as gods and goddesses, to live out a life based on one's [[karma]] before they die again, according to the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/srimaddevibhagav26vijnuoft/srimaddevibhagav26vijnuoft_djvu.txt|title=Archived: Full text of "Srimad Devi Bhagavatam".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29482">'''Egocentric bias''' is the tendency to rely too heavily on one's own perspective and/or have a higher opinion of oneself than reality.&lt;ref name="Schacter2011" /&gt; It appears to be the result of the psychological need to satisfy one's [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] and to be advantageous for [[memory consolidation]]. Research has shown that experiences, ideas, and beliefs are more easily recalled when they match one's own, causing an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] outlook. [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|Michael Ross]] and [[Fiore Sicoly]] first identified this [[cognitive bias]] in their 1979 paper, "Egocentric biases in availability and attribution".&lt;ref name="RossSicoly1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holtgraves2014" /&gt; Egocentric bias is referred to by most psychologists as a general umbrella term under which other related phenomena fall.

The effects of egocentric bias can differ based on personal characteristics, such as age and the number of languages one speaks.   Thus far, there have been many studies focusing on specific implications of egocentric bias in different contexts.  Research on collaborative group tasks have emphasized that people view their own contributions differently than they view that of others.  Other areas of research have been aimed at studying how mental health patients display egocentric bias, and at the relationship between egocentric bias and voter distribution.  These types of studies surrounding egocentric bias usually involve written or verbal questionnaires, based on the subject's personal life or their decision in various hypothetical scenarios.

== History and analysis ==
The term "egocentric bias" was first coined in 1980 by [[Anthony Greenwald]], a psychologist at Ohio State University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He described it as a phenomenon in which people skew their beliefs so that what they recall from their memory or what they initially understood is different than what actually occurred.  He cites research by Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker, who explain that the [[self-reference effect]] is the ability of people to recall information better if they think about how the information will affect them during the [[encoding (memory)|encoding]] process (recording memories in their brain).  Greenwald argues that the self-reference effect causes people to exaggerate their role in a situation.  Furthermore, information is better encoded, and thus people are more likely to suffer from egocentric bias, if they produce information actively rather than passively, such as by having a direct role in the outcome of a situation.

Egocentric bias occurs when people fail to consider situations from other people's perspectives.  Egocentric bias has influenced ethical judgements to the point where people not only believe that self-interested outcomes are preferential but are also the morally sound way to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epley|first=Nicholas|last2=Caruso|first2=Eugene M.|year=2004|title=Egocentric Ethics|url=http://pbjlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ego_ethics.pdf|journal=Social Justice Research|volume=17|pages=171–187|via=|doi=10.1023/b:sore.0000027408.72713.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;   People are more inclined to be aware of their own behaviors since they can use their thoughts and emotions to gain more information about themselves.  These thoughts and emotions can affect how people view themselves in relation to others in specific situations.  A common example arises when people are asked to explain how much credit should be given to each person in a collaborative project.  [[Daniel Schacter]], a psychology professor at Harvard University, considers egocentric bias as one of the [[seven sins of memory|"seven sins" of memory]] and essentially reflects the prominent role played by the self when encoding and retrieving [[episodic memories]]. As such, people often feel that their contributions to a collaborative project are greater than those of other members, since people tend to focus more on how much they have done.&lt;ref name="Tanaka1993" /&gt;

In social context, egocentric bias influences people to choose a social circle that is capable of maintaining one's positive traits. Studies show that one's choice of friend or social circle is likely to be dependent on the amount of positive feedback received.&lt;ref name="Clark2009" /&gt;

== Examples ==
In a 1993 study conducted in Japan, subjects were asked to write down fair or unfair behaviors that they themselves or others did. When writing about fair behavior, they tended to start with the word "I" rather than "others". Likewise, they began unfair behaviors with "others" rather than "I". This demonstrates that people tend to attribute successes and positive behaviors to themselves, while placing the burden of failures and negative behaviors on others.&lt;ref name="Tanaka1993" /&gt; Furthermore, in this study there were gender differences detected; Japanese women, compared to men, remembered the behaviors of others more than their own, and were also more probable to characterize fair or unfair behavior to others compared to themselves.&lt;ref name="Tanaka1993" /&gt;

Another study found that egocentric bias influences perceived fairness. Subjects felt that overpayment to themselves were more fair than overpayment to others; by contrast, they felt the underpayment to themselves were less fair than underpayment to others. Greenberg's studies showed that this egocentrism was eliminated when the subjects were put in a self-aware state, which was applied in his study with a mirror being placed in front of the subjects. When a person is not self-aware, they perceive that something can be fair to them but not necessarily fair to others. Therefore, fairness was something biased and subjective. When a person is self-aware, there is a uniform standard of fairness and there is no bias. When made self-aware, subjects rated overpayment and underpayment to both themselves and to others as equally unfair. It is believed that these results were obtained because self-awareness elevated subjects' concerns about perceived fairness in payment, thereby overriding egocentric tendencies.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1983" /&gt;

The egocentric bias can also be clearly observed in young children, especially those who have not yet developed [[theory of mind]], or the ability to understand concrete situations from the perspective of others. In one study by Wimmer and Perner, a child and a stuffed animal were presented with two differently colored boxes and both are shown that one contains an object of interest. The experimenter then removed the stuffed animal from the room and moved the object into the other box. When asked where the stuffed animal should search for the object, the children overwhelmingly tended to point to the box that they knew the object was in. Rather than thinking about the animal's perspective, the children displayed an egocentric bias in assuming that the animal would share their point of view, even though the animal had no way of knowing the same information as them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Heinz|last2=Perner|first2=Josef|date=1983-01-01|title=Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027783900045|journal=Cognition|volume=13|issue=1|pages=103–128|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes and motivations for egocentric bias were investigated in a 1983 journal entry by Brian Mullen of Murray State University. Inspired by the study by Ross et al. demonstrating the false consensus effect, Mullen's paper focused on the overestimation of consensus. Mullen analyzed the NBC television show "Play the Percentages" to determine whether egocentric bias was rooted in a perceptual  and unintentional distortion of reality versus a conscious, intentional motivation to appear normalized.  Subjects in this analysis were contestants from the show, 20–30 year old middle class married couple with equal gender distribution. At the start of each show, studio audiences were asked several trivia questions, and the percentage of correct answers was recorded for later use in the game. During each round of the game, opposing contestants estimated the percentage of correct answers. The contestant who had a closer estimate wins the percentage of correct answer as a score, and then if they answer said trivia question correctly, wins the remaining percentage for a maximum possible 100 points. The first couple to win 300 points received a cash prize, with the opportunity to win more prizes in bonus rounds. Thus, the show provided incentive for unbiased estimates of consensus. Statistical analysis of the collected data showed that the "egocentric bias of false consensus was observed in spite of the potent incentive for unbiased estimates of consensus." This analysis ultimately supports the hypothesis that egocentric bias is a result of unintentional perceptual distortion of reality rather than a conscious, intentional motivation to appear normalized.&lt;ref name="Mullen1983" /&gt;

From a psychological standpoint, memories appear to be stored in the brain in an egocentric manner: the role of oneself is magnified in one's experiences to make them more personally relevant and thereby easier to recall. Early childhood memories, therefore, may be more difficult to recall since one's sense of self is less developed, so old memories do not connect as strongly to oneself as newer ones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/12/science/a-bias-puts-self-at-center-of-everything.html|title=A bias puts self at center of everything|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|date=1984-06-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, egocentric bias may have evolved from [[hunter-gatherer]] times, in which communities were small and interdependent enough that individuals could assume that others around them had very similar outlooks. An egocentric view would have reduced [[cognitive load]] and increased communication efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Uwe|date=2015-12-01|title=Human thinking, shared intentionality, and egocentric biases|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-015-9512-0|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=299–312|doi=10.1007/s10539-015-9512-0|issn=0169-3867|pmc=4771814|pmid=27013769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of personal characteristics ==

=== Age ===
A 2016 study published by Riva, Triscoli, Lamm, Carnaghi, and Silani found that egocentric bias tends to be experienced in a much greater degree by adolescents and older adults than by young and middle aged adults. They examined the emotional effect of visuo-tactile stimulation on pairs of participants from a population of 114 female of varying ages. The varying degree of egocentric bias with age was attributed to the developmental cycle of the right [[supramarginal gyrus]] (rSMG) of the [[parietal lobe]], which finishes developing at the end of adolescence and decays early.&lt;ref name="NCBI"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Triscoli|first2=Chantal|last3=Lamm|first3=Claus|last4=Carnaghi|first4=Andrea|last5=Silani|first5=Giorgia|date=April 26, 2016|title=Emotional Egocentricity Bias Across the Life-Span|pmc=4844617|journal=Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=74|last1=Riva|first1=Frederica|doi=10.3389/fnagi.2016.00074|pmid=27199731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Billingualism ===
Recent studies of egocentric bias have been done in many different subgroups of people, such as [[bilingual]] people.  A study done by Paula Rubio-Fernández and [[Sam Glucksberg]] found that bilingual people are less prone to egocentric bias because they have grown to pay more attention to others' thoughts.  Thus, it is less difficult for them to differentiate between their own opinions and those of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubio-Fernández|first=Paula|last2=Glucksberg|first2=Sam|date=2012-01-01|title=Reasoning about other people's beliefs: Bilinguals have an advantage.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/38/1/211/|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|language=English|volume=38|issue=1|pages=211–217|doi=10.1037/a0025162|issn=1939-1285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==

=== False-consensus effect ===
{{Main|False-consensus effect}}
Considered to be a facet of egocentric bias, the false-consensus effect states that people believe their thoughts, actions, and opinions are much more common than they are in reality.&lt;ref name="Mullen1983" /&gt; When people are asked to make an estimate of a population's statistic, they often only have data from themselves and tend to assume that others in the population are similar to them due to egocentric bias. In turn, people tend to overestimate the extent to which their opinion is shared by the rest of the population. Moreover, people tend to believe that those who differ in opinion must be part of a minority and that the majority actually agrees with them. Therefore, the false-consensus effect, or the tendency to deduce judgements from own's own opinions, is a direct result of egocentric bias.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Joachim|year=1994|title=The Truly False Consensus Effect: An Ineradicable and Egocentric Bias in Social Perception|url=http://files.clps.brown.edu/jkrueger/journal_articles/krueger-1994-trulyfalse.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=4|pages=596–610|via=|pmid=7965607|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known example of false-consensus effect is a study published by Ross, Greene and House in 1977.&lt;ref name="Ross1977" /&gt; Students are asked to walk around a campus with a sandwich board that bearing the word "repent". People who agreed to do so (50%) estimated that most of their peers would also agree to do so (average estimation 63.5%). Conversely, those who refused to do the experiment reported that most of their peers would refuse as well.&lt;ref name="Wallin2011" /&gt;

People who exhibit the false consensus effect take egocentric bias a step further: they not only forgo thinking of other perspectives, but they believe that their viewpoints are those accepted by the majority of people.  Nevertheless, some psychologists do not distinguish between egocentric bias and the false consensus effect.  For example, in the paper published by Ross,  Greene, and House, the terms "false consensus" and "egocentric attribution bias" are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Ross1977" /&gt;  In the second part of their study, they gave out a questionnaire which asked participants which option (out of two choices) they would choose in specified situations, and what percentage of the population would choose which option.  In all four scenarios that were given, subjects rated the option that they chose as the most probable.  Ross, Greene, and House conclude that their results support the false consensus hypothesis, and that "intuitive estimates of deviance and normalcy, and the host of social inferences and interpersonal responses that accompany such estimates, are systematically and egocentrically biased in accord with his own behavioral choices."&lt;ref name="Ross1977" /&gt;

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
A related concept to egocentric bias is self-serving bias, in which one takes undue credit for achievements and blames failures on external forces. However, egocentric bias differs from self-serving bias in that egocentric bias is rooted in an erroneous assumption of other's perception of reality, while self-serving bias is an erroneous perception of one's own reality. For example, consider a student who earns a low grade in a class. Self-serving bias would result in the assumption that the student's low grade is a result of poor teaching, which would direct the fault of one's reality away from one's own actions.

Egocentric bias might also result in an overestimation of the number of students that received low grades in the class for the purpose to normalize these students' performance. However, similar to the false-consensus effect, the self-serving bias and the egocentric bias have also been used as interchangeable terms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0L7dwJKel8C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=egocentric%20bias%20vs%20self-serving%20bias|title=Handbook of Cross-cultural Psychology: Social behavior and applications|last=Berry|first=John W.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=John Berry|isbn=9780205160761|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both concepts may be the product of individualistic cultures that usually stress independence and personal achievement over group-oriented success. Cross-cultural studies have found a strong presence of the egocentric bias in the primarily individualistic American, South African, and Yugoslavian communities, but noted the opposite effect in the collectivistic [[Japan]]ese, [[Nepal]]i, and [[India]]n societies. People from these cultures tend to demonstrate a bias toward modesty, in which success is attributed to external or group-related factors and failures are seen as the result of personal shortcomings.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

[[Bayesian reasoning]] is a form of statistical inference that relies on [[Bayes' rule]] to make probability prediction based on given information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelmann|first1=Dirk|last2=Strobel|first2=Martin|title=The False Consensus Effect Disappears if Representative Information and Monetary Incentives Are Given|journal=Experimental Economics|date=2001|volume=3|pages=241–260|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.9974&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016|doi=10.1007/bf01669774}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bayesian updating, people use prior probabilities to make estimates, and then gradually change these probabilities as they gain more information.  [[Bayesian inference]] is often used by psychologists to determine whether subjects who exhibit the false-consensus effect have a rational thought process. To understand Bayes' rule, consider an example from an experiment by Kreuger and Clement: there is an urn with 100 chips, some blue and some red, and then subjects are told that the first chip drawn from the urn is blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krueger|first1=Joachim|last2=Russell W.|first2=Clement|title=The truly false consensus effect: An ineradicable and egocentric bias in social perception|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=October 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=596–610|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.596|pmid=7965607}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects are asked to estimate the probability that the urn contains predominantly blue chips. Using Bayes' rule, the probability that a blue chip is drawn given that the urn contains predominantly blue chips is equal to the probability of the urn being predominantly blue multiplied by the probability of the urn being predominantly blue given that a blue chip was drawn, all divided by the probability that the urn is predominantly blue.  Most participants overestimated the requested probability.  Data shows that subjects tend not to pay attention to sample size when making probability predictions.  For example, although it has statistically been proven by the law of large numbers that larger samples have less variability, people tend to claim that large and small samples have the same amount of variability.  Studies like the urn experiment above provide evidence that the false-consensus effect is not entirely rational, and that egocentric viewpoints tend to be predominant.

== Real-world implications ==

===Collaboration===
Egocentric bias can lead to the devaluation of peer contributions and the amplification of one's own work when in a collaborative setting. For example, when group members have been asked to report what percentage of the output they created, the total summed to greater than 100%. Usually, individuals are more easily able to recall their personal contributions and thus believe them to greater or more important. This applies to both positive and negative inputs: in a study of married couples, each spouse rated themselves as more responsible for helpful (cleaning) and detractive activities (causing arguments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egocentric Bias|last=Savitsky|first=Ken|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that feelings of sibling caregivers and their siblings depend on the contact between siblings and their feelings of closeness.&lt;ref name="Oxford Journals"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=Melvin J.|last2=Tierney|first2=Mary|last3=Somers|first3=Darryl G.|last4=Reid|first4=David|last5=Chiriboga|first5=David|title=Adult Children as Caregivers: Egocentric Biases in Judgments of Sibling Contributions|date=1991|pages=746–755|edition=31|url=http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/6/746.short|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these two groups believed that their siblings contributed less to the needs of their family than themselves, and were more resistant to increasing these types of contributions.  The closer that siblings were to each other, measured through observation and self reports, the smaller the extent of egocentric bias they felt in reporting each sibling's contribution.

===Mental health===
An overly exaggerated or extremely low demonstration of egocentric bias could be an indicator of mental illness. Those with anxiety tend to view themselves as the center of all events around them, regardless of their nature or how unrelated they are to oneself.  On the other hand, people suffering from depression may have a lower tendency towards egocentricity, as evidenced by the fact that they tend to more realistically rate their contributions to group work, while non-depressed participants often overreport their additions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Voting===
The egocentric bias has also been shown to contribute to a citizen's decision to vote in elections. Firstly, people tend to view their personal choice between voting and abstinence as a reflection of those who support the same candidates and issues. Secondly, although each individual vote has very little power in large-scale elections, those who vote overestimate the significance their ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acevedo|first=Melissa|last2=Krueger|first2=Joachim I.|date=2004-02-01|title=Two Egocentric Sources of the Decision to Vote: The Voter's Illusion and the Belief in Personal Relevance|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00359.x/abstract|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=115–134|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00359.x|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, citizens demonstrate egocentric bias, in conjunction with the false-consensus effect, in their predictions of election outcomes. A study examining the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 American presidential election]] found that the more strongly people favor a certain candidate, the higher they estimate that candidate's likelihood of winning the election. For instance, those who strongly preferred Barack Obama predicted that he had a 65% chance of becoming the president, while those who preferred another candidate approximated that he only had a 40% chance of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/02/in-politics-were-convinced-that-our-candidate-is-a-shoo-in/|title=Never mind the polls—we're convinced our candidate is going to win|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], it can be shown that every [[function (mathematics)|function]] can be written as the composite of a [[surjective]] function followed by an [[injective]] function. '''Factorization systems''' are a generalization of this situation in [[category theory]].

==Definition==

A '''factorization system''' (''E'', ''M'') for a [[category (category theory)|category]] '''C''' consists of two classes of [[morphisms]] ''E'' and ''M'' of '''C''' such that:
#''E'' and ''M'' both contain all [[isomorphisms]] of '''C''' and are closed under composition.
#Every morphism ''f'' of '''C''' can be factored as &lt;math&gt;f=m\circ e&lt;/math&gt; for some morphisms &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;.
#The factorization is ''functorial'': if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are two morphisms such that &lt;math&gt;vme=m'e'u&lt;/math&gt; for some morphisms &lt;math&gt;e, e'\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m, m'\in M&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; making the following diagram commute:
[[Image:Factorization_system_functoriality.png|center]]


''Remark:'' &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism from &lt;math&gt;me&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m'e'&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Comma_category#Arrow_category|arrow category]].

== Orthogonality ==

Two morphisms &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''orthogonal'', denoted &lt;math&gt;e\downarrow m&lt;/math&gt;, if for every pair of morphisms &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ve=mu&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; such that the diagram

[[Image:Factorization_system_orthogonality.png|center]]

commutes. This notion can be extended to define the orthogonals of sets of morphisms by

:&lt;math&gt;H^\uparrow=\{e\quad|\quad\forall h\in H, e\downarrow h\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H^\downarrow=\{m\quad|\quad\forall h\in H, h\downarrow m\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since in a factorization system &lt;math&gt;E\cap M&lt;/math&gt; contains all the isomorphisms, the condition (3) of the definition is equivalent to
:(3') &lt;math&gt;E\subset M^\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\subset E^\downarrow.&lt;/math&gt;


''Proof:'' In the previous diagram (3), take &lt;math&gt; m:= id ,\  e' := id &lt;/math&gt; (identity on the appropriate object) and &lt;math&gt; m' := m &lt;/math&gt;.

== Equivalent definition ==
The pair &lt;math&gt;(E,M)&lt;/math&gt; of classes of morphisms of '''C''' is a factorization system if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:

#Every morphism ''f'' of '''C''' can be factored as &lt;math&gt;f=m\circ e&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M.&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;E=M^\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M=E^\downarrow.&lt;/math&gt;

== Weak factorization systems ==
Suppose ''e'' and ''m'' are two morphisms in a category '''C'''. Then ''e'' has the ''[[right lifting property|left lifting property]]'' with respect to ''m'' (resp. ''m'' has the ''[[right lifting property]]'' with respect to ''e'') when for every pair of morphisms ''u'' and ''v'' such that ''ve''=''mu'' there is a morphism ''w'' such that the following diagram commutes. The difference with orthogonality is that ''w'' is not necessarily unique.

[[Image:Factorization_system_orthogonality.png|center]]

A '''weak factorization system''' (''E'', ''M'') for a category '''C''' consists of two classes of morphisms ''E'' and ''M'' of '''C''' such that :
#The class ''E'' is exactly the class of morphisms having the left lifting property wrt the morphisms of ''M''.
#The class ''M'' is exactly the class of morphisms having the right lifting property wrt the morphisms of ''E''.
#Every morphism ''f'' of '''C''' can be factored as &lt;math&gt;f=m\circ e&lt;/math&gt; for some morphisms &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2850">In [[mathematics]], the term '''fiber''' (or '''fibre''' in [[British English]]) can have two meanings, depending on the context:

# In [[naive set theory]], the '''fiber''' of the [[Element (mathematics)|element]] ''y'' in the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Y'' under a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is the [[inverse image]] of the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] &lt;math&gt;\{y\}&lt;/math&gt; under ''f''.
# In [[algebraic geometry]], the notion of a fiber of a [[morphism]] of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] must be defined more carefully because, in general, not every point is closed.

== Definitions ==

===Fiber in naive set theory===
Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} be a [[Map (mathematics)|map]]. The '''fiber''' of an element &lt;math&gt;y \in Y,&lt;/math&gt; commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y),&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math display="block"&gt;f^{-1}(y) := \{x \in X \mid f(x) = y\}.&lt;/math&gt; That is, the fiber of ''y'' under ''f'' is the set of elements in the domain of ''f'' that are mapped to ''y''.

The [[inverse image]] or preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the concept of the fiber to subsets &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; of the codomain. The notation &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is still used to refer to the fiber, as the fiber of an element ''y'' is the preimage of the singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{y\}&lt;/math&gt;, as in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{y\})&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the fiber can be treated as a function from the codomain to the [[powerset]] of the domain: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} : Y \to \mathcal{P}(X),&lt;/math&gt; while the preimage generalizes this to a function between powersets: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} : \mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' maps into the real numbers, so &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is simply a number, then the fiber &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is also called the '''[[level set]]''' of ''y'' under ''f'': &lt;math&gt;L_y(f).&lt;/math&gt; If ''f'' is a [[continuous function]] and ''y'' is in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f'', then the level set of ''y'' under ''f'' is a curve in [[Two-dimensional space|2D]], a surface in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]], and, more generally, a [[hypersurface]] of [[dimension]] {{nowrap|''d'' − 1.}}

===Fiber in algebraic geometry===
In [[algebraic geometry]], if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is a morphism of schemes, the '''fiber''' of a point ''p'' in ''Y'' is the [[fiber product of schemes]] 
:&lt;math&gt;X\times_Y \operatorname{Spec} k(p)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''k''(''p'') is the [[residue field]] at ''p''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="934">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''first-order predicate''' is a [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] that takes only individual(s) constants or variables as argument(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Dictionary of Philosophy: Revised Second Edition|first=Antony|last=Flew|publisher=Macmillan|year=1984|isbn=9780312209230|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Compare [[second-order predicate]] and [[higher-order predicate]].

This is not to be confused with a '''one-place predicate''' or monad, which is a predicate that takes only one argument. For example the expression "is a planet" is a one-place predicate, while the expression "is father of" is a '''two-place predicate'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">At [[common law]], the '''fleeing felon rule''' permits the [[use of force]], including [[deadly force]], against an individual who is suspected of a [[felony]] and is in clear flight.  According to David Caplan "Immediate stopping of the fleeing felon, whether actually or presumably dangerous, was deemed absolutely necessary for the security of the people in a free state, and for maintaining the "public security." ... "  Indeed, it has been said that the social policy of the common law in this matter was not only to threaten dangerous felons and hence deter them, but was also to induce them to "surrender peaceably" if they dared commit inherently dangerous felonies, rather than allow them to "escape trial for their crimes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even Deadly Force |url=https://saf.org/journal/12/CAPLAN.htm| accessdate=2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. law==
Under [[U.S. law]] the fleeing felon rule was limited in 1985 to non-lethal force in most cases by ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]],'' {{ussc|471|1}}. The justices held that deadly force "may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others."&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">'''Guy Coburn Robson''' (1888 - 1945) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[zoologist]], specializing in [[Mollusca]], who first named and described ''[[Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni]]'', the colossal squid.

Robson studied at the marine biological station in [[Naples]], and joined the staff of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in 1911, becoming Deputy Keeper of the Zoology Department from 1931 to 1936.

==Evolution==

Robson is best known for his major book ''The Variations of Animals in Nature'' (co-authored with [[Owain Richards|O. W. Richards]], 1936) which argued that although the fact of [[evolution]] is well established, the mechanisms are largely hypothetical and undemonstrated.&lt;ref name="Allee"&gt;Allee, W. C. (1937). [https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/217506 ''The Variation of Animals in Nature: A Critical Summary and Judgment of Evolutionary Theories by G. C. Robson, O. W. Richards'']. ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' 42 (4): 596-597.&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims that most differences among animal populations and related species are non-adaptive. It was published before major developments in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] and contains critical evaluation of [[natural selection]]. It was positively reviewed in science journals in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Allee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. S. C. (1936). [https://www.nature.com/articles/137680a0 ''The Variation of Animals in Nature'']. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 137: 680–681.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoologist [[Mark Ridley (zoologist)|Mark Ridley]] has noted that "Robson and Richards suggested that the differences between species are non-adaptive and have nothing to do with natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Mark. (1993). ''Evolution''. Blackwell Scientific. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-86542-495-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Will Provine]] has commented that the book "has been in disrepute since the late 1940s because of its antagonism to natural selection" but notes that it was the "best known general work on animal taxonomy" before the work of [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Ernst Mayr]].&lt;ref&gt;Provine, William B. (1986). ''Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology''. Harvard University Press. p. 293. {{ISBN|0-226-68473-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley in ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]'' (1942), described the book as "an undue belittling of the role of selection in evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian. (1948 edition). [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.218848/2015.218848.Evolution-The#page/n37/mode/2up ''Evolution: The Modern Synthesis'']. George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideological criticism''' is a method in [[rhetorical criticism]] concerned with critiquing texts for the dominant ideology they express while silencing opposing or contrary [[ideologies]]. It was started by a group of scholars roughly in the late-1970s through the mid-1980s at universities in the United States. Leading scholars of ideological criticism were Michael Calvin McGee at the University of Iowa and Phillip Wander at San Jose State University. Wander's 1983 article, "The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=March 1983|title=The ideological turn in modern criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978309368110?journalCode=rcst19|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/10510978309368110|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1984 article, "The Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=December 1984|title=The third persona: An ideological turn in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978409368190|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/10510978409368190|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the most important articles in the field. According to Sonja Foss, “the primary goal of the ideological critic is to discover and make visible the dominant ideology or ideologies embedded in an artifact and the ideologies that are being muted in it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice (3rd ed.)|last=Foss|first=|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss has also mentioned the contribution to ideological criticism of several theoretical schools, including [[Marxism]], [[structuralism]], [[cultural studies]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Ideograph==
A unit of analysis in ideological criticism, or what Foss calls "traces of ideology in an artifact," is the [[ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].  It is a symbol representing an ideological concept and is more than what the symbol itself depicts.  Michael McGee, a renowned ideological critic, postulated that an “ideograph is an ordinary term found in political discourse” that “is a high-order abstraction representing collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=462–463}}  Thus, McGee restricted ideographs to [[words]], words that “constitute a vocabulary of public motives, which authorize and warrant public actions”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|p=479}}  McGee encourages the study of ideographs (such as “[[liberty]]” and “[[Political freedom|freedom]]”) to help identify the ideological position of a [[society]].  He argues such terms are used in [[discourse]] as a means of justifying problematic issues within a society.  The meaning of an ideograph is defined by a society and its [[culture]] and can change over time.  Ideographs need not be only positive in nature, but can be negative as well.  For example, [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[slavery]], can “guide behavior and belief negatively by branding unacceptable behavior."  McGee notes that to fully understand ideographs, they must be examined both “[[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]” as well as “[[Synchronic analysis|synchronically]].”  That is, ideographs need to be examined across time to determine how their meanings may have changed and all ideographs that are used in a given situation must be considered.

Who in [[democracy]] would be opposed to actions taken under the auspices of liberty and freedom?  To do so would, ideographically speaking, be undemocratic. Citizens of a democratic state are “conditioned” to believe that liberty and freedom are so fundamentally important that society expects those citizens to simply unquestioningly accept actions claiming to be in defense of liberty and freedom.  For example, even within the United States, the ideograph of freedom has changed.  At the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), freedom meant breaking away from the tyrannical rule of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  Today, freedom means many things including the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the freedom to be left alone.  People disagree about the freedoms that are most important: freedom to possess guns, freedom to make decisions that affect one's body, freedom from fear or violence, and freedom of movement.  Depending on one's ideological orientation, the ideograph of freedom represents many things, which is why it can be so powerfully used by politicians.  Ideographs succeed in political discourse because of their inability to be concretely understood.  

Ideographs need not be [[Linguistics|verbal]] only; they can be [[Visual communication|visual]] too.  In 1997, Janis Edwards and Carol Winkler expanded the idea of the ideograph to include visual images as well as written words.{{Sfn|Edwards and Winkler 1997|pp=289–310}}  They argue images can act as “a Visual reference point that forms the basis of arguments about a variety of themes and subjects” that are used by both “[[elite]]s and non-elites” alike.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=487–508}}  Like McGee’s textual ideographs, visual ideographs depict common values and goals in a given culture, recur in different contexts over time, and are used to validate arguments and [[Social practice theory|social practice]]s.  Edwards and Winkler mention images of people can act as ideographs too.  “In their construct, a person (character) is abstracted and elevated to the status of a cultural figure, and becomes a surface for the articulation of the political character, employing cultural ideals”.  Foss identifies the following steps in a piece of ideological criticism: 1) “formulate a [[research question]] and select an [[Social artifact|artifact]]”; 2) “select a [[unit of analysis]]” (which she calls “traces of ideology in an artifact”); 3) “analyze the artifact” (which, according to Foss, involves identifying the ideology in the artifact, analyzing the interests the ideology serves, and uncovering the strategies used in the artifact to promote the ideology); and 4) “write the critical essay”.

'''''Ignorantia juris non excusat'''''&lt;ref name=BLD672&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 5th Edition, pg. 672&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''ignorantia legis neminem excusat'''''&lt;ref name=BLD673&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 5th Edition, pg. 673&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] for "[[ignorance]] of the [[law]] excuses not"&lt;ref name=BLD672/&gt; and "ignorance of law excuses no one"&lt;ref name=BLD673/&gt; respectively)  is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape [[legal liability|liability]] for violating that law merely because one was unaware of its content. 

European-law countries with a tradition of Roman law may also use an expression from [[Aristotle]] translated into Latin: '''''nemo censetur ignorare legem''''' (nobody is thought to be ignorant of the law) or '''''ignorantia iuris nocet''''' (not knowing the law is harmful).

==Explanation==
{{see also|Promulgation|Promulgation (canon law)}}
The rationale of the doctrine is that if ignorance were an excuse, a person charged with [[criminal offense]]s or a subject of a civil [[lawsuit]] would merely claim that one was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even if that person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law [[imputation (law)|imputes]] knowledge of all laws to all persons within the [[jurisdiction]] no matter how transiently. Even though it would be impossible, even for someone with substantial legal training, to be aware of every law in operation in every aspect of a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state's]] activities, this is the price paid to ensure that [[willful blindness]] cannot become the basis of [[exculpatory|exculpation]]. Thus, it is well settled that persons engaged in any undertakings outside what is common for a normal person, such as running a [[nuclear power plant]], will make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. If they do not, they cannot complain if they incur liability.

The doctrine assumes that the law in question has been properly promulgated—published and distributed, for example, by being printed in a [[government gazette]], made available over the [[internet]], or printed in volumes available for sale to the public at affordable prices. In the ancient phrase of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], ''Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur'' ("[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Laws]] are instituted when they are promulgated").&lt;ref&gt;[[Gratian]], [[Decretum Gratiani|''Decretum'']], Distinctio 4, dictum post c.3&lt;/ref&gt; In order that a law obtain the binding force which is proper to a law, it must be applied to the men who have to be ruled by it. Such application is made by their being given notice by promulgation. A law can bind only when it is reasonably possible for those to whom it applies to acquire knowledge of it in order to observe it, even if actual knowledge of the law is absent for a particular individual. A secret law is no law at all.

In [[criminal law]], although ignorance may not clear a defendant of [[guilt (law)|guilt]], it can be a consideration in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]], particularly where the law is unclear or the defendant sought advice from law enforcement or regulatory officials. For example, in one [[Canada|Canadian]] case, a person was charged with being in possession of [[gambling]] devices after they had been advised by [[customs]] officials that it was legal to import such devices into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;R v Potter (1978), 39 CCC (2d) 538, 3 CR (3d) 154 (PEISC).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the defendant was convicted, the sentence was an [[absolute discharge]].

In addition, there were, particularly in the days before [[satellite]] communication and [[cellular phones]], persons who could genuinely be ignorant of the law due to distance or isolation. For example, in a case in [[British Columbia]], a pair of hunters were [[acquitted]] of game offenses where the law was changed during the period they were in the wilderness hunting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In reaching this decision, the court refused to follow an early [[English law]] case in which a seaman on a [[clipper]] before the [[invention of radio]] was convicted even though the law had been changed while he was at sea (Bailey (1800) Russ &amp; Ry 1).

== In literature == 
The doctrine,"Ignorance of the law is no excuse," first shows up in the Bible in Leviticus 5:17: "If a person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD's commands, even though he does not know it, he is guilty and will be held responsible."  An alternate explanation of the origin of the maxim, though not particularly relevant to the modern context, can be found in the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans. Such were cultures heavily influenced by customary legal systems. Within such a system, law is learned as a person participates in the culture and customs of the community. Thus it is unreasonable to believe a person could have avoided learning them. These rules and customs were also interwoven with ethical and religious dialogue so that laws expressed what is right and that which is not.  We find that [[Cicero]] wrote the following in ''[[De re publica]]'' (On the Republic):

"There is a true law, right reason, agreeable to nature, known to all men, constant and eternal, which calls to duty by its precepts, deters from evil by its prohibition.  This law cannot be departed from without guilt.  Nor is there one law at Rome and another at Athens, one thing now and another afterward; but the same law, unchanging and eternal, binds all races of man and all times."

[[Minos (dialogue)|Minos]] (attributed to [[Plato]]) states the following conversation between [[Socrates]] and his companion:

;Socrates
:Come then, do you consider just things to be unjust and unjust things just, or just things to be just and unjust things unjust?

;Companion
:I consider just things to be just, and unjust things unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMinos%3Asection%3D315e Plat. Minos 315e]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Socrates
:And are they so considered among all men elsewhere as they are here?

;Companion
:Yes.
.
.
.
;Socrates
:Are things that weigh more considered heavier here, and things that weigh less lighter, or the contrary?

;Companion
:No, those that weigh more are considered heavier, and those that weigh less lighter.

;Socrates
:And is it so in Carthage also, and in Lycaea?

;Companion
:Yes.

;Socrates
:Noble things, it would seem, are everywhere considered noble&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMinos%3Asection%3D316a Plat. Minos 316a]&lt;/ref&gt;, and base things base; not base things noble or noble things base.

;Companion
:That is so.

==Translation==
'''Presumed knowledge of the law''' is the principle in [[jurisprudence]] that one is bound by a law even if one does not know of it. It has also been defined as the "prohibition of ignorance of the law".

The concept comes from [[Roman law]], and is expressed in the [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] ''ignorantia legis non excusat''.

The essential public character of a law requires that the law, once properly promulgated, must apply to anyone in the [[jurisdiction]] where the law applies. Thus, no one can justify his conduct on the grounds that he was not aware of the law.

Generally, a convention exists by which the laws are issued and rendered accessible by methods, authors and means that are simple and well known: the law is readable in certain places (some systems prescribe that a collection of the laws is copied in every local city council), is made by certain authorities (usually sovereign, government, parliament, and derivative bodies), and enters into effect in certain ways (many systems for instance prescribe a certain number of days - often 15 - after issue). This is commonly intended as a [[constitutional law|constitutional]] regulation, and in fact many [[constitution]]s or [[statute]]s exactly describe the correct procedures.

However, some recent interpretations weaken this concept.  Particularly in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], regard can be had to the difficulty of being informed of the existence of a law considering the lifestyle of the average citizen. On the penal side, the quality of the knowledge of the law can affect the evaluation of the [[animus nocendi]] or the [[mens rea]], in that certain subjective conditions can weaken personal responsibility.

The theme was widely discussed, also for political reasons, at the time of [[the Enlightenment]] and in the 18th century, given the heavy proportion of illiterate citizens in European countries (who would have some difficulties being aware of all the laws in a country). It was then argued that both the presumed knowledge and the heavily increasing corpus of national legislation were working in favour of lawyers rather than citizens.

In recent times, some authors have considered this concept as an extension of (or at least as analogous to) the other ancient concept (typical of [[criminal law]]) that no one can be punished under a law that was issued after the action was committed (non-retroactivity of the law. See [[ex post facto]]). This interpretation is however disputed, given that the matter would hierarchically more properly refer to a constitutional doctrine rather than to a civil or penal one.

Some modern criminal statutes contain language such as stipulating that the act must be done "knowingly and wittingly" or "with unlawful intent," or some similar language. However, this does not refer to ignorance of laws, but having [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]].

==Statutory law==
This principle is also stated in [[statute]]s:

*Brazil: Decree 2848 as changed by law 7209.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm Decree 2848 (compiled)], part of [[Brazilian Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canada: [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], section 19&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-7.html#docCont Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-34, s 19].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philippines: [[Civil Code of the Philippines|Republic Act No. 386 "Civil Code of the Philippines"]], Article 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/06/18/republic-act-no-386/|title=Republic Act No. 386 {{!}} GOVPH|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==

In some jurisdictions, there are exceptions to the general rule that ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. For example, under U.S. Federal criminal tax law, the element of ''willfulness'' required by the provisions of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] has been ruled by the courts to correspond to a "voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty" under which an "actual good faith belief based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law" is a valid legal defense.

United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Strauss, "Nonpayment of Taxes: When Ignorance of the Law Is an Excuse," 25 ''Akron Law Review'' 611 (Winter/Spring 1992), at [https://uakron.edu/dotAsset/4ea43a5b-7873-49cb-afc4-c37f776fd6f2.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark C.

:''In politics, the term "incrementalism" is also used as a synonym for [[Gradualism#Politics and society|Gradualism]].''
'''Incrementalism''' is a method of working by adding to a project using many small [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] changes instead of a few (extensively planned) large jumps. [[Logic]]al incrementalism implies that the steps in the process are sensible.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, J.B., 1978. Strategic change: logical incrementalism. Sloan Management Review 20 (1), 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Logical incrementalism focuses on "the Power-Behavioral Approach to planning rather than to the Formal Systems Planning Approach".&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, J. B. (1978). Strategic Change: "Logical Incrementalism." Sloan Management Review, 20 (1), p7.&lt;/ref&gt; In public policy, incrementalism is the method of change by which many small policy changes are enacted over time in order to create a larger broad based policy change. This was the theoretical policy of rationality developed by [[Charles E. Lindblom|Lindblom]] to be seen as a middle way between the [[rational actor model]] and [[bounded rationality]], as both long term goal driven policy rationality and [[satisficing]] were not seen as adequate.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Origin ==
Most people use incrementalism without ever needing a name for it because it is the natural and intuitive way to tackle everyday problems, such as making [[coffee]] or getting dressed. These actions normally don't require extensive planning and problems can be dealt with one at a time as they arise.

Even in processes that involve more extensive planning, incrementalism is often an important tactic for dealing reactively with small details. For example, one might plan a route for a driving trip on a map, but one would not typically plan in advance where to change lanes or how long to stop at each streetlight.

The political scientist Charles E. Lindblom developed Incrementalism in the mid 1950s. “The Science of Muddling Through” (1959), was an essay Lindblom wrote to help policymakers understand why they needed to consider a different approach when making policy changes. The goal for the new perspective of Incrementalism was for policy makers to avoid making changes before they really engaged and rationally thought through the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Incrementalism. (n.d.). Retrieved November 20, 2015, from http://reachandywilliams.weebly.com/incrementalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrasts to other planning methodologies ==
In large projects following some type of [[strategic planning]], there is normally a need to allocate time to plan the project in order to avoid "fire fighting", in other words the avoidance of time delaying issues. In contrast to other systems of planning such as [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down, bottom up]], and so on, incrementalism involves concentrating on dealing with the immediate problems as they arrive and avoiding trying to create an overall strategic plan. This means muddling through the issues at hand based on importance.

[[Strategy implementation|Strategic implementation]] is a very well thought out plan of implementation that is the opposite to incrementalism. Although the plan involved with the strategic implementation might work incrementally it has set objectives at set times with little to no intention of muddling through the process. In other words, every part of the implementation would be expected and planned for ahead of time.

The [[antithesis]] of incrementalism is that work must be accomplished in one single push rather than through a process of [[continuous improvement]]. All work must be planned, only presented when complete and work in progress must be hidden. 

In [[political science]], research on incrementalism has largely been incorporated into the study of [[Punctuated equilibrium in social theory]], which views policy change as periods of incremental improvement punctuated by major policy shifts.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of incrementalism over other formal systems is that no time is wasted planning for outcomes which may not occur.
* Politically expedient: Since it does not involve any radical and complete changes, it is easily accepted and therefore the process is expedient.
* Simplicity: it is very simple to understand. Compared to some of the other budgeting methods used in business, it is one of the easiest to put in practice one does not have to be an accountant or have much experience in business to use this form of budgeting.
* Gradual change: a very stable budget exists from one period to the next and allows for gradual change within the company. Many managers are intimidated by large budget increases from one period to the next. This type of budget will not cause that problem because it is based on the previous period's budget.
* Flexibility: it is very flexible. Doing it from one month to the next allows one to see change very quickly when a new policy or budget is implemented.
* Avoiding conflict: companies with many different departments often run into conflict between departments because of their different budgets. With this method of budgeting, it is easier to keep everyone on the same page and avoid conflicts between departments&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S., &amp; Harbridge, L. (June 2010). Incrementalism in Appropriations: Small Aggregation, Big Changes. Retrieved October 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Disadvantages are that time may be wasted dealing with the immediate problems and no overall strategy is developed. Incrementalism in the study of rationality can be seen as a stealthy way to bring about radical changes that were not initially intended, a [[slippery slope]].
* Beagle Fallacy: A beagle hound has a very good sense of smell but limited eyesight, and thus could miss prey that appears in front of but downwind. Likewise, by only focusing on incremental changes to policies and policy applications, organisations are in danger of missing the broader directions in fulfilling their mandate. Beagle fallacy is the primary criticism of incrementalism.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dg-7OFEp3E8C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=beagle+fallacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0agOe_TBRo&amp;sig=tOA8AhV5wq9xZt6DEDn1iL_Ho_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR1LDyjv3VAhXEMo8KHUB1DewQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=beagle%20fallacy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
* Failure to account for change: it is based on the idea that expenses will run much as they did before. However, in business, that is rarely the case, and there are always variables.
* Absence of incentives: such a simple method of budgeting really does not provide employees with much reason to be creative. They have no incentive to innovate and come up with new ideas or policies since everything is limited.
* "Use it or lose it" perspective: Many employees view this as a "use it or lose it" system and know that next year's budget is going to be incrementally based on this year's. Therefore, if they do not spend everything that is allocated to them, they may not have enough money to work with next year. That creates an environment where waste is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Vladeck, B. (2001, February 1). Medicare and the Politics of Incrementalism. Retrieved October 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Incrementalism is commonly employed in [[politics]], [[engineering]], [[software design]], [[planning]] and [[industry]]. Whereas it is often criticized as "fire fighting", the progressive improvement of product designs characteristic, e.g., of [[Japan]]ese engineering can create steadily improving product performance, which in certain circumstances outperforms more orthodox planning systems.

Another example would be in small changes that make way for a bigger overall change to get past unnoticed. A series of small steps toward an agenda would be less likely to be questioned than a large and swift change. An example could be the rise of gas prices, the company would only raise the price by a few cents every day, instead of a large change to a target price overnight.  More people would notice and dispute a dramatic, 100% increase overnight, while a 100% increase over a span of a week would less likely be even noticed, let alone argued.  This can be applied in many different ways, such as, economics, politics, a person's appearance, or laws.

=== Examples ===
In the 1970s, many countries decided to invest in [[wind energy]]. [[Denmark]], a small country of around 5 million people, became a world leader in this technology using an incremental approach.&lt;ref&gt;F. Borum and PH Kristiansen (Copenhagen, 1989); "Industrial Innovation and Incremental Learning: The Case of Danish Wind Technology from 1975 to 1988&lt;/ref&gt; While more formal design processes in the [[United States|US]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] failed to develop competitive machines. The reason for the difference of approach was that the Danish wind industry developed from an agricultural base whilst the American and UK wind industries were based on [[hi-tech]] [[aerospace]] companies with significant [[university]] involvement.&lt;ref name="Bricolage" /&gt; While the Danes built better and better windmills using an incremental approach, those using formal planning techniques believed that they could easily design a superior windmill straight away.

In practice, however, windmill design is not very complicated and the biggest problem is the tradeoff between cost and reliability. Although the UK and the U.S.A. designs were technically superior, the lack of experience in the field meant that their machines were less reliable in the field. In contrast, the heavy agricultural windmills produced by the Danes just kept turning, and by 2000 the top three windmill manufacturers in the world were Danish.&lt;ref name="Bricolage" /&gt;

The [[Central Arizona Project]] and the [[Salt River Project]] display the use of [[Innovation]] and incrementalism.  There was a Plan 6 cost-sharing program that was a component in both of these projects and displayed innovations of the external enforcers and internal entrepreneurs and how they muddled through as well as collaborated incrementally to work on these projects with many different players in the mix.&lt;ref&gt;Micale, L. M. (1990). Policy change as innovation and incrementalism: The case of plan 6 cost-sharing.  http://search.proquest.com/docview/303793098&lt;/ref&gt;

The resource allocation in local authorities is riddled by politics and provides the underlying methods of incrementalism in the negotiations process of putting local authorities priorities together.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. P. (1986). Incrementalism and the politics of resource allocation in local authorities. http://search.proquest.com/docview/1477359910&lt;/ref&gt; Looking the United States Federal Budget is a back and forth negotiation between politicians and provides great insight of incremental change.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, R. E. (2014). An examination of the effects of incrementalism and annuality in U.S. government budgeting practices. http://search.proquest.com/docview/1528557751&lt;/ref&gt; Every year a new budget must be formed to allocate funds to the agencies such as the DoD and government programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The amounts with which are decided gradually change based on the importance as well as efficiencies and inefficiencies of agencies or priorities.

In the case of climate change the opinions changed gradually over the years as more and more scientific evidence became clear to policy makers that it should be a prevalent policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;Knaggård, Å. (2014). What do policy-makers do with scientific uncertainty? The incremental character of Swedish climate change policy-making. Policy Studies, 35(1), 22-39. doi:10.1080/01442872.2013.804175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political economy of climate change]] and [[Politics of global warming]] are worth noting on the international scale of climate change policy and how there has been an incremental leaning towards the belief and action against climate change over the years.

== Related concepts ==
Incrementalism is a planning methodology normally found where a large strategic plan is either unnecessary or has failed to develop and for that reason it is often just called "muddling through".&lt;ref&gt;[[Overseas Development Institute]] Research and Policy in Development Group; [http://www.odi.org.uk/RAPID/Tools/Theory/Theories_muddlethrough.html Fundamental decisions vs disjointed incrementalism ('muddling through')]&lt;/ref&gt; Incrementalism is the antithesis of intrusive central planning, which can create rigid work systems unable to deal with the actual problems faced at the grassroots level.&lt;ref name="Bricolage"&gt;Raghu Garuda &amp; Peter Karnøe; "Bricolage versus breakthrough: distributed and embedded agency in technology entrepreneurship", Research Policy 32 (2003) 277–300&lt;/ref&gt; However, without a central planning framework incremental working is difficult to support within structured systems and therefore requires a degree of self-reliance, skills and experience of those dealing with the problems such as is found in [[autonomous work group]]s. &lt;!-- no Wikipedia entry? --&gt;

[[Image:Refill-Ink-Kit-Black.jpg|thumb|200px|Black - Inkjet refill kit.]]
An '''inkjet refill kit''' is a set of tools and a certain amount of ink used to refill [[ink cartridge]]s.  The specific tools and the amount or type of ink depends on which cartridge the kit is designed for.  The purpose of an inkjet refill kit for consumers is that it offers a low-cost alternative to buying new cartridges.

==Contents==
Typically, a refill kit comes with a cartridge holder, bottles of ink and needles.  The exact tools that come with the kit can vary by manufacturer or by which cartridge the kit is for.  Some tools are found in all kits because they are necessary to refill, but others, like the cartridge holder or a needle to withdraw air from the cartridge, are optional.

The most common refill kits come with either:  bottles of black ink for black refill kits; or one bottle each of [[cyan]], [[magenta]] and yellow for color refill kits; or one bottle each of photo cyan, photo magenta and photo black for photo-color refill kits; or combination of all colors for combo refill kits.

==Refilling process==
{{howto|section|date=December 2011}}
The refill process typically involves the following steps:

* ''Injecting ink'': Depending on the type of cartridge being refilled, ink can either be injected through a hole on top of the cartridge, or directly into the ink chambers after the top has been popped off.  The ink can be injected directly from a bottle (with a needle tip on it) or from a needle filled with ink.  The ink must be slowly injected into the cartridge so as not to cause damage, or overfilling, or overflow to other-color ink reservoirs. (For colors, a label on the cartridge might have three ordered color-dots to indicate the corresponding three ink colors of the reservoir chambers.

: Some refill kits include a final step where a small amount of air is removed from the cartridge in order to restore the ink-fluid balance that was present inside the cartridge before the refilling.

* ''Installing and running'': Once the cartridge is filled, the top is placed back on (if necessary) and the cartridge can be reinstalled in the printer.  Extra ink flowing from the cartridge print-head can be wiped or blotted (for a few minutes).  On some cartridges, the ink has a problem getting to the bottom of the cartridge (especially the colored cartridges), it must be forced to the bottom either by suction through the jet plate or by putting pressure from the top with a syringe to purge the ink through the jet plate very gently.  It might be necessary to run the printer cleaning utilities on the refilled cartridge, in case any excess ink is left over from the refilling process.  A note to the unfamiliar: the capacity of the cartridge of some brands is much much more than the cartridge comes with when new (especially the colored ones), there may be room for 2 or 3 times the ink sold in some "kits" (this can be learned by doing an autopsy on a non-functioning cartridge, also why the ink does not reach the bottom in the case of some colored inks).  In those cases, the needle must be able to reach to within 0.375" from the bottom or closer to be sure that the ink can reach the jets and not just saturate the sponge.  The sponge can in some cases take two or more charges of ink and still not reach the bottom (jets).
* ''Print-head cleaning'':  Sometimes the ink flow might be blocked by dried ink on the ink cartridge print-head.  For color cartridges, typically one ink-color fails to flow due to dried ink.  The dried ink can be cleaned using [[isopropyl alcohol]] (50% or higher) on a swab or folded paper towel rubbed gently three or four times across the print-head.  Another method is to let the cartridge sit overnight in a shallow cup or glass of very warm clean water (not necessarily distilled water).  The water depth required is about .25 or .375";  remove and re-clean as above and try to use.

==Anti-refilling protections used by printer manufacturers==

[[Image:Wiki vb ngeresetEpson.gif|thumb|Resetting an Epson ink cartridge using a resetter tool]]

Many printer manufactures provide their cartridges with chips and/or sensors to prevent refilling. These chips can also serve as a "copy protection," so that the printer does not work with cartridges made by other manufacturers. In such cases, the refilling process must include the bypassing of those anti-refilling protections. (Refill instructions, chip resetters or autoreset chips [the latter are reset each time the printer is switched on] for different cartridge models, and other tools are available on the Internet.)

'''Time-coding of ink cartridges'''

To make more money, some manufacturers provide their ink cartridges with a time chip, so that after a certain period of time or after a certain number of printed pages the ink cartridges no longer work and/or a message appears that they are empty even if they are still almost full. So the user cannot buy several ink cartridges to store them for a longer time, but must regularly buy new ones.

'''Region-coding of printers and ink cartridges'''

For price discrimination, some printer manufacturers (e.g. Canon, Epson, HP, Lexmark, Xerox) give their printers and ink cartridges region codes - similar to DVD region codes -, so that the users can only use printers and ink cartridges from their region and cannot import cheaper ones from another region. The region can be changed several times; then, the printer is "region-locked" like an RPC-2 DVD drive and accepts only cartridges from one certain region. Sometimes the region change must be done by the manufacturer's customer service and cannot be done by the user.
&lt;br /&gt;
Xerox printers are shipped with neutral "factory" ink sticks with no region coding. Upon the installation of the first new ink stick after these factory sticks, the machine will set a region code based on the installed ink stick and will only accept ink sticks for that region from that point forward. "Officially, " only three starter ink sticks per color can be used; then, the printer will no longer accept them and will want region-coded ink sticks to be inserted, but there are workarounds for that problem.

When moving to a new region, it seems a good idea to store empty cartridges from the old region (or to re-use the region-free Xerox factory ink sticks) and to refill them with ink from the new region. However, they usually also have chips and sensors to prevent refilling (such as the "time chips" mentioned above).
	
Some manufacturers of region-coded printers also offer region-free printers specially designed for travelers, but, generally, ''the best solution seems to be to avoid region-coded printers.''

'''Integration of the print-head in the cartridge'''

Some manufacturers install the print-head not in the printer, but integrate it in the cartridge. This makes it more difficult or even illegal (because of patent laws) for other manufacturers to rebuild cartridges, and just refilling the cartridge (including cleaning the print-head and resetting or disabling chips/sensors, if necessary) is sometimes not sufficient, because one cannot print anymore once the print-head no longer works.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{original research|section|date=April 2013}}
The main benefit of using a refill kit is the claimed cost savings. Environmental benefit is also claimed, as the process reuses a cartridge that would have otherwise been thrown away after one use.

The downside to refill is the time associated with it and the unpredictability.  Refilling a cartridge can take 10–15 minutes for those unfamiliar with the process, and some may prefer buying a new cartridge to the effort it takes to refill.  Also, ink cartridges usually last for 4-5 refills, but there are those that can only be refilled one time before they are worn out.

The biggest perceived downside to refilling is the mess associated with it.  Many consumers shy away from refilling either based on past experiences or stories they have heard.  Many of the unsuccessful refill kits of the past were so-called "universal" kits, meaning they were designed for use with multiple cartridges.  Because all manufacturers use different types of ink, and because different cartridge designs require different refilling processes, these universal kits had a high failure rate.  Today these kits are harder to find, as refill kits made for specific cartridges have become more the norm, but perception that all refill kits are messy still remains.

The main reason for the decline in refill kits is the emergence of large chains of ink stores that offer a refill process.  This is similar to the evolution of the automobile oil change. Just as cars became too complex for the average driver to change oil, the new cartridges have also become too complex for the average consumer to do it by themselves.

Inkjet refill kits are available in different sizes and with different grades of ink.

The proposal passed on 16 June was not a piece of final legislation. Instead, it began a process of editing 13 separate laws according to the proposal's specifications. This process was expected to be completed by mid-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ICELAND TO BECOME INTERNATIONAL TRANSPARENCY HAVEN | url=http://immi.is/?l=en&amp;p=intro | accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iceland seeks to become sanctuary for free speech | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iceland-free-speech-20110403,0,5332545.story | date=2 April 2011 | publisher =[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate= 3 April 2011 | first=Henry | last=Chu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After WikiLeaks exposed the loan book of [[Kaupthing Bank]], one of the largest news channels, RUV, was injuncted from displaying the news story.

==Support and endorsements==

{{Confuse|intensive and extensive properties}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property of a system or of a material itself or within. It is independent of how much of the material is present and is independent of the form of the material, e.g., one large piece or a collection of small particles. Intrinsic properties are dependent mainly on the chemical composition or structure of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Packaging Engineering (IFNHH, Massey University, NZ)&lt;/ref&gt;

A property that is not essential or inherent is called an '''extrinsic''' property. For example, [[density]] is an intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas '''belonging to something''' is an extrinsic property that depends on another object.

In biology, intrinsic effects originate from inside an organism or cell, such as an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disease or [[intrinsic immunity]].

'''Kurt Walter Bachstitz''' (4 October 1882 – 1949 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[art dealer]]. He died shortly before his naturalization to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="libmma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Bachstitz_records_b18041048.pdf|title=Bachstitz, Inc. records, 1923-1937|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.2|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==

===Until Emigration 1938===
Bachstitz was born as the child of the Jewish couple Liber Jacob Bachstitz and Mathilde Markowitz. His place of birth is arguable. All contemporary sources mention the formerly German [[Breslau]] (the present-day Polish [[Wrocław]]) as his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189; Central Bureau for Genealogy, The Hague, Calmery archive, Bachstitz file&lt;/ref&gt; But Bachstitz requested for himself the Austrian village Raipoltenbach as his place of birth when he claimed at the U.S. Department of Labor for an extension of his temporary stay in 1931.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt; He studied architecture in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Vienna]] where he finished his studies with a diploma. On the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was called up for military service and served between 1914 and 1918 as an officer, lastly in the rank of a troop captain. He served actively in the field until 1916, when he was severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elfriede Pesé (died in 1918) with whom he had two children – a son Walter Werner Michael who died in 1943 by tuberculosis in [[Switzerland]] and a daughter, Margit Martha&lt;ref&gt;File RC 1.78, estate inventory (via Ministry of Finance, inheritance tax returns)&lt;/ref&gt; who died in [[South Africa]] in 1982. On 19 December 1918 he married his second wife Elisa ("Lilly") Emma Hofer. Lilly was a [[Protestant]]. Because of her Bachstitz converted to the evangelic faith.&lt;ref&gt;NA, SNK 178, Bachstitz file, draft letter from Bogisch to Weyma, undated&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he apparently lived and traded in Munich. In his diary [[Thomas Mann]] wrote about a meeting in Bachstitz' Munich apartment, where Mann bought a work from Bachstitz. He described him quite prerogatively as a "blond-Jewish" example of an "international culture-capitalistic profiteer".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann Tagebücher, 1918–1921, herausgegeben von Peter de Mendelssohn, Frankfurt/M. 1979, {{ISBN|978-3-10-048192-4}}, S. 143 – 145 '"Der Mensch, blond-jüdisch und elegant, Mitte dreißig, mit Monokel und fetten, weißen, manikürten Händen, in gesteppter Hausjacke und Lackhausschuhen, wunderbar als Typus des international-kultur-kapitalistischen Schiebertums."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he established an art dealership in the Hague named Kunsthandel K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Gallery N.V.). Surinamestraat 11, He lived in Vienna and in [[Berlin]] and he created an internationally known company with art galleries in The Hague, [[New York City]] and Berlin. Lilly was the sister of art dealer [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]] who had managed the Gallery in The Hague for a while and subsequently became an art buyer for [[Hermann Göring]].

In 1937 Bachstitz waived his Austrian citizenship. In 1938 the couple moved to The Hague.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;

===World War II===

Between the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 and 1941 Bachstitz sold a number of paintings to the "[[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sondernauftrag Linz]]" that was run by [[Hitler]]'s Special Representative of the planned '[[Führermuseum]]' in Linz,&lt;ref&gt;Looted Art Commission.

Among the works sold to the Sonderauftrag were the following:

The correspondence between Bachstitz and Posse concerning these works is preserved. Posse achieved high price reductions.&lt;ref&gt;

In February 1941 Bachstitz officially resigned as supervisory director of the Bachstitz Gallery and his wife became the managing director. Together with his wife, he continued to provide a clandestine management role. In this way, they avoided having the Gallery placed under the forced administration for the duration of the war. According to the documents in the file concerning his successful application to become a Dutchman after the war&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, ministerie van justitie (1915–1955), inv. No. 13533 (1646)&lt;/ref&gt; the couple provided undercover protection for Jews trying to escape the authorities.

In 1942 Bachstitz was summoned by the occupation authority (the "Wirtschaftsamt") as he had failed to register the gallery as "non-Aryan property". Proceedings were commenced against him and he was arrested by the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in July 1943 and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague. Due to an intervention of Göring initiated by Bachstitz' brother-in-law Hofer, he was released from prison. He was then also exempted from wearing the Star of David. Furthermore, the couple had their marriage dissolved in September 1943 to prevent the confiscation of the gallery by the occupying authority.

Between 1942 und 1944 Bachstitz sold a number of works to the museums that were run by [[Kurt Martin]], the head of the Museums of the Upper Rhine (Alsace and Baden) under [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/SucheMeldungDetail.html?resourceId=4348&amp;input_=4340&amp;pageLocale=de&amp;person=&amp;titelbesch=&amp;datierung=&amp;objektart=-1&amp;objektart.GROUP=1&amp;mattech=&amp;provsamml=kurt+martin&amp;institution=&amp;ort=&amp;id=&amp;type=DetailVerlust&amp;type.GROUP=1&amp;suche_typ=MeldungDetail&amp;suche_typ.HASH=01c6e21bb090266af660&amp;suchen=Suchen  10 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Bachstitz managed to obtain permission to leave the Netherlands and he emigrated to Switzerland, again with the help of Andreas Hofer.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.6|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a bribe for the exit visa Bachstitz had to hand over art to Hermann Göring, namely a painting with the Samson and Delilah motive by [[Jan Steen]],&lt;ref&gt;US-NARA, RG 260, M1946. Roll 127. Restitution Research Records. Göring, Hermann: Notes on Purchases. Page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well two antique necklaces.&lt;ref name="lootedart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/aliu-long_print;Y|title=Post-War Reports: Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|publisher=lootedart.com|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After The War - Successful and Unsuccessful Restitution Efforts===

After the war the Allies returned most of the art that the gallery had sold to German authorities to the Netherlands. The Netherlands restituted the painting by Jan Steen&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK), 2.08.42.&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected an application for the restitution of the other works. They became part of the Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK). Kurt Walter Bachsitz and Lilly Bachstitz-Hofer were again registered as officially married. Kurt Walter Bachstitz died in 1949.

'''Waste diversion''' or '''landfill diversion''' is the process of diverting waste from [[landfills]]. The success of landfill diversion can be measured by comparison of the size of the landfill from one year to the next. If the landfill grows minimally or remains the same, then policies covering landfill diversion are successful. For example, currently in the United States there are 3000 landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/wastes.html |title=Wastes &amp;#124; Browse EPA Topics &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A measure of the success of landfill diversion would be if that number remains the same or is reduced. In 2009, it was recorded that the national average of landfill diversion in the United States was 33.8%, while San Francisco had implemented the most effective policies and had recorded a landfill diversion rate of 77%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Additional Waste &amp; Recycling Indicators|url=https://greendashboard.dc.gov/Waste/WasteDivertedFromLandfills|website=Green Dashboard|publisher=Government of the District of Columbia|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By diverting landfills we can preserve our natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greendashboard.dc.gov/Waste/WasteDivertedFromLandfills |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722145116/http://greendashboard.dc.gov/Waste/WasteDivertedFromLandfills |archivedate=July 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste diversion==
Waste diversion is the process of diverting waste from landfills through recycling and source reduction activities.  This can be calculated in different ways. As a global community, we can measure the size and number of landfills from one year to the next.  If the landfills have shrunk or decreased in number, then it can be gathered that we are successfully implementing a waste diversion plan.  If landfills have increased in number, then we are not doing enough to combat the growing population and growing waste we produce.  On a smaller scale, we can track our week to week, or even day to day, waste diversion rate.

==Types of landfill diversion==
===Waste reduction===
Reduction of waste is another way to divert waste from landfills; not creating waste in the first place will reduce the amount of waste going to landfills. There are numerous ways to reduce waste, for example, consumers can avoid single use products and instead invest in re-usable items such as canvas bags instead of plastic bags; consuming less in general is also an effective way to reduce waste. In addition, maintaining vehicles' tires will also help reduce [[waste tires]] in landfills since they are undesirable and take up too much space along with many other negative effects.

=== Recycling ===
Landfill diversion can occur through [[recycling]]. Recycling refers to taking used materials and creating new products in order to prevent the disposal of these products in landfills. Recycling material can include glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics. [[File:Recycle Plastic Bird.jpg|thumb|Recycle Plastic Bird]]

===Thermal treatment===
Another method of landfill diversion is [[thermal treatment]] (such as [[Incineration]]). Approximately sixteen percent (16%) of waste is incinerated yearly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zerowasteamerica.org/Statistics.htm |title=Statistics |publisher=Zerowasteamerica.org |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incineration, however, can lead to other environmental issues that may have positive or negative results.

===Biological treatments===
In addition to reusing materials waste products can go through biological treatment. There are two types of biological treatments [[anaerobic digestion]] or [[composting]]. Simply stated, biological treatment is the breaking down of material through the action of micro-organisms. Materials are broken down to carbon dioxide, water and biomass. Biomass consists of wood, crops, yard and animal waste. Biomass is considered a renewable energy because more can be grown in a short amount of time. Biomass contributes to roughly four percent of our energy. Biomass energy although its burned, does not pollute the air as much as fossil fuels. Some materials easily break down, others do not. The environment in which the material is placed determines the speed of breakdown.

===Return waste to supplier of original materials===
It is possible in many production facilities to return waste product to the supplier of the original raw material.  Some examples include the reuse of beer kegs by returning to the distributor to be refilled, reuse of propane tanks, and recycling batteries to be used again.  These products are large contributors to the overgrowth of landfills.  Many companies will offer incentives or credits for the returned product towards the next purchase.

===Reuse waste in the same or other steps of production process===
The development of more closed loop systems aides in diverting waste from landfills.  Manufacturing and most production facilities will create waste to varying degrees.  A closed loop system will recycle the waste back into the production process to maintain minimal levels of waste that is left to be disposed of.  This is environmentally and economically friendly. [[File:Industry park Höchst - waste-to-energy plant - Industriepark Höchst - Müllverbrennungsanlage - 07.jpg|thumb|Industry park Höchst - waste-to-energy plant - Industriepark Höchst - Müllverbrennungsanlage - 07]]

===Selling waste to a third party===
More unfamiliar than other types, it is possible for a company to sell its waste to a third party.  This third party will purchase the waste for reuse in their own production process.  In addition to the sale of waste, there are also third parties which will retrieve your waste for you if they are capable of disposing of it more efficiently and/or affordably.

===Waste to energy===
Other options for diversion are composting and [[waste-to-energy]]: converting primary waste into various types of energy such as heat or electricity.

==Types of landfills==
===Open dump===
An open dump is an area where unwanted waste is disposed of with no regulations or restrictions; they often produce adverse effects on the environment. The Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 prohibited open dumping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slimak|first1=Karen|title=Landfill Disposal Systems|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=December 1978|volume=27|pages=309–316|url=http://taurus.hood.edu:2088/stable/pdf/3428892.pdf|doi=10.1289/ehp.7827309}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore making it illegal in many states.

===Sanitary landfill===
A sanitary landfill is where waste is disposed of in thin layers little by little; each layer is covered and compacted with soil to prevent foul odors and wind blown litter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanitary Landfill|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/sanitary-landfill|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method prevents the creation of safety and public health hazards; this landfill has four requirements before it is built. The first requirement is that it must have absolute [[leachate]] security; the bottom of the landfill can be lined, synthetically or with soil, to prevent water contamination. Secondly, there must be formal engineering preparations and plannings in order to ensure the success of the landfill. Thirdly, permanent supervision must be present in all stages of the landfill also to ensure success and sustainability. Lastly, the placement and compacting of waste must be planned to prevent pest and vermin infestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solid Waste|url=http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/sectors/solid-waste-landfills.html|website=web.mit.edu|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure landfill===
A secure landfill is where [[hazardous waste]] is deposited since it requires a much more stringent regulation than municipal waste. The landfill must have at least two impermeable liners as well as a system for leachate collection to prevent any water contamination. In addition to this, the landfill must also have a groundwater monitoring system in case there is a leak; the wells can be pumped to remove the contaminated water for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nathanson|first1=Jerry|title=Hazardouse-waste management|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/hazardous-waste-management#ref593344|website=Britannica|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deep-well injection====
Deep-well injection is a form of disposing of liquid hazardous waste. The liquid waste is pumped into porous limestone or sandstone through a steel casing, and high pressure is applied in order to permanently store the waste within the pores and fissures of the rocks. The limestone or sandstone used for injection must be located beneath an impermeable layer of clay or rock at least 0.5 mile below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nathanson|first1=Jerry|title=Hazardouse-waste management|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/hazardous-waste-management#ref593344|website=Britannica|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option generally does not require pre-treatment of the waste and is one of the more inexpensive options, however it poses a risk of hazardous waste leakage.

== Legislation ==
===US===
==== California ====
The California Integrated Waste Management Act mandated all Californian cities and counties to divert 25% of their solid waste by 1990 and 50% by 2000 through planning and programs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enforcement|url=http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/LGCentral/Enforcement/|website=Cal Recycle|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is managed by the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), and they also provide assistance in creating plans and programs. The percentage of solid waste required to be diverted has remained at 50% each year.

====Maryland====
The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) promotes the idea of waste diversion by partnering with Maryland's jurisdictions as well as the public and private sectors. All counties and Baltimore City are required to recycle 15% of waste generated (populations under 150,000) or 20% (populations over 150,000) due to The Maryland Recycling Act (MRA); the state government is also required to recycle at least 20% of their solid waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waste Diversion in Maryland|url=http://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Land/RecyclingandOperationsprogram/Pages/Programs/LandPrograms/recycling/index.aspx|website=The Department of the Environment|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
The Municipal Waste Planning Recycling and Waste Reduction Act (Act 101) was passed in 1988 which first initiated a statewide recycling program in Pennsylvania.  As of 2016, at least 94% of Pennsylvania residents had access to recycling while 79% of the same population have direct access through curb side pick up programs.  This act also required that individual counties develop efficient plans to combat the waste which will need disposed of in the next 10+ years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Waste/Recycling/Pages/default.aspx#.Vikxb03D-Uk&lt;/ref&gt;
Success of Pennsylvania's recycling programs can be seen in the numbers.  Over 6.12 million tons of waste were recycled into resources in 2013.  This amount of recycling constitutes to 7.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions that were diverted from entering the air.  The amount of carbon dioxide that this single state reduced in one year is equivalent to taking 1.58 million vehicles off of the road for one full year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Waste/Recycling/Pages/default.aspx#.Vikxb03D-Uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
European waste legislation focuses upon the diversion of [[biodegradable waste]] from landfill, due to its potential to add to the effects of [[climate change]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recyclecddebris.com/rCDd/Resources/Documents/CSIEurope01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste diversion rate==
Calculating waste diversion rates is an important tool for households and especially businesses to use.  It is a KPI in indicating a successful recycling program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cleanriver.com/how-to-measure-your-waste-diversion-rate/|title=How to Measure Your Waste Diversion Rate - CleanRiver|date=2014-03-31|newspaper=CleanRiver|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By tracking progress weekly, changes can be made to improve week to week. A simple formula is used to calculate the waste diversion rate, as follows:

(Weight of Recycling / (Weight of Recycling + Weight of Garbage)) X 100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cleanriver.com/how-to-measure-your-waste-diversion-rate/|title=How to Measure Your Waste Diversion Rate - CleanRiver|date=2014-03-31|newspaper=CleanRiver|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waste should be labeled with the name of the area in which they were received.  For businesses, this will be helpful in implementing programs; what may work for one part of the company may not work for another. The goal is to calculate a number as close to one hundred as possible. This would imply that one hundred percent of your waste is recycled.  If a lower number is calculated, changes are required to improve the score.  When a need to change the recycling plan is recognized, you must effectively communicate the plan to all members involved to make sure it is implemented in full. After the plan is implemented, try measuring the waste diversion rate again. Measure the changes to see if the new plan has produced clear benefits.

==Waste diversion validation==
The UL is a global independent safety science company which is working to find and improve current technologies and the public use of these things.  They work to innovate the usage to promote a world where these luxuries and a healthy environment can co-inhabit the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ul.com/aboutul/|title=About UL {{!}} UL|website=www.ul.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are three different levels of validations which the UL uses to honor the companies who manage their waste in environmentally healthy ways. Facilities are recognized as "Zero Waste" if they can consistently measure at a waste diversion rate of 100 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://services.ul.com/service/landfill-waste-diversion-validation/|title=Landfill Waste Diversion Validation {{!}} Services|website=services.ul.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Facilities which are granted "Virtually Zero," maintain a waste diversion rate of 98 percent or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://services.ul.com/service/landfill-waste-diversion-validation/|title=Landfill Waste Diversion Validation {{!}} Services|website=services.ul.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If facilities can manage to keep a waste diversion rate of 80 percent or higher, they are recognized as operating with landfill waste diversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://services.ul.com/service/landfill-waste-diversion-validation/|title=Landfill Waste Diversion Validation {{!}} Services|website=services.ul.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero waste==
=== What does it mean to operate at zero waste? ===
A zero waste system is one which redesigns the traditional production system.  Rather than using natural resources which are scarce, it promotes the reuse of waste to create new products.  This process continues endlessly, constantly making product from the waste created by the last production process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocycle.org/zerowaste&lt;/ref&gt;

===A zero waste system===
A zero waste society will be led by motivated citizens. Responsible policies must be enacted which will provide regulations to follow to achieve zero waste. Regulations and closed loop manufacturing systems will create a clean and efficient manufacturing process.  Programs will be enacted locally to promote education and awareness over the importance of operating at zero waste and ways to effectively do so. Even after a zero waste production process is created, there is still remaining waste that must be properly disposed of.  This requires recovery infrastructure.  This infrastructure would look to replace landfills.  It has a potential to recover upwards of 90% of waste that has entered and is present in landfills to date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocycle.org/zerowaste&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7321">In differential geometry, a '''Lie algebra-valued form''' is a [[vector-valued differential form|differential form with values in a Lie algebra]]. Such forms have important applications in the theory of [[connection (principal bundle)|connections]] on a [[principal bundle]] as well as in the theory of [[Cartan connection]]s.

== Formal Definition ==

A Lie algebra-valued differential ''k''-form on a manifold, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is a smooth [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[fibre bundle|bundle]] &lt;math&gt; (\mathfrak{g} \times M) \otimes \Lambda^k T^*M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lie algebra]], &lt;math&gt;T^*M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cotangent bundle]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Exterior algebra|exterior power]].

== Wedge product ==

Since every Lie algebra has a bilinear Lie bracket operation, the wedge product of two Lie algebra-valued forms can be composed with the bracket operation to obtain another Lie algebra-valued form. This operation, denoted by &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt;, is given by: for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''p''-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''q''-form &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta](v_1, \cdots, v_{p+q}) = {1 \over (p + q)!}\sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) [\omega(v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(p)}), \eta(v_{\sigma(p+1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(p+q)})]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are tangent vectors. The notation is meant to indicate both operations involved. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are Lie algebra-valued one forms, then one has
:&lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta](v_1,v_2) = {1 \over 2} ([\omega(v_1),\eta(v_2)] - [\omega(v_2),\eta(v_1)]).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- With this operation the set of all Lie algebra-valued forms on a manifold ''M'' becomes a [[graded Lie superalgebra]].--&gt;

The operation &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt; can also be defined as the bilinear operation on &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M, \mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;[(g \otimes \alpha) \wedge (h \otimes \beta)] = [g, h] \otimes (\alpha \wedge \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;g, h \in \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \Omega(M, \mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Some authors have used the notation &lt;math&gt;[\omega, \eta]&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt;. The notation &lt;math&gt;[\omega, \eta]&lt;/math&gt;, which resembles a [[Commutator#Ring theory|commutator]], is justified by the fact that if the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix algebra then &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt; is nothing but the [[graded commutator]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, i. e. if &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega^p(M, \mathfrak g)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta \in \Omega^q(M, \mathfrak g)&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta] = \omega\wedge\eta - (-1)^{pq}\eta\wedge\omega,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega \wedge \eta,\ \eta \wedge \omega \in \Omega^{p+q}(M, \mathfrak g)&lt;/math&gt; are wedge products formed using the matrix multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;.

== Operations ==
Let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]]. If φ is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued form on a manifold, then ''f''(φ) is an &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;-valued form on the same manifold obtained by applying ''f'' to the values of φ: &lt;math&gt;f(\varphi)(v_1, \dots, v_k) = f(\varphi(v_1, \dots, v_k))&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, if ''f'' is a multilinear functional on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \prod_1^k \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, then one puts&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi–Nomizu|loc=Ch. XII, § 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(\varphi_1, \dots, \varphi_k)(v_1, \dots, v_q) = {1 \over q!} \sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) f(\varphi_1(v_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(q_1)}), \dots, \varphi_k(v_{\sigma(q - q_k + 1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(q)}))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''q'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-forms. Moreover, given a vector space ''V'', the same formula can be used to define the ''V''-valued form &lt;math&gt;f(\varphi, \eta)&lt;/math&gt; when
:&lt;math&gt;f: \mathfrak{g} \times V \to V&lt;/math&gt;
is a multilinear map, φ is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued form and η is a ''V''-valued form. Note that, when
:(*) ''f''([''x'', ''y''], ''z'') = ''f''(''x'', ''f''(''y'', ''z'')) - ''f''(''y'', ''f''(''x'', ''z'')),
giving ''f'' amounts to giving an action of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; on ''V''; i.e., ''f'' determines the representation
:&lt;math&gt;\rho: \mathfrak{g} \to V, \rho(x)y = f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
and, conversely, any representation ρ determines ''f'' with the condition (*). For example, if &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = [x, y]&lt;/math&gt; (the bracket of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;), then we recover the definition of &lt;math&gt;[\cdot \wedge \cdot]&lt;/math&gt; given above, with ρ = ad, the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]]. (Note the relation between ''f'' and ρ above is thus like the relation between a bracket and ad.) 

In general, if ''α'' is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}(V)&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''p''-form and φ is a ''V''-valued ''q''-form, then one more commonly writes α⋅φ = ''f''(α, φ) when {{nowrap|''f''(''T'', ''x'') &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''T''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''.}} Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha \cdot \phi)(v_1, \dots, v_{p+q}) = {1 \over (p+q)!} \sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \alpha(v_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(p)}) \phi(v_{\sigma(p+1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(p+q)}).&lt;/math&gt;
With this notation, one has for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(\alpha) \cdot \phi = [\alpha \wedge \phi]&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: If ω is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued one-form (for example, a [[connection form]]), ρ a representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; on a vector space ''V'' and φ a ''V''-valued zero-form, then
:&lt;math&gt;\rho([\omega \wedge \omega]) \cdot \varphi = 2 \rho(\omega) \cdot (\rho(\omega) \cdot \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since &lt;math&gt;\rho([\omega \wedge \omega])(v, w) = \rho([\omega \wedge \omega](v, w)) = \rho([\omega(v), \omega(w)]) = \rho(\omega(v))\rho(\omega(w)) - \rho(\omega(w))\rho(\omega(v))&lt;/math&gt;, we have that
:&lt;math&gt;(\rho([\omega \wedge \omega]) \cdot \phi)(v, w) = {1 \over 2} (\rho([\omega \wedge \omega])(v, w) \phi - \rho([\omega \wedge \omega])(w, v) \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
is &lt;math&gt;\rho(\omega(v))\rho(\omega(w))\phi - \rho(\omega(w))\rho(\omega(v))\phi = 2(\rho(\omega) \cdot (\rho(\omega) \cdot \phi))(v, w).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms with values in an adjoint bundle ==
{{see also|adjoint bundle}}
Let ''P'' be a smooth principal bundle with structure group ''G'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} = \operatorname{Lie}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. ''G'' acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; via [[adjoint representation]] and so one can form the associated bundle:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_P = P \times_{\operatorname{Ad}} \mathfrak{g}.&lt;/math&gt;
Any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_P&lt;/math&gt;-valued forms on the base space of ''P'' are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with any [[tensorial form]]s on ''P'' of adjoint type.

A '''metatheory''' or '''meta-theory''' is a [[theory]] whose [[wikt:subject matter|subject matter]] is some theory. All fields of research share some [[meta]]-theory, regardless whether this is explicit or correct. In a more restricted and specific sense, in [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical logic]], ''metatheory'' means a ''mathematical theory about another mathematical theory''.

The following is an example of a meta-theoretical statement:{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}
{{quote|Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it.  No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.  On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meta-theoretical investigations are generally part of the [[philosophy of science]]. Also a metatheory is an object of concern to the area in which the individual theory is conceived.

== Taxonomy ==
Examining groups of related theories, a first finding may be to identify classes of theories, thus specifying a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of theories.

==In mathematics==
The concept burst upon the scene of 20th-century philosophy as a result of the work of the [[Germany|German]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[David Hilbert]], who in 1905 published a proposal for proof of the [[consistency]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] of mathematics, creating the field of [[metamathematics]].  His hopes for the success of this proof were dashed by the work of [[Kurt Gödel]], who in 1931, used his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] to prove this [[Hilbert's program|goal of consistency and completeness]] to be unattainable. Nevertheless, his program of unsolved mathematical problems, out of which grew this metamathematical proposal, continued to influence the direction of mathematics for the rest of the 20th century.

The study of metatheory became widespread during the rest of that century by its application in other fields, notably [[Linguistics|scientific linguistics]] and its concept of [[metalanguage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35590">In [[mathematics]], a '''metric space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] for which [[Metric (mathematics)|distances]]  between all [[Element (mathematics)|members]] of the set are defined. Those distances, taken together, are  called a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the set. A metric on a space induces [[topological properties]] like [[open set|open]] and [[closed set]]s, which lead to the study of more abstract [[topological space]]s.

The most familiar metric space is [[3-dimensional Euclidean space]]. In fact, a "metric" is the generalization of the [[Euclidean metric]] arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric  defines the distance between two points as the length of the [[Straight line|straight]] [[line segment]] connecting them. Other metric spaces occur for example in [[elliptic geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], where distance on a [[sphere]] measured by angle is a metric, and the [[hyperboloid model]] of hyperbolic geometry is used by [[special relativity]] as a metric space of [[velocities]].

== History ==
{{Expand section|Reasons for generalizing the Euclidean metric, first non-Euclidean metrics studied, consequences for mathematics|date=August 2011}}

In 1906 [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced metric spaces in his work ''Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rendic. Circ. Mat. Palermo 22 (1906) 1–74&lt;/ref&gt; However the name is due to [[Felix Hausdorff]].

== Definition ==

A '''metric space''' is an [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;d \colon M \times M \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that for any &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, the following holds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B. Choudhary|title=The Elements of Complex Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K9i2YwgTjYC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1992|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-0399-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- same table is at [[Metric (mathematics)#Definition]] --&gt;
:{|
|-
|style="width:20px"| 1.
|style="width:250px"|&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
|| [[Non-negative|non-negativity]] or separation axiom
|-
| 2. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y&lt;/math&gt; || [[identity of indiscernibles]]
|-
| 3. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)  = d(y,x) &lt;/math&gt; || [[Symmetric function|symmetry]]
|-
| 4. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;  || [[subadditivity]] or [[triangle inequality]]
|}

The first condition follows from the other three. Since for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt;:

:{|
|-
|style="width:250px"| &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) + d(y,x) \ge d(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;
|| by triangle inequality
|-
| &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) + d(x,y) \ge d(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;
| by symmetry
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2d(x,y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
| by identity of indiscernibles
|-
| &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
| we have non-negativity
|-
|}

The function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is also called ''distance function'' or simply ''distance''. Often, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is omitted and one just writes &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.

Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldn't be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours aren't shortcuts. If the distance between two points is zero, the two points are indistinguishable from one-another. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea.

== Examples of metric spaces == &lt;!-- [[Finite Metric space]] redirects here--&gt;
* The [[real number]]s with the distance function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \vert y - x \vert&lt;/math&gt; given by the [[absolute difference]], and, more generally, [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] with the [[Euclidean distance]], are [[complete space|complete]] metric spaces. The [[rational number]]s with the same distance function also form a metric space, but not a complete one.
* The [[positive real numbers]] with distance function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) =\vert \log(y/x) \vert&lt;/math&gt; is a complete metric space.
* Any [[normed vector space]] is a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \lVert y - x \rVert&lt;/math&gt;, see also [[Metric (mathematics)#Metrics on vector spaces|metrics on vector spaces]]. (If such a space is [[Complete metric space|complete]], we call it a [[Banach space]].) Examples:
** The [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|Manhattan norm]] gives rise to the [[Manhattan distance]], where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates.
** The [[maximum norm]] gives rise to the [[Chebyshev distance]] or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a [[king (chess)|chess king]] would take to travel from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[British Rail]] metric (also called the “post office metric” or the “[[SNCF]] metric”) on a [[normed vector space]] is given by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(x,x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. More generally &lt;math&gt;\lVert . \rVert&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; taking an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to non-negative reals and taking the value &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at most once:  then the metric is defined on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = f(x) + f(y)&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(x,x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys to proceed via London (or Paris) irrespective of their final destination.
* If &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a metric space by restricting the domain of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[discrete metric]], where &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all sets. This, in particular, shows that for any set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an [[open ball]], and therefore every subset is open and the space has the [[discrete topology]].
* A finite metric space is a metric space having a [[finite set|finite]] number of points.  Not every finite metric space can be [[Isometry|isometrically]] embedded in a [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nati Linial|Nathan Linial]]. [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304466 ''Finite Metric Spaces—Combinatorics, Geometry and Algorithms'', Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 3, pp573–586] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502190916/https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304466 |date=2018-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/metrop.ps''Open problems  on embeddings  of finite  metric  spaces'', edited by Jirīı Matoušek, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226232112/http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/metrop.ps |date=2010-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]] is a metric space. More generally:
** If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is any [[connectedness|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then we can turn &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the [[infimum]] of the lengths of the paths (continuously differentiable [[curve]]s) connecting them.
** If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is some set and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then, the set of all [[bounded function]]s &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. those functions whose image is a [[bounded subset]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;) can be turned into a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))&lt;/math&gt; for any two bounded functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is [[supremum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Searcóid, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aP37I4QWFRcC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; This metric is called the [[uniform metric]] or supremum metric, and If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then this [[function space]] is complete as well. If ''X'' is also a topological space, then the set of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (endowed with the uniform metric), will also be a complete metric if ''M'' is.
** If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an [[graph theory|undirected connected graph]], then the set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of vertices of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In [[geometric group theory]] this is applied to the [[Cayley graph]] of a group, yielding the [[word metric]].
* [[Graph edit distance]] is a measure of dissimilarity between two [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], defined as the minimal number of [[Graph operations|graph edit operations]] required to transform one graph into another.
* The [[Levenshtein distance]] is a measure of the dissimilarity between two [[string (computer science)|strings]] &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an [[edit distance]].

* Given an [[injective function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y))&lt;/math&gt; defines a metric on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[Helly metric]]  is used in [[game theory]].

== Open and closed sets, topology and convergence ==
Every metric space is a [[topological space]] in a natural manner, and therefore all definitions and theorems about general topological spaces also apply to all metric spaces.

About any point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; we define the '''[[open ball]] of radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a real number) about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''' as the set
:&lt;math&gt;B(x;r) = \{y \in M : d(x,y) &lt; r\}.&lt;/math&gt;
These open balls form the [[base (topology)|base]] for a topology on ''M'', making it a [[topological space]].

Explicitly, a subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''[[open set|open]]''' if for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; there exists an &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. The [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is called '''[[closed set|closed]]'''. A [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is any subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that contains an open ball about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a subset.

A topological space which can arise in this way from a metric space is called a '''metrizable''' space; see the article on [[metrization theorems]] for further details.

A [[sequence]] (&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) in a metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the limit &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt; [[iff]] for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number ''N'' such that &lt;math&gt;d(x_n,x) &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, one can use the general definition of convergence available in all topological spaces.

A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is closed iff every sequence in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that converges to a limit in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has its limit in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Types of metric spaces ==

===Complete spaces===
{{Main|Complete metric space}}

A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''complete''' if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. That is to say: if &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x_m) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as both &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; independently go to infinity, then there is some &lt;math&gt;y\in M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, y) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Every [[Euclidean space]] is complete, as is every closed subset of a complete space. The rational numbers, using the absolute value metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \vert x - y \vert&lt;/math&gt;, are not complete.

Every metric space has a unique (up to [[isometry]]) [[completion (metric space)|completion]], which is a complete space that contains the given space as a [[dense set|dense]] subset. For example, the real numbers are the completion of the rationals.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a complete subset of the metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, a space is complete [[iff]] it is closed in any containing metric space.

Every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]].

===Bounded and totally bounded spaces===
[[File:Diameter of a Set.svg|thumb|Diameter of a set.]]
{{See also|bounded set}}
A metric space ''M'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists some number ''r'', such that ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''.  The smallest possible such ''r'' is called the '''[[diameter]]''' of ''M''. The space ''M'' is called '''precompact''' or '''[[totally bounded]]''' if for every ''r'' &gt; 0 there exist finitely many open balls of radius ''r'' whose union covers ''M''. Since the set of the centres of these balls is finite, it has finite diameter, from which it follows (using the triangle inequality) that every totally bounded space is bounded.  The converse does not hold, since any infinite set can be given the discrete metric (one of the examples above) under which it is bounded and yet not totally bounded.

Note that in the context of [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s in the space of [[real number]]s and occasionally regions in a Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt; a bounded set is referred to as "a finite interval" or "finite region". However boundedness should not in general be confused with "finite", which refers to the number of elements, not to how far the set extends; finiteness implies boundedness, but not conversely. Also note that an unbounded subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt; may have a finite [[Lebesgue measure|volume]].

===Compact spaces===
A metric space ''M'' is compact if every sequence in ''M'' has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in ''M''. This is known as [[sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and, in metric spaces (but not in general topological spaces), is equivalent to the topological notions of [[countably compact space|countable compactness]] and [[compact space|compactness]] defined via [[open cover]]s.

Examples of compact metric spaces include the closed interval [0,1] with the absolute value metric, all metric spaces with finitely many points, and the [[Cantor set]]. Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact.

A metric space is compact [[iff]] it is complete and totally bounded.  This is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Note that compactness depends only on the topology, while boundedness depends on the metric.

[[Lebesgue's number lemma]] states that for every open cover of a compact metric space ''M'', there exists a "Lebesgue number" δ such that every subset of ''M'' of [[diameter]] &lt; δ is contained in some member of the cover.

Every compact metric space is [[second countable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html|title=PlanetMath: a compact metric space is second countable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=planetmath.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205003114/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html|archivedate=5 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a continuous image of the [[Cantor set]]. (The latter result is due to [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn|Urysohn]].)

===Locally compact and proper spaces===
A metric space is said to be [[locally compact]] if every point has a compact neighborhood. Euclidean spaces are locally compact, but infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are not.

A space is [[proper space|proper]] if every closed ball {''y'' : ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r''} is compact. Proper spaces are locally compact, but the converse is not true in general.

===Connectedness===
A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[connected space|connected]] if the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; itself.

A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[connectedness|path connected]] if for any two points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt; there exists a continuous map &lt;math&gt;f\colon [0,1] \to M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(0)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(1)=y&lt;/math&gt;.
Every path connected space is connected, but the converse is not true in general.

There are also local versions of these definitions: [[locally connected space]]s and [[connectedness|locally path connected spaces]].

[[Simply connected space]]s are those that, in a certain sense, do not have "holes".

===Separable spaces===
A metric space is [[separable space]] if it has a [[countable]] [[dense set|dense]] subset. Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space. For metric spaces (but not for general topological spaces) separability is equivalent to [[second-countable space|second-countability]] and also to the [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] property.

===Pointed metric spaces===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty metric space and &lt;math&gt;x_0\in X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''pointed metric space'', and &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''distinguished point''.  Note that a pointed metric space is just a nonempty metric space with attention drawn to its distinguished point, and that any nonempty metric space can be viewed as a pointed metric space. The distinguished point is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; due to its similar behavior to zero in certain contexts.

==Types of maps between metric spaces==
Suppose (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are two metric spaces.

===Continuous maps===
{{Main|Continuous function (topology)}}

The map ''f'':''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[continuous map|continuous]]
if it has one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent properties:
;General topological continuity: for every open set ''U'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[preimage]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is open in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:This is the general definition of [[Continuity (topology)|continuity in topology]].
;Sequential continuity: if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that converges to ''x'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) converges to ''f''(''x'') in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:This is [[sequential continuity]], due to [[Eduard Heine]].
;ε-δ definition: for every ''x'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and every ε&gt;0 there exists δ&gt;0 such that for all ''y'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; we have
::&lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
:This uses the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]], and is due to [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]].

Moreover, ''f'' is continuous if and only if it is continuous on every compact subset of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every compact set under a continuous function is compact, and the image of every connected set under a continuous function is connected.

===Uniformly continuous maps===
The map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 there exists ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt; \varepsilon \quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every uniformly continuous map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is continuous.  The converse is true if ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is compact ([[Heine–Cantor theorem]]).

Uniformly continuous maps turn Cauchy sequences in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into Cauchy sequences in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For continuous maps this is generally wrong; for example, a continuous map
from the open interval (0,1) ''onto'' the real line turns some Cauchy sequences into unbounded sequences.

===Lipschitz-continuous maps and contractions===
{{Main|Lipschitz continuity}}

Given a real number ''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0, the map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Lipschitz continuity|''K''-Lipschitz continuous]] if

:&lt;math&gt;d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq K d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every Lipschitz-continuous map is uniformly continuous, but the converse is not true in general.

If ''K'' &lt; 1, then ''ƒ'' is called a [[contraction mapping|contraction]]. Suppose ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is complete. If ''ƒ'' is a contraction, then ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point ([[Banach fixed point theorem]]). If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is compact, the condition can be weakened a bit: ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point if

:&lt;math&gt; d(f(x), f(y)) &lt; d(x, y) \quad \mbox{for all} \quad x \ne y \in M_1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Isometries===
The map ''f'':''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[isometry]] if
:&lt;math&gt;d_2(f(x),f(y))=d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1&lt;/math&gt;
Isometries are always [[injective]]; the image of a compact or complete set under an isometry is compact or complete, respectively. However, if the isometry is not [[surjective]], then the image of a closed (or open) set need not be closed (or open).

===Quasi-isometries===
The map ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[quasi-isometry]] if there exist constants ''A''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''B''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{A} d_2(f(x),f(y))-B\leq d_1(x,y)\leq A d_2(f(x),f(y))+B \text{ for all } x,y\in M_1&lt;/math&gt;

and a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that every point in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a distance at most ''C'' from some point in the image&amp;nbsp;''f''(''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

Note that a quasi-isometry is not required to be continuous. Quasi-isometries compare the "large-scale structure" of metric spaces; they find use in [[geometric group theory]] in relation to the [[word metric]].

==Notions of metric space equivalence==
Given two metric spaces (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

*They are called '''homeomorphic''' (topologically isomorphic) if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] continuous in both directions).
*They are called '''uniformic''' (uniformly isomorphic) if there exists a [[uniform isomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] uniformly continuous in both directions).
*They are called '''isometric''' if there exists a [[bijective]] [[isometry]] between them. In this case, the two metric spaces are essentially identical.
*They are called '''quasi-isometric''' if there exists a [[quasi-isometry]] between them.

==Topological properties==
Metric spaces are [[paracompact]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, Mary Ellen.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2035708 A new proof that metric spaces are paracompact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412015215/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2035708 |date=2016-04-12 }}.  Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 20, No. 2. (Feb., 1969), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hausdorff space]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=5838|title=metric spaces are Hausdorff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence [[normal space|normal]] (indeed they are perfectly normal). An important consequence is that every metric space admits [[partitions of unity]] and that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subset of a metric space can be extended to a continuous map on the whole space ([[Tietze extension theorem]]). It is also true that every real-valued [[Lipschitz maps|Lipschitz-continuous]] map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz-continuous map on the whole space.

Metric spaces are [[first countable]] since one can use balls with rational radius as a neighborhood base.

The metric topology on a metric space ''M'' is the coarsest topology on ''M'' relative to which the metric ''d'' is a continuous map from the product of ''M'' with itself to the non-negative real numbers.

==Distance between points and sets; Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric==
A simple way to construct a function separating a point from a closed set (as required for a [[completely regular]] space) is to consider the [[Distance#Distances between sets and between a point and a set|distance between the point and the set]]. If (''M'',''d'') is a metric space, ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''M'' and ''x'' is a point of ''M'', we define the distance from ''x'' to ''S'' as
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,S) = \inf\{d(x,s) : s \in S \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\inf&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[infimum]].

Then ''d''(''x'', ''S'') = 0 if and only if ''x'' belongs to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Furthermore, we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,S) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,S),&lt;/math&gt;
which in particular shows that the map &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,S)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Given two subsets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''M'', we define their [[Hausdorff distance]] to be
:&lt;math&gt;d_H(S,T) = \max \{ \sup\{d(s,T) : s \in S \} , \sup\{ d(t,S) : t \in T \} \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[supremum]].

In general, the Hausdorff distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'',''T'') can be infinite. Two sets are close to each other in the Hausdorff distance if every element of either set is close to some element of the other set.

The Hausdorff distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; turns the set ''K''(''M'') of all non-empty compact subsets of ''M'' into a metric space. One can show that ''K''(''M'') is complete if ''M'' is complete.
(A different notion of convergence of compact subsets is given by the [[Kuratowski convergence]].)

One can then define the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff distance]] between any two metric spaces by considering the minimal Hausdorff distance of isometrically embedded versions of the two spaces. Using this distance, the class of all (isometry classes of) compact metric spaces becomes a metric space in its own right.

==Product metric spaces==
If &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1),\ldots,(M_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; are metric spaces, and ''N'' is the [[Euclidean norm]] on ''R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', then &lt;math&gt;\Big(M_1\times \ldots \times M_n, N(d_1,\ldots,d_n)\Big)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, where the [[product metric]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;N(d_1,...,d_n)\Big((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\Big) = N\Big(d_1(x_1,y_1),\ldots,d_n(x_n,y_n)\Big),&lt;/math&gt;

and the induced topology agrees with the [[product topology]].  By the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, an equivalent metric is obtained if ''N'' is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|taxicab norm]], a [[Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]], the [[Norm (mathematics)#Infinity norm or maximum norm|max norm]], or any other norm which is non-decreasing as the coordinates of a positive ''n''-tuple increase (yielding the triangle inequality).

Similarly, a countable product of metric spaces can be obtained using the following metric

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac1{2^i}\frac{d_i(x_i,y_i)}{1+d_i(x_i,y_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

An uncountable product of metric spaces need not be metrizable. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is not [[first-countable space|first-countable]] and thus isn't metrizable.

===Continuity of distance===
In the case of a single space &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt;, the distance map &lt;math&gt;d\colon M\times M \rightarrow R^+&lt;/math&gt; (from the [[Metric space#Definition|definition]]) is uniformly continuous with respect to any of the above product metrics &lt;math&gt;N(d,d)&lt;/math&gt;, and in particular is continuous with respect to the product topology of &lt;math&gt;M\times M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quotient metric spaces==
If ''M'' is a metric space with metric ''d'', and ''~'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', then we can endow the quotient set ''M/~'' with the following (pseudo)metric. Given two equivalence classes [''x''] and [''y''], we define
:&lt;math&gt;d'([x],[y]) = \inf\{d(p_1,q_1)+d(p_2,q_2)+\dotsb+d(p_{n},q_{n})\}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[infimum]] is taken over all finite sequences &lt;math&gt;(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;[p_1]=[x]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[q_n]=[y]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[q_i]=[p_{i+1}], i=1,2,\dots, n-1&lt;/math&gt;. In general this will only define a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;d'([x],[y])=0&lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily imply that &lt;math&gt;[x]=[y]&lt;/math&gt;. However, for nice equivalence relations (e.g., those given by gluing together polyhedra along faces), it is a metric.

The quotient metric ''d'' is characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If &lt;math&gt;f:(M,d)\longrightarrow(X,\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric map]] between metric spaces (that is, &lt;math&gt;\delta(f(x),f(y))\le d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'') satisfying ''f''(''x'')=''f''(''y'') whenever &lt;math&gt;x\sim y,&lt;/math&gt; then the induced function &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\colon M/\sim\longrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}([x])=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is a metric map &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\colon (M/\sim,d')\longrightarrow (X,\delta).&lt;/math&gt;

A topological space is [[sequential space|sequential]] if and only if it is a quotient of a metric space.&lt;ref&gt;Goreham, Anthony. [http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf Sequential convergence in Topological Spaces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604232111/http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}.

==Generalizations of metric spaces==
*Every metric space is a [[uniform space]] in a natural manner, and every uniform space is naturally a [[topological space]]. Uniform and topological spaces can therefore be regarded as generalizations of metric spaces.
*If we consider the first definition of a metric space [[#Definition|given above]] and relax the second requirement, we arrive at the concepts of a [[pseudometric space]] or a dislocated metric space.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Pascal Hitzler and Anthony Seda, Mathematical Aspects of Logic Programming Semantics. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; If we remove the third or fourth, we arrive at a [[quasimetric space]], or a [[semimetric space]].
*If the distance function takes values in the [[extended real number line]] '''R'''∪{+∞}, but otherwise satisfies all four conditions, then it is called an ''extended metric'' and the corresponding space is called an ''&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;-metric space''. If the distance function takes values in some (suitable) ordered set (and the triangle inequality is adjusted accordingly), then we arrive at the notion of ''generalized ultrametric''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*[[Approach space]]s are a generalization of metric spaces, based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point distances.
*A [[continuity space]] is a generalization of metric spaces and [[poset]]s, that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and [[Domain theory|domain]]s.

=== Metric spaces as enriched categories ===
The ordered set &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\geq)&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] by requesting exactly one [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;a\to b&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a\geq b&lt;/math&gt; and none otherwise. By using &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; as the [[tensor product]] and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Identity element|identity]], it becomes a [[monoidal category]] &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Every metric space &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; can now be viewed as a category &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; [[enriched category|enriched]] over &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;:
* Set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ob}(M^*):=M&lt;/math&gt;
* For each &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in M&lt;/math&gt; set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X,Y):=d(X,Y)\in \operatorname{Ob}(R^*)&lt;/math&gt;
* The composition morphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(Y,Z)\otimes \operatorname{Hom}(X,Y)\to \operatorname{Hom}(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt; will be the unique morphism in &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; given from the triangle inequality &lt;math&gt;d(y,z)+d(x,y)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;
* The identity morphism &lt;math&gt;0\to \operatorname{Hom}(X,X)&lt;/math&gt; will be the unique morphism given from the fact that &lt;math&gt;0\geq d(X,X)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Since &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; is a poset, all [[Diagram (category theory)|diagrams]] that are required for an enriched category commute automatically.

'''Metta World Peace''' (born '''Ronald William Artest Jr.'''; November 13, 1979) is an American professional [[basketball]] coach and former player. He is currently the player development coach for the [[South Bay Lakers]] of the [[NBA G League]]. He was known as '''Ron Artest''' before legally changing his name in September 2011.

World Peace gained a reputation as one of the league's premier defenders as he won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] in 2004, when he was also named an [[NBA All-Star]] and earned [[All-NBA]] honors. He was a participant in several controversial on-court incidents, most notably the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|Malice at the Palace]], and is known for his sometimes eccentric and outspoken behavior. He won an [[NBA championship]] in 2010 as a member of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

Artest played high school basketball at [[La Salle Academy]] and [[college basketball]] at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]]. He has played for six teams in the NBA.

==Early life==
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
Metta World Peace was born Ronald William Artest Jr. on November 13, 1979, and raised in the [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]] projects in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He has two younger brothers, Isaiah and Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Aasen |title=The man behind the melee |url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=39502&amp;search=ron%20artest&amp;section=search |work=[[Indiana Daily Student]] |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209123845/http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=39502&amp;search=ron%20artest&amp;section=search |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played high school basketball at [[La Salle Academy]]. He also teamed with future NBA players [[Elton Brand]] and [[Lamar Odom]] on the same [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) team.&lt;ref name="Ron Artest Bio Page"/&gt;

Growing up, Artest witnessed the murder of a fellow player on a basketball court in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. "It was so competitive, they broke a leg from a table and they threw it, it went right through his heart and he died right on the court. So I'm accustomed to playing basketball really rough."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.chron.com/nba/2009/05/a_wild_and_crazy_night_kobe_ge.html A wild and crazy night: Kobe gets tough, Artest gets angry and the NBA has some decisions to make]. Retrieved on May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The player to whom Artest was referring was 19-year-old Lloyd Newton, who was stabbed in the back with a broken-off table leg during an altercation at a 1991 [[YMCA]]-sanctioned basketball tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/nyregion/player-dies-in-stabbing-at-basketball-game.html Player Dies in Stabbing at Basketball Game]. Nytimes.com (April 15, 1991). Retrieved on 2012-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Artest played [[college basketball]] at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]] from 1997 to 1999. At St. John's, he majored in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=ArtesRo01 Ron Artest Pro and College Stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011339/http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=ARTESRO01 |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

Artest gained fame playing in some of New York City's high-profile summer basketball tournaments at [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Pro City, Hoops in the Sun at [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach]], [[Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and Dyckman Park at [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], earning himself nicknames such as Tru Warier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truwarier.com |title=Ron Artest |publisher=TruWarier.com |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The New World Order, a name he received from Randy Cruz (one of the co-founders of the Hoops In The Sun basketball league at Orchard Beach).

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bulls (1999–2002)===
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
Artest was selected by the [[Chicago Bulls]] with the 16th pick of the [[1999 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbadraft.net/nba_draft_history/1999.html 1999 NBA draft]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1999.html&amp;nbsp;– 1999 NBA Draft | Basketball-Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artest played a total of 175 games for the Bulls over 2-1/2 years, the bulk as a starter, during which time he averaged about 12.5 points and just over 4 rebounds per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in the 1999–2000 season.

Midway through the 2001–02 season, Artest was traded by Chicago to the Indiana Pacers along with [[Ron Mercer]], [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Brad Miller]], and [[Kevin Ollie]], in exchange for [[Jalen Rose]], [[Travis Best]], [[Norman Richardson (basketball)|Norman Richardson]], and a 2nd round draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Davenport, [http://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2009/7/4/937998/a-ron-artest-review-the-soap-opera "A Ron Artest Review: The Soap Opera So Far"], ''Silver Screen and Roll'', July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana Pacers (2002–2006)===
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
During the 2003–04 season with the Pacers, he averaged 18.3 points per game, 5.7 rebounds per game, and 3.7 assists per game. Artest made the [[2004 NBA All-Star Game]] as a reserve and was named the Defensive Player of the Year. He wore three jersey numbers for the Pacers: 15, 23, and 91.

====Pacers–Pistons brawl====
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
{{main article|Pacers–Pistons brawl}}

On November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an [[violence in sports|altercation]] among players and fans during a game in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], between Artest's Pacers and the home team [[Detroit Pistons]]. The brawl involved Artest, Pistons [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Ben Wallace]], Artest's teammates [[Jermaine O'Neal]] and [[Stephen Jackson]], several other players, and spectators including Pistons fans John Green&lt;ref name="John Green"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842| title= Fan details strides made since brawl| date = November 19, 2009| publisher=ESPN.com| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and A.J. Shackleford.&lt;ref name="firstreport"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380 |title=Artest, Jackson charge Palace stands |date=November 21, 2004 |work=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. O'Neal, Jackson and Wallace were suspended indefinitely the day after the game. A day later, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games. Artest missed 86 games, the [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension]] for an on-court incident in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suspensions without pay, won't be staggered|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|publisher=ESPN|date=November 22, 2004|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath and trade====
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
Early in the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]], Artest requested a trade from the Indiana Pacers and was put on the team's inactive roster. Artest's call for a trade created a rift between him and his teammates. "We felt betrayed, a little disrespected", teammate Jermaine O'Neal said. As for their basketball relationship, O'Neal said: "The business relationship is over. That's fact." Pacers president [[Larry Bird]] said he also felt "betrayed" and "disappointed".&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10612285/ 'Betrayed' Bird says Artest must go – December 27, 2005]. MSNBC (December 27, 2005). Retrieved on 2012-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2006, reports from NBA sources confirmed that the [[Sacramento Kings]] had agreed to trade [[Predrag Stojaković|Peja Stojaković]] to the Pacers for Artest. However, before the trade could be completed, many press outlets reported that Artest had informed team management that he did not want to go to Sacramento. According to Artest's [[sports agent|agent]], his original trade request was only made because he was upset when he heard rumors that the Pacers were going to trade him to Sacramento for Stojaković early in the season. While not denying his agent's story, Artest did deny that he had rejected the trade to Sacramento, saying that he would play anywhere; hence, contradicting earlier press accounts stating Artest was holding up the trade. Given conflicting accounts, it is unclear why the trade was delayed, but it was nevertheless completed on January 25 and Artest was officially sent to the Kings for Stojaković.

===Sacramento Kings (2006–2008)===
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
[[Image:Ron Artest.jpg|thumb|170px|Artest during his tenure with the Sacramento Kings.]]
Though traded midseason to the Kings franchise, Artest quickly found his place on the team by providing some much needed defense.&lt;ref name="foxsports1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Kahn |title=Artest has Kings back in playoff hunt |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/5408720 |work=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=March 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524234734/http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/5408720 |archivedate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many feared his abrasive personality would be a problem, he worked well with his teammates and then-coach [[Rick Adelman]]. Artest wore #93 for his jersey number with the Kings. After acquiring Artest in late January 2006, the team immediately went on a 14–5 run, the team's best run of the season. The Kings broke .500 and landed the eighth spot in the Western Conference. This prompted [[ESPN]] to declare that "Ron Artest has breathed new life in the Sacramento Kings and enhanced their chances of reaching the playoffs for the ninth straight year."&lt;ref name="espn3"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/preview?gameId=260314023 NBA Preview – Lakers At Kings – March 14, 2006]. Sports.espn.go.com (March 14, 2006). Retrieved on 2012-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] proclaimed, "Artest has Kings back in playoff hunt."&lt;ref name="foxsports1" /&gt;

He was suspended for Game 2 of the team's first-round series against the [[San Antonio Spurs]] following a flagrant foul (elbow to the head) on [[Manu Ginóbili]]. The Kings eventually were eliminated from the playoffs in six games.

After the playoffs, Artest offered to donate his entire salary to keep teammate [[Bonzi Wells]] with the team, who became a free agent after the [[2005–06 NBA season]]. He even jokingly threatened to kill Wells if he did not re-sign with the Kings.&lt;ref name="hardwood"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Amick |title=Q &amp; A: Artest hits the road and the hardwood |url=http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/sports/story/14276300p-15085707c.html |work=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |page=C1 |date=July 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512072334/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/sports/story/14276300p-15085707c.html |archivedate = May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was later picked up by the [[Houston Rockets]] and then traded to the [[New Orleans Hornets]] for former [[Sacramento Kings]] player [[Bobby Jackson (basketball)|Bobby Jackson]]. Artest also offered to donate his salary to retain the services of head coach [[Rick Adelman]], whose contract expired after the same season. Adelman and the Kings did not agree on a contract extension so the two parted ways.

===Houston Rockets (2008–2009)===
&lt;!-- Please **DON'T CHANGE** Ron Artest to Metta World Peace. **CONSENSUS** is to use "Artest" for all events before his name change. --&gt;
[[Image:Ron Artest Rockets Wizards.jpg|thumb|left|Artest playing for the [[Houston Rockets]] in the [[2008–09 NBA season]].]]
On July 29, 2008, it was reported that Artest was to be traded to the [[Houston Rockets]] along with [[Patrick Ewing, Jr.]] and [[Sean Singletary]] for [[Bobby Jackson (basketball)|Bobby Jackson]], recently drafted forward [[Donté Greene]], a [[2009 NBA draft|2009 first-round draft]] pick, and cash considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3510261 Rockets agree to send pick, Greene, Jackson to Kings for Artest]. Sports.espn.go.com (July 31, 2008). Retrieved on 2012-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was made official on August 14, due to Greene's rookie contract signing on July 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It's official: Rockets acquire Ron Artest in blockbuster trade |work=[[NBA.com]] |url=http://www.nba.com/rockets/news/Itrsquos_official_Ron_Artes-280197-34.html |accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the trade, [[Yao Ming]] was generally positive, but jokingly said that "hopefully he's not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands." In response, Artest said, "This is Tracy (McGrady) and Yao's team, you know. I'm not going to take it personal. I understand what Yao said, but I'm still ghetto. That's not going to change. I'm never going to change my culture. Yao has played with a lot of black players, but I don't think he's ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as I represent my culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Feigen |title=Despite Yao's comments, Artest seems happy about future |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5916652.html |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artest and Yao later exchanged extensive phone calls. Artest also said, "Whatever Adelman needs me to do, whether that's come off the bench, sixth, seventh man, start, I don't even care. Whatever he needs me to do, I'm 100 percent sure it's going to work out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feigen |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/sports/5945115.html |title=Rockets hoping Artest ends playoff drought |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2008, Artest received his first technical as a Houston Rocket, as he raced towards a group of [[Dallas Mavericks]] players and then quickly went to [[Yao Ming]] who bumped [[Josh Howard]] after play stopped. Artest was trying to pull Yao away from the play and to the foul line, but contact was made with Maverick players. The [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] broadcast crew felt this technical was not warranted, and was based upon Artest's prior reputation as a feisty player in the league.

{{main article|Pacers–Pistons brawl}}

On November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an altercation among players and fans during a game in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] between Artest's Pacers and the home team [[Detroit Pistons]].

The brawl began when Artest [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouled]] Pistons [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Ben Wallace]] as Wallace was [[Layup|putting up a shot]]. Wallace, upset at being fouled hard when the game was effectively over (the Pacers led 97–82 with less than 50 seconds to go), responded by shoving Artest, leading to an [[violence in sports|altercation]] near the scorer's table. Artest walked to the sideline and lay down on the scorer's table. Reacting to Wallace throwing something at Artest, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke&lt;ref name="John Green 2"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842| title= Fan details strides made since brawl| date = November 19, 2009| publisher=ESPN.com| accessdate=November 19, 2009|quote="I remember throwing the cup, actually a cup of Diet Coke, not a beer, but I had been drinking and I've had issues with alcohol in the past"}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Artest, hitting him. Artest jumped into the front-row seats and confronted a man he incorrectly believed to be responsible, which in turn erupted into a brawl between Pistons fans and several of the Pacers. Artest returned to the basketball court, and punched Pistons fan A.J. Shackleford, who was apparently taunting Artest verbally.&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt; This fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. Artest's teammates [[Jermaine O'Neal]] and [[Stephen Jackson]] were suspended indefinitely the day after the game, along with Wallace.

On November 21, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games.  All told, Artest missed 86 games (73 regular season games plus 13 playoff games), the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. Eight other players (four Pacers and four Pistons) received suspensions, without pay, which ranged from one to thirty games in length. Each of the players involved were levied fines and ordered to do community service. Several fans were also charged and were banned from attending Pistons games for life. Artest lost approximately $5 million in salary due to the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/ |title=Palace brawl lives in infamy 1 year later |date=November 26, 2005 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gn543Q?url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/ |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mãe Menininha do Gantois''' (10 February 1894 – 13 August 1986) also known as '''Mother Menininha do Gantois''', was a Brazilian spiritual leader ''(iyalorixá)'' and spiritual daughter of [[Orisha|orixá]] [[Oshun|Oxum]], who officiated for 64 years as the head of one of the most noted [[Candomblé]] temples, the [[Ilê Axé Iyá Omin Iyamassê]], or Terreiro do Gantois, of Brazil, located in Alto do Gantois in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]].{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|pp=755–56}}{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=95}} She was instrumental in gaining legal recognition of Candomblé and its rituals, bringing an end to centuries of prejudice against Afro-Brazilians, who practiced their faith.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}} When she died on 13 August 1986, the State of Bahia declared a three-day state mourning in her honour,{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}} and the City Council of Salvador held a special session to pay tributes to her.&lt;ref name=Honour&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/bahia/noticia/2011/08/morte-de-mae-menininha-do-gantois-completa-25-anos-neste-sabado.html|title= Morte de Mãe Menininha do Gantois completa 25 anos neste sábado|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher= Globo 1|location=Salvador, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Terreiro do Gantois temple has been declared a protected national monument.{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}}

She was married to Alvaro MacDowell de Oliveira and they had two daughters. The elder daughter was Mãe [[Cleusa da Conceição Nazaré de Oliveira]], born in 1923, who was a doctor and who became the inherited Candomblé priestess of the temple after her mother's death.

==Career==
The temple, which she headed was established by her grandmother Mãe Pulquéria following a dispute over leadership from Engenho Velho, an older temple said to be one of the oldest Candomblé temple (1830 or even 100 years older) in Bahia which had been built by three freed African women. Two temples were built, one was the Terreiro do Gantois built in 1900 by Mãe Pulquéria and the other was Ile Axe Opo Afonja credited to Mãe Aninha.{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=755}} Mãe Pulquéria, who was the functional head of the Terreiro do Gantois, died suddenly in 1918.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; As she had no children, her niece Maria da Glória Nazaré was designated as her successor, but Maria died in 1920 before assuming office.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Then according to hierarchical rights the temple was given to Mother Menininha. This process was confirmed by deities [[Oshosi|Oxóssi]], [[Shango]], Oshun and [[Babalú-Ayé]]. Once chosen and confirmed in 1922 Menininha became the head of the Candomblé do Gantois.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; She dedicated her life to the temple and for the cause of the African religion of Candomblé which represented to her the "last stronghold of the black dignity". She faced persecution at the hands of the Brazilian government and even incarceration, as well as being subjected to harassment. She defended the African-Brazilian traditions of worship at the Terreiro do Gantois and other Terreiros at [[Engenho Velho]] and [[Casa Branca, São Paulo|Casa Branca]].&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; Her struggle, in association with other well known candomblé priesteses like Stella de Oxossi, asserted the Africanness of Candombé, stressing the fact that their religion was not the same as [[Roman Catholicism]].{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}}

One of the reasons she became prominent was that she initiated hundreds of "daughters" into the faith,{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=578}} as well as artists,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=10}} and invited the academic community to study the roots of the religion.{{sfn|Parés|Sansi|2011|p=45}} One of those academics, [[Ruth Landes]] compiled her findings and published a book,&lt;ref name=Andreson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreson|first1=Jamie Lee|title=Ruth Landes e Edison Carneiro: matriarcado e etnografia nos candomblés da Bahia (1938–9)|journal=Revista de História da UEG|volume=2|issue=1|date=January–July 2013|publisher=Universidade Federal da Bahia|url=http://www.revista.ueg.br/index.php/revistahistoria/article/download/1585/969|pages=236–261|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''City of Women'' (1947) discussing how the racial policies of the government were intertwined with the Candomblé religious rites.&lt;ref name=Glenn &gt;{{cite web|last1=Glenn|first1=James R.|title=Register to the Papers of Ruth Landes|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/fa/landes.pdf|website=National Anthropological Archives|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]], a powerful senator from Bahia; [[Carybé]], the illustrator; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edson Carneiro|pt}} and [[Pierre Verger]], two other anthropologists who studied Afro-Brazilian communities, were also prominent connections used by Menininha to further study and promote the validity of Candomblé.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}} These studies were influential in furthering research on the Nigerian roots of the religion,{{sfn|Parés|Sansi|2011|p=45}} but at the same time brought criticism from other temples in the faith that Menininha was exploiting the religion.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=10}} However, her success in obtaining legalization of the religion in the 1970s facilitated the first freedom to practice their faith in hundreds of years and began the process of eliminating prejudice against other Afro-Brazilian faiths.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}}

==Legacy==
Menininha died at the age of 92 on 13 August 1986. At the special session held in the City Council of Salvador to commemorate her death, Edvaldo Britto, Deputy Mayor; Pedro Godinho, President of the House; her friends; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Mabel Veloso|pt}} attended. Veloso paid a tribute to the mother by highlighting her role as the priestess in leading the resistance and fighting against discrimination and religious faith.&lt;ref name="Honour" /&gt; Her successor to the temple was her daughter Cleusa who was chosen as priestess in 1989. Upon Cleusa's death, the deities chose her younger sister, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mãe Carmem de Òsàlá|pt|3=Mãe Carmem}} to succeed her.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Menininha became a symbol of motherhood and spiritual daughter of the Orixa Oxum. Her ritual chair, which appears like a throne, is placed at the entry to the city museum in Salvador.{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=755}}

== Poems ==
Many songs have been written paryear songs seeking her blessings and spiritual guidance. [[Beth Carvalho]], a famous singer paid tribute to her in his composition titled '''O Encanto do Gantois'', in 1985. One of these poems reads:&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=755}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15337">The [[probability]] of the outcome of an experiment is never negative, although a [[quasiprobability distribution]] allows a '''negative probability''', or '''quasiprobability''' for some events. These distributions may apply to unobservable events or conditional probabilities.

==Physics and mathematics==
In 1942, [[Paul Dirac]] wrote a paper "The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1942.0023|pages=1–39|jstor=97777|title=Bakerian Lecture. The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=180|issue=980|year=1942|last1=Dirac|first1=P. A. M.|bibcode=1942RSPSA.180....1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he introduced the concept of [[negative energy|negative energies]] and negative [[probabilities]]:

: "Negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense.  They are well-defined concepts mathematically, like a negative of money."

The idea of negative probabilities later received increased attention in physics and particularly in [[quantum mechanics]].  [[Richard Feynman]] argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |date=1987 |editor1-last=Peat |editor1-first=F. David |editor2-last=Hiley |editor2-first=Basil |title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |pages=235–248 |chapter=Negative Probability |isbn=978-0415069601 |chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that no one objects to using negative numbers in calculations: although "minus three apples" is not a valid concept in real life, negative money is valid. Similarly he argued how negative probabilities as well as probabilities above [[1 (number)|unity]] possibly could be useful in probability [[calculations]].

Mark Burgin gives another example:
{{quote|"Let us consider the situation when an attentive person A with the high knowledge of English writes some text T. We may ask what the probability is for the word “texxt” or “wrod” to appear in his text T. Conventional probability theory gives 0 as the answer. However, we all know that there are usually misprints. So, due to such a misprint this word may appear but then it would be corrected. In terms of extended probability, a negative value (say, −0.1) of the probability for the word “texxt” to appear in his text T means that this word may appear due to a misprint but then it’ll be corrected and will not be present in the text T."|Mark Burgin|{{cite arXiv  |authorlink= |eprint=1008.1287 |title= Interpretations of Negative Probabilities|class= physics.data-an|year= 2010|version= |last1= Burgin|first1= Mark}}  }}

Negative probabilities have later been suggested to solve several problems and [[paradoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Y. (1997): ''Non-Archimedean Analysis: Quantum Paradoxes, Dynamical Systems and Biological Models''. Kluwer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-4800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-coins'' provide simple examples for negative probabilities. These strange coins were introduced in 2005 by [[Gábor J. Székely]].&lt;ref&gt;Székely, G.J. (2005) [http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf Half of a Coin: Negative Probabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108010759/http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf |date=2013-11-08 }}, Wilmott Magazine July, pp 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Half-coins have infinitely many sides numbered with 0,1,2,... and the positive even numbers are taken with negative probabilities. Two half-coins make a complete coin in the sense that if we flip two half-coins then the sum of the outcomes is 0 or 1 with probability 1/2 as if we simply flipped a fair coin.

In ''[[Convolution quotient]]s of nonnegative definite functions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages= 235–239|doi=10.1007/BF01352002|title=Convolution quotients of nonnegative functions|journal=Monatshefte für Mathematik|volume=95|issue=3|year=1983|last1=Ruzsa|first1=Imre Z.|last2=SzéKely|first2=Gábor J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Algebraic Probability Theory'' &lt;ref&gt;Ruzsa, I.Z. and Székely, G.J. (1988): ''Algebraic Probability Theory'', Wiley, New York {{ISBN|0-471-91803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] and [[Gábor J. Székely]] proved that if a [[random variable]] X has a signed or quasi distribution where some of the probabilities are negative then one can always find two random variables, Y and Z, with ordinary (not signed / not quasi) distributions such that X, Y are independent and X + Y = Z in distribution. Thus X can always be interpreted as the "difference" of two ordinary random variables, Z and Y. If Y is interpreted as a measurement error of X and the observed value is Z then the negative regions of the distribution of X are masked / shielded by the error Y.

Another example known as the Wigner distribution in [[phase space formulation|phase space]], introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1932 to study quantum corrections, often leads to negative probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.40.749|title=On the Quantum Correction for Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Physical Review|volume=40|issue=5|year=1932|last1=Wigner|first1=E.|bibcode=1932PhRv...40..749W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it has later been better known as the [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution]]. In 1945, [[M. S. Bartlett]] worked out the mathematical and logical consistency of such negative valuedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bartlett | first=  M. S.| year = 1945| title= Negative Probability | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 41| pages=  71–73 | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100022398|bibcode = 1945PCPS...41...71B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigner distribution function is routinely used in [[physics]] nowadays, and provides the cornerstone of [[Weyl quantization|phase-space quantization]]. Its negative features are an asset to the formalism, and often indicate quantum interference.  The negative regions of the distribution are shielded from direct observation by the quantum [[uncertainty principle]]: typically, the moments of such a non-positive-semidefinite quasiprobability distribution are highly constrained, and prevent ''direct measurability'' of the negative regions of the distribution. But these regions contribute negatively and crucially to the [[expected value]]s of observable quantities computed through such distributions, nevertheless.

=== An example: the double slit experiment ===

Consider a double slit experiment with photons. The two waves exiting each slit can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;f_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;f_2(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the distance to the detection screen, ''a'' is the separation between the two slits, ''x'' the distance to the center of the screen, ''λ'' the wavelength and ''dN/dt'' is the number of photons emitted per unit time at the source. The amplitude of measuring a photon at distance ''x'' from the center of the screen is the sum of these two amplitudes coming out of each hole, and therefore the probability that a photon is detected at position ''x'' will be given by the square of this sum:

&lt;math&gt;I(x) = \left\vert f_1(x)+f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 + \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 + \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

This should strike you as the well-known probability rule:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{either}\,\,\mathtt{slit})
 = \,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Negative joint probability 2.svg|thumb|In blue, the sum of the probabilities of going through holes 1 and 2; in red, minus the joint probability of going through "both holes". The interference pattern is obtained by adding the two curves.]]whatever the last term means. Indeed, if one closes either one of the holes forcing the photon to go through the other slit, the two corresponding intensities are

&lt;math&gt;I_1(x) = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;I_2(x) = \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

But now, if one does interpret each of these terms in this way, the joint probability takes negative values roughly every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\frac{d}{a}&lt;/math&gt; !&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} I_{12}(x) &amp; = \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right] \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\sin\left[(h/\lambda)(\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}-\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2})\right] \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, these negative probabilities are never observed as one can't isolate the cases in which the photon "goes through both slits", but can hint at the existence of anti-particles.

== Finance ==

Negative probabilities have more recently been applied to [[mathematical finance]]. In quantitative finance most probabilities are not real probabilities but pseudo probabilities, often what is known as [[risk neutral]] probabilities.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} These are not real probabilities, but theoretical "probabilities" under a series of assumptions that helps simplify calculations by allowing such pseudo probabilities to be negative in certain cases as first pointed out by Espen Gaarder Haug in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, E. G. (2004): [http://www.espenhaug.com/NegativeProbabilitiesHaug.pdf Why so Negative to Negative Probabilities], Wilmott Magazine, Re-printed in the book (2007); Derivatives Models on Models, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous mathematical definition of negative probabilities and their properties was recently derived by Mark Burgin and Gunter Meissner (2011). The authors also show how negative probabilities can be applied to financial [[option pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1773077  Burgin and Meissner: Negative Probabilities in Financial Modeling] Wilmott Magazine March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engineering ==

The concept of negative probabilities have also been proposed for reliable facility location models where facilities are subject to negatively correlated disruption risks when facility locations, customer allocation, and backup service plans are determined simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=L.V.|last2=Daskin|first2=M.S.|date=2005|title=Reliability Models for Facility Location: The Expected Failure Cost Case|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.1040.0107|journal=Transportation Science|volume=39|issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1287/trsc.1040.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=T.|last2=Ouyang|first2=Y.|last3=Shen|first3=Z-J.

This approach reduces a problem from one with correlated disruptions to one without. Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=|year=2015|title=Decomposition of general facility disruption correlations via augmentation of virtual supporting stations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515001290|journal=Transportation Research Part B|volume=80|pages=64–81|doi=10.1016/j.trb.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; later showed how negatively correlated disruptions can also be addressed by the same modeling framework, except that a supporting station now may be disrupted with a “failure propensity” which

“... inherits all mathematical characteristics and properties of a failure probability except that we allow it to be larger than 1...”

This finding paves ways for using compact mixed-integer mathematical programs to optimally design reliable location of service facilities under site-dependent and positive/negative/mixed disruption correlations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=An|first2=K.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=2017|title=Planning of Facility Location under Correlated Facility Disruptions|url=|journal=Under Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed “propensity” concept in Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; turns out to be what Feynman and others referred to as “quasi-probability.” Note that when a quasi-probability is larger than 1, then 1 minus this value gives a negative probability. The truly physically verifiable observation is the facility disruption states, and there is no direct information on the station states or their corresponding probabilities. Hence the failure probability of the stations, interpreted as “probabilities of imagined intermediary states,” could exceed unity.

'''Neo-futurism''' is a late 20th to early 21st century movement in [[the arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]. It could be seen as a departure from the attitude of [[Postmodern architecture|post-modernism]] and represents an [[Idealism|idealistic]] belief in a better future and "a need to periodize the modern rapport with the technological".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hal Foster]], Annals of the Architectural Association School of Architecture, Issues 14-16, Published by The Architectural Association, London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[avant-garde]] movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Avant-Garde-Neo-Avant-Garde-Critical-Studies-17/dp/9042019255/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388874183&amp;sr=1-4 |title=Avant-Garde / Neo-Avant-Garde (Avant-Garde Critical Studies 17): Dietrich Scheunemann: 9789042019256: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2005-10-24 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a futuristic rethinking of the aesthetic and functionality of rapidly growing cities. The industrialization that began worldwide following the end of the [[Second World War]] gave wind to new streams of thought in life, art and architecture, leading to post-modernism, neo-modernism and then neo-futurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/10-of-the-most-unusual-architectural-structures-in-europe/?view=all|title=10 of the Most Unusual Architectural Structures in Europe|work=TheRichest|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western countries, [[futurist architecture]] evolved into [[Art Deco]], the [[Googie architecture|Googie movement]] and [[high-tech architecture]], and most recently into neo-futurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steampunkopera.wordpress.com/tag/futurism/|title=futurism - A Steampunk Opera (The Dolls Of New Albion)|publisher=Steampunkopera.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Louis Cohen]] has defined neo-futurism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/design/the-future-of-architecture-since-1889.php|title=The Future of Architecture Since 1889|work=Cool Hunting|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.stmarytx.edu/mobile/item.php?search/o681503360|title=Blume Library Mobile|publisher=Library.stmarytx.edu|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "a corollary to technology, being the structures built today byproducts of new materials to create previously impossible forms." Etan J. Ilfeld wrote that in the contemporary neo-futurist aesthetics "the machine becomes an integral element of the creative process itself, and generates the emergence of artistic modes that would have been impossible prior to computer technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Contemporary-Art-Etan-Ilfeld/dp/1908126221|title=Beyond Contemporary Art: Amazon.co.uk: Etan Ilfeld: Books|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reyner Banham's definition of "une architecture autre" is a call for an architecture that technologically overcomes all previous architectures but possessing an expressive form,&lt;ref&gt;Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as Banham stated about neo-futuristic "Archigram’s Plug-in Computerized City, form does not have to follow function into oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;Reyner Banham, "A Clip-on Architecture," Architectural Design 35, no. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overexploitation''', also called '''overharvesting''', refers to harvesting a [[renewable resource]] to the [[point of diminishing returns]]. Continued overexploitation can lead to the destruction of the resource. The term applies to [[natural resource]]s such as: wild [[medicinal plant]]s, [[Pasture|grazing pasture]]s, [[Game (food)|game animals]], [[fish stocks]], [[forests]], and [[Aquifer|water aquifers]].

In [[ecology]], overexploitation describes one of the five main activities threatening global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilcove |first=D. S. |first2=D. |last2=Rothstein |first3=J. |last3=Dubow |first4=A. |last4=Phillips |first5=E. |last5=Losos |year=1998 |title=Quantifying threats to imperiled species in the United States |journal=BioScience |volume=48 |issue= |pages=607–615 |doi=10.2307/1313420 |jstor= 1313420 |url= http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/geog/144/001/www/readings/wilcove2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists use the term to describe populations that are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. This can result in extinction at the population level and even extinction of whole species. In [[conservation biology]] the term is usually used in the context of human economic activity that involves the taking of biological resources, or organisms, in larger numbers than their populations can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford. (1996). Oxford Dictionary of Biology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used and defined somewhat differently in [[fisheries]], [[hydrology]] and [[natural resource management]].

Overexploitation can lead to resource destruction, including [[extinction]]s. However it is also possible for overexploitation to be sustainable, as [[#Fisheries|discussed below]] in the section on fisheries. In the context of fishing, the term [[overfishing]] can be used instead of overexploitation, as can [[overgrazing]] in [[stock management]], [[overlogging]] in [[forest management]], [[overdrafting]] in [[aquifer]] management, and [[endangered species]] in species monitoring. Overexploitation is not an activity limited to humans. Introduced predators and herbivores, for example, can overexploit native [[flora]] and [[fauna]].

==History==
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|right|When the giant flightless birds called [[moa]] were overexploited to the point of extinction,&lt;ref name=Holdaway /&gt; the giant [[Haast's eagle]] that preyed on them also became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=A. |author2=Martinson, P. |year=2006 |title=Extinct Birds of New Zealand |publisher=Te Papa Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Concern about overexploitation is relatively recent, though overexploitation itself is not a new phenomenon. It has been observed for millennia. For example, ceremonial cloaks worn by the Hawaiian kings were made from the [[mamo]] bird; a single cloak used the feathers of 70,000 birds of this now-extinct species. The [[dodo]], a flightless bird from [[Mauritius]], is another well-known example of overexploitation.  As with many island species, it was naive about certain predators, allowing humans to approach and kill it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fryer |date=2002-09-14 |title=Bringing the dodo back to life |work=BBC News |accessdate=2006-09-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2255991.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest of times, [[hunting]] has been an important human activity as a means of survival. There is a whole history of overexploitation in the form of overhunting. The [[overkill hypothesis]] ([[Quaternary extinction event]]s) explains why the [[megafauna]]l extinctions occurred within a relatively short period of time. This can be traced with [[human migration]]. The most convincing evidence of this theory is that 80% of the North American large mammal species disappeared within 1000 years of the arrival of humans on the western hemisphere continents.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  The fastest ever recorded extinction of [[megafauna]] occurred in [[New Zealand]], where by 1500 AD, just 200 years after settling the islands, ten species of the giant [[Moa|moa birds]] were hunted to extinction by the [[Māori people|Māori]].&lt;ref name=Holdaway&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holdaway |first=R.

In more recent times, overexploitation has resulted in the gradual emergence of the concepts of [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which has built on other concepts, such as [[sustainable yield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larkin |first=P.

==Overview==
Overexploitation doesn't necessarily lead to the destruction of the resource, nor is it necessarily unsustainable. However, [[resource depletion|depleting]] the numbers or amount of the resource can change its quality. For example, [[Livistona rotundifolia|footstool palm]] is a wild palm tree found in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are used for thatching and food wrapping, and overharvesting has resulted in its leaf size becoming smaller.

==Tragedy of the commons==
[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|left|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The [[tragedy of the commons]] is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur.]]

The [[tragedy of the commons]] refers to a dilemma described in an article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] and first published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |first=Garrett |last=Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |year=1968 |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H }} Also available [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to [[Tragedy of the commons#Garrett Hardin's essay|Hardin's essay]] is an example which is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur. This example was first sketched in an 1833 pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd]], as a hypothetical and simplified situation based on medieval [[land tenure]] in Europe, of herders sharing a [[Common land|common]] on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze. In Hardin's example, it is in each herder's interest to put each succeeding cow he acquires onto the land, even if the [[carrying capacity]] of the common is exceeded and it is temporarily or permanently damaged for all as a result. The herder receives all of the benefits from an additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group. If all herders make this individually rational economic decision, the common will be overexploited or even destroyed to the detriment of all. However, since all herders reach the same rational conclusion, overexploitation in the form of [[overgrazing]] occurs, with immediate losses, and the pasture may be degraded to the point where it gives very little return.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons." (Hardin, 1968)&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of his essay, Hardin develops the theme, drawing in many examples of latter day commons, such as [[national park]]s, the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and [[fish stocks]]. The example of fish stocks had led some to call this the "tragedy of the fishers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Bowles |title=Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=27–29 |year=2004 |isbn=0-691-09163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme running through the essay is the growth of human populations, with the [[Earth]]'s finite resources being the general common.

The tragedy of the commons has intellectual roots tracing back to [[Aristotle]], who noted that "what is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=E. |year=1992 |chapter=The rudiments of a theory of the origins, survival, and performance of common-property institutions |editor-first=D. W. |editor-last=Bromley |title=Making the Commons Work: Theory, Practice and Policy |location=San Francisco |publisher=ICS Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Hobbes]] and his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feeny |first=D. |year=1990 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons: Twenty-two years later |journal=Human Ecology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1007/BF00889070 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite situation to a tragedy of the commons is sometimes referred to as a [[tragedy of the anticommons]]: a situation in which rational individuals, acting separately, collectively waste a given resource by underutilizing it.

The tragedy of the commons can be avoided if it is appropriately regulated. Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading Hardin to later remark that he should have titled his work "The tragedy of the unregulated commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fe20060726sh.html |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? |work=The Japan Times Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisheries==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] is currently seriously overexploited. Scientists say 7,500 tons annually is the sustainable limit, yet the fishing industry continue to harvest 60,000 tons.]]

In [[wild fisheries]], overexploitation or [[overfishing]] occurs when a [[fish stock]] has been fished down "below the size that, on average, would support the long-term [[maximum sustainable yield]] of the fishery".&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/glossary.htm ''FishWatch glossary''] Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, overexploitation can be sustainable.

When a fishery starts harvesting fish from a previously unexploited stock, the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of the fish stock will decrease, since harvesting means fish are being removed. For sustainability, the rate at which the fish replenish biomass through reproduction must balance the rate at which the fish are being harvested. If the harvest rate is increased, then the stock biomass will further decrease. At a certain point, the maximum harvest yield that can be sustained will be reached, and further attempts to increase the harvest rate will result in the collapse of the fishery. This point is called the [[maximum sustainable yield]], and in practice, usually occurs when the fishery has been fished down to about 30% of the biomass it had before harvesting started.&lt;ref&gt;Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PL6r1Ir_x_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Wildlife+ecology+and+management%22&amp;ei=ugW6SpjREJCINMbR1L8P#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Wildlife ecology and management''] 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. {{ISBN|0-13-840422-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to fish the stock down further to, say, 15% of the pre-harvest biomass, and then adjust the harvest rate so the biomass remains at that level. In this case, the fishery is sustainable, but is now overexploited, because the stock has been run down to the point where the sustainable yield is less than it could be.

Fish stocks are said to "collapse" if their biomass declines by more than 95 percent of their maximum historical biomass. [[Atlantic cod]] stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; Even though fishing has ceased, the cod stocks have failed to recover.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt; The absence of cod as the [[apex predator]] in many areas has led to [[trophic cascade]]s.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt;

About 25% of world fisheries are now overexploited to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grafton | first1 = RQ | authorlink3 = Ray Hilborn | last2 = Kompas | first2 = T | last3 = Hilborn | first3 = RW | year = 2007 | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5856/1601 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5856| page = 1601 | doi=10.1126/science.1146017 | bibcode=2007Sci...318.1601G | pmid=18063793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These depleted fisheries can often recover if fishing pressure is reduced until the stock biomass returns to the optimal biomass.

The [[tragedy of the commons]] can be avoided within the context of fisheries if fishing effort and practices are regulated appropriately by [[fisheries management]]. One effective approach may be assigning some measure of ownership in the form of  [[individual transferable quota]]s (ITQs) to fishermen. In 2008, a large scale study of fisheries that used ITQs, and ones that didn't, provided strong evidence that ITQs help prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn14762-guaranteed-fish-quotas-halt-commercial-freeforall.html  New Scientist: Guaranteed fish quotas halt commercial free-for-all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12253181 A Rising Tide: Scientists find proof that privatising fishing stocks can avert a disaster] The Economist, 18th Sept, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water resources, such as [[lake]]s and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to be [[Overdrafting|overdrafted]] or depleted.  Forests enhance the recharge of [[aquifer]]s in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation: UN Report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Conrad2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |last= Conrad|first= C.|title= Forests of eucalyptus shadowed by questions |date= 2008-06-21|publisher= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206103926/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean.

This has led to the concept of [[peak water]].

==Forest resources==
{{see|Overlogging}}
[[File:Gordon River Clearcut.jpg|thumb|right|Clear cutting of old growth forests in Canada.]]

[[Forest]]s are overexploited when they are [[Logging|logged]] at a rate faster than [[reforestation]] takes place. Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Historically utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, have played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term economic gains made by [[Deforestation|conversion of forest]] to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of overexploitation and the consequent declining timber harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:Overgrazing.JPG|thumb|right|It is not just humans that overexploit resources. [[Overgrazing]] can be caused by native fauna, as shown in the upper right. However, past human overexploitation (leading to elimination of some predators) may be behind the situation.]]

Overexploitation threatens one-third of endangered [[vertebrate]]s, as well as other groups. Excluding edible fish, the illegal [[wildlife trade|trade in wildlife]] is valued at $10 billion per year.  Industries responsible for this include the trade in [[bushmeat]], the trade in [[Chinese medicine]], and the [[fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemley 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or [[CITES]] was set up in order to control and regulate the trade in endangered animals.  It currently protects, to a varying degree, some 33,000 species of animals and plants. It is estimated that a quarter of the endangered vertebrates in the United States of America and half of the endangered mammals is attributed to overexploitation.&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Primack |first=R. B. |year=2002 |title=Essentials of Conservation Biology |edition=3rd |location=Sunderland |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-719-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All living organisms require resources to survive. Overexploitation of these resources for protracted periods can deplete natural stocks to the point where they are unable to recover within a short time frame. Humans have always harvested food and other resources they have needed to survive.  Human populations, historically, were small, and methods of collection limited to small quantities. With an exponential increase in human population, expanding markets and increasing demand, combined with improved access and techniques for capture, are causing the [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] of many species beyond sustainable levels.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1992, Fitzgibon ''et al.'' 1995, Cuarón 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In practical terms, if continued, it reduces valuable resources to such low levels that their exploitation is no longer sustainable and can lead to the [[extinction]] of a species, in addition to having dramatic, unforeseen [[keystone species|effects]], on the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankham |first=R. |last2=Ballou |first2=J. D. |last3=Briscoe |first3=D. A. |year=2002 |title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63014-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexploitation often occurs rapidly as markets open, utilising previously untapped resources, or locally used species.

[[File:Conuropsis carolinensisAWP026AA2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carolina parakeet]] was hunted to extinction.]]

Today, overexploitation and misuse of natural resources is an ever-present threat for [[species richness]].  This is more prevalent when looking at [[island ecology]] and the species that inhabit them, as islands can be viewed as the world in miniature.  Island [[Endemism|endemic]] populations are more prone to [[extinction]] from overexploitation, as they often exist at low densities with reduced reproductive rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dowding |first=J.

As another example, when the humble [[Erinaceus europaeus|hedgehog]] was introduced to the Scottish island of [[Uist]], the population greatly expanded and took to consuming and overexploiting shorebird eggs, with drastic consequences for their breeding success.  Twelve species of [[Bird|avifauna]] are affected, with some species numbers being reduced by 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=D. B. |last2=Fuller |first2=R.

Where there is substantial human migration, civil unrest, or war, controls may no longer exist.  With civil unrest, for example in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], firearms have become common and the breakdown of food distribution networks in such countries leaves the resources of the natural environment vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=R. F. |year=1990 |title=Farewell to Africa |journal=Audubon |volume=92 |issue= |pages=1547–1551 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are even killed as target practice, or simply to spite the government.  Populations of large primates, such as [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, [[ungulate]]s and other mammals, may be reduced by 80% or more by hunting, and certain species may be eliminated altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkie |first=D.

Overall, 50 bird species that have become extinct since 1500 (approximately 40% of the total) have been subject to overexploitation,&lt;ref&gt;The LUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[Pinguinus impennis|Great Auk]] – the penguin-like bird of the north, was hunted for its feathers, meat, fat and oil.
* [[Carolina parakeet]] – The only parrot species native to the eastern United States, was hunted for crop protection and its feathers.

==Cascade effects==
[[Image:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|left|Overexploiting [[sea otter]]s resulted in [[cascade effect]]s which destroyed [[kelp forest]] ecosystems.]]

Overexploitation of species can result in knock-on or [[cascade effect]]s. This can particularly apply if, through overexploitation, a habitat loses its [[apex predator]]. Because of the loss of the top predator, a [[Overpopulation in wild animals|dramatic increase]] in their [[prey]] species can occur. In turn, the unchecked prey can then overexploit their own food resources until population numbers dwindle, possibly to the point of extinction.

A classic example of cascade effects occurred with [[sea otters]]. Starting before the 17th century and not phased out until 1911, sea otters were hunted aggressively for their exceptionally warm and valuable pelts, which could fetch up to $2500 US. This caused cascade effects through the [[kelp forest]] ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=J. A. |first2=D. O. |last2=Duggins |first3=G. B. |last3=Rathbun |year=1989 |title=The ecology of extinctions in kelp forest communities |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251–264 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00085.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sea otters’ primary food sources is the [[sea urchin]]. When hunters caused sea otter populations to decline, an [[ecological release]] of sea urchin populations occurred. The sea urchins then overexploited their main food source, [[kelp]], creating urchin barrens, areas of seabed denuded of kelp, but carpeted with urchins. No longer having food to eat, the sea urchin became [[locally extinct]] as well. Also, since kelp forest ecosystems are homes to many other species, the loss of the kelp caused other cascade effects of secondary extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dayton |first=P. K. |first2=M. J. |last2=Tegner |first3=P. B. |last3=Edwards |first4=K. L. |last4=Riser |year=1998 |title=Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities |journal=Ecol.

In 1911, when only one small group of 32 sea otters survived in a remote cove, an international treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea otters. Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, [[Orcinus orca|killer whales]] have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea otters, again reducing their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3038">In [[differential geometry]] and the study of [[Lie group]]s, a '''parabolic geometry''' is a [[homogeneous space]] ''G''/''P'' which is the quotient of a [[semisimple Lie group]] ''G'' by a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P''.  More generally, the curved analogs of a parabolic geometry in this sense is also called a parabolic geometry: any geometry that is modeled on such a space by means of a [[Cartan connection]].

== Examples ==
The [[projective space]] ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an example.  It is the homogeneous space PGL(''n''+1)/''H'' where ''H'' is the isotropy group of a line.  In this geometrical space, the notion of a straight line is meaningful, but there is no preferred ("affine") parameter along the lines.  The curved analog of projective space is a manifold in which the notion of a [[geodesic]] makes sense, but for which there are no preferred parametrizations on those geodesics.  A [[projective connection]] is the relevant Cartan connection that gives a means for describing a projective geometry by gluing copies of the projective space to the tangent spaces of the base manifold.  Broadly speaking, [[projective geometry]] refers to the study of manifolds with this kind of connection.

Another example is the [[conformal geometry|conformal sphere]].  Topologically, it is the ''n''-sphere, but there is no notion of length defined on it, just of angle between curves.  Equivalently, this geometry is described as an equivalence class of [[Riemannian metric]]s on the sphere (called a conformal class).  The group of transformations that preserve angles on the sphere is the [[Lorentz group]] O(''n''+1,1), and so ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = O(''n''+1,1)/''P''.  [[Conformal geometry]] is, more broadly, the study of manifolds with a conformal equivalence class of Riemannian metrics, i.e., manifolds modeled on the conformal sphere.  Here the associated Cartan connection is the [[conformal connection]].

Other examples include:
* [[CR geometry]], the study of manifolds modeled on a real hyperquadric &lt;math&gt;Q^{2(p+q)-1} = SU(p,q)/P \subseteq \mathbb{C}^{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the stabilizer of an isotropic line (see [[CR manifold]])
* contact projective geometry, the study of manifolds modeled on &lt;math&gt;SP(n)/P&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is that subgroup of the [[symplectic group]] stabilizing the line generated by the first standard basis vector in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Phagomimicry''' is a [[defensive behaviour]] of [[sea hare]]s, in which the animal ejects a mixture of chemicals, which [[Mimicry|mimic]] food, and overwhelm the senses of their predator, giving the sea hare a chance to escape.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kicklighter|first=Cynthia E.|last2=Shabani|first2=Shkelzen|last3=Johnson|first3=Paul M.|last4=Derby|first4=Charles D.|title=Sea Hares Use Novel Antipredatory Chemical Defenses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205002228|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=6|pages=549–554|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shabani|first1=Shkelzen|last2=Yaldiz|first2=Seymanur|last3=Vu|first3=Luan|last4=Derby|first4=Charles D.|date=2 October 2007|title=Acidity enhances the effectiveness of active chemical defensive secretions of sea hares, Aplysia californica, against spiny lobsters, Panulirus interruptus|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=193|issue=12|pages=1195–1204|doi=10.1007/s00359-007-0271-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nusnbaum|first1=Matthew|last2=Derby|first2=Charles D.|date=May 2010|title=Ink secretion protects sea hares by acting on the olfactory and nonolfactory chemical senses of a predatory fish|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1067–1076|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.01.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical defence response of the sea hare to a predator is to release two chemicals - [[Cephalopod ink|ink]] from the ink gland and [[opal]]ine from the opaline gland. While ink creates a dark, diffuse cloud in the water which disrupts the sensory perception of the predator by acting as a smokescreen and as a decoy, the opaline, which affects the senses dealing with feeding, causes the predator to instinctively attack the cloud of chemicals as if it were indeed food.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; This ink is able to mimic food by having a high concentration of amino acids and other compounds that are normally found in food, and the attack behaviour of the predator allows the sea-hares the opportunity to escape.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NUSNBAUM|first=MATTHEW|last2=DERBY|first2=CHARLES D.|date=2010|title=Effects of Sea Hare Ink Secretion and Its Escapin-Generated Components on a Variety of Predatory Fishes|jstor=27822920|journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=218|issue=3|pages=282–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inking behaviour ==
The inking behaviour exhibited in phagomimicry is in response to predator threat. [[Anaspidea|Sea hares]] have many natural predators such as [[starfish]], [[lobster]]s, and other [[crustacean]]s. When threatened by a predator, phagomimicry behaviour begins. An ink solution is released from both the [[Opaline gland|opaline]] and ink glands individually, then the compounds mix in the mantle of the sea hare to form the ink mixture. When ink is released it creates a smoke-screen like [[Anti-predator adaptation|defense mechanism]] allowing the sea hares time to escape while also affecting the [[Olfaction|olfactory]] and [[Taste|gustation]] senses of their predator.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Predators are tricked into thinking that they have captured their prey due to the specific chemical composition of the ink released. This induces feeding behaviours in the predator, and again gives the sea hares a better chance of escaping predation.

=== Opaline gland ===
The opaline gland is a structure resembling a bundle of grapes attached to a central canal which is composed of [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells. Synthesis of the opaline substance happens in the opaline vesicles themselves, as there are only opaline vesicles and muscle cells in the opaline gland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prince|first=Jeffrey S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Opaline gland ultrastructure in Aplysia californica (Gastropoda: Anaspidea)|url=http://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/73/2/199/978441/Opaline-gland-ultrastructure-in-Aplysia|journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies|language=en|volume=73|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1093/mollus/eym016|issn=0260-1230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gland is innervated by three separate [[motor neuron]]s, and is composed of single large cells and vesicle cells, all of which have enlarged nucleus. These cells are inclosed in an external layer of muscle. When a [[sensory neuron]] detects a predator threat, dopamine is released onto one of the three motor neurons. The dopamine release causes a gland contraction, which then causes the expulsion of the opaline substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brunelli|first=M.|last2=Castellucci|first2=V.|last3=Kandel|first3=E. R.|date=1976|title=Synaptic Facilitation and Behavioral Sensitization in Aplysia: Possible Role of Serotonin and Cyclic AMP|jstor=1743647|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1178–1181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ink gland ===
The ink gland is smaller in size than the opaline gland, and is composed of two cell types: Rough endoplasmic recticlum (RER) and granulate cells. The cells are surrounded by a layer of muscle, to contraction and expelling their contents. The RER is the formation site of the anti-predator protein, the granulate cells are for extra pigment storage. Pigment is dependent on the amount of red algae available to the sea hares, the higher the red algal consumption, the darker the colour of their ink.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamio|first=Michiya|last2=Grimes|first2=Tiphani V.|last3=Hutchins|first3=Melissa H.|last4=Dam|first4=Robyn van|last5=Derby|first5=Charles D.|title=The purple pigment aplysioviolin in sea hare ink deters predatory blue crabs through their chemical senses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347210001338|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=80|issue=1|pages=89–100|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mixing can cause another chain of reactions between the compounds that have further implications on the effect that the ink secretion has on predators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ink chemical composition ==
Both the opaline and ink gland secrete different substances that when mixed together form the ink released during phagomimicry. The secretion is very acidic (ink having a pH of 4.9 and opaline having a pH of 5.8) and contains high levels of bioactive molecules that can serve as feeding stimulants, feeding deterrents, and aversive compounds. Feeding stimulants can be found in both the ink and opaline secretions in the form of [[amino acid]]s (such as [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]), and serve to trick predators into thinking that the ink secretion is a food source.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derby|first=Charles D.|last2=Kicklighter|first2=Cynthia E.|last3=Johnson|first3=P. M.|last4=Zhang|first4=Xu|date=2007-05-01|title=Chemical Composition of Inks of Diverse Marine Molluscs Suggests Convergent Chemical Defenses|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-007-9279-0|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=1105–1113|doi=10.1007/s10886-007-9279-0|issn=0098-0331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; To induce the aversive feeding effects on predators the ink contains a compound from the opaline gland produced from the oxidation of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-lysine, which is then mixed in the mantle with the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acid oxidase from the ink gland.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Together this compound, called escapin is secreted in the ink, and is a feeding deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ko|first=Ko-Chun|last2=Tai|first2=Phang C.|last3=Derby|first3=Charles D.|date=2012-04-01|title=Mechanisms of Action of Escapin, a Bactericidal Agent in the Ink Secretion of the Sea Hare Aplysia californica: Rapid and Long-Lasting DNA Condensation and Involvement of the OxyR-Regulated Oxidative Stress Pathway|url=http://aac.asm.org/content/56/4/1725|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|language=en|volume=56|issue=4|pages=1725–1734|doi=10.1128/aac.05874-11|issn=0066-4804|pmid=22232273|pmc=3318362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ink secretion can have a long-lasting effect on predators as chemical phagomimics can cause chemo-mechanosensory stimulation which overwhelms the sensory system and leads to confusion and eventually the cession of the attack.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Physical properties of Ink ==
The ink released from the ink gland is dark purple in colour, the colour depends on the type of algae consumed by the sea-hare.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt; The opaline ink is white in colour, and when it mixes with the ink gland ink they form a compound that suspends itself in the water ([[Dispersity|polidisperse]] suspension), creating a smoke-screen defence mechanism.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; The particle density of the ink is similar to that of species such as [[cuttlefish]], the particles range in size from 80–150&amp;nbsp;nm, with a density of 1.27&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;small&gt;-3,&lt;/small&gt; which allows for the inks suspension in water &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soto-Gómez|first=Diego|last2=Pérez-Rodríguez|first2=Paula|last3=López-Periago|first3=J.

More generally, the principle means that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; the behavior should not astonish or surprise users.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Formulation==
A [[textbook]] formulation is: "People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and [[mental model]]s."&lt;ref name="SaltzerKaashoek2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltzer|first1=J. H.|last2=Kaashoek|first2=Frans|authorlink2 =  Frans Kaashoek | title=Principles of computer system design: an introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-NOcVMGWSUC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-374957-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of "least surprising" behavior can depend on the expected [[audience]] (for example, [[end user]]s, [[programmer]]s, or [[System Administrators Day|system administrators]]).&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt;

In more practical terms, the principle aims to leverage the pre-existing knowledge of users to minimize the [[learning curve]], for instance by designing interfaces that borrow heavily from "functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar".&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; User expectations in this respect may be closely related to a particular [[computing platform]] or [[tradition]]. For example, [[Unix]] command line programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[Switch (command line)|switches]],&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; and [[GUI widget|widget]]s of [[Microsoft Windows]] programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[keyboard shortcut]]s.&lt;ref name="Petroutsos2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroutsos|first=Evangelos|title=Mastering Microsoft Visual Basic 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7LZTSVKZDoC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2010|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-53287-4|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more abstract settings like an [[Application programming interface|API]], the expectation that [[Function (computer science)|function]] or method names intuitively match their behavior is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176622 |chapter=How to design a good API and why it matters |last=Bloch|first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Bloch |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |year=2006 |pages=506–7  |doi=10.1145/1176617.1176622 |isbn=1-59593-491-X  |title=Proceeding OOPSLA '06 Companion to the 21st ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice also involves the application of sensible [[default (computer science)|default]]s.&lt;ref name="rexx" /&gt;

When two elements of an interface conflict, or are ambiguous, the behavior should be that which will least surprise the [[User (computing)|user]]; in particular a [[programmer]] should try to think of the behavior that will least surprise someone who uses the program, rather than that behavior that is natural from knowing the inner workings of the program.&lt;ref name="rexx"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=Could there be a high astonishment factor associated with the new feature? If a feature is accidentally misapplied by the user and causes what appears to him to be an unpredictable result, that feature has a high astonishment factor and is therefore undesirable. If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature.

==Examples==
A web site could declare an [[Form (HTML)|input]] that should autofocus when the page is loaded,&lt;ref name="Forms in HTML"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#The_autofocus_attribute | title=Forms in HTML | publisher=Mozilla | work=Mozilla Developers Network | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a search field (e.g., [[Google.com]]), or the ''username'' field of a [[login]] [[Form (HTML)|form]].  Sites offering [[keyboard shortcut]]s often allow pressing {{Key press|?}} to see the available shortcuts.  Examples include [[Gmail]]&lt;ref name="Gmail Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594 | title=Keyboard shortcuts for Gmail | author=Vivian | publisher=Google | date=2013-06-21 | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jira (software)|Jira]].&lt;ref name="Jira Using Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts#UsingKeyboardShortcuts-AccessingtheKeyboardShortcutsDialogBox | title=Using Keyboard Shortcuts | publisher=Atlassian | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{keypress|F1}} [[Function key]] in [[Windows operating system]]s is almost always for opening a help program associated with an application, and similarly for some of the Linux [[desktop environment]]s.  The corresponding key combination in [[Mac OS X]] is {{keypress|Command|Shift|/}}. Users expect a help screen or similar help services [[Context menu|popup]] when they press this key. Software binding this key to some other feature is likely to cause astonishment if no help appears. [[Malware|Malicious programs]] are known to exploit users' familiarity with regular shortcut keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9164038/Microsoft_Don_t_press_F1_key_in_Windows_XP |title=Microsoft: Don't press F1 key in Windows XP |newspaper=Computerworld |first=G. |last=Keizer |date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In programming, a good example of this principle is the common &lt;code&gt;ParseInteger(string, radix)&lt;/code&gt; function which exists in most languages and is used to convert a [[String (computer science)|string]] to an integer value. The [[radix]] is usually an optional argument and assumed to be 10 (representing [[Decimal|base 10]]). Other bases are usually supported (like [[Binary number|binary]] or [[octal]]) but only when specified explicitly; when the radix argument is not specified, base 10 is assumed. Notably JavaScript did not originally adopt this behavior, which resulted in developer confusion and software bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5600366/why-does-the-radix-for-javascripts-parseint-default-to-8 |title=Why does the radix for JavaScript's parseInt default to 8? |date=8 April 2011 |work=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-tiling tile set''', or ''setiset'', of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes or pieces, usually planar, each of which can be tiled with smaller replicas of the complete set of ''n'' shapes. That is, the ''n'' shapes can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves, where the increase in scale is the same in each case. Figure 1 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 using distinctly shaped [[decominoes]]. The concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension. The name setisets was coined by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2012,&lt;ref name=mathmag&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] |date=December 2012 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=323–333 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.85.5.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://alejandroerickson.com/home/blog/blog.php?entry=15 Alejandro Erickson on Self-tiling tile sets]&lt;/ref&gt; but the problem of finding such sets for ''n'' = 4 was asked decades previously by C. Dudley Langford, and examples for [[polyabolo]]es (discovered by [[Martin Gardner]], Wade E. Philpott and others) and [[polyomino]]es (discovered by Maurice J. Povah) were previously published by Gardner.&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;''Polyhexes and Polyaboloes'' in ''Mathematical Magic Show'', by Martin Gardner, Knopf, 1977, pp 146-159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and definitions==
[[File:A setiset with duplicated piece.png|thumb|300px|Figure 2:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset with duplicated piece.]]
From the above definition it follows that a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces is the same thing as a 'self-replicating tile' or [[rep-tile]], of which setisets are therefore a generalization.&lt;ref name=mathmag2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=More On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=April 2014 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=100–112 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.87.2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setisets using ''n'' distinct shapes, such as Figure 1, are called ''perfect''. Figure 2 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 which is ''imperfect'' because two of the component shapes are the same.
{{clear}}

The shapes employed in a setiset need not be ''connected'' regions. Disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted. Such pieces are described as ''disconnected'', or ''weakly-connected'' (when islands join only at a point), as seen in the setiset shown in Figure 3.

The fewest number of pieces in a setiset is two. Figure 4 encapsulates an infinite family of order 2 setisets each composed of two triangles, ''P'' and ''Q''. As shown, the latter can be hinged together to produce a compound triangle that has the same shape as ''P'' or ''Q'', depending upon whether the hinge is fully open or fully closed. This unusual specimen thus provides an example of a [[hinged dissection]].

==Inflation and Deflation==
[[File:A setiset of order 4 showing two stages of inflation.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 5:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset of order 4 using octominoes. Two stages of inflation are shown.]]

The properties of setisets mean that their pieces form [[substitution tiling]]s, or [[tessellations]] in which the [[prototile]]s can be dissected or combined so as to yield smaller or larger duplicates of themselves. Clearly, the twin actions of forming still larger and larger copies (known as inflation), or still smaller and smaller dissections (deflation), can be repeated indefinitely. In this way, setisets can produce non-periodic tilings. However, none of the non-periodic tilings thus far discovered qualify as [[Aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]], because the prototiles can always be rearranged so as to yield a periodic tiling. Figure 5 shows the first two stages of inflation of an order 4 set leading to a non-periodic tiling.

==Loops==
[[File:A loop of length 2 using decominoes.png|thumb|300px|Figure 6:  {{pad|.2em}}  A loop of length 2 using decominoes.]]
Besides self-tiling tile sets, which can be interpreted as loops of length 1, there exist longer loops, or closed chains of sets, in which every set tiles its successor.&lt;ref name=delahaye&gt;[http://www.scilogs.fr/complexites/pepites-geometriques-cachees/ ''Geometric Hidden Gems'' by Jean-Paul Delahaye in Scilogs], April 07, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 6 shows a pair of mutually tiling sets of [[decominoes]], in other words, a loop of length 2. Sallows and Schotel did an exhaustive search of order 4 sets that are composed of [[octominoes]]. In addition to seven ordinary setisets (i.e., loops of length 1) they found a bewildering variety of loops of every length up to a maximum of 14. The total number of loops identified was nearly one and a half million. More research in this area remains to be done, but it seems safe to suppose that other shapes may also entail loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/index.php?page_menu=Self-Tiling%20Tile%20Sets Self-Tiling Tile Sets website]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Methods of construction==
To date, two methods have been used for producing setisets. In the case of sets composed of shapes such as [[polyomino]]es, which entail integral piece sizes, a brute force search by computer is possible, so long as ''n'', the number of pieces involved, is not prohibitive. It is easily shown that ''n'' must then be a [[Square number|perfect square]].&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt; Figures 1,2,3,5 and 6 are all examples found by this method.

Alternatively, there exists a method whereby multiple copies of a rep-tile can be dissected in certain ways so as to yield shapes that create setisets. Figures 7 and 8 show setisets produced by this means, in which each piece is the union of 2 and 3 rep-tiles, respectively. In Figure 8 can be seen how the 9 pieces above together tile the 3 rep-tile shapes below, while each of the 9 pieces is itself formed by the union of 3 such rep-tile shapes. Hence each shape can be tiled with smaller duplicates of the entire set of 9.&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt;

[[File:Wind tunnel x-43.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A full scale [[NASA X-43|X-43]] [[wind tunnel]] test. The test is designed to have '''dynamic similitude''' with the real application to ensure valid results.]]

'''Similitude''' is a concept applicable to the testing of [[engineering]] [[Physical model|models]]. A model is said to have similitude with the real application if the two share geometric similarity, [[kinematics|kinematic]] similarity and dynamic similarity. ''Similarity'' and ''similitude'' are interchangeable in this context.

The term '''dynamic similitude''' is often used as a catch-all because it implies that geometric and kinematic similitude have already been met.

Similitude's main application is in [[hydraulic]] and [[aerospace engineering|aerospace]] engineering to test [[fluid flow]] conditions with [[Scale (ratio)|scaled]] models. It is also the primary theory behind many textbook [[formula]]s in [[fluid mechanics]].

The concept of similitude is strongly tied to [[dimensional analysis]].

== Overview ==
Engineering models are used to study complex fluid dynamics problems where calculations and computer simulations aren't reliable. Models are usually smaller than the final design, but not always. Scale models allow testing of a design prior to building, and in many cases are a critical step in the development process.

Construction of a scale model, however, must be accompanied by an analysis to determine what conditions it is tested under. While the geometry may be simply scaled, other parameters, such as [[pressure]], [[temperature]] or the [[velocity]] and type of [[fluid]] may need to be altered. Similitude is achieved when testing conditions are created such that the test results are applicable to the real design.

[[File:Similitude (model).png|thumb|right|280px|The three conditions required for a model to have similitude with an application.]]

The following criteria are required to achieve similitude;
*'''[[Similarity (geometry)|Geometric similarity]]''' &amp;ndash; the model is the same shape as the application, usually scaled.
*'''[[Kinematic similarity]]''' &amp;ndash; fluid flow of both the model and real application must undergo similar time rates of change motions. (fluid streamlines are similar)
*'''[[Dynamic similarity (Reynolds and Womersley numbers)|Dynamic similarity]]''' &amp;ndash; ratios of all forces acting on corresponding fluid particles and boundary surfaces in the two systems are constant.

To satisfy the above conditions the application is analyzed; 
# All parameters required to describe the system are identified using principles from [[continuum mechanics]].
# [[Dimensional analysis]] is used to express the system with as few independent variables and as many [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless parameters]] as possible.
# The values of the dimensionless parameters are held to be the same for both the scale model and application. This can be done because they are ''dimensionless'' and will ensure dynamic similitude between the model and the application. The resulting equations are used to derive ''scaling laws'' which dictate model testing conditions.

It is often impossible to achieve strict similitude during a model test. The greater the departure from the application's operating conditions, the more difficult achieving similitude is. In these cases some aspects of similitude may be neglected, focusing on only the most important parameters.

The design of marine vessels remains more of an art than a science in
large part because dynamic similitude is especially difficult to attain
for a vessel that is partially submerged: a ship is affected by wind
forces in the air above it, by hydrodynamic forces within the water
under it, and especially by wave motions at the interface between the
water and the air. The scaling requirements for each of these
phenomena differ, so models cannot replicate what happens to a full
sized vessel nearly so well as can be done for an aircraft or
submarine—each of which operates entirely within one medium.

Similitude is a term used widely in fracture mechanics relating to the strain life approach. Under given loading conditions the fatigue damage in an un-notched specimen is comparable to that of a notched specimen. Similitude suggests that the component fatigue life of the two objects will also be similar.

== An example ==
Consider a [[submarine]] modeled at 1/40th scale. The application operates in sea water at 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C, moving at 5&amp;nbsp;m/s. The model will be tested in fresh water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. Find the power required for the submarine to operate at the stated speed.

A [[free body diagram]] is constructed and the relevant relationships of force and velocity are formulated using techniques from [[continuum mechanics]]. The variables which describe the system are:

{| class="wikitable"
!Variable
!Application
!Scaled model
!Units
|-
|L ([[Length|diameter]] of submarine)
|1
|1/40
|(m)
|-
|V ([[speed]])
|5
|''calculate''
|(m/s)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; ([[density]])
|1028
|998
|(kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; ([[Viscosity|dynamic viscosity]])
|1.88x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|1.00x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|[[pascal (unit)|Pa]]·s (N s/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|F ([[force]])
|''calculate''
|''to be measured''
|[[newton (unit)|N]] &amp;nbsp; (kg m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|}

This example has five independent variables and three [[fundamental units]]. The fundamental units are: [[metre]], [[kilogram]], [[second]].&lt;ref&gt;In the [[SI]] system of units, [[newton (unit)|newton]]s can be expressed in terms of kg·m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invoking the [[Buckingham π theorem]] shows that the system can be described with two dimensionless numbers and one independent variable.&lt;ref&gt;5 variables - 3 fundamental units =&gt; 2 dimensionless numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dimensional analysis]] is used to re-arrange the units to form the [[Reynolds number]] (&lt;math&gt; R_e&lt;/math&gt;) and [[pressure coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;). These dimensionless numbers account for all the variables listed above except ''F'', which will be the test measurement. Since the dimensionless parameters will stay constant for both the test and the real application, they will be used to formulate scaling laws for the test.

'''Scaling laws:'''

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
  &amp;R_e = \left(\frac{\rho V L}{\mu}\right)
  &amp;\longrightarrow
  &amp;V_\text{model} = V_\text{application} \times \left(\frac{\rho_a}{\rho_m}\right)\times \left(\frac{L_a}{L_m}\right) \times \left(\frac{\mu_m}{\mu_a}\right)
  \\
  &amp;C_p = \left(\frac{2 \Delta p}{\rho V^2}\right), F=\Delta p L^2
  &amp;\longrightarrow
  &amp;F_\text{application} =F_\text{model} \times \left(\frac{\rho_a}{\rho_m}\right) \times \left(\frac{V_a}{V_m}\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{L_a}{L_m}\right)^2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure (&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) is not one of the five variables, but the force (&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) is. The pressure difference (Δ&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) has thus been replaced with (&lt;math&gt;F/L^2&lt;/math&gt;) in the pressure coefficient. This gives a required test velocity of:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\text{model} = V_\text{application} \times 21.9 &lt;/math&gt; .

A model test is then conducted at that velocity and the force that is measured in the model (&lt;math&gt;F_{model}&lt;/math&gt;) is then scaled to find the force that can be expected for the real application (&lt;math&gt;F_{application}&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{application} = F_\text{model} \times 3.44 &lt;/math&gt;

The power &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in watts required by the submarine is then:

:&lt;math&gt; P [\mathrm{W}] =F_\text{application}\times V_\text{application}= F_\text{model} [\mathrm{N}] \times 17.2 \ \mathrm{m/s}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that even though the model is scaled smaller, the water velocity needs to be increased for testing. This remarkable result shows how similitude in nature is often counterintuitive.

== Typical applications ==
{{see also|List of dimensionless numbers}}

===Fluid mechanics===
Similitude has been well documented for a large number of engineering problems and is the basis of many textbook formulas and dimensionless quantities. These formulas and quantities are easy to use without having to repeat the laborious task of dimensional analysis and formula derivation. Simplification of the formulas (by neglecting some aspects of similitude) is common, and needs to be reviewed by the engineer for each application.

Similitude can be used to predict the performance of a new design based on data from an existing, similar design. In this case, the model is the existing design. Another use of similitude and models is in validation of [[computer simulation]]s with the ultimate goal of eliminating the need for physical models altogether.

Another application of similitude is to replace the operating fluid with a different test fluid. Wind tunnels, for example, have trouble with air liquefying in certain conditions so [[helium]] is sometimes used. Other applications may operate in dangerous or expensive fluids so the testing is carried out in a more convenient substitute.

Some common applications of similitude and associated dimensionless numbers;

===Solid mechanics: structural similitude===

[[File:Scaledbeams.jpg|thumb|Schematic of scaled composite laminated I-beams: prototype (top) and models with different scales and layups (bottom)]]

Similitude analysis is a powerful engineering tool to design the scaled-down structures. Although both dimensional analysis and direct use of the governing equations may be used to derive the scaling laws, the latter results in more specific scaling laws.&lt;ref&gt;Rezaeepazhand, J., G. J. Simitses, and J. H. Starnes. "Scale models for laminated cylindrical shells subjected to axial compression." Composite Structures 34.4 (1996): 371-379&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the scaled-down composite structures can be successfully carried out using the complete and partial similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Asl, Mohamad Eydani, et al. "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278409912_Similitude_Analysis_of_Composite_I-beams_With_Application_to_Subcomponent_Testing_of_Wind_Turbine_Blades Similitude Analysis of Composite I-Beams with Application to Subcomponent Testing of Wind Turbine Blades]." Experimental and Applied Mechanics, Volume 4. Springer International Publishing, 2016. 115-126.&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of the scaled structures under complete similarity condition, all the derived scaling laws must be satisfied between the model and prototype which yields the perfect similarity between the two scales. However, the design of a scaled-down structure which is perfectly similar to its prototype has the practical limitation, especially for laminated structures. Relaxing some of the scaling laws may eliminate the limitation of the design under complete similarity condition and yields the scaled models that are partially similar to their prototype. However, the design of the scaled structures under the partial similarity condition must follow a deliberate methodology to ensure the accuracy of the scaled structure in predicting the structural response of the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Asl, Mohamad Eydani, et al. "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278410038_Predicting_the_Vibration_Response_in_Subcomponent_Testing_of_Wind_Turbine_Blades Predicting the vibration response in subcomponent testing of wind turbine blades]." Special Topics in Structural Dynamics, Volume 6. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 115-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Scaled models can be designed to replicate the dynamic characteristic (e.g. frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios) of their full-scale counterparts. However, appropriate response scaling laws need to be derived to predict the dynamic response of the full-scale prototype from the experimental data of the scaled model.&lt;ref&gt;Asl, Mohamad Eydani, et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18368">{{About|behavior imitation to reflect correct social behavior|imitation to gain approval|normative social influence}}

'''Social proof''', a term coined by Dr. Robert Cialdini in his 1984 book, ''Influence'', is also known as '''informational social influence'''.  It describes a [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[social]] phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation. 

Social proof is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate ''mode of behavior'', and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.

The effects of [[social influence]] can be seen in the tendency of large groups to conform to choices which are either correct or mistaken. This is referred to in some publications as the ''[[herd behavior]]''. Although social proof reflects a rational motive to take into account the information possessed by others, formal analysis shows that it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single distinct choice, so that decisions of even larger groups of individuals may be grounded in very little information (see [[information cascade]]s).

Social proof is one type of [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]].  When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave, they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behavior. When "we conform because we believe that others' interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action",&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M.  (2005).  Social Psychology (5th ed.).  Upper Saddle River, NJ:  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; it is informational social influence.  This is contrasted with [[normative social influence]] wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others.

Social proof often leads not only to public [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] (conforming to the behavior of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct) but also private acceptance (conforming out of a genuine belief that others are correct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C.|title=Compliance, identification, and internalization three processes of attitude change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|date=1 March 1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more important and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable.

== Mechanisms ==

===Multiple source effect===
The multiple source effect occurs when people give more credence to ideas that are stated by multiple sources. This effect can be clearly seen when social proof occurs.  For instance, one study observed that people who hear five positive reviews on a book as read by five different synthesized voices perceive that book more favourably than if they hear the same five reviews as read by one synthesized voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kwan Min|title=The Multiple Source Effect and Synthesized Speech.|journal=Human Communication Research|date=1 April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=182–207|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00730.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncertainty about the correct conclusion===
Uncertainty is a major factor that encourages the use of social proof. One study found that when evaluating a product, consumers were more likely to incorporate the opinions of others through the use of social proof when their own experiences with the product were ambiguous, leaving uncertainty as to the correct conclusion that they should make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wooten|first=D|author2=ReedII, A |title=Informational Influence and the Ambiguity of Product Experience: Order Effects on the Weighting of Evidence|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|date=1 January 1998|volume=7|issue=1|pages=79–99|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0701_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarity to the surrounding group===
Similarity also motivates the use of social proof; when a person perceives themselves as similar to the people around them, they are more likely to adopt and perceive as correct the observed behavior of these people. This has been noted in areas such as the use of [[laugh tracks]], where participants will laugh longer and harder when they perceive the people laughing to be similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platow|first=Michael J.|author2=Haslam, S. Alexander |author3=Both, Amanda |author4=Chew, Ivanne |author5=Cuddon, Michelle |author6=Goharpey, Nahal |author7=Maurer, Jacqui |author8=Rosini, Simone |author9=Tsekouras, Anna |author10=Grace, Diana M. |title="It’s not funny if they’re laughing": Self-categorization, social influence, and responses to canned laughter☆|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=1 September 2005|volume=41|issue=5|pages=542–550|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social proof is also one of [[Robert Cialdini|Robert Cialdini's]]  six principles of persuasion, (along with reciprocity, commitment/consistency, authority, liking, and scarcity) which maintains that people are especially likely to perform certain actions if they can relate to the people who performed the same actions before them.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 2001 72–79"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|title=Harnessing the science of persuasion|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=October 2001|volume=79|issue=9|pages=72–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment which exemplifies this claim was conducted by researchers who joined a door-to-door charity campaign, who found that if a list of prior donators was longer, the next person solicited was more likely to donate as well. This trend was even more pronounced when the names on the donor list were people that the prospective donor knew, such as friends and neighbors.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 2001 72–79"/&gt; Cialdini's principle also asserts that peer power is effective because people are more likely respond to influence tactics applied horizontally rather than vertically, so people are more likely to be persuaded by a colleague than a superior.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 2001 72–79"/&gt;

== Research ==

=== Early research ===
The most famous study of social proof is [[Muzafer Sherif|Muzafer Sherif's]] 1935 experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherif | first1 = M | year = 1935 | title = A study of some social factors in perception | url = | journal = Archives of Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | page = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this experiment subjects were placed in a dark room and asked to look at a dot of light about 15 feet away.  They were then asked how much, in inches, the dot of light was moving.  In reality it was not moving at all, but due to the [[autokinetic effect]] it appeared to move.  How much the light appears to move varies from person to person but is generally consistent over time for each individual.  A few days later a second part of the experiment was conducted. Each subject was paired with two other subjects and asked to give their estimate of how much the light was moving out loud. Even though the subjects had previously given different estimates, the groups would come to a common estimate.  To rule out the possibility that the subjects were simply giving the group answer to avoid looking foolish while still believing their original estimate was correct, Sherif had the subjects judge the lights again by themselves after doing so in the group.  They maintained the group's judgment.  Because the movement of the light is ambiguous the participants were relying on each other to define reality.

Another study looked at informational social influence in [[eyewitness identification]].  Subjects were shown a slide of the "perpetrator".  They were then shown a slide of a line-up of four men, one of whom was the perpetrator they had seen, and were asked to pick him out.  The task was made difficult to the point of ambiguity by presenting the slides very quickly.  The task was done in a group that consisted of one actual subject and three confederates (a person acting as a subject but actually working for the experimenter).  The confederates answered first and all three gave the same wrong answer.  In a high-importance condition of the experiment subjects were told that they were participating in a real test of eyewitness identification ability that would be used by police departments and courts, and their scores would establish the norm for performance.  In a low-importance condition subjects were told that the slide task was still being developed and that the experimenters had no idea what the norm for performance was—they were just looking for useful hints to improve the task. It was found that when subjects thought the task was of high importance they were more likely to conform, giving the confederate's wrong answer 51% of the time as opposed to 35% of the time in the low-importance condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=Robert S.|author2=Vandello, Joseph A. |author3=Brunsman, Bethany |title=The forgotten variable in conformity research: Impact of task importance on social influence.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1996|volume=71|issue=5|pages=915–927|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.5.915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural effects on social proof===
The strength of social proof also varies across different cultures. For instance, studies have shown that subjects in collectivist cultures conform to others' social proof more often than those in individualist cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=Rod|author2=Peter B. Smith |title=Culture and Conformity: A Meta-analysis of Studies Using Asch’s (1952, 1956) Line Judgment Task|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1996|volume=119|pages=111–37|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this trend seems reoccurring, there is evidence which suggests that these results are a simplification, and that an independent subject's personal individualistic-collectivist tendency also makes an impact upon their decisions.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 1999 1242–1253"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|author2=Wosinska, W. |author3=Barett, D. W. |author4=Gornik-Durose, M. |title=Compliance with a request in two cultures: The differential influence of social proof and commitment/consistency on collectivists and individualists|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=October 1999|volume=25|issue=10|pages=1242–1253|doi=10.1177/0146167299258006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional variables, such as the subject's sense of social responsibility, need to be taken into account to better understand the mechanisms of social proof across cultures; for example, more collectivist individuals will often have an increased compulsion to help others because of their prominent awareness of social responsibility, and this in turn will increase the likelihood they will comply to requests, regardless of their peers' previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 1999 1242–1253"/&gt;

=== Copycat suicides ===
{{further|Copycat suicide#Social proof model}}
Social proof has been proposed as an explanation for [[copycat suicide]], where suicide rates increase following media publication about suicides.&lt;ref name="influence" /&gt; One study using [[agent-based modeling]] showed that copycat suicides are more likely when there are similarities between the person involved in the publicized suicide and the potential copycats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=Alex|author2=Jones, James Holland |title=The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=9|pages=e7252|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007252|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=James Holland|pmid=19789643|pmc=2748702|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research performed by David Phillips between 1947 and 1968 further supports the existence of copycat suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann-Richter|first=Ulrike|title=The Werther Effect and Assisted Suicide|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|date=Summer 2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=192–200|doi=10.1521/suli.33.2.192.22768|last2=Schenker|first2=Tanja|last3=Finzen|first3=Asmus|last4=Dittmann|first4=Volker|last5=Kraeuchi|first5=Kurt|last6=Hoffmann-Richter|first6=Ulrike|pmid=12882420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

===In employment===
A person who has been [[unemployed]] for a long time may have a hard time finding a new job—even if they are highly skilled and qualified.  Potential employers attribute wrongly the person's lack of employment to the person rather than the situation.  This causes the potential employers to search more intensively for flaws or other negative characteristics that are "congruent" with or explain the person's failure and to discount the applicant's virtues.

Similarly, a person who is in high demand—for example a [[CEO]]—may continue to get many attractive job offers and can, as a result, extract a considerable wage premium—even if his/her objective performance has been poor.  When people appear successful, potential employers and others who evaluate them tend to search more intensively for virtues or positive characteristics that are "congruent" with or explain the person's success, and
to ignore or underestimate the person's faults.  People who experience positive social proof may also benefit from a [[halo effect]].  Other attributes are deemed to be more positive than they actually are.  Additionally, the person's attributes may be viewed with a positive [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing]] bias.  For example, a person might be viewed as arrogant if they have negative social proof, and bold if they have positive social proof. For these reasons, social proof is important in determining a potential employer's [[consideration set]].

Social proof naturally also applies to products and is used extensively in marketing and sales.

Situations that violate social proof can cause [[cognitive dissonance]], and can cause people to have a sense of loss of control or failure of the "[[just world hypothesis]]".

===In entertainment===
Theaters sometimes use [[Claque|specially planted audience members]] who are instructed to give ovations at pre-arranged times. Usually, these people are the ones who clap initially, and the rest of the audience follows. Such ovations may be perceived by non-expert audience members as signals of the performance's quality.

Contrary to common annoyance of [[laugh track|canned laughter]] in television shows, television studios have discovered that they can increase the perceived "funniness" of a show by merely playing canned laughter at key "funny" moments. They have found that even though viewers find canned laughter highly annoying, they perceive shows that happen to use canned laughter more funny than the shows that do not use canned laughter.&lt;ref name="influence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cialdini|title=Influence|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In social media ===
Social proof is also prominent on social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. The number of followers, fans, views, likes, favorites and even comments that a user has made, positively affects how other users perceive them. A user on Twitter with a million followers is perceived as more trustworthy and reputable than a similar user with a thousand followers, resulting in faster growth of followers and higher engagement and click-through-rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using Social Proof for your Digital Success ϟ Devumi|url = https://devumi.com/social-proof-in-digital-success/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although, these fake followers will never help meet business objectives or generate sales directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Proof in Social Media|url=https://somiibo.com/blog/social-proof-in-social-media/|website=somiibo.com|accessdate=3 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire multimillion-dollar industry, known as [[ghost followers]], exist for the sole purpose of increasing social proof on social media.

===The environment===

Social norms are often not clearly articulated for sustainable or pro-environmental conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/social-norm-behaviour-change | author = Corner, Adam | title = Social norm strategies do work – but there are risks involved. |date=December 16, 2011 | work = Guardian Professional Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possession of special knowledge===
If one perceives that s/he is better advised about a situation than the surrounding group, then s/he is less likely to follow the group's behavior.

===Identification with authority===
If one perceives themselves as a relevant authority figure in the situation, they are less likely to follow the surrounding group's behavior. This is a combination of "Identification of the surrounding group with self" and "Possession of special knowledge". People in authority positions tend to place themselves in different categories than other people and usually they have special training or knowledge that allows them to conclude that they are better informed than the surrounding group.

==="Smart money"===
One might perceive particular groups of others, identified by their behavior or other characteristics, to be more reliable guides to the situation than the average person. One might think truck drivers to be more frequent, and therefore more experienced drivers than others, and therefore weigh more heavily the number of trucks than the number of cars parked when judging the quality of a restaurant.  One might identify the movement of betting odds or securities prices at certain times as revealing the preferences of "smart money"—those more likely to be in the know.

== Cause ==
Some academics argue that International Resource Privilege remains because arrangements between global institutions tend to be struck without adequate concern for their thoroughgoing effects on the global poor. One example is that it provides additional incentive to overthrowing governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasper|first1=Anke|title='Poverty is a massive crime against humanity'|url=http://www.dw.de/poverty-is-a-massive-crime-against-humanity/a-16936635|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=Deutsche Welle|date=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schweickart|first1=David|title=Global Poverty: Alternative Perspectives on What We Should Do-and Why|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|date=December 2008|volume=39|issue=4|pages=471–491|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008.00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little incentive for foreign governments to challenge the situation because they benefit from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKinnon|first1=edited by Catriona|title=Issues in political theory|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199572823|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washington Post quotes [[Thomas Pogge]] as saying “most of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.” &lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Americans already think a third of the budget goes to foreign aid.

Thomas Pogge argues that we are.

== Philosophical Response ==

[[Mathias Risse]] calls the resource and borrowing privilege "The Cosmopolitan Complaint". He does acknowledge that the global order provides incentives for it but attributes oppression to the sheer desire to rule. Risse rejects the  belief that the global order Pogge is referring to is shaped by the "sheer existence of states" but Pogge rejects this idea also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=Do We Owe the Global Poor Assistance or Rectification?|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=01|pages=9–18|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00485.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Severe Poverty as a Violation of Negative Duties|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=01|pages=55–83|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00490.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''white-winged junco''' (''Junco hyemalis aikeni'') is a [[subspecies]] of the [[dark-eyed junco]]. It is superficially similar to the [[slate-colored junco]]. It was formerly classified as a distinct species.

It is a common [[endemism|endemic]] breeder in the [[Black Hills]] area of [[South Dakota]], [[Wyoming]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Montana]], and winters south along the [[Front Range]] to northeastern [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Sibley (2000): pp.500-502, CLO (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

''J. h. aikeni'' resembles the slate-colored junco but is larger, lighter gray (the head plumage contrasting with the dark lores), has much more white in the tail, and has a larger, longer bill that often has a bluish cast. Females are paler and washed brownish. Most fresh (fall/winter) individuals have the white wingbars that give this taxon its common name, but this feature is not always present, especially in spring and summer on females as the white tips to the wing coverts easily wear off.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} About one slate-colored junco in 200 has wing bars as bold as those of a fresh white-winged junco. Therefore, using wingbars alone to identify a bird as a white-winged junco outside the breeding range is ill-advised; identifications must be based on all the relevant characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''world line''' (or '''worldline''') of an object is the [[path (topology)|path]] that object traces in 4-[[dimension]]al [[spacetime]]. It is an important concept in modern [[physics]], and particularly [[theoretical physics]].

The concept of a "world line" is distinguished from concepts such as an "[[orbit]]" or a "[[trajectory]]" (e.g., a planet's ''orbit in space'' or the ''trajectory'' of a car on a road) by the ''time'' dimension, and typically encompasses a large area of spacetime wherein [[perception|perceptually]] straight paths are recalculated to show their ([[Principle of relativity|relatively]]) more absolute [[position states]]—to reveal the nature of [[special relativity]] or [[gravitation]]al interactions. 

The idea of world lines originates in [[physics]] and was pioneered by [[Hermann Minkowski]]. The term is now most often used in relativity theories (i.e., [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]).

==Usage in physics==
In [[physics]], a world line of an object (approximated as a point in space, e.g., a particle or observer) is the sequence of [[spacetime]] events corresponding to the history of the object. A world line is a special type of curve in spacetime. Below an equivalent definition will be explained: A world line is a time-like curve in spacetime. Each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time.

For example, the ''orbit'' of the Earth in space is approximately a circle, a three-dimensional (closed) curve in space: the Earth  returns every year to the same point in space. However, it arrives there at a different (later) time. The ''world line''  of the Earth is [[helix|helical]] in spacetime (a curve in a four-dimensional space) and does not return to the same point.

Spacetime is the collection of points called [[event (relativity)|events]], together with a continuous and smooth coordinate system identifying the events. Each event can be labeled by four numbers: a time coordinate and three space coordinates; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space. The mathematical term for spacetime is a four-dimensional [[manifold]]. The concept may be applied as well to a higher-dimensional space. For easy visualizations of four dimensions, two space coordinates are often suppressed. The event is then represented by a point in a [[Minkowski diagram]], which is a plane usually plotted with the time coordinate, say &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, upwards and the space coordinate, say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; horizontally.
As expressed by F.R. Harvey
:A curve M in [spacetime] is called a ''worldline of a particle'' if its tangent is future timelike at each point. The arclength parameter is called [[proper time]] and usually denoted &amp;tau;. The length of M is called the ''proper  time'' of the worldline or particle. If the worldline M is a line segment, then the particle is said to be in [[free fall]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Reese Harvey (1990) ''Spinors and calibrations'',  pages 62,3, [[Academic Press]], {{ISBN|0-12-329650-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime. A [[world sheet]] is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line (like a string) traveling through spacetime. The world sheet of an open string (with loose ends) is a strip; that of a closed string (a loop) is a volume.

Once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume, it traces out not a ''world line'' but rather a [[world tube]].

==World lines as a tool to describe events==
[[Image:Brane-wlwswv.png|300px|right|thumb|World line, worldsheet, and world volume, as they are derived from [[elementary particle|particles]], [[string theory|strings]], and [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]]s.]]

A one-dimensional ''line'' or ''curve'' can be represented by the coordinates as a function of one parameter. Each value of the parameter corresponds to a point in spacetime and varying the parameter traces out a line. So in mathematical terms a curve is defined by four coordinate functions &lt;math&gt;x^a(\tau),\; a=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x^{0}&lt;/math&gt; usually denotes the time coordinate) depending on one parameter &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. A coordinate grid in spacetime is the set of curves one obtains if three out of four coordinate functions are set to a constant.

Sometimes, the term '''world line''' is loosely used for ''any'' curve in spacetime. This terminology causes confusions. More properly, a '''world line'''  is a curve in spacetime which traces out the ''(time) history''  of a particle, observer or small object. One usually takes the [[proper time]] of an object or an observer as the curve parameter  &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; along the world line.

===Trivial examples of spacetime curves===
[[Image:Worldlines1.jpg|frame|Three different world lines representing travel at different constant four-velocities. ''t'' is time and ''x'' distance.]]
A curve that consists of a horizontal line segment (a line at constant coordinate time), may represent a rod in spacetime and would not be a world line in the proper sense. The parameter traces the length of the rod.

A line at constant space coordinate (a vertical line in the convention adopted above) may represent a particle at rest (or a stationary observer). A tilted line represents a particle with a constant coordinate speed (constant change in space coordinate with increasing time coordinate). The more the line is tilted from the vertical, the larger the speed.

Two world lines that start out separately and then intersect, signify a ''collision'' or "encounter". Two world lines starting at the same event in spacetime, each following its own path afterwards, may represent the decay of a particle into two others or the emission of one particle by another.

World lines of a particle and an observer may be interconnected with the world line of a photon (the path of light) and form a diagram which depicts the emission of a photon by a particle which is subsequently observed by the observer (or absorbed by another particle).

===Tangent vector to a world line, four-velocity===
The four coordinate functions &lt;math&gt;x^a(\tau),\; a=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;
defining a world line, are real functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and can simply be differentiated in the usual calculus. Without the existence of a metric (this is important to realize) one can speak of the difference between a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on the curve at the parameter value &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; and a point on the curve a little (parameter &lt;math&gt;\tau_0+\Delta\tau&lt;/math&gt;) farther away. In the limit &lt;math&gt;\Delta\tau\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, this difference divided by &lt;math&gt;\Delta\tau&lt;/math&gt; defines a vector, the '''tangent vector''' of the world line at the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. It is a four-dimensional vector, defined in the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. It is associated with the normal 3-dimensional velocity of the object (but it is not the same) and therefore called [[four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;, or in components:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = (v^0,v^1,v^2,v^3) = \left( \frac{dx^0}{d\tau}\;,\frac{dx^1}{d\tau}\;, \frac{dx^2}{d\tau}\;, \frac{dx^3}{d\tau} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the derivatives are taken at the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, so at &lt;math&gt;\tau=\tau_0&lt;/math&gt;.

All curves through point p have a tangent vector, not only world lines. The sum of two vectors is again a tangent vector to some other curve and the same holds for multiplying by a scalar. Therefore, all tangent vectors in a point p span a [[linear space]], called the [[tangent space]] at point p. For example, taking a 2-dimensional space, like the (curved) surface of the Earth, its tangent space at a specific point would be the flat approximation of the curved space.

==World lines in special relativity==

So far a world line (and the concept of tangent vectors) has been described without a means of quantifying the interval between events. The basic mathematics is as follows: The theory of [[special relativity]] puts some constraints on possible world lines. In special relativity the description of [[spacetime]] is limited to ''special'' coordinate systems that do not accelerate (and so do not rotate either), called [[inertial frame of reference|inertial coordinate system]]s. In such coordinate systems, the [[speed of light]] is a constant. The structure of spacetime is determined by a [[bilinear form]] &amp;eta; which gives a [[real number]] for each pair of events. The bilinear form is sometimes called a ''spacetime metric'', but since distinct events sometimes result in a zero value, unlike metrics in [[metric space]]s of mathematics, the bilinear form is ''not'' a mathematical metric on spacetime.

World lines of freely falling particles/objects are called [[geodesic]]s. In special relativity these are straight lines in Minkowski space.

Often the time units are chosen such that the speed of light is represented by lines at a fixed angle, usually at 45 degrees, forming a cone with the vertical (time) axis. In general, useful curves in spacetime can be of three types (the other types would be partly one, partly another type):

* '''light-like''' curves, having at each point the speed of light. They form a cone in spacetime, dividing it into two parts. The cone is three-dimensional in spacetime, appears as a line in drawings with two dimensions suppressed, and as a cone in drawings with one spatial dimension suppressed.

[[Image:World line2.svg|right|thumb|320px|An example of a [[light cone]], the three-dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in spacetime. Here, it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed.]]
[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the trajectory ("world line") of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the [[spacetime]] of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.]]

* '''time-like''' curves, with a speed less than the speed of light. These curves must fall within a cone defined by light-like curves. In our definition above: '''world lines are time-like curves in spacetime'''.
* '''space-like''' curves falling outside the light cone. Such curves may describe, for example, the length of a physical object. The circumference of a cylinder and the length of a rod are space-like curves.

At a given event on a world line, spacetime ([[Minkowski space]]) is divided into three parts.

* The '''future''' of the given event is formed by all events that can be reached through time-like curves lying within the future light cone.
* The '''past''' of the given event is formed by all events that can influence the event (that is, which can be connected by world lines within the past [[light cone]] to the given event).
* The '''lightcone''' at the given event is formed by all events that can be connected through light rays with the event. When we observe the sky at night, we basically see only the past [[light cone]] within the entire spacetime.
* '''Elsewhere''' is the region between the two light cones. Points in an observer's '''elsewhere''' are inaccessible to her/him; only points in the past can send signals to the observer.  In ordinary laboratory experience, using common units and methods of measurement, it may seem that we look at the present, but in fact there is always a delay time for light to propagate.  For example, we see the [[Sun]] as it was about 8 minutes ago, not as it is "right now".  Unlike the '''present''' in Galilean/Newtonian theory, the '''elsewhere''' is thick; it is not a 3-dimensional volume but is instead a 4-dimensional spacetime region.
** Included in "elsewhere" is the '''simultaneous hyperplane''', which is defined for a given observer by a [[space]] which is [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to her/his world line. It is really three-dimensional, though it would be a 2-plane in the diagram because we had to throw away one dimension to make an intelligible picture. Although the light cones are the same for all observers at a given spacetime event, different observers, with differing velocities but coincident at the event (point) in the spacetime, have world lines that cross each other at an angle determined by their relative velocities, and thus they have different simultaneous hyperplanes.
** The '''present''' often means the single spacetime event being considered.

===Simultaneous hyperplane===
Since a world line &lt;math&gt; w(\tau) \isin R^4&lt;/math&gt; determines a velocity 4-vector &lt;math&gt; v = \frac {dw}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt; that is time-like, the Minkowski form &lt;math&gt; \eta(v,x)&lt;/math&gt; determines a linear function &lt;math&gt; R^4 \rarr R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;  x \mapsto \eta( v , x ) .&lt;/math&gt; Let  ''N'' be the [[kernel (linear algebra)|null space]] of this linear functional. Then ''N'' is called the '''simultaneous hyperplane''' with respect to ''v''. The [[relativity of simultaneity]] is a statement that ''N'' depends on ''v''. Indeed, ''N'' is the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''v'' with respect to &amp;eta;. 
When two world lines ''u'' and ''w'' are related by &lt;math&gt; \frac {du}{d\tau} = \frac {dw}{d\tau}, &lt;/math&gt; then they share the same simultaneous hyperplane. This hyperplane exists mathematically, but physical relations in relativity involve the movement of information by light. For instance, the traditional electro-static force described by [[Coulomb's law]] may be pictured in a simultaneous hyperplane, but relativistic relations of charge and force involve [[retarded potential]]s.

==World lines in general relativity==
The use of world lines in [[general relativity]] is basically the same as in special relativity, with the difference that [[spacetime]] can be [[curvature|curved]]. A [[metric tensor|metric]] exists and its dynamics are determined by the [[Einstein field equations]] and are dependent on the mass-energy distribution in spacetime. Again the metric defines [[lightlike]] (null), [[spacelike]] and [[timelike]] curves.  Also, in general relativity, world lines are [[timelike]] curves in spacetime, where [[timelike]] curves fall within the lightcone. However, a lightcone is not necessarily inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. However, this is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system, and reflects the coordinate freedom ([[diffeomorphism invariance]]) of general relativity. Any [[timelike]] curve admits a [[Proper frame|comoving observer]] whose "time axis" corresponds to that curve, and, since no observer is privileged, we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. See also for example [[Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates]].

World lines of free-falling particles or objects (such as planets around the Sun or an astronaut in space) are called [[geodesic]]s.

==World lines in literature==
In 1884 [[C. H. Hinton]] wrote an essay "What is the fourth dimension ?" which he published as a [[scientific romance]]. He wrote
:Why, then, should not the four-dimensional beings be ourselves, and our successive states the passing of them through the three-dimensional space to which our consciousness is confined.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. H. Hinton]] (1884) [https://archive.org/stream/scientificroman01hintgoog#page/n24/mode/2up What is the fourth dimension], ''Scientific Romances'', link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular description of human world lines was given by [[J. C. Fields]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in the early days of relativity. As described by Toronto lawyer Norman Robertson:
:I remember [Fields] lecturing at one of the Saturday evening lectures at the [[Royal Canadian Institute]]. It was advertised to be a "Mathematical Fantasy"—and it was! The substance of the exercise was as follows: He postulated that, commencing with his birth, every human being had some kind of spiritual aura with a long filament or thread attached, that travelled behind him throughout his life. He then proceeded in imagination to describe the complicated entanglement every individual became involved in his relationship to other individuals, comparing the simple entanglements of youth to those complicated knots that develop in later life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson]] (1979) ''The Mathematics Department in the University of Toronto'', p. 19, [[University of Toronto Press]] {{ISBN|0-7727-1600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they oversimplify world lines, which traverse four-dimensional spacetime, into one-dimensional timelines, almost all purported science-fiction stories about [[time travel]] are actually wishful fantasy stories. Some device or superpowered person is generally portrayed as departing from one point in time, and with little or no subjective lag, arriving at some other point in time—but at the same literally geographic point in space, typically inside a workshop or near some historic site. However, in reality the planet, its solar system, and its galaxy would all be at vastly different spatial positions on arrival. Thus, the time travel mechanism would also have to provide instantaneous teleportation, with infinitely accurate and simultaneous adjustment of final 3D location, linear momentum, and angular momentum.

Author [[Oliver Franklin]] published a [[science fiction]] work in 2008 entitled ''World Lines'' in which he related a simplified explanation of the hypothesis for laymen.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Lines |author=Oliver Franklin |isbn=1-906557-00-4 |year=2008 |publisher=Epic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short story ''[[Life-Line]]'', author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] describes the world line of a person:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Technovelgy: Chronovitameter |url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1851 |accessdate= 8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:He stepped up to one of the reporters. "Suppose we take you as an example. Your name is Rogers, is it not? Very well, Rogers, you are a space-time event having duration four ways. You are not quite six feet tall, you are about twenty inches wide and perhaps ten inches thick. In time, there stretches behind you more of this space-time event, reaching to perhaps nineteen-sixteen, of which we see a cross-section here at right angles to the time axis, and as thick as the present. At the far end is a baby, smelling of sour milk and drooling its breakfast on its bib. At the other end lies, perhaps, an old man someplace in the nineteen-eighties.

:"Imagine this space-time event that we call Rogers as a long pink worm, continuous through the years, one end in his mother's womb, and the other at the grave..."

Heinlein's ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' uses the term, as does [[James Blish]]'s ''[[The Quincunx of Time]]'' (expanded from "Beep").

A [[visual novel]] named [[Steins;Gate]], produced by [[5pb.]], tells a story based on the shifting of world lines.  The "[[Science Adventure]]" series by the same company also utilized the concept.

[[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel [[Anathem]] involves a long discussion of worldlines over dinner in the midst of a philosophical debate between [[Platonic realism]] and [[nominalism]].

Absolute Choice depicts different world lines as a sub-plot and setting device.

The '''Zero one or infinity (ZOI) rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] in [[software design]] proposed{{when|date=June 2017}} by early [[computing]] pioneer [[Willem van der Poel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WillemLouisVanDerPoel&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that arbitrary limits on the number of instances of a particular entity{{technical statement|date=June 2017}} should not be allowed. Specifically, an entity should either be forbidden entirely, only one should be allowed, or any number of them should be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zero-One-Infinity-Rule.html | title = Zero-One-Infinity Rule | work = [[Jargon File]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although various factors outside that particular [[software]] could limit this number in practice, it should not be the software itself that puts a hard limit on the number of instances of the entity.

'''''"Allow none of foo, one of foo, or any number of foo."'''
''

Examples of this rule may be found in the structure of many [[file system]]s' directories (also known as folders): 
* 0 – The topmost directory has zero [[parent directories]]; that is, there is no directory that contains the topmost directory.  
* 1 – Each subdirectory has exactly one parent directory (not including shortcuts to the directory's location; while such files may have similar icons to the icons of the destination directories, they are not directories at all).  
* [[Infinity|∞ (infinity)]] – Each directory, whether the topmost directory or any of its subdirectories, according to the file system's rules, may contain any number of files or subdirectories. Practical limits to this number are caused by other factors, such as space available on [[storage media]] and how well the computer's [[operating system]] is maintained.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
Note that violations of this rule of thumb do exist: for example, some file systems impose a limit of 65,536 (i.e. 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) files to a directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm| title = NTFS vs. FAT vs exFAT | work = NTFS.com | accessdate = 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
