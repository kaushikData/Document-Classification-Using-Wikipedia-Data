In the [[Book of Genesis]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], chapters one through five, there are two [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narratives]] with two distinct perspectives. In the first, Adam and Eve are not mentioned (at least not mentioned by name). Instead, God created humankind in [[image of God|God's image]] and instructed them to multiply and to be [[Stewardship (theology)|stewards]] over everything else that God had made. In the second narrative, God fashions [[Adam]] from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam is told that he can eat freely of all the trees in the garden, except for a [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Subsequently, [[Eve]] is created from one of Adam's ribs to be Adam's companion. They are innocent and unembarrassed about their nakedness. However, a [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] deceives Eve into eating fruit from the forbidden tree, and she gives some of the fruit to Adam. These acts give them additional knowledge, but it gives them the ability to conjure negative and destructive concepts such as [[shame]] and [[evil]]. God later curses the serpent and the ground. God prophetically tells the woman and the man what will be the consequences of their sin of disobeying God. Then he banishes them from the Garden of Eden.

The story underwent extensive elaboration in later Abrahamic traditions, and it has been extensively analyzed by modern biblical scholars. Interpretations and beliefs regarding Adam and Eve and the story revolving around them vary across religions and sects; for example, the Islamic version of the story holds that Adam and Eve were ''equally'' responsible for their sins of [[hubris]], instead of Eve being the first one to be unfaithful. The story of Adam and Eve is often depicted in art, and it has had an important influence in literature and poetry. The story of the fall of Adam is often understood to be an allegory.

There is no physical evidence that Adam and Eve ever existed, and their literal existence is incompatible with [[human evolutionary genetics]].

== Hebrew Bible narrative  ==
[[File:The Creation of Adam.jpg|500px|thumb|right|''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' depicted in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]]]]
Adam and Eve are figures from the [[Primeval history|Primeval History]] (Genesis 1 to 11), the Bible's [[myth]]ic history of the first years of [[Chronology of the Bible|the world's existence]].{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=ix}} The History tells how God creates the world and all its beings and places the first man and woman (Adam and Eve) in his [[Garden of Eden]], how the first couple are expelled from God's presence, of the first murder which follows, and God's decision to destroy the world and save only the righteous Noah and his sons; a new humanity then descends from these sons and spreads throughout the world. Although the new world is as sinful as the old, God has resolved never again to destroy the world by flood, and the History ends with Terah, the father of Abraham, from whom will descend God's chosen people, the [[Israelites]].{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=1}}

===Creation narrative===
{{main|Genesis creation narrative}}
Adam and Eve are the Bible's first man and first woman.{{sfn|Hearne|1990|p=9}}{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} Adam's name appears first in Genesis 1 with a collective sense, as "mankind"; subsequently in Genesis 2-3 it carries the definite article ''ha'', equivalent to English "the", indicating that this is "the man".{{sfn|Hearne|1990|p=9}} In these chapters God fashions "the man" (''ha adam'') from earth (''adamah''), breathes life into his nostrils, and makes him a caretaker over creation.{{sfn|Hearne|1990|p=9}} God next creates for the man an ''ezer kenegdo'', a "helper corresponding to him", from his side or rib.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} She is called ''ishsha'', "woman", because, the text says, she is formed from ''ish'', "man".{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} The man receives her with joy, and the reader is told that from this moment a man will leave his parents to "cling" to a woman, the two becoming one flesh.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}}

===Eden narrative (the Fall)===
The first man and woman are in God's Garden of Eden, where all creation is vegetarian and there is no violence. They are permitted to eat of all the trees except one, the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], the woman is tempted by a talking serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, and gives some to the man, who eats also.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} (Contrary to popular myth she does not beguile the man, who appears to have been present at the encounter with the serpent).{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} God curses all three, the man to a lifetime of hard labour followed by death, the woman to the pain of childbirth and to subordination to her husband, and the serpent to go on his belly and suffer the enmity of both man and woman.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} God then clothes the nakedness of the man and woman, who have become god-like in knowing good and evil, then banishes them from the garden lest they eat the fruit of a second tree, the [[tree of life]], unmentioned up to this point, and live forever.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=27-28}}

===The Generations of Adam===
Genesis 4 introduces the humans in their life outside God's garden. The chapter deals with the birth of Adam's sons Cain and Abel and the story of the first murder, followed by the birth of a third son, Seth. Genesis 5, the Book of the Generations of Adam, lists the descendants of Adam from Seth to Noah with their ages at the birth of their first sons (except Adam himself, for whom his age at the birth of Seth, his third son, is given) and their ages at death (Adam lives 930 years). The chapter notes that Adam had other sons and daughters after Seth, but does not name them. Adam has already named the woman Eve at the end of the Eden narrative, and in Genesis 4:25 and for the first time, he is called Adam as a personal name.

=== The Fall and expulsion from Eden ===
{{Main|Fall of man}}

The Adam and Eve story continues in Genesis 3 with the "[[Fall of man|expulsion from Eden]]" narrative. A [[form criticism|form analysis]] of Genesis 3 reveals that this portion of the story can be characterized as a [[parable]] or "wisdom tale" in the [[wisdom tradition]]. The poetic addresses of the chapter belong to a speculative type of wisdom that questions the [[paradox]]es and harsh realities of life. This characterization is determined by the narrative's format, [[Setting (narrative)|setting]]s, and the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. The form of Genesis 3 is also shaped by its vocabulary, making use of various [[pun]]s and [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Meyers, Patrick|title=The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of [[David Noel Freedman]]|year=1983|publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]]|isbn=9780931464195|pages=343–344|editor=[[Carol L. Meyers]] |editor2=Michael Patrick O'Connor |editor3=[[David Noel Freedman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expulsion from Eden narrative begins with a dialogue between the woman and a serpent,&lt;ref name="Mathews, 226"&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:1|HE}} as an animal that was more crafty than any other animal made by God, although Genesis does not identify the serpent with [[Satan]].&lt;ref name=Levenson&gt;{{cite book

|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} The woman is willing to talk to the serpent and respond to the creature's cynicism by repeating God's prohibition against eating fruit from the tree of knowledge ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:17|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman is lured into dialogue on the serpent's terms which directly disputes God's command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serpent assures the woman that God will not let her die if she ate the fruit, and, furthermore, that if she ate the fruit, her "eyes would be opened" and she would "be like God, knowing good and evil" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:5|HE}}). The woman sees that the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a delight to the eye and that it would be desirable to acquire wisdom by eating the fruit. The woman eats the fruit and gives some to the man ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:6|HE}}). With this the man and woman recognize their own nakedness, and they make loincloths of fig leaves ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:7|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next narrative dialogue, God questions the man and the woman ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:8–13|HE}}),&lt;ref name="Mathews, 226"/&gt; and God initiates a dialogue by calling out to the man with a rhetorical question designed to consider his wrongdoing. The man explains that he hid in the garden out of fear because he realized his own nakedness ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:10|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by two more rhetorical questions designed to show awareness of a defiance of God's command. The man then points to the woman as the real offender, and he implies that God is responsible for the tragedy because the woman was given to him by God ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:12|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Mathews, 241"&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; God challenges the woman to explain herself, and she shifts the blame to the serpent ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:13|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine pronouncement of three judgments are then laid against all the culprits, {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:14–19|HE}}.&lt;ref name="Mathews, 226"/&gt; A judgement oracle and the nature of the crime is first laid upon the serpent, then the woman, and, finally, the man. On the serpent, God places a divine [[curse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman receives penalties that impact her in two primary roles: she shall experience pangs during childbearing, pain during childbirth, and while she shall desire her husband, he will rule over her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man's penalty results in God cursing the ground from which he came, and the man then receives a death oracle, although the man has not been described, in the text, as immortal.&lt;ref name=Levenson /&gt;{{rp|18;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abruptly, in the flow of text, in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:20|HE}}, the man names the woman "Eve" (Heb. ''hawwah''), "because she was the [[Hebat|mother of all living]]". God makes skin garments for Adam and Eve ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:20|HE}}).

The [[chiasmus]] structure of the death oracle given to Adam in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:19|HE}}, is a link between man's creation from "dust" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|HE}}) to the "return" of his beginnings:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  you return, to the ground, since from it you were taken, for dust you are, and to dust, you will return."

The garden account ends with an intradivine monologue, determining the couple's expulsion, and the execution of that deliberation ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:22–24|HE}}}.&lt;ref name="Mathews, 226"/&gt; The reason given for the expulsion was to prevent the man from eating from the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] and becoming immortal: "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever" ({{bibleverse|Genesis|3:22|HE}}).&lt;ref name=Levenson /&gt;{{rp|18;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Addis|first=Edward|title=The Documents of the Hexateuch, Volume 1|year=1893|publisher=Putnam|pages=4–7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3SpVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bibliogroup:%22The+Documents+of+the+Hexateuch%22#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; God exiles Adam and Eve from the Garden and installs [[cherub]]s (supernatural beings that provide protection) and the "ever-turning sword" to guard the entrance ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:24|HE}}).&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinstein|first=Brian|title=54 Torah Talks: From Layperson to Layperson|year=2010|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781440192555|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offspring ===
{{Main|Genealogies of Genesis}}
Genesis 4 tells of the birth of [[Cain and Abel]], Adam and Eve's first children, while Genesis 5 gives Adam's genealogy past that. Adam and Eve are listed as having three children, Cain, Abel and [[Seth]], then "other sons and daughters", {{Bibleverse|Genesis|5:4|HE}}. According to the [[Book of Jubilees]] (which is usually not considered canonical), Cain married his sister [[Awan (religious figure)|Awan]], a daughter of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;Betsy Halpern Amaru (1999). ''The Empowerment of Women in the Book of Jubilees,'' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
The Primeval History forms the opening chapters of the [[Torah]], the five books making up the history of the origins of Israel. This achieved something like its current form in the 5th century BCE,{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=5}} but Genesis 1-11 shows little relationship to the rest of the Bible:{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301 and fn.35}} for example, the names of its characters and its geography - Adam (man) and Eve (life), the Land of Nod ("Wandering"), and so on - are symbolic rather than real,{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} and almost none of the persons, places and stories mentioned in it are ever met anywhere else.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} This has led scholars to suppose that the History forms a late composition attached to Genesis and the Pentateuch to serve as an introduction.{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301}} Just how late is a subject for debate: at one extreme are those who see it as a product of the Hellenistic period, in which case it cannot be earlier than the first decades of the 4th century BCE;{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=240-241}} on the other hand the  Yahwist source has been dated by some scholars, notably [[John Van Seters]], to the exilic pre-Persian period (the 6th century BCE) precisely because the Primeval History contains so much Babylonian influence in the form of myth.{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=6}}&lt;ref group="Note" name="Seters"&gt;See John Van Seters, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zRl8aj_KiM4C&amp;q=80#v=snippet&amp;q=80 Prologue to History: The Yahwist as Historian in Genesis]'' (1992), pp.80, 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt; The Primeval History draws on two distinct "sources", the [[Priestly source]] and what is sometimes called the [[Yahwist]] source and sometimes simply the "non-Priestly"; for the purpose of discussing Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis the terms "non-Priestly" and "Yahwist" can be regarded as interchangeable.{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}}

Certain concepts, such as the serpent being identified as [[Satan]], Eve being a sexual temptation, or Adam's first wife being [[Lilith]], come from literary works found in various [[Jewish apocrypha]], but they are not found anywhere in the [[Book of Genesis]] or the [[Torah]] itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Writings dealing with these subjects are [[extant literature]] in Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Armenian, and Arabic, extending back to ancient Jewish thought. The concepts are not part of [[Rabbinic Judaism]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} but they did influence Christian theology, and this marks a radical split between the two religions. Some of the oldest Jewish portions of apocrypha are called ''Primary Adam Literature'' where some works became Christianized. Examples of Christianized works are ''[[Life of Adam and Eve]]'', ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]''&lt;ref&gt;First translated by [[August Dillmann]] (''Das christl. Adambuch des Morgenlandes'', 1853), and the Ethiopic book first edited by Trump (''Abh. d. Münch. Akad.'' xv., 1870–1881).&lt;/ref&gt; and an original Syriac work entitled ''[[Cave of Treasures]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Die Schatzhöhle'' translated by [[Carl Bezold]] from three Syriac MSS (1883), edited in Syriac (1888).&lt;/ref&gt; which has close affinities to the ''Conflict'' as noted by [[August Dillmann]].

Some modern scholars, such as [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]], [[Moshe Greenberg]], and [[Michael Fishbane]], see the story of Adam and Eve as a representation of a rise to moral agency, at least as much as, if not more than the story of a fall from grace. [[Carol Meyers]] and Bruce Naidoff view the tale as an explanation of agricultural conditions in the highlands of [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{For|the Jewish [[Weekly Torah portion]]|Bereshit (parsha)#Third reading|Bereshit (parsha)#Fourth reading}}
It was also recognized in [[ancient Judaism]], that there are two distinct accounts for the creation of man. The first account says "male and female [God] created them", implying simultaneous creation, whereas the second account states that God created Eve subsequent to the creation of Adam. The [[Midrash Rabbah]] – Genesis VIII:1 reconciled the two by stating that Genesis one, "male and female He created them", indicates that God originally created Adam as a [[hermaphrodite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howard Schwartz |title=Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism: The Mythology of Judaism|date=September 2004|isbn=0195086791|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/?id=60iVk1p8Y9IC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=indicates%20that%20God%20originally%20created%20Adam%20as%20a%20hermaphrodite&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage|accessdate=27 December 2014|quote="The myth of Adam the Hermaphrodite grows out of three biblical verses"}}&lt;/ref&gt; bodily and spiritually both male and female, before creating the separate beings of Adam and Eve. Other rabbis suggested that Eve and the woman of the first account were two separate individuals, the first being identified as [[Lilith]], a figure elsewhere described as a night demon.

According to traditional Jewish belief, Adam and Eve are buried in the [[Cave of Machpelah]], in [[Hebron]].

In [[Reform Judaism]], [[Harry Orlinsky]] analyzes the Hebrew word ''nefesh'' in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|HE}} where "God breathes into the man's nostrils and he becomes ''[[Nephesh|nefesh hayya]]''." Orlinsky argues that the earlier translation of the phrase "living soul" is incorrect. He points out that "nefesh" signifies something like the English word "being", in the sense of a corporeal body capable of life; the concept of a "[[soul]]" in the modern sense, did not exist in Hebrew thought until around the 2nd century B.C., when the idea of a bodily resurrection gained popularity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s Notes to the NJPS Torah&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early [[Fathers of the Church|fathers of the Christian church]] held Eve responsible for the [[Fall of man]] and all subsequent women to be the first sinners because Eve tempted Adam to commit the taboo. "You are the devil's gateway" [[Tertullian]] told his female readers, and went on to explain that they were responsible for the death of Christ: "On account of your [[Desertion|desert]] [i.e., punishment for sin, that is, death], even the Son of God had to die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf04/anf04-06.htm |title=Tertullian, "De Cultu Feminarum", Book I Chapter I, '&amp;#39;Modesty in Apparel Becoming to Women in Memory of the Introduction of Sin Through a Woman'&amp;#39; (in "The Ante-Nicene Fathers") |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1486, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] Kramer and Sprengler used similar tracts in ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' ("Hammer of Witches") to justify the persecution of "witches".

Medieval Christian art often depicted the Edenic Serpent as a woman (often identified as [[Lilith]]), thus both emphasizing the serpent's seductiveness as well as its relationship to Eve. Several early [[Church Fathers]], including [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], interpreted the Hebrew "Heva" as not only the name of Eve, but in its aspirated form as "female serpent."

Based on the Christian doctrine of the [[Fall of man]], came the doctrine of [[original sin]]. [[St Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), working with a Latin translation of the [[Epistle to the Romans]], interpreted the [[Apostle Paul]] as having said that Adam's sin was hereditary: "Death passed upon [i.e., spread to] all men because of Adam, [in whom] all sinned", {{Bibleref2|Romans|5:12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible|origyear=1991|year=2006|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] Limited|isbn=9780141925752|pages=15–27|author-link=Robin Lane Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original sin became a concept that man is born into a condition of sinfulness and must await redemption. This doctrine became a cornerstone of Western Christian theological tradition, however, not shared by Judaism or the Orthodox churches.

Over the centuries, a system of unique Christian beliefs had developed from these doctrines. [[Baptism]] became understood as a washing away of the stain of hereditary sin in many churches, although its original symbolism was apparently rebirth. Additionally, the serpent that tempted Eve was interpreted to have been [[Satan]], or that Satan was using a serpent as a [[spokesperson|mouthpiece]], although there is no mention of this identification in the Torah and it is not held in Judaism.

Conservative Protestants typically interpret {{Bibleref2|Genesis|3}} as defining humanity's original parents as Adam and Eve who disobeyed God's prime directive that they were not to eat "the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (NIV). When they disobeyed, they committed a major transgression against God and were immediately punished, which led to "[[Fall of man|the fall]]" of humanity. Thus, sin and death entered the universe for the first time. Adam and Eve were ejected from the Garden of Eden, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, B.A. "Salvation: Teachings by Southern Baptists and other conservative Protestant denominations". Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, 2010.  Accessed 2 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gnostic traditions ===
{{See also|Gnostics}}
[[Gnostic Christianity]] discussed Adam and Eve in two known surviving texts, namely the "[[Apocalypse of Adam]]" found in the [[Nag Hammadi]] documents and the "[[Testament of Adam]]". The creation of Adam as [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|Protoanthropos]], the original man, is the focal concept of these writings.

Another Gnostic tradition held that Adam and Eve were created to help defeat Satan. The serpent, instead of being identified with Satan, is seen as a hero by the [[Ophites]]. Still other Gnostics believed that Satan's fall, however, came after the creation of humanity. As in Islamic tradition, this story says that Satan refused to bow to Adam due to pride. Satan said that Adam was inferior to him as he was made of fire, whereas Adam was made of clay. This refusal led to the [[fallen angel|fall of Satan]] recorded in works such as the [[Book of Enoch]].

=== Islam ===
{{main|Biblical narratives and the Quran#Adam and Eve (آدم Adam and حواء Hawwaa)}}
[[File:Islamic Adam &amp; Eve.jpg|thumb|right|Painting from Manafi al-Hayawan (The Useful Animals), depicting Adam and Eve. From [[Maragheh]] in Iran, 1294–99]]
In [[Islam]], Adam ({{transl|ar|ALA|Ādam}}; {{lang-ar|آدم}}), whose role is being the father of [[human]]ity, is looked upon by [[Muslim]]s with reverence. Eve ({{transl|ar|ALA|Ḥawwāʼ}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''' حواء ''') is the "mother of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', Wheeler, "Adam and Eve"&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of Adam and Eve is referred to in the {{transl|ar|ALA|Qurʼān}}, although different Qurʼanic interpreters give different views on the actual creation story (Qurʼan, Surat al-Nisaʼ, verse 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|1|s=ns}}:''O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [[Eve (Islam)|Hawwa (Eve)]], and from them both He created many men and women;''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tafsir Al-Qummi|al-Qummi's]] [[tafsir]] on the [[Garden of Eden]], such place was not entirely earthly. According to the {{transl|ar|ALA|Qurʼān}}, both Adam and Eve ate the [[Forbidden fruit#Islamic tradition|forbidden fruit]] in a ''Heavenly'' Eden (''see also'' [[Jannah]]). As a result, they were both sent down to Earth as God's representatives. Each person was sent to a mountain peak: Adam on [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|al-Safa]], and Eve on [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|al-Marwah]]. In this Islamic tradition, Adam wept 40 days until he repented, after which God sent down the [[Black Stone]], teaching him the [[Hajj]]. According to a prophetic [[hadith]], Adam and Eve reunited in the plain of ʻArafat, near [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNQ_3aRdHPYC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=adam+and+eve+mecca#v=onepage&amp;q=adam%20and%20eve%20mecca |title=Mecca and Eden: Ritual, Relics, and Territory in Islam – Brannon M.

There is also a legend of a younger son, named Rocail, who created a palace and sepulcher containing autonomous statues that lived out the lives of men so realistically they were mistaken for having souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "original sin" does not exist in [[Islam]], because according to Islam [[Adam and Eve#Islamic tradition|Adam and Eve]] were forgiven by God. When God orders the angels to bow to Adam, [[Devil (Islam)|''{{transl|ar|ALA|Iblīs}}'']] questioned, "Why should I bow to man? I am made of pure fire and he is made of soil."&lt;ref name="Cite quran|7|12|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[liberal movements within Islam]] have viewed God's commanding the angels to bow before Adam as an exaltation of humanity, and as a means of supporting [[human rights]]; others view it as an act of showing Adam that the biggest enemy of humans on earth will be their ego.&lt;ref&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], ''Mizan''. Lahore: Dar al-Ishraq, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the Adam and Eve narrative is seen as symbolic. In ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] rejects a literal reading and states that the story contains "divine mysteries and universal meanings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Sours, Michael |year = 2001 |title = The Tablet of the Holy Mariner: An Illustrated Guide to Baha'u'llah's Mystical Work in the Sufi Tradition |publisher = Kalimát Press |location = Los Angeles |isbn = 1-890688-19-3  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oav14cyFoykC |pages = 86

== Historicity ==
{{main|Historicity of the Bible}}
While a traditional view was that the Book of Genesis was authored by [[Moses]] and has been considered historical and metaphorical, modern scholars consider the Genesis creation narrative as one of various ancient [[origin myth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Van Seters|first=John|chapter=The Pentateuch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues#v=onepage|editor=Steven L.

With scientific developments in paleontology, geology, biology and other disciplines, it was discovered that humans, and all other living things, [[evidence of common descent|share a common ancestor]] and [[evolution|evolved]] through natural processes, with earlier life forms going back to billions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kampourakis|first=Kostas|year=2014|title=Understanding Evolution|location=Cambridge; New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03491-4|lccn=2013034917|oclc=855585457|pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schopf|first1=J.

In biology the [[most recent common ancestor]]s, when traced back using the [[Y-chromosome]] for the male lineage and [[mitochondrial DNA]] for the female lineage, are commonly called the [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] and [[Mitochondrial Eve]], respectively.

== Arts and literature ==
[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', a famous 17th-century [[epic poem]] written in [[blank verse]], explores and elaborates upon the story of Adam and Eve in great detail. As opposed to the Biblical Adam, Milton's Adam is given a glimpse of the future of mankind, by the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], before he has to leave Paradise.

American painter [[Thomas Cole]] painted ''The Garden of Eden'' (1828), with lavish detail of the first couple living amid waterfalls, vivid plants, and attractive deer.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibit at the [[Amon Carter Museum]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]] wrote humorous and satirical diaries for Adam and Eve in both [[Eve's Diary]] (1906) and ''The Private Life of Adam and Eve'' (1931), posthumously published.

[[C. L. Moore]]'s 1940 story ''Fruit of Knowledge'' is a re-telling of the [[Fall of Man]] as a [[love triangle]] between [[Lilith]], Adam and Eve – with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.

In [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s musical ''[[Children of Eden]]'', "Father" (God) creates Adam and Eve at the same time and considers them His children. They even assist Him in naming the animals. When Eve is tempted by the serpent and eats the forbidden fruit, Father makes Adam choose between Him and Eden, or Eve. Adam chooses Eve and eats the fruit, causing Father to banish them into the wilderness and destroying the Tree of Knowledge, from which Adam carves a staff. Eve gives birth to Cain and Abel, and Adam forbids his children from going beyond the waterfall in hopes Father will forgive them and bring them back to Eden. When Cain and Abel grow up, Cain breaks his promise and goes beyond the waterfall, finding the giant stones made by other humans, which he brings the family to see, and Adam reveals his discovery from the past: during their infancy, he discovered these humans, but had kept it secret. He tries to forbid Cain from seeking them out, which causes Cain to become enraged and he tries to attack Adam, but instead turns his rage to Abel when he tries to stop him and kills him. Later, when an elderly Eve tries to speak to Father, she tells how Adam continually looked for Cain, and after many years, he dies and is buried underneath the waterfall. Eve also gave birth to Seth, which expanded hers and Adam's generations. Finally, Father speaks to her to bring her home. Before she dies, she gives her blessings to all her future generations, and passes Adam's staff to Seth. Father embraces Eve and she also reunited with Adam and Abel. Smaller casts of the American version usually have the actors cast as Adam and Eve double as Noah and Mama Noah.

In Ray Nelson's novel ''Blake's Progress'' the poet William Blake and his wife Kate travel to the end of time where the demonic Urizen offers them his own re-interpretation of the Biblical story: "In this painting you see Adam and Eve listening to the wisdom of their good friend and adviser, the serpent. One might even say he was their Savior. He gave them freedom, and he would have given them eternal life if he'd been allowed to."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[John William "Uncle Jack" Dey]] painted "Adam and Eve Leave Eden" (1973), using stripes and dabs of pure color to evoke Eden's lush surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam and Eve Leave Eden|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=6786|work=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[C.S.Lewis]]' science fiction novel "[[Perelandra]]", the story of Adam and Eve is re-enacted on the Planet [[Venus]] - but with a different ending. A green-skinned pair, who are destined to be the ancestors of Venusian humanity, are living in naked innocence on wonderful floating islands which are the Venusian Eden; a  demonically-possessed Earth scientist arrives in a spaceship, acting the part of the snake and trying to tempt the Venusian Eve into disobeying God; but the protagonist, Cambridge scholar Ransom, succeeds in thwarting him - so that Venusian humanity will have a glorious future, free of [[Original Sin]].

'''Antun Barac''' ([[Kamenjak]], 20 August 1894&amp;nbsp;– [[Zagreb]], 1 November 1955), was a [[Croats|Croatian]] historian.

==Biography==
Barac graduated at the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of philosophy]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] in 1917, and received his Ph.D. as a high school professor on [[Sušak, Rijeka|Sušak]] in 1918, with the thesis on [[Vladimir Nazor]]'s poetry. Since 1930 he is a regular professor at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. He was accepted as a regular member of [[JAZU]] in 1947.

He edited numerous scientific editions and anthologies, and has written high school handbooks together with Nazor. He served as a prorector of the University of Zagreb after his rectorship mandate expired (1950–1951). He was a significant contributor to modern Croatian [[literary theory]], especially in the position of [[Croatian literature]] in the European context. He published numerous monographies on top Croatian artists such as [[Vladimir Nazor|Nazor]], [[August Šenoa|Šenoa]], [[Vladimir Vidrić|Vidrić]] or [[Ivan Mažuranić|Mažuranić]], a number of critic-essayist writings on lesser known writers, as well as great syntheses on Croatian literary criticism of the 19th century, and the unfinished history of Croatian literature from [[Croatian National Revival]] to the time of creation of [[Yugoslavia]].

A square in [[Novi Zagreb]] is named after him.

==Literary criticism==
Barac's valorisation of literature is based on the two tenets: the literature has to be an expression of a man in his totality, as an individual and social being, deeply covering the basic aspects of life. His other tenet is that the great art is born only out of the great pain.

His studies were permeated by a specific national criterion, holding that every little literature to a more or less extent reflects the social life of its people, as opposed to the large national literature. This view is reflected in his well-known maxim on the greatness of the small.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">The '''Association for Manitoba Archives''' (AMA) is a voluntary organization dedicated to the preservation of the documentary heritage of the people and institutions of the province of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], by improving the administration, effectiveness and efficiency of the province's archival systems. The membership is made up primarily of archivists and archival institutions, but anyone who is interested in supporting the mandate of the organization can join. 

The AMA is an amalgamation of two organizations: the Association of Manitoba Archivists, founded in 1980, and the Manitoba Council of Archives, founded in 1986.  The Association of Manitoba Archivists provided a seasonal program of meetings on various archival subjects. It created a basic training program, implemented a field advisory service for new or emerging archives, published a newsletter and sponsored a number of outreach programs and events to promote the profession and archives.  The Manitoba Council of Archives was created specifically to distribute grants from the newly formed Canadian Council of Archives.  In support of the grant program, the Manitoba Council undertook a provincial archival needs assessment study entitled "The Past is Present" (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Haglund, Diane, Coordinator. "The Past is Present: A Needs Assessment and Planning Study for Archives in Manitoba," Manitoba Council of Archives, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of institutional standards and accreditation, the so-called Stunden Report, followed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Plan2000"&gt;"Plan 2000: The Manitoba Archival Community in the 1990s," the Association of Manitoba Archivists and the Manitoba Council of Archives, March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A joint committee was created to look at the existence of the two organizations and published a report in 1991. "Plan 2000: The Manitoba Archival Community in the 1990s" stated that the archival community in Manitoba was not large enough to support two separate organizations dedicated to archives and that a single organization should be established.  The two organizations merged shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Plan2000" /&gt;

Today the AMA provides a number of services, including: support for its members; advisory services for both members and non-members; educational and training opportunities; advocacy to increase the awareness of archives in the wider community; publications; virtual and real exhibitions; grants and awards.  Of particular interest to the broader community is the [[Manitoba Day Award]], which recognizes those users of archives who have completed an original work of excellence which contributes to the understanding and celebration of Manitoba history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm AMA Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412024436/http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm |date=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boris M. Gombač''' (born 15 September 1945) is a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[historian]] from [[Italy]].

He was born to a middle class Slovene family in [[Trieste]], Italy. He studied history at the [[University of Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]] (then part of [[former Yugoslavia]]). Between 1975 and 1984, he worked as a researcher at the Institute for the History of Workers' Movement in [[Ljubljana]], now known as the [[Institute of Contemporary History, Ljubljana|Institute of Contemporary History]]. Between 1984 and 1994, he served as director of the [[National Museum of Slovenia]]. Since 1995, he is a researcher at the Scientific Research Centre of the [[University of Primorska]].

During the difficult process of Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia, he was active in civil society organizations that worked for the protection and eventual return of Slovenian conscripts drafted in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]. 

He wrote about the history of Trieste and the [[Julian March]] in the 19th and 20th century, especially the history of the workers' movement and the Italian historiography of Trieste. He was member of the [[Slovenian-Italian Cultural-Historical Commission]], established by the governments of the two countries to shed light on the historical relationship between the two peoples from 1880 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm|title=Slovene-Italian Relations 1880-1956 - Report of the Slovene-Italian historical and cultural commission|website=Kozina.com|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fainsislandpage35spider.png|thumb|The [[water spider]] is said to have first brought fire to the inhabitants of the earth in the basket on her back.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, J. W. ''Nineteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology,'' Part 1, 1897-98. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900. Page 242.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This article concerns itself with the '''Spiritual beliefs of the [[Cherokee]]''', [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s indigenous to the Appalachias, and today are enrolled in the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], [[Cherokee Nation]], and [[United Keetowah Band of Cherokee Indians]]. Some of these myths go by different names in different branches of the tribe, however, the actual myth remains the same.

==Creation beliefs==
The Cherokee creation belief describes the earth as a great floating island surrounded by seawater.  It hangs from the sky by cords attached at the four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal points]].  The story tells that the first earth came to be when Dâyuni'sï (Beaver's Grandchild), the little [[Water beetle]] came from Gälûñ'lätï, the sky realm, to see what was below the water.  He scurried over the surface of the water, but found no solid place to rest.  He dived to the bottom of the water and brought up some soft mud.  This mud expanded in every direction and became the earth, according to the account recorded in 1900 by the Bureau of American Ethnology.

The other animals in Gälûñ'lätï were eager to come down to the new earth, and first birds were sent to see if the mud was dry.  [[Buzzard]] was sent ahead to make preparations for the others, but the earth was still soft.  When he grew tired, his wings dipped very low and brushed the soft mud, gouging mountains and valleys in the smooth surface, and the animals were forced to wait again.  When it was finally dry they all came down.  It was dark, so they took the sun and set it in a track to run east to west, at first setting it too low and the [[crawfish|red crawfish]] was scorched. They elevated the sun several times in order to reduce its heat.

The story also tells how plants and animals acquired certain characteristics, and is related to one of their medicine rituals.  They all were told to stay awake for seven nights, but only a few animals, such as owl and panther, succeeded and they were given the power to see and prey upon the others at night. Only a few trees succeeded as well, namely cedar, pine, spruce and laurel, so the rest were forced to shed their leaves in the winter.

The first people were a brother and sister.  Once, the brother hit his sister with a fish and told her to multiply.  Following this, she gave birth to a child every seven days and soon there were too many people, so women were forced to have just one child every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sproul |first=Barbara C. |publisher=HarperOne HarperCollinsPublishers |title=Primal Myths |isbn=978-0-06-067501-1 |year=1979 |ref=harv }} pages 254-255&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Story of Corn and Medicine===
The Story of Corn and Medicine begins with the creation of the earth and animals. Earth was created out of mud that grew into a volcano. Animals began exploring the earth, and it was the Buzzard that created valleys and mountains in the Cherokee land by the flapping of his wings. After some time, the earth became habitable for the animals, once the mud of the earth had dried and the sun had been raised up for light.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

According to the Cherokee medicine ceremony, the animals and plants had to stay awake for seven nights. Only the owl, panther, and unnamed others were able to fulfill the requirements of the ceremony, so these animals were given the gift of night vision, which allowed them to hunt easily at night. Similarly, the only trees able to remain awake for the seven days were the cedar, pine, spruce, holly, laurel and oak. These trees were given the gift of staying green year-round.&lt;ref name="ParkerCitation" /&gt;

The first woman argued with the first man and left their home. The first man, helped by the sun, tried tempting her to return with blueberries and blackberries but was not successful. He finally persuaded her to return with  strawberries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Neufeld

Humans began to hunt animals and quickly grew in numbers. The population grew so rapidly that a rule was established that women can only have one child per year. Two early humans were Kanáti and Selu. Their names meant "The Lucky Hunter" and "Corn," respectively. Kanáti would hunt and bring an animal home for Selu to prepare. Kanáti and Selu had a child, and their child befriended another boy who had been created out of the blood of the slaughtered animals. The family treated this boy like one of their own, except they called him "The Wild Boy".
Kanáti consistently brought animals home when he went hunting, and one day, the boys decided to secretly follow him. They discovered that Kanáti would move a rock concealing a cave, and an animal would come out of the cave only to be killed by Kanáti. The boys secretly returned to the rock by themselves and opened the entrance to the cave. However, the boys didn't realize that when the cave was opened many different animals escaped. Kanáti saw the animals and realized what must have happened. He journeyed to the cave and sent the boys home so he could try to catch some of the escaped animals for eating. This explains why people must hunt for food now.

The boys returned to Selu, who went to get food from the storehouse. She instructed the boys to wait behind while she was gone, but they disobeyed and followed her. They discovered Selu's secret, which was that she would rub her stomach to fill baskets with corn, and she would rub her sides to fill baskets with beans. Selu knew her secret was out and made the boys one last meal. She and Kanáti then explained to the boys that the two of them would die because their secrets had been discovered. Along with Kanáti and Selu dying, the easy life the boys had become accustomed to would also die. However, if the boys dragged Selu's body seven times in a circle, and then seven times over the soil in the circle, a crop of corn would appear in the morning if the boys stayed up all night to watch. The boys did not fulfill the instructions completely, which is why corn can only grow in certain places around earth. Today, corn is still grown, but it does not come overnight.	

During the early times, the plants, animals, and people all lived together as friends, but the dramatic population growth of humans crowded the earth, leaving the animals with no room to roam. Humans also would kill the animals for meat or trample them for being in the way. As a punishment for these horrendous acts the animals created diseases to infect the humans with.

Like other creatures, the plants decided to meet, and they came to the conclusion that the animals' actions had to been too harsh and that they would provide a cure for every disease.&lt;ref name=UofGeorgia&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Corn and Medicine|url=http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/CS/CSCorn&amp;Medicine.html|website=Creation Stories from around the World|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why all kinds of plant life helps to cure many varieties of diseases. Medicine was created in order to counteract with the animals' punishments.

===The Thunder Beings===
The Cherokee believe that there is the Great Thunder and his sons, the two Thunder Boys, who live in the land of the west above the sky vault.  They dress in lightning and rainbows. The priests pray to the thunder and he visits the people to bring rain and blessings from the South.  It was believed that the thunder beings who lived close to the Earth's surface in the cliffs, mountains, and waterfalls could harm the people at times, which did happen. These other thunders are always plotting mischief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mooney |first=James |publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology |title=Myths of the Cherokee |year=1966 }} pages 257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Corn Ceremony===
[[File:Cherokee Indians ready for The Green Corn Dance, Cherokee, N. C. (5755511285).jpg|thumb|247x247px|A postcard depicting Cherokee people ready for The Green Corn Dance.]]
The thunder beings are viewed as the most powerful servants of the Apportioner (Creator Spirit), and are revered in the first dance of the [[Green Corn Ceremony]] held each year, as they are directly believed to have brought the rains for a successful [[Maize|corn]] crop.

===Medicine and Disease===

It is said that all plants, animals, beasts and people once lived in harmony with no separation between them. At this time, the animals were bigger and stronger until the humans became more powerful. When the human population increased, so did the weapons, and the animals no longer felt safe. The animals decided to hold a meeting to discuss what should be done to protect themselves.

The Bears met first and decided that they would make their own weapons like the humans, but this only led to further chaos. Next the Deer gathered to discuss their plan of action and they came to the conclusion that if a hunter was to kill a Deer, they would develop a disease. The only way to avoid this disease was to ask the Deer's spirit for forgiveness. Another requirement was that the people only kill when necessary. The council of Birds, Insects and small animals met next and they decided that humans were too cruel, therefore they concocted many diseases to infect them with.

The plants heard what the animals were planning and since they were always friendly with the humans, they vowed that for every disease made by the animals, they would create a cure. Every plant serves a purpose and the only way to find the purpose is to discover it for yourself.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;Norton, Terry L. (2016).  Cherokee Myths and Legends: Thirty Tales Retold. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland&lt;/ref&gt; When a medicine man does not know what medicine to use, the spirits of the plants instruct him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mooney |first=James |publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology |title=Myths of the Cherokee |year=1966 }} pages 250-252&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Spirit==
The Cherokee revered the [[Great Spirit]], simply referred to as Unetlanvhi, or "Creator", who presided over all things and created the Earth.&lt;ref name=LewisOrrin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Orrin|last2=Redish|first2=Laura|title=Legendary Native American Figures: Unetlanvhi (Ouga)|url=http://www.native-languages.org/morelegends/unetlanvhi.htm|website=Native Languages of the Americas|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Spirit is said to be omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. The Unetlanvhi was said to have made the earth to provide for its children. The Wahnenauhi Manuscript says that God is Unahlahnauhi, meaning "maker of all things" and Kalvlvtiahi, meaning "The one who lives above". In most myths the Great Spirit is not personified as having human characteristics or a physical human form.&lt;ref name=LewisOrrin/&gt;

==Signs, Visions, and Dreams==
The Cherokee held that [[Portent (divination)|signs]], visions, [[dream]]s, and [[supernatural power|power]]s were all gifts of the [[spirit]]s, and that their world was intertwined with and presided over by the spirit world.

Spiritual beings can come in the form of animal or human and are considered a part of daily life. A group of spiritual beings are spoken about as [[Little people (mythology)|Little People]] and they can only be seen by man when they want to be seen. It is said that when they choose who they present themselves to and appear as any other Cherokee would, except they are small with very long hair.&lt;ref name=CherokeeNation&gt;Cherokee Nation. (2016). The traditional belief system. Retrieved from http://www.cherokee.org/AboutTheNation/Culture/General/TheTraditionalBeliefSystem.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Little People can be helpful but one should be cautious while interacting with them because they can be very deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Barbara R., Davey Arch, and Inc Netlibrary. (1998). Living Stories of the Cherokee. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not common to talk about an experience one has with the Little People. Instead, you could relay an incident told to you about someone else's experience.&lt;ref name=ParkerCitation&gt;Parker, G. K. (2005). Seven Cherokee Myths: Creation, Fire, the Primordial Parents, the Nature of Evil, the Family, Universal Suffering, and Communal Obligation.

==Evil==
Traditionally there is no universal evil spirit corresponding to Satan in Cherokee Theology.  An Asgina is any sort of spirit, but it is usually considered to be a malevolent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilpatrick |first=Jack Frederick |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |title=The Wahnenauhi Manuscript: Historical Sketches of the Cherokee |year=1966 }} pages 185&lt;/ref&gt; Uya, sometimes called Uyaga, is an evil earth spirit which is invariably opposed to the forces of right and light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kilpatrick |first=Jack Frederick &amp; Anna Gritts |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |title=Notebook of a Cherokee Shaman |year=1970 }} pages 100&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also [[Nun'Yunu'Wi]], an evil spirit monster who preys on humans, and Kalona Ayeliski ([[Raven Mocker]]). These spirits preyed on the souls of the dying and would torment their victims until they died, after which they would eat the heart of the victim. Kalona Ayeliski are invisible, except to a medicine man, and the only way to protect a potential victim was to have a [[medicine man]] who knew how to drive Kalona Ayeliski off, since they were scared of him.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Frederick Kilpatrick.

'''Franklin Rudolf Ankersmit''' (born 20 March 1945, [[Deventer]], [[Netherlands]]) is professor of intellectual history and historical theory at the [[University of Groningen]].

Ankersmit, member of the family of textile manufacturers Ankersmit,&lt;ref&gt;For the family Ankersmit see ''Nederlandsch Patriciaat''  1995-1996; 1 - 64 and 19 for Franklin Rudolf .&lt;/ref&gt; initially studied physics and mathematics in Leiden for three years and then did his military service. He next studied both history and philosophy at the University of Groningen. In 1981 he took his doctoral degree at that same University with a dissertation entitled ''Narrative Logic: A Semantic Analysis of the Historian’s Language''. In 1986 he was appointed member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (''KNAW''). He is founder and was until 2017 chief editor of the ''Journal of the Philosophy of History'' promoting a strictly philosophical approach to the reflection on the writing of history.

In 1992 he was appointed full professor for [[intellectual history]]  and philosophy of history at the University of Groningen. His main interests, apart from philosophy of history, are political philosophy, aesthetics and the notion of historical experience (or sensation). The notion of representation is of central importance in his writings focusing on historical,  political and aesthetic representation. He published fifteen books (edited books not included) of which many were translated into English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Russian and Chinese. He wrote over two hundred-fifty scientific articles and is member of the editorial board of several journals in his fields of study. With his book on historical experience he won the Socrates challenge cup  in 2008. He retired in 2010 and was appointed in that same year Officer in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] by H.M. the Queen of the Netherlands. In 2011 he was granted an Honorary Degree in the Humanities by the University of Ghent and in that same year he was appointed member of the [[Academia Europaea]]''. ''

== Philosophy of History ==
In the 1980s he developed a narrativist philosophy of history in which the order and coherence the historian gives to the facts of the past are said to be presented in, and with a historical ‘narrative’. In the 1990s he elaborated this idea into a philosophy of historical representation. According to this philosophy the historian  does not ‘translate’ a meaning allegedly present in the past itself into the text of his representation, but he creates historical meaning in his representation of the past which can be seen as a substitute for the absent past itself. Since the word ‘narrative’ invites unwelcome associations with the novel, Ankersmit soon replaced it by the far more adequate word ‘representation’. This is where his philosophy of history basically differs from that of [[Hayden White]].  Ankersmit analyzed the notion of representation with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s logic and metaphysics – no philosopher in the history of Western thought granted to representation a more central place than Leibniz. In his later work Ankersmit concentrates on the issue of historical rationality; his aim then is to establish on what rational grounds historians prefer one representation of the past to another. Leibniz is here his guide as well. Although Ankersmit is often perceived as a postmodernist, his work can also be seen as drawing from the 19th century historian [[Friedrich Meinecke]] and as an "An almost neo-Kantian desire to counter the hegemony of science in history and politics". &lt;ref&gt;H. Paul, A. van Veldhuizen, 'A Retrieval of Historicism: Frank Ankersmit's Philosophy of History and Politics', History and Theory 57, no. 1 (March 2018), 33-55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Ankersmit was a member of the Dutch liberal party, the VVD ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]), and one of the authors of the Liberal Manifesto that this party presented. In 2009 he ended his membership of that party, since it had turned, in his view, from a liberal into a neoliberal party. He sees [[Neoliberalism]] as a return to Medieval [[feudalism]]: both wish to entrust public competences and responsibilities to (semi-)private hands. Whereas liberalism was born at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries from the rejection  of feudalism. The Anglo-Saxon countries could forget about this, since they remained outside the grip of the French Revolution. Ankersmit was member of the National Convention, a commission installed by  minister [[Alexander Pechtold]] in order to offer advice about how to strengthen democracy. More recently he insisted that representative democracy is, in fact, an elective aristocracy, which is, from a logical point of view, a peculiar mixture of Medieval political representation by the three Estates and the concept of sovereignty, as established under absolute monarchy. Ankersmit regularly participates at public debate on democracy, political representation, liberalism and related topics.

The archaeological '''gallery roads''' (棧道) were roads through remote mountain areas of [[China]]. They consisted of wooden planks erected on holes cut into the sides of cliffs. They were most notably used in the [[Qin Mountains]] linking the [[Wei River]] and the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]] valleys. The first gallery roads were built during the [[Warring States period]] (476-221 BC) and used by [[Qin (state)|Qin]] to invade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] and [[Ba (state)|Ba]]. They were fully consolidated into a thriving network during the [[Han Dynasty]]. Before the 20th century, very primitive versions were used in the western gorges of the [[Pamir Mountains]].

{{Jerusalem sidebar}}

The '''Islamization of Jerusalem''' refers to the religious transformation of the [[Levant]]ine city that occurred three times in [[history]]. The first [[Islamization]] of [[Jerusalem]] followed the [[History of Jerusalem (Middle Ages)|Islamic Conquest of Jerusalem]] by [[Umar|Umar ibn Al-Khattāb]] in 638 CE. The second Islamization followed the fall of Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, followed by Ayybiud rule in the late 12th century, followed by dominant [[Islamic culture]] through the Mamluk and early Ottoman rule. Since late Ottoman era, Jerusalem turned increasingly multi-cultural, gradually becoming predominantly Jewish during late 19th and early 20th century. However, with the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank]], Jerusalem underwent [[Islamization of Jerusalem under Jordanian occupation|another round of Islamization and Arabization]].

The remodulation was grounded on a foundational narrative in early Islamic texts, themselves drawing on Persian, Jewish and Christian traditions&lt;ref&gt;Khoury p.57:’Persian, Jewish, and Christian-Byzantine elements were present in Arabia itself prior to the appearance of Islam, and were integrated into Arab history, tradition, and culture to become part of the collective heritage and memories that were recorded in the Islamic historical writings of later years. A particularly rich repertoire of Arab myths and memories, as well as architecture, thus preceded the appearance of the first Islamic monument.&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasized the city's cosmological significance within God's creation.&lt;ref name="Antrim"&gt;[[Zayde Antrim]], ''Routes and Realms: The Power of Place in the Early Islamic World,''Oxford University Press, 2012 p.48&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Muslim conquest of the city, the victors encountered many traditions connecting  the Temple Mount with David (the ''miḥrāb Dāwūd'' in the Qur'an 38:20-21) and  Jewish beliefs that from there, on  Mount Moriah, Adam had been born and died,&lt;ref&gt;Graber pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt; and absorbed the belief that [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], [[John the Baptist]]’s father and, in the Qur'an, 'prophet of the Jewish scholars',  had raised a [[mihrab]] to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary, the mother of Jesus]] on the site,&lt;ref&gt;Khoury, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; and such traditions affected the outlay of Islamic buildings. It has also  been argued that the central role Jerusalem assumed in Islamic belief began with Muhammad's instruction to his followers to observe the [[qibla]] by facing the direction of Jerusalem during their daily prostrations in prayer. After 16 months, the direction of prayer was changed to [[Mecca]] in present-day Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Reiter, Marwan Abu Khalaf,[http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=169 'Jerusalem’s Religious Significance,'] at Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol.8, No.1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] construction of the Dome of the Rock was interpreted by later hostile [[Abbasid dynasty]] historians as an attempt to redirect the [[Hajj]] or pilgrimage from Mecca to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Nuha N. N. Khoury, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523172 ''The Dome of the Rock, the Kaʿba, and Ghumdan: Arab Myths and Umayyad Monuments,''] in ''Muqarnas, Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar,'' Brill (1993), pp. 57-65, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jerusalem is not mentioned by its [[Names of Jerusalem|names]] in [[Quran]], it is mentioned in later Islamic literature and in [[Hadiths]], as the place of [[Muhammad]]'s [[Isra and Mi'raj|ascension to heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Historic Cities of the Islamic World edited by Clifford Edmund Bosworth P: 226&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'anic reference to a ''masjid al-aqṣā'' originally referred to one of two sanctuaries at [[Al Ju`ranah|al-Ji'ranah]] near Mecca, the other being ''masjid al-adnā,''&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Grabar, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629098 ''The Umayyad Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem,''] [[Freer Gallery of Art|Ars Orientalis]], Vol. 3 (1959), pp. 33-62 p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Umayyad caliphate exploited these traditions concerning Muhammad’s night journey to Jerusalem and, in the face of some concerted opposition, particularly from [[Shiites]], their claim prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Reiter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bZbFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 ''Jerusalem and Its Role in Islamic Solidarity,'']  Springer 2008 p.21.:’The issue of al-Aqsa Mosque’s location has been subject to much debate within Islam, and even today there are those who  believe it is not in Jerusalem at all, according to one claim, the text was meant to refer to the Mosque of the Prophet in al-Madina or in a place close to al-Madina. Another perception is that of the Ja’fari Shiites, who interpret that al-Aqsa is a mosque in heaven. This interpretation reflects the Shiite anti-Umayyad emotions in an attempt to play down the sacredness of Umayyad Jerusalem and to minimize the sanctity of Jerusalem by detaching the qur’anic al-Masjid al-aqsa from the Temple Mount, thus asserting that the Prophet never came to that city, but rather ascended to the heavenly al-Aqsa mosque without ever stopping in bayt al-Maqdis. Apart from depriving Jerusalem of its major attraction for pilgrims, the Shiite traditions offer alternative pilgrimage attractions such as the Shiite holy city of Kufa, as well as Mecca. However, the tradition about Muhammad’s Night Journey to Jerusalem were never suppressed. They were exploited by the Umayyads and continued to be quoted in the [[tafsir]] (Qur’an interpretation) collections. The interpretation dating from the Umayyad and Crusader eras, according to which al-Aqsa is in Jerusalem, is the one that prevailed.’’&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Islamization of Jerusalem under the Caliphates==
In 638 [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Islam]]ic [[Caliphate]] extended its dominion to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Arab conquest]] of the [[Shaam|region]], Jews were allowed back into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Palestine, 634–1099 |last=Gil |first=Moshe |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=February 1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |pages=70–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority population of Jerusalem during the time of Arab conquest was Christian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mamluk.uchicago.edu/MSR_VI_2002-Luz_pp133-154.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aspects of Islamization of Space and Society in Mamluk Jerusalem and its Hinterland |author=Nimrod Luz |publisher=Mamluk.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of the Palestine population of about 300,000-400,000 inhabitants, was still Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Cohen (1950). Contemporary Jewry: a survey of social, cultural, economic, and political conditions, p 310.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=has the 300K but apparently not the majority| date=November 2013}} In the aftermath the process of cultural Arabization and Islamization took place, combining immigration to Palestine with the adoption of Arabic language and conversion of the part of  local population to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren S. Bahr; Bernard Johnston (M.A.); Louise A. Bloomfield (1996). Collier's encyclopedia: with bibliography and index. Collier's. p. 328. Retrieved 19 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to several Muslim scholars, including [[Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi|Mujir ad-Din]], [[al-Suyuti]], and [[al-Muqaddasi]], the mosque was reconstructed and expanded by the [[caliph]] Abd al-Malik in 690 along with the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref name="Elad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="le Strange"&gt;le Strange, Guy. (1890). ''Palestine under the Moslems'', pp.80–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In planning his magnificent project on the Temple Mount, which in effect would turn the entire complex into the Haram al-Sharif ("the Noble Sanctuary"), Abd al-Malik wanted to replace the slipshod structure described by Arculf with a more sheltered structure enclosing the ''[[qibla]]'', a necessary element in his grand scheme. The Jewish background  in the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] is commonly accepted by historians. A number of scholars consider the construction of the Dome as the Muslim desire to rebuild [[Solomon's Temple]] or Mihrab Dawud. Grabar and Busse claimed that this was the primary Islamic legitimization for the sanctity of the Dome of the Rock, while the [[Al-mi'raj]] traditions were transferred to the rock only later.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship: Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage By Amikam Elad P:161&lt;/ref&gt; An early Islamic tradition from the converted rabbi [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]] states "Ayrusalaim which means Jerusalem and the Rock which means the Temple. I shall send you my servant [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] who will build you and adorn you. I shall surely restore you to [[Bayt Al Maqdis]], its first kingdom and I shall crown it with gold, silver and gems. And I shall surely send you my creatures. And I shall surely invest my throne of glory upon the rock, since I am the sovereign God, and [[David]] is the king of the [[Children of Israel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship: Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage By Amikam Elad P:162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Rashidun Caliphate===
The [[Rashidun]] caliph [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]] signed a treaty with [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christian]] Patriarch [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], assuring him that Jerusalem's Christian holy places and population would be protected under Muslim rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Crusades:The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem |last=Runciman |first=Steven |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1951 |pages=Vol.1 pp.3–4 |nopp=true|isbn=0-521-34770-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When led to pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the holiest site for Christians, the caliph Umar declined to pray within the church in order not to establish a precedent that might be exploited later by some Muslims to convert the church into a [[mosque]]. He prayed outside the church, where the [[Mosque of Omar (Jerusalem)|Mosque of Umar]] (Omar) stands to this day, opposite the entrance to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

According to the Gaullic bishop [[Arculf]], who lived in Jerusalem from 679 to 688, the Mosque of Umar was a rectangular wooden structure built over ruins which could accommodate 3,000 worshipers.&lt;ref name="Yisrael Shalem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_8.html |last=Shalem |first=Yisrael |publisher=Ingeborg Rennert Center for Jerusalem Studies, [[Bar-Ilan University]]|title=The Early Arab Period – 638–1099 |accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Umayyad Caliphate===
The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] commissioned the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in the late 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Holy City: Jerusalem in the Theology of the Old Testament |last=Hoppe |first=Leslie J. |publisher=Michael Glazier Books |date=August 2000 |isbn=0-8146-5081-3 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th century historian [[al-Muqaddasi]] writes that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to "compete in grandeur" with Jerusalem's monumental churches.&lt;ref name="Yisrael Shalem"/&gt; Over the next four hundred years Jerusalem's prominence diminished as Arab powers in the region jockeyed for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/mzank/Jerusalem/p/period4-3.htm |last=Zank |first=Michael |publisher=Boston University |title=Abbasid Period and Fatimid Rule (750–1099) |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Fatimid Caliphate===
In 1099, The [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] ruler expelled the native Christian population before Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|conquered]] by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who massacred most of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants when they took the solidly defended city by assault, after a period of siege; later the Crusaders created the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. By early June 1099 Jerusalem’s population had declined from 70,000 to less than 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hull |first=Michael D. |date=June 1999 |title=First Crusade: Siege of Jerusalem |journal=Military History |url=http://www.historynet.com/historical_conflicts/3028446.html?page=4&amp;c=y |accessdate=2007-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181302/http://www.historynet.com/historical_conflicts/3028446.html?page=4&amp;c=y |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Islamization of Jerusalem==

===Under the Ayyubid dynasty===
In 1187, the city was wrested from the Crusaders by [[Saladin]] who permitted Jews and Muslims to return and settle in the city.&lt;ref name="century1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centuryone.com/hstjrslm.html |publisher=The CenturyOne Foundation |title=Main Events in the History of Jerusalem |accessdate=2007-02-02 |year=2003 |work=Jerusalem: The Endless Crusade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] of Saladin, a period of huge investment began in the construction of houses, markets, public baths, and pilgrim hostels as well as the establishment of religious endowments. However, for most of the 13th century, Jerusalem declined to the status of a village due to city's fall of strategic value and Ayyubid internecine struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia

In 1244, Jerusalem was sacked by the  [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty|Khwarezmian]] [[Tatars|Tartars]], who decimated the city's Christian population and drove out the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khwarezmian Tartars were driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. From 1250 to 1517, Jerusalem was ruled by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s. During this period of time many clashes occurred between the Mamluks on one side and the crusaders and the [[Mongols]] on the other side. The area also suffered from many earthquakes and [[Black Death|black plague]].

==Islamization of the Temple Mount==
{{main|Islamization of the Temple Mount}}

[[Muslim]] authorities have sought to appropriate and [[Islamization|Islamicize]] the [[Temple Mount]] for exclusive Muslim use.&lt;ref name="Israeli2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raphael Israeli|title=War, peace and terror in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4B11CFdP-oC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=3 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5531-4|pages=21–|quote=During the process of the Islamization of Jerusalem, a mosque was built on the site...The Islamicized Mount became the destination of Muhammad's ''isra’''...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally an Israelite and subsequently [[Jew]]ish holy site, as the location of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s, the site was subsequently the location of a Byzantine church and later of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].

At the time of the Muslim conquest, the [[Temple Mount]] may have been the site of a [[Byzantine]] public building, perhaps a church, with an elaborate mosaic floor, some of the remains of which have been discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Was-the-Aksa-Mosque-built-over-the-remains-of-a-Byzantine-church "Was the Aksa Mosque built over the remains of a Byzantine church?,"], Etgar Lefkowitz, November 16, 2008, Jerusalem Post.&lt;/ref&gt; In 682 CE, 50 years after Muhammad’s death, ‘[[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]] rebelled against the [[Caliph of Damascus]], conquered Mecca and stopped pilgrims from coming south to the [[Hajj]] in Mecca.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|‘Abd al-Malik]], the Umayyad Caliph, responded by creating a new holy site.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}   He chose sura 17, verse 1, “Glory to Him who caused His servant to travel by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, whose precincts We have blessed, in order to show him some of Our Signs, He is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.”{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} And designated the Temple Mount in Jerusalem as the "Farthest Mosque" mentioned in that verse.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Dome of the Rock===
{{main|Dome of the Rock}}

The Islamization of the Temple Mount climaxed at the end of the seventh century, with the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in the early 690s when [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] was developing his program of Islamization. It was built over the [[Foundation Stone]], the site of the historic [[Second Temple|Jewish Temple]].&lt;ref name="Gordon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Gordon|title=The rise of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiawUHevW24C&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=3 October 2010|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32522-9|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[al-Aqsa mosque]] was built at the southern end of the mount in the 8th-century.

Throughout the entire period of the Muslim conquest until the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, various structures were built on the mount including memorial sites and gates.&lt;ref name="al-HādīPASSIA.2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahdī ʻAbd al-Hādī|author2=PASSIA.|title=Documents on Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT8vAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 October 2010|year=2007|publisher=PASSIA, Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs|isbn=978-9950-305-19-9|page=247|quote=The Islamization of the Temple Mount culminated at the end of the seventh century, with the establishment of the Dome of the Rock above the Foundation Stone and the construction of the al-Aqsa mosque in the south of the Temple Mount.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 13th-century onwards, after the Muslims had regained control of the city, building projects in Jerusalem and around the Temple Mount sought to further establish the city’s Islamic character.&lt;ref name="Lazarus-Yafeh1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hava Lazarus-Yafeh|title=Some religious aspects of Islam: a collection of articles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7k3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=3 October 2010|date=1 December 1981|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-06329-7|page=69|quote=In the same way, when Jerusalem was taken back under the leadership of Saladin in 1187, and particularly from the 13th-century and on, a great deal of building activity began around the Temple Mount and in the whole city — obviously so as to establish its Islamic character.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conquest of the city by Saladin, non-Muslims were permitted to set foot on the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=MeyerMessner&gt;"Entering the Temple Mount - in Halacha and Jewish History," Gedalia Meyer and Henoch Messner, PDF available at [http://hakirah.org/], VOl 10, Summer 2010, Hakirah.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Aqsa Mosque===
{{main|Al-Aqsa Mosque}}

It is unknown exactly when the al-Aqsa Mosque was first constructed and who ordered its construction, but it is certain that it was built in the early Umayyad period of rule in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], referring to a testimony by [[Arculf]], a [[Gaul|Gallic]] monk, during his pilgrimage to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 679–82, notes the possibility that the second [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of [[Mu'awiyah I]], and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.&lt;ref name="Elad"&gt;Elad, Amikam. (1995). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDz_yctbQVgC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Aqsa+Mosque+construction&amp;sig=ACfU3U18kr7-hEXqRvqOKs-Jg3Pk2_CeBg#PPA29,M1 Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage]'' BRILL, pp.29–43. {{ISBN|90-04-10010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of Temple Mount antiquities, 1995–2001===
{{see also|Temple Denial}}
Between 1995 and 2001, the Islamic Waqf carried out extensive construction work in order to build the biggest mosque in the region named Marwani mosque, with a capacity of 10,000 worshippers in an area of about 5,000 square meters. During unsupervised construction, the Waqf obliterated many of the antiquities at [[Solomon's Stables]] section of [[Temple Mount]]. The original Herodian structure was converted into a mosque. The structure stones were stripped of its original surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templemountdestruction.com/Destruction/Destructionofantiquities19952001/tabid/186/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/12/Conversion-of-the-Solomons-Stables-structure-into-a-mosque.aspx|title= Temple Mount Antiquities Rescue Committee - Destruction of antiquities 1995-2001|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519222050/http://www.templemountdestruction.com/Destruction/Destructionofantiquities19952001/tabid/186/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/12/Conversion-of-the-Solomons-Stables-structure-into-a-mosque.aspx|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At eastern Hulda gate, the Waqf destroyed the original Herodian ornamentation and later plastered them and painted them over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templemountdestruction.com/Destruction/Destructionofantiquities19952001/tabid/186/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/14/The-Double-Gate-passageway-western-Hulda-Gate.aspx|title=Temple Mount Antiquities Rescue Committee - Destruction of antiquities 1995-2001|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519204550/http://www.templemountdestruction.com/Destruction/Destructionofantiquities19952001/tabid/186/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/14/The-Double-Gate-passageway-western-Hulda-Gate.aspx|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of truck loads of dirt were dumped into Kidron Walley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2185">'''Jean-Noël Paquot''' (1722&amp;ndash;1803) was a Belgian [[theologian]], historian, [[Hebrew]] scholar and [[bibliographer]].

== Life ==
Paquot was born in [[Florennes]] in 1722. In 1738 he enrolled at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]], graduating Licentiate of Theology in 1751.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Chauvin]], "Paquot (Jean-Noël)", ''[[Biographie Nationale de Belgique]]'', vol. 16 (Brussels, 1901), 597-609.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1755 to 1771 he taught Hebrew at the [[Collegium Trilingue]] in [[Leuven]], where he was also librarian. He was stripped of his position after a criminal trial. In subsequent years he lived in [[Brussels]] and [[Gembloux]]. In 1782 he was stripped of his pension as court historiographer to [[Empress Maria Theresa]], for having denied that the Austrian government had a historical claim to [[Saint-Hubert, Belgium|Saint-Hubert]].

On 1 February 1769 he was elected to the Société littéraire de Bruxelles, a precursor of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academieroyale.be/fr/details-690/relations/jean-noel-paquot/secorig593/ Jean Noël Paquot], L'Académie / Who's who ? – Accessed 9 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787 he moved to Liège to collaborate on an abortive project to found a university there. He died in [[Liège]] in 1803.

== Works ==
He wrote a book encompassing the entire literary history of the Low Countries, in all languages, entitled ''Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire littéraire des dix-sept provinces des Pays-Bas, de la principauté de Liège et de quelques contrées voisines'' ("Memoirs for the literary history of the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands, the Principality of Liege, and some neighboring countries"), Leuven, 1763-1770, 18 volumes in octavo or in three folio volumes, Leuven, 1765-1770.

He was educated at the [[King's School, Rochester]] (his father's school) and at [[Winchester College]], before joining the [[University of Oxford]] as a scholar of [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]] in 1824. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1827, and was made a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of Wadham in 1830, lecturing in classics and then in divinity.  He was ordained as a priest in the [[Church of England]] in 1838, and became preacher at the [[Chapel Royal, Whitehall]] in 1854. He was one of the "Four Tutors" who protested in March 1841 against the Anglo-Catholic [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[Tract 90]], despite his dislike of controversy.  He later explained that he disliked the anonymous basis on which the tract had been published, with an implicit link to the university, as well as its content. His fellowship at Wadham lasted until 1854 under the statutes prevailing at the time, and he then resigned and moved to [[Hampton Wick]]. Appointed as [[Keeper of the Archives]] in 1857 (a position he held until his death), he returned to Oxford.  In 1871, reluctantly, he became Warden of Wadham, resigning in 1881.  He also served on various committees and held other administrative positions within the university.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

His publications include editions of classical texts, and some works connected with Oxford: ''An Index to Wills Proved in the Court of the Chancellor of the University of Oxford'' (1862), and an edition of the [[William Laud|Laudian]] university statutes (1888). He collected medals and prints, and sold one Rembrandt etching for £1,510 in May 1883 (equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1510|1883|r=-3}}}} in present-day terms){{inflation-fn|UK}} – at that time, the highest price paid for one print. He was known as a courteous and hospitable man, formal in his dress and behaviour, and rather reserved (which seemed not to help relations with Wadham's undergraduates).  He died in his home in Oxford on 14 August 1885.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|author1=Greenhill, W. A. |author2=rev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''John Dademo Waiko''' (born 8 August 1945) is a Papua New Guinean [[historian]], [[anthropologist]], [[playwright]] and [[politician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pngec.gov.pg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/nominations.pdf?sfvrsn=0 | title=Nominations By Electorate | publisher=PNG Electoral Commission | accessdate=15 June 2017 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6rEbk3093?url=http://www.pngec.gov.pg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/nominations.pdf?sfvrsn=0 | archive-date=2017-06-15 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waiko was born in the village of Tabara in the [[Oro Province|Northern Province]].&lt;ref name="Waiko, John D. 1993"&gt;Waiko, John D., ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'', 1993, {{ISBN|0-19-553164-7}}. Biographical information on back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der.org/films/man-without-pigs.html "Man Without Pigs"], Documentary Educational Resources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Social Sciences]] from the [[Australian National University]], thus becoming the first Papua New Guinean to earn a PhD of any kind.

== Career ==
In 1986, he was the first Papua New Guinean to be appointed Professor, and became head of the History department at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]]. He has published a number of articles on the [[History of Papua New Guinea|history]], [[Culture of Papua New Guinea|culture]] and [[Politics of Papua New Guinea|politics of his country]]. His book ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'' was first published in 1993.&lt;ref name="Waiko, John D. 1993" /&gt;

He is also the author of a play, ''The Unexpected Hawk'', published in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QeTYwho1zOEC&amp;pg=PA524 Bibliography of John Waiko] ''in'' G. W. Trompf, ''PaybackThe Logic of Retribution in Melanesian Religions'', 1994, {{ISBN|0-521-41691-4}}, p.524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/sspng/mobile_devices/ch18.html "Nationalism and Papua New Guinea Writing"], ''Australian Quarterly'', 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Waiko was elected to [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|Parliament]], beginning his national political career. He was Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2001 to 2002, before losing his seat in Parliament in the [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2002|June 2002 general election]]. In the [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2007|2007 general election]], he stood unsuccessfully for election at the Sohe Open constituency, representing the new [[Papua New Guinea Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pngec.gov.pg/resultsNat2007/SoheOpen.htm PNG Electoral Commission, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318060658/http://www.pngec.gov.pg/resultsNat2007/SoheOpen.htm |date=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waiko was controversially involved with a prominent Malaysian businessmen in the logging industry in Papua New Guinea, Philip Lee. After Lee had "fraudulently obtained three Papua New Guinea passports and was found guilty of violating PNG immigration laws", Foreign Affairs Minister [[John Pundari]] ordered his deportation. Pundari was sacked by Prime Minister [[Mekere Morauta]], and replaced by Waiko, who suspended and reviewed the deportation order. When it was revealed in February 2002 that Waiko and Lee "held shares in the same company", and Waiko admitted they were "business partners", PNG Forest Watch expressed its concern over a "clear conflict of interest" and urged Waiko to resign. Papua New Guinea's Trade Union Congress also called for Waiko to be sacked.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Crocombe]], ''Asia in the Pacific Islands: Replacing the West'', Suva: IPS Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|978-982-02-0388-4}}, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20020219/news03 "Forest pressure move"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209094115/http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20020219/news03 |date=2005-02-09 }}, ''Post Courier'', 19 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/png-tuc-wants-minister-sacked "PNG TUC wants minister sacked"], Radio Australia, 13 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/png-illegal-passports-scam "PNG illegal passports scam"], Radio Australia, 30 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Waiko has been the subject of two biographical films. He was the subject of, starred in, and was associate producer of, the 1990 film ''Man Without Pigs'', by [[Chris Owen (director)|Chris Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226712/Man-Without-Pigs/overview "Man Without Pigs (1990)"], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he starred in ''Minister Without Money'', a short film by Sandra Welkerling, focused on his political career, set against the wider context of [[Politics of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinean politics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afc.gov.au/filmsandawards/filmdbsearch.aspx?view=title&amp;title=MINIST&amp;area=all&amp;year=2005 Australian Film Commission]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Australian government website&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]]''' ('''LGBT''') '''firsts by year''' denotes pioneering [[LGBT]] endeavors organized chronologically. [[Coming Out|Openly]] LGBT people remain a [[Demographic profile|demographic]] minority in most places. In areas that historically are not known for having (or being friendly to) LGBT people who do not remain [[closeted]], a "first" can make it easier for other openly LGBT persons to enter the field or for those who are closeted to [[coming out|come out]]. Openly LGBT people being visible in society affects [[societal attitudes toward homosexuality]], bisexuality, and the transgender community on a wider level.

One commonly cited example is [[Harvey Milk]], the first openly gay person to be elected to political office in [[California]], becoming the most visible LGBT politician in the world in the 1970s, after decades of resistance to LGBT people by mainstream culture. Milk encouraged LGBT people to "come out of the closet" during his speeches; as a result of his work and [[Moscone-Milk assassinations|his assassination—along with San Francisco mayor George Moscone]]—thousands of ordinary people did so. In 2002, Milk was called "the most famous and most significantly open LGBT official ever elected in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Raymond, Haider-Markel, Donald, eds., (2002).

'''Marc Léopold Benjamin Bloch''' ({{IPAc-en|b|l|ɒ|k}}; {{IPA-fr|maʁk blɔk|lang}}; 6 July 1886 – 16 June 1944) was a [[List of contemporary French historians|French historian]] who cofounded the highly influential [[Annales School]] of French social history. Bloch was a quintessential modernist. An assimilated [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jew]] from an academic family in Paris, he was deeply affected in his youth by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. He studied at the elite [[École Normale Supérieure]]; in 1908–9 he studied at Berlin and Leipzig. He fought in the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for four years. In 1919 he became Lecturer in Medieval history at [[Strasbourg University]], after the German professors were all expelled; he was called to the University of Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history. He is best known for his pioneering studies ''French Rural History'' and ''Feudal Society'' and his posthumously-published unfinished meditation on the writing of history, ''[[The Historian's Craft]].'' A French soldier in both World Wars, he was captured and shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] for his work in the [[French Resistance]].

English historian Denys Hays says he and [[Frederic William Maitland]] were "the two greatest historians of recent times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Denys Hay|title=Annalists and Historians: Western Historiography from the VIIIth to the XVIIIth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OV37CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=169|isbn=9781317274568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French historian [[Fernand Braudel]] says Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] were, "the greatest historians of this century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Dosse|title=New History in France: The Triumph of the Annales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=279SfqpRV9EC&amp;pg=PA109|year=1994|publisher=U of Illinois Press|page=109|isbn=9780252063732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and First World War==
Born in [[Lyon]] to a Jewish family, the son of the professor of ancient history [[Gustave Bloch]], Marc studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and [[Fondation Thiers]] in Paris, then at Berlin and Leipzig. He was an officer of infantry in [[World War I]], rising to the rank of captain and being awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]].

After the war, he went to the university at [[Strasbourg]], then in 1936 succeeded [[Henri Hauser]] as professor of [[economic history]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].

==Career==
In 1924 he published one of his most famous works ''Les rois thaumaturges: étude sur le caractère surnaturel attribué à la puissance royale particulièrement en France et en Angleterre'' (translated in English as ''The magic-working kings'' or ''The royal touch: sacred monarchy and scrofula in England and France'') in which he collected, described and studied the documents pertaining to the ancient tradition that the kings of the Middle Ages were able to cure the disease of [[scrofula]] simply by [[royal touch|touching]] people suffering from it.&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2011/11/history-heroes-marc-bloch/|title=History Heroes: Marc Bloch|last=Dash|first=Mike | authorlink = Mike Dash|date=December 9, 2011|work=Past Imperfect blog|publisher=[[Smithsonian magazine]]|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has its roots in the magical role of kings in ancient societies. This work by Bloch had a great impact not only on the [[social history]] of the Middle Ages but also on [[cultural anthropology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Bloch's most important work centered on the study of [[feudalism]]. In 1939 he published a large work, available in a two-volume English translation as ''Feudal Society.'' In some ways, his most innovative work is his monograph 1931 ''French Rural History.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfnzN3uzXrAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=French Rural History: An Essay on its Basic Characteristics| isbn=9780520016606| last1=Bloch| first1=Marc| year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annales==
With colleague [[Lucien Febvre]] he founded the [[Annales School]] in 1929, by starting the new scholarly journal, ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of economic and social history"), which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities.

Bloch has had lasting influence in the field of [[historiography]] through his unfinished manuscript ''[[The Historian's Craft]]'', which he was working on at his death. Bloch's book is often considered one of the most important historiographical works of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Dash"/&gt;

==Historiography==
Bloch was highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at [http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html Vidal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909192633/http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917). In ''Méthodologie Historique'' (written in 1906 but not published until 1988), Bloch rejected the histoire événementielle (event history) of his mentors [[Charles-Victor Langlois]] and [[Charles Seignobos]] to argue for greater analysis of the role of structural and social phenomena in determining the outcome of historical events. Bloch was trying to reinvent history as a social science, but he departed significantly from Durkheim in his refusal to exclude psychology from history; Bloch maintained that the individual actor should be considered along with social forces. Bloch's methodology was also greatly influenced by his father, Gustave Bloch, a historian of the ancient world, and by 19th-century scholars such as [[Gabriel Monod]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]].

Bloch vigorously supported the idea of international scholarly cooperation and tried unsuccessfully to set up an international journal with American support. Bloch wrote some 500 reviews of German books and articles, While promoting the importance of German historiography and admiring its scholarly rigor, he repeatedly criticized [[Sonderweg|its nationalism]] and methodological limitations.

==Miracles and mentalities==
In ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch looked at the long-standing [[folk belief]] that the king could cure [[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]] by touch. The kings of France and England indeed regularly practised the ritual. Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the [[royal touch]]—he acted like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long-duration studies spanning a thousand years (with specific events used as illustrations). By investigating the impact of [[rituals]], the efficacy of [[myths]], and all the possible sources of [[collective behavior]], he became the "father of historical anthropology." Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. Stirling (2007) examines this essentially stylistic trait alongside Bloch's peculiarly quixotic idealism, which tempered and sometimes compromised his work through his hope for a truly cooperative model of historical inquiry. While humanizing and questioning him, Stirling gives credit to Bloch for helping to break through the monotonous methodological alternance between [[positivism]] and [[narrative history]], creating a new, synthetic version of the historical practice that has since become so ingrained in the discipline that it is typically overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural history==
Bloch's own ideas on rural history were best expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'' (1939).

In ''L'Individualisme Agraire du XVIIIe Siècle'' (1978), Bloch characterized the [[agrarian reforms]] of 18th-century France as a "failed revolution," citing the persistence of regional traditions as evidence for their failure. A typical example of the Annales School's "total history," Bloch's argument weaves the connections between politics, culture, and economics against a backdrop of class conflict to illustrate how "the conscious actions of men have overcome the rhythms of the materialist causality of history." He argued that the anti-feudal sentiment of French peasants expressed in the 1789 ''cahier de doléances'' (list of grievances) was linked to the "seigneurial reaction" of the late 18th century in which lords significantly increased feudal dues. Bloch argued that it was this intensified exploitation that provoked peasant revolt, leading to the Revolution.

==History of technology==
The November 1935 issue of the ''Annales'' contains Febvre's introduction that defines three essential approaches to a [[history of technology]]: to investigate technology, to understand the progress of technology, and to understand the relationship of technology to other human activities. Bloch's article, "The Advent and Triumph of the Watermill in Medieval Europe," incorporates these approaches by investigating the connections between technology and broader social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela O. Long, "The Annales and the History of Technology: ''Annales D'histoire Economique et Sociale 7 (November 1935), Les Techniques, L'histoire et La Vie.''" ''[[Technology and Culture]]'' 2005 46(1): 177–186. {{ISSN|0040-165X}} Fulltext: [[Project Muse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
In 1939 France declared war on Germany after its [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|occupation of Poland]]. As France [[Military mobilization|mobilized]] its troops, Marc Bloch left his position at the Sorbonne and took up his reserve status as a captain in the [[French Army]] at the age of 52. He was encouraged at the time by colleagues both in France and abroad to leave the country. He said it was his personal obligation to stand for the moral imperative.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was born in France, I have drunk the waters of her culture. I have made her past my own. I breathe freely only in her climate, and I have done my best, with others, to defend her interests.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Strange Defeat''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His memoir of the first days of World War II, ''[[Strange Defeat]],'' written in 1940 but not published until 1946, blamed the sudden total military defeat on the French military establishment, along with her social and political culture, and helped after the war to neutralize the traumatic memory of France's failure, and to build a new French identity.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, "Narratives of Resistance in Marc Bloch's ''L'etrange Defaite''." ''Modern and Contemporary France'' 2003 11(4): 443–452. {{ISSN|0963-9489}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloch joined the [[French Resistance]] in late 1942, driven by ardent patriotism, identification with his Jewish roots and a conception of France as the champion of liberty. His code name was "Narbonne". He was eventually captured in [[Lyon]] by [[Vichy France|Vichy]] police in March 1944 and turned over to the [[Gestapo]]. He was then imprisoned in Montluc prison, and was tortured by the Gestapo at their headquarters. He was interrogated by [[Klaus Barbie]] who was in charge of interrogations at the prison. Under such treatment Bloch remained "calm and stoic" throughout, according to his biographer [[Carole Fink]], reportedly providing no other information to his captors than his real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dash|first1=Mike|title=History Heroes: Marc Bloch|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-heroes-marc-bloch-134082792/|website=Smithsonianmag|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
At around 8pm on the night of 16 June 1944, ten days after [[D-Day]], Marc Bloch was among twenty-eight Resistance prisoners taken by German troops in a ''camionette'' (an open truck) along the [[River Saone]] to a place called La Rousille just before the village of [[Saint-Didier-de-Formans]] in the [[Ain department]]. Here, shortly after 10.00 pm in a meadow surrounded by high bushes, Bloch was executed by firing squad, one of the first group of four of the twenty-eight,{{sfn| According to Georges Altman in 'Les Cahiers Politiques' 8 (1945): 2, Bloch, who had comforted a young fellow prisoner, was the first victim to fall, crying out, "Vive la France"; cited in Fink, p.322, n.89}} handcuffed in pairs, to face the machine guns, and one of twenty-six men to be murdered that night in a period of twenty minutes.{{sfn|Two of those shot, Jean Crespo and Charles Perrin, survived to bear witness to the murders in depositions taken 31 January and 2 February 1946}} The victims were stripped of all means of identification and left by the Germans in the field. The following day they were found by Marcel Pouveret, a schoolmaster, who informed the mayor of St Didier, to whom he was assistant, and the mayor called in the ''[[gendarmerie]]'' of [[Trevoux]] to bury the bodies.{{sfn|Carole Fink, 'Marc Bloch. A Life in History', pp.320-322}} &lt;ref name="Dash"/&gt; There is today a memorial to those killed in the meadow near where they were shot.

As Bloch had spent his final days in prison, he left unfinished one of his most intimate works and a classic of historiography, "The Historian's Craft" (''Apologie pour l'histoire ou Métier d'historien''), which was edited and published posthumously, by which time Marc Bloch had become a national martyr following the [[Liberation of France#Liberation of France|Allied liberation]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, by Bryce Lyon, of ''French Rural History'', X.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
*Bloch's focus on the ''[[longue durée]]'' and his emphasis upon structures underlying events led to misguided accusations of a denial of human agency and a marginalization of political history. In ''Strange Defeat'' he clearly states his view that individuals can change events and he castigates the French government's refusal to trust its own officers in the field of battle, thus leading to the surrender of France to the Nazis.
*In 1998 the University of Social Sciences in Strasbourg was renamed in honour of Bloch. [[Marc Bloch University]] became a constituent part of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on 1 January 2009.

'''Martin Broszat''' (14 August 1926 – 14 October 1989) was a German [[historian]] specializing in modern German [[social history]] whose work has been described by ''The Encyclopedia of Historians'' as indispensable for any serious study of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"&gt;Lorenz, Chris "Broszat, Martin" pp. 143–144 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', volume 1, edited by Kelly Boyd, London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] and studied history at the [[University of Leipzig]] (1944–1949) and at the [[University of Cologne]] (1949–1952).&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; He married Alice Welter in 1953 and had three children.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; He served as a professor at the University of Cologne (1954–1955), at the [[Institute of Contemporary History (Munich)|Institute of Contemporary History]] in [[Munich]] (1955–1989) and was a Professor [[Emeritus]] at the [[University of Konstanz]] (1969–1980).&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; He was head of the [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]] (Institute of Contemporary History) between 1972 and 1989.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Throughout his career Broszat successfully hid the fact that he had been a member of the Nazi party since 1944. This only came out after his death, but did not seem to trouble his academic supporters. The concealment raises serious questions which have yet to be fully resolved.

==Early work==
In 1944, as a university student, Broszat joined the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;Broszat's driving incentive was to help an understanding of how Germany could sink into barbarity. That he himself had succumbed to the elan of the Nazi Movement was central to his motivation to elucidate for later generations how it could have happened. And that the later murder of the Jews arose from Nazism's anti-Jewish policies, but that these played so little part in the idealism of millions who had been drawn into support for the Nazi Movement (or in his own enthusiasm for the Hitler Youth), posed questions he always sought to answer. It amounted to a search for the pathological causes of the collapse of civilization in German society. But the attempt to find general causes in individual ideological intention and personal culpability seemed misplaced. This perspective pushed him, like Buchheim and others at the Institut, into looking to the structures of Nazi rule that implicated countless functionaries (and ordinary citizens) in the regime's inhumanity and criminality, even though they were far from sharing the ideological obsessions of the regime's leadership. And in his seminal essay on the "genesis of the Final Solution", published in 1977, Broszat specifically deployed a structuralist approach to widen responsibility beyond Hitler and the narrow Nazi leadership.&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout his academic career, a recurring interest for Broszat, like many German historians of the "Hitler Youth generation", was the question of why and how National Socialism occurred in Germany.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"&gt;Deborah Andrews (ed.) "Martin Broszat" in ''The Annual Obituary 1989''. Chicago: St. James Press, 1990, pp. 602–603.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat wrote his dissertation on anti-Semitism in Germany during the Second Reich.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt; As a historian, Broszat was most interested in exploring historical occurrences and the actions of individuals by scrutinizing the broader social structure that underlay the events of the past.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt; In his 1960 book ''Der Nationalsozialismus'' (translated into English in 1966 as ''German National Socialism 1919–1945''), Broszat examined [[Nazi]] ideology, which he regarded as incoherent. For Broszat, the constants were [[anti-communism]], [[anti-Semitism]] and the perceived need for ''[[Lebensraum]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Chris Lorenz. "Broszat, Martin" in Kelly Boyd (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', volume 1. London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999, pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt; In Broszat's view, these were a cloak for the essence of [[Nazism|National Socialism]], irrational emotions: an intense desire to realize the "rebirth" of "the German nation"; the need to "act" and irrational hatred directed against those considered ''Volksfeinde'' (enemies of the German People) and ''Volksfremde'' (those foreign to the German "race").&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Broszat saw the primary supporters of the Nazis being the middle classes, who turned to Nazism to alleviate their anxieties about impoverishment and "proletarianization" in the wake of [[hyperinflation]] in the early 1920s and the mass unemployment that began with the Great Depression at the end of the decade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

From the mid-1950s, Broszat served as one of the co-editors of the ''DTV Weltgeschichte'' journal.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt; Initially, Broszat's work focused on German ''Ostpolitik'' (Eastern Policy) in the 19th and 20th centuries and of the muddled socialism of the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt; Broszat's work on German-Polish relations in the 19th–20th centuries was to ultimately win him accolades in Poland as one of the first German historians to offer an honest account of German–Polish relations.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt;

In 1962, Broszat wrote a letter to the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' newspaper to "hammer home, once more, the persistently ignored or denied difference between concentration and extermination camps".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 78"&gt;Deborah Lipstadt. ''Denying the Holocaust''. New York: Free Press, 1993, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, Broszat claimed this was not an "admission" that there was no Holocaust but rather an attempt to "set the record straight" about the differences between concentration and death camps.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 78"/&gt; Broszat noted the differences between [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], which were places where the inmates were consistently mistreated but were not the subject of annihilation and [[Extermination camp|death camps]], which existed to exterminate people. Broszat denied there was a functioning gas chamber at the [[Dachau concentration camp]] (though he noted that one was built shortly before the end of the war as part of the effort to convert Dachau into a death camp but was never used). Broszat commented that though there were many concentration camps in Germany, all of the German death camps for the genocide of the European Jews were in Poland.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 78"/&gt; Broszat argued that this confusion in the public's mind between concentration and death camps and the tendency to erroneously describe Dachau as a death camp was aiding the early Holocaust deniers like [[Paul Rassinier]], [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] and [[David Hoggan]], who were making much of the fact that there was no functioning gas chamber at Dachau.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 78"/&gt;

In 1961, when the Polish-Jewish historian [[Joseph Wulf]] accused the prominent German doctor Dr Wilhelm Hagen, who served in the health department of the [[General Government]] during the war, of helping to liquidate Jews living in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], Broszat together with other experts from the Institute of Contemporary History were involved in the effort to silence Wulf during an exchange of letters in 1963.&lt;ref name="Context page 189"&gt;David Bankier and Dan Michman (eds.). ''Holocaust Historiography in Context: Emergence, Challenges, Polemics and Achievements''. New York: Yad Vashem Publications, 2009, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen, who was a senior official in the West German Ministry of Health, falsely claimed to have been opposed to the Holocaust and to have done everything in his power to save the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto and asked the Institute to support his version of events.&lt;ref name="Context page 189"/&gt; Broszat wrote a letter to Wulf demanding that he retract his allegations against Hagen "in the interest of the tidiness of the historical document" &lt;ref name="Context page 189"/&gt; The British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote that the Broszat-Wulf letters did not present Broszat in the best light, especially that Broszat seemed to have abandoned his support for Dr. Hagen very reluctantly and to have accepted Wulf's version only half-heartedly.&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"/&gt; Broszat only accepted Wulf's version after Wulf produced a war-time memo written by Hagen urging that sick Jews "wandering around" be shot down, which led Broszat to concede that perhaps Hagen was not the friend of the Ghetto he claimed to have been.&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"/&gt;

At the 1963–1965 [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials|Auschwitz Trial]] in [[Frankfurt]], Broszat together with other experts from the Institute of Contemporary History such as [[Helmut Krausnick]], Hans-Adolf Jacobsen and Hans Buchheim served as expert witnesses for the prosecution.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittman, Rebecca page 3"&gt;Rebecca Wittman. ''Beyond Justice''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; The report that they compiled for the prosecution served as the basis for their 1968 book ''Anatomy of the SS State'', the first comprehensive study of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] based on SS records.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittman, Rebecca page 3"/&gt; In 1983, Broszat together with the other experts from Institute for Contemporary History played a prominent role in debunking the Hitler Diaries.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 603"&gt;"Martin Broszat", in Deborah Andrews (ed.), ''The Annual Obituary 1989''. Chicago: St. James Press, 1990, pp. 602–603.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionalism==
Broszat argued against characterizing [[Nazi Germany]] as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime and criticized [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] and [[Ernst Nolte]] for advancing such a notion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; With [[Hans Mommsen]], Broszat developed a "structuralist" interpretation of Nazi Germany. Broszat saw Nazi Germany as a welter of competing institutions, putting forth the thesis that this internal rivalry, not [[Adolf Hitler]], provided the driving force behind Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Hitler in Broszat's controversial view, was (to use Mommsen's phrase), a "weak dictator"; as such, the [[Government of Nazi Germany]] was not a ''monocracy'' (rule by one man), rather a ''polycracy'' (rule by many).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In his 1969 book ''Der Staat Hitlers'' (''The Hitler State''), Broszat argued that Nazi Germany was dominated by a power struggle by various institutions and that these power struggles explained the course that Nazi Germany took.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 603"/&gt; Broszat pointed out that the Nazi State was dualistic; the normal institutions of the German state, (theoretically Nazified) operating in parallel to institutions of the Nazi Party, a rival power structure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Broszat was able to prove that beneath the public veneer of Nazi unity, there were endless power struggles between the revolutionary institutions of the Nazi Party and the organs of the traditional German state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In Broszat's view, these power struggles formed the dynamics and structures of the Nazi state, which were the driving forces behind Nazism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Broszat argued these power struggles were a Darwinian competition in which the "fittest" were the most radical elements of the Nazi movement, leading to "cumulative radicalization", to use another of Mommsen's phrases describing the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz. "Broszat, Martin" in Kelly Boyd (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Vol. 1. London: Fitzroy Dearborn, pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat rejected the view that Hitler was following a "divide and rule" strategy as argued by Bracher and instead argued that Hitler was unwilling and unable to provide for orderly government.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 75"&gt;Ian Kershaw. ''The Nazi Dictatorship''. London: Edward Arnold, 2000, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that Hitler allowed the Nazi state to become a collection of rival power blocs, which allowed for the release of extremely destructive forces into German society.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 75"/&gt;

That the Nazi state was a jumble of competing bureaucracies in perpetual power struggles has been widely accepted by historians.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; The second element, that Hitler was a "weak dictator" is less influential on the grounds that although Hitler did not involve himself much in daily administration, this apparent neglect stemmed not from an inability to do so (as Broszat suggested) but a lack of interest in the quotidian.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt;

Broszat was a [[Functionalism versus intentionalism|Functionalist]] on the origins of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat argued that the Nazis wanted to have "revolution in society" but because they needed the co-operation of the traditional elites in business, the military and the civil service, they turned their energy and hatred on those groups such as Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals and the mentally ill that the traditional elites did not care about.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; These groups were subjected to increasing persecution in the 1930s, beginning with internment in concentration camps (which were not initially death camps) and the "euthanasia" program (murder) of people with learning difficulties, escalating into the genocide of Jews in 1941–1942.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat argued that aggression abroad was part of the same process of lashing out against ''Volksfeinde'' and ''Volksfremde'' caused by the Nazi failure to achieve the sort of comprehensive revolution they sought in German society.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; After all, Hitler had frequently spoken of nationalizing not industry (as conventional socialists wanted) but the ''people''.

In Broszat's view, the evidence was lacking for the thesis that Hitler was executing a "Programme" in his [[Nazi Foreign Policy (debate)|foreign policy]].&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 139"&gt;Ian Kershaw. ''The Nazi Dictatorship''. London: Edward Arnold, 2000, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that Hitler's foreign policy was motivated by his need to maintain his image, which led to efforts to negate any form of restraint imposed by treaties or alliances.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 139"/&gt; For Broszat, the idea of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' was more of a vague utopian "metaphor" which served to provide a vision for the Nazi movement and was not a coherent foreign policy goal.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 139"/&gt; Broszat contended that prior to 1939, Hitler's lack of clear policy towards [[Poland]] proved that there could have no "Programme" in foreign policy, since Poland's geographical status as the land between Germany and the Soviet Union should have provided for a clear-cut Polish policy.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 139"/&gt; In a 1970 article that was a critique of [[Andreas Hillgruber]]'s theories, Broszat wrote that [[Operation Barbarossa]] was not "a calculated plan to realize his [Hitler's] ''Lebensraum'' ideas but that he felt compelled to get out from waiting in the summer of 1940 and proceed to a decisive ending of the war".&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs. ''The Hitler of History''. New York: Vintage Books, 1997, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, Broszat offered up harsh criticism of Hillgruber's book on German-Romanian relations by arguing that Hillgruber had seriously misunderstood the ''Reich'''s relations with Romania by focusing only on the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|''Auswärtiges Amt'']] and upon Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Rebecca "German Historians and the Romanian National Legionary State 1940-41" pages 676-683 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 71, Issue #4 October 1993 pages 678-679&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that there were two factions competing with each in regards to relations with Romania, namely the "old guard" which comprised the traditional German elites in the Wehrmacht and the ''Auswärtiges Amt'' who supported General [[Ion Antonescu]] and the "new guard" in the SS and the NSDAP who supported [[Horia Sima]] of the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name="Haynes pages 676-683"&gt;Haynes, Rebecca "German Historians and the Romanian National Legionary State 1940-41" pages 676-683 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 71, Issue #4 October 1993 page 679&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Broszat argued that German policy towards Romania between September 1940-January 1941 was largely incoherent with different factions in the German government supporting different factions in the Romanian government, which thus explained how in January 1941 the SS supported the Iron Guard's coup attempt against General Antonescu while the Wehrmacht and the ''Auswärtiges Amt'' supported Antonescu.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Haynes, Rebecca "German Historians and the Romanian National Legionary State 1940-41" pages 676-683 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 71, Issue #4 October 1993 page 678&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat maintained that Hillgruber's picture of German foreign policy being run by Hitler at every turn was incorrect because if that were true, the situation in January 1941 during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom]] with the SS supporting the Iron Guard's coup against General Antonescu who was being supported by the Wehrmacht and the ''Auswärtiges Amt'' would never had occurred.&lt;ref name="Haynes pages 676-683"/&gt; Broszat argued that ultimately Hitler chose to support Antonescu as part of his general preference for conservatives like Antonescu who were more capable of governing competently over radical fascists like the Iron Guard who were ideologically closer to him, but were also incompetent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

==Critique of David Irving: "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution'"==
In an article first published in the ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte'' journal in 1977, later translated into English as "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses", Broszat criticized [[David Irving]]'s argument in his book ''[[Hitler's War]]'' that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust but did accept Irving's argument that there was no written order from Hitler for the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question".&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 419–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat's essay was notable as the first account of the origins of the Holocaust by a respected historian in which responsibility for the genocide was not assigned entirely to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust In History'', Toronto: KeyPorter 2000, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Broszat took considerable pains to emphasize what he considered the unpleasant aspects of Hitler's character, writing at one point of Hitler's "totally irresponsible, self-deceiving, destructive and evilly misanthropic egocentricity and his lunatic fanaticism", in Broszat's opinion the Holocaust could not be explained solely with reference to Hitler or his ideas.&lt;ref name="Marrus, Michael 2000, page 41"&gt;Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust In History'', Toronto: KeyPorter 2000, page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broszat argued that the radical [[anti-Semitism]] of the Nazis had led them to embark on increasingly extreme attempts to expel the Jews of Europe, and after the failure of successive deportation schemes, the lower officials of the Nazi state had started exterminating people on their own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 399–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that the Holocaust began "bit by bit" as German officials stumbled into genocide.&lt;ref name="Marrus, Michael 2000, page 41"/&gt; Broszat argued that Hitler provided the goal to the functionaries of the German state "to get rid of the Jews and above all to make the territory of the ''Reich'' ''judenfrei'', i.e. clear of the Jews," without providing any guidelines as to how this was to be done.&lt;ref name="Marrus, Michael 2000, page 41"/&gt; German officials began a massive program of [[ethnic cleansing]] and mass expulsions in Poland and elsewhere without "clear aims…with respect to the subsequent fate of the deportees."&lt;ref name="Marrus, Michael 2000, page 41"/&gt; Following the abandonment of the [[Madagascar Plan]], after June 1941, German officials hoped that "…the {{sic|enormous}} spaces to be occupied in the Soviet Union would…offer a possibility for getting rid of the Jews of Germany and of the allied and occupied countries."&lt;ref name="Marrus, Michael 2000, page 41"/&gt; Broszat maintained that when faced with the stalemate on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the overwhelming of the European rail system by successive deportations and the self-imposed "problem" of three million Polish Jews the Germans had forced into ghettoes between 1939 and 1941, local German officials in Poland started in the fall of 1941 "improvised" killing schemes as the "simplest" solution to the "Jewish Question".&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch page 408.&lt;/ref&gt; In Broszat's opinion, Hitler subsequently approved of the measures initiated by the lower officials and allowed the expansion of the Holocaust from Eastern Europe to all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 408–413.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Broszat argued that the ''Shoah'' was not begun in response to an order, written or unwritten from Hitler, but was rather "a way out of the blind alley into which the Nazis had manoeuvred themselves".&lt;ref name="Marrus, Michael 2000, page 41"/&gt; Broszat argued that the Holocaust was not the result of a master-plan of Hitler's going back to when he wrote ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1924, but rather was the work of hundreds of thousands of German officials, many of whom were non-Nazis and most of whom were quite ordinary.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt;

In the same essay, Broszat was extremely critical of Irving's handling of sources, accusing him of repeatedly seeking to distort the historical record in Hitler's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 392–395 &amp; 413–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat wrote with regards to ''Hitler's War'' that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Irving] is too eager to accept authenticity for objectivity, is overly hasty in interpreting superficial diagnoses and often seems insufficiently interested in complex historical interconnections and in structural problems that transcend the mere recording of historical facts, but are essential for their evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 392–393.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broszat argued that in writing ''Hitler's War'', Irving was too concerned with the "antechamber aspects" of Hitler's headquarters and accused Irving of distorting facts in Hitler's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 393 and 413–419&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat complained that Irving was focused too much on military events at the expense of the broader political context of the war and that he had offered false interpretations such as accepting at face value the Nazi claim that the [[Action T4]] "euthanasia" program began in September 1939 to make hospital spaces for wounded German soldiers, when it began in January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch page 394.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat criticized Irving's claim that because of one telephone note written by Himmler stating "No liquidation" in regards to a train convoy of German Jews passing through [[Berlin]] to [[Riga]] (whom the SS intended to have all shot upon arrival) on 30 November 1941 that this proved that Hitler did not want to see the Holocaust happen.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 413–415&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that this was not proof that Hitler had given an order to Himmler to stop the killings of Jews but rather that the comment "No liquidation" referred to that train and was likely to relate to concerns about questions American reporters were asking about the fate of German Jews being sent to Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 414–415"&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 414–415&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat questioned whether Hitler had given Himmler any order to save the lives of the people aboard the train, given that the phone call Himmler made from the ''[[Wolfsschanze]]'' to Heydrich in Prague took place at about 11:30 A.M. and the records show that Hitler did not get up until about 2:00 P.M on 30 November 1941.&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 414–415"/&gt;

Broszat criticized Irving for accepting the "fantastic" claims of the SS ''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Karl Wolff]], that he did not know about the Holocaust (Irving's argument was that if Wolff did not know about the Holocaust, how could Hitler?), despite the fact that Wolff was convicted of war crimes in 1963 on the basis of documentary evidence implicating him in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 420–421&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat accused Irving of seeking to generate a highly misleading impression of a conference between Hitler and the Hungarian Regent, Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], in April 1943 by re-arranging the words to make Hitler appear less brutally anti-Semitic than the original notes showed.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch pages 427–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat maintained that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to engage in moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states, leading to Hitler's "fanatical, destructive will to annihilate" being downgraded to being "...no longer an exceptional phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch page 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism by Broszat was considered to be especially damaging to Irving because Broszat had based his critique largely on the examination of the primary sources Irving had used for ''Hitler's War''.

==''Alltagsgeschichte'' and the Bavaria Project==
Broszat was a pioneer of ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (history of everyday life).&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; To pursue this aim better he led the "Bavaria Project" between 1977 and 1983, which was intended be a comprehensive look at ''Alltagsgeschichte'' in [[Bavaria]] between 1933 and 1945.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; In ''Bayern in der NS-Zeit'' ("Bavaria in the National Socialist Era") as the six volumes written by the "Bavaria Project" team and edited by Broszat were entitled, depicted actions such as refusal to give the Nazi salute or regularly attending church as a type of [[German resistance|resistance]]. The emphasis upon resistance in "everyday life" in the "Bavaria Project" portrayed ''Widerstand'' (resistance) not as a contrast between black and white but rather shades of grey, noting that people who often refused to behave as the Nazi regime wanted in one area often conformed in others; as an example the Bavarian peasants who did business with Jewish cattle dealers in the 1930s despite the efforts of the Nazi regime to stop these transactions otherwise often expressed approval of the anti-Semitic laws.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work on the "Bavaria Project", Broszat formed the concept of ''Resistenz'' (immunity), which is not to be confused with resistance (in [[German language|German]] ''Widerstand'').&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; ''Resistenz'' referred to the ability of institutions such as the [[Wehrmacht]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the bureaucracy to enjoy "immunity" from the Nazi claims to total power and to function according to their traditional values, without seeking to challenge the Nazi regime's political monopoly.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat used the ''Resistenz'' concept to advance the view that at the local level, there was much continuity in Germany between the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Era]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat argued that there were two approaches to the ''Widerstand'' question, namely the "behavioral" approach that focused on intent and the "functional" approach that focused on the effect (''Wirkung'') on one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 194.&lt;/ref&gt; For Broszat, the concept of ''Resistenz'' was meant to explain how much of the German population was able to evade the Nazi "claim to total power" without seeking to fundamentally challenge the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 pages 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Resistenz'' concept proved to be controversial, with Swiss historian Walter Hofer stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of ''Resistenz'' leads to a levelling down of fundamental resistance against the system on one hand and actions criticizing more or less accidental, superficial manifestations on the other: the tyrannicide appears on the same plane as the illegal cattle-slaughterer.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 195"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hofer maintained that it was intent not effect that should provide the basis of judging resistance and opposition in Nazi Germany, that the things Broszat included under ''Resistenz'' were relatively unimportant and had no effect in the broader scheme of things on the Nazi regime's ability to achieve its goals.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 195"/&gt;

Klaus-Jürgen Müller argued that the term ''Widerstand'' should apply only to those having a "will to overcome the system" and that Broszat's ''Resistenz'' concept did too much to muddy the waters between by speaking of societal "immunity" to the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 195.&lt;/ref&gt; A more sympathetic appraisal of the ''Resistenz'' concept came from [[Manfred Messerschmidt]] and Heinz Boberach who argued that ''Widerstand'' should be defined from the viewpoint of the Nazi state and any activity that was contrary to the regime's wishes such as listening to [[jazz]] music should be considered as a form of ''Widerstand''.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Historikerstreit''==
During the ''[[Historikerstreit]]'' of 1986–1988, Broszat again strongly criticized Nolte's views and work. In a 1986 essay entitled "Where the Roads Part" in ''[[Die Zeit]]'' on 3 October 1986, Broszat called Nolte an obnoxious crank and attacked him for his "offensive" claims that the Holocaust had in someway been forced on the Nazi regime by fear of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Where the Roads Part" pages 125–129 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 126&lt;/ref&gt; As a socialist, Broszat argued against attempts to promote a "less extreme" view of the Nazi period.&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 603"/&gt; Broszat argued during the ''Historikerstreit'' that [[Andreas Hillgruber]] had come close to being a Nazi apologist and that Nolte was one.&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 125–129"&gt;Broszat, Martin "Where the Roads Part" pages 125–129 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 pages 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Nolte's claim that [[Chaim Weizmann]] on behalf of world Jewry had declared war on Germany in 1939, Broszat wrote Weizmann's letter to [[Neville Chamberlain]] promising the support of the Jewish Agency in World War II was not a "declaration of war" nor did Weizmann have the legal power to declare war on anyone.&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 125–129"/&gt; Broszat commented "These facts may be overlooked by a right-wing publicist with a dubious educational background but not by the college professor Ernst Nolte".&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 125–129"/&gt; Broszat accused [[Michael Stürmer]] of attempting to create an "ersatz religion" in German history that Broszat argued was more appropriate for the pre-modern era then 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin "Where the Roads Part" pages 125–129 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 pages 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat wrote that "Here the roads part" and argued that no self-respecting historian could associate himself with the effort to "drive the shame out of the Germans".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Broszat, Martin "Where the Roads Part" pages 125–129 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 129&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat ended his essay with the remark that such "perversions" of German history must be resisted in order to ensure the German people a better future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=="Historicization" of National Socialism and the Debate with Saul Friedländer==
He was best known for arguing in a 1985 essay "A Plea For the Historicization of National Socialism" that Nazi Germany should be treated as a "normal" period of history.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; His call for "historicization" of the treatment of Nazi Germany was controversial, as Broszat called for historians to cease judging the period in overtly moralistic tones and to embark instead upon scientific, dispassionate analysis as they would for any other time.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; For Broszat, because historians did not treat the Nazi period the same way other periods were treated, this distance between the historian and his/her subject in regards to the Nazi era led to the Nazi period being treated as "island" of "abnormality".&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 220"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that the Nazi period was a chapter of German history and historians needed to stop treating the Nazi times as one of utter evil with no connection to what came before and after in German history.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; In Broszat's opinion, the "insulation" that severed the Nazi period from the rest of German history had to be ended&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt;

Broszat called the "normalization" of the Nazi era by focusing on ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' approach that allow shades of gray by examining both the "normality" of "everyday life" and the "barbarity" of the regime.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 221"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 221.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this "normalization", Broszat called for the end of the teleological approach that saw [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] as the culmination of the Nazi regime and instead paid heed to the fact that for most Germans the Holocaust was of marginal concern during the Nazi era and that Auschwitz did not obtain its iconic status as the supreme symbol of evil and inhumanity until after 1945.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat urged that historians stop the black and white treatment between "evil" Nazis and "good" anti-Nazis in German society and instead used the more "realistic" approach of noting the shades of grey within German society.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; As an example of "shades of grey", Broszat noted that the man designated to serve as Germany's new chancellor if the [[July 20 Plot]] had succeeded, [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] was an anti-Semite.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Broszat, Martin "A Plea for the Historicization of National Socialism" pages 77–87 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldiwn, Boston, 1990 pages 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat noted that the simplistic contrast between totally "good" anti-Nazis vs. completely "evil" Nazis led to historians ignoring Goerdeler's anti-Semitism to keep the camps of good and evil pure. Broszat called for a history that could allow one take in account nuances and degrees of agreement between German anti-Nazis and Nazis, thus allowing historians to write a history that could allow one to accept the fact that one could be both an anti-Nazi and an anti-Semite.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Broszat called for the Nazi period to be integrated into the broad stream of German history and called for a long-range view of the German past, with the Nazi era seen as a stage of the broader story of German history rather than being treated as an abnormal period that was not connected to what came before or after.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 220"/&gt; Broszat wrote that "not all those historically significant developments which occurred in Germany during the Nazi period merely served the regime's goals of inhuman and dictatorial domination" and called for a broader look at the Nazi era.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Peter "The ''Historikerstreit'' in Context" pages 3–37 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldiwn, Boston, 1990 page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat used as an example of his approach, the "Ley Plan" as the wide-ranging reform of the German [[social insurance]] system proposed in 1940 by the [[German Labour Front|DAF]] was known, which Broszat noted borne many striking similarities to the British [[Beveridge Report|Beveridge Plan]] of 1943 (though the German plan applied only to those classified as "Aryans")&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 77–87"&gt;Broszat, Martin "A Plea for the Historicization of National Socialism" pages 77–87 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldiwn, Boston, 1990 page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Broszat argued that such a comparative approach would place the Nazi era in a better broader European and German context, especially since Broszat argued that the German plan of 1940 was in many ways the forerunner of the West German social insurance plan of 1957 with such features as pensions guaranteed by the state indexed to the level of GNP (which was not surprising given that many of the same people worked on both plans)&lt;ref name="Broszat pages 77–87"/&gt; Broszat called for the "normalization" of the historical understanding of the Nazi era with detailed scholarship employing "mid-range" concepts based upon empirical research and rejecting the moralistic condemnation of the period.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 221"/&gt; Based upon his work in ''Alltagsgeschichte'', Broszat felt that particular attention should be paid to the "normality" for most people of everyday life in Nazi Germany and how this "normality" co-existed with the "barbarity" of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 221"/&gt; Broszat' call for "historicization" was much influenced by his work in the field of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' and by his functionalist understanding of the Nazi period&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Peter "The ''Historikerstreit'' in Context" pages 3–37 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldiwn, Boston: Beacon Press, 1990 page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Broszat's call for the "historization" of National Socialism, the historian [[Rainer Zitelmann]] suggested that Broszat's "historization" approach was a fruitful view that just as not everything was evil in the Soviet Union, not everything was evil about Nazi Germany and that the Nazi regime accomplished many successful social reforms&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The American historian [[Gavriel David Rosenfeld|Gavriel D. Rosenfeld]] wrote about Broszat's call for "historization" that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the 1980s, the German historian Martin Broszat famously argued that overtly moral analyses of the Third Reich suffered from their embrace of a "black-and-white" perspective that drew too rigid a dichotomy between perpetrators and victims, obscured the era's gray complexity, bracketed off the Third Reich from "normal" modes of historical analysis (such as an empathetic perspective towards the historical actors themselves) and prevented it from being integrated into the large sweep of German history... At the same time, an overly moralistic view runs the risk of mythologizing history and transforming it into a collection of moral ethical lessons that, over time, can easily become stale and cease to resonate within society at large. It was for this reason that German historian Martin Broszat in the 1980s called on German to "historicize" the Nazi era by abandoning their simplistic black-and-white image of the Third Reich as a story of demonic villains and virtuous heroes and replacing it with a grayer perspective that recognized the period's immense complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Gavriel ''The World Hitler Never Made'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 21 &amp; 393.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Nazi era as opposed to the "demonization" of the period, involved him in a vigorous debate with three Israeli historians in the latter half of the 1980s. The three historians Broszat debated were Otto Dov Kulka, Dan Diner and above all with the Franco-Israeli historian [[Saul Friedländer]].&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; During an exchange of letters with Broszat during the late 1980s, Friedländer argued that there were three dilemmas and three problems involved in the "historicization" of the Nazi period.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 223"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dilemma was that of historical periodization and how long-term social changes could be related to an understanding of the Nazi period.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 223"/&gt; Friedländer argued that focusing on long-term social changes such as the growth of the welfare state from the Imperial to Weimar to the Nazi periods to the present as Broszat suggested changed the focus on historical research from the particular of the Nazi era to the general ''[[longue durée]]'' (long duration) of 20th-century German history.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 223"/&gt; Friedländer felt that "relative relevance" of the growth of the welfare state under the Nazi government and its relationship to post-war developments would cause historians to lose attention of the genocidal politics of the Nazi state.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 223"/&gt; The second dilemma Friedländer felt that by treating the Nazi period as a "normal" period of history and by examining the aspects of "normality" might run the danger of causing historians to lose interest in the "criminality" of the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 224"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a concern for Friedländer because he contended that aspects of "normality" and "criminality" very much overlapped in the everyday life of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 224"/&gt; The third dilemma involved was Friedländer considered the vague definition of "historicization" entailed and might allow historians to advance apologetic arguments about National Socialism such as those Friedländer accused [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[Andreas Hillgruber]] of making.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 224"/&gt; Friedländer conceded that Broszat was not an apologist for Nazi Germany like Nolte and Hillgruber.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 224"/&gt; Friedländer noted that through the concept of "historicization" was a highly awkward one because it opened the door to the type of arguments that Nolte and Hillgruber advanced during the ''Historikerstreit'', Broszat's motives in calling for the "historicization" were honourable.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 224"/&gt;

The first problem for Friedländer was that the Nazi era was too recent in popular memory for historians to deal with it as a "normal" period as for example 16th century France.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 225"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The second problem was "differential relevance" of "historicization".&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 225"/&gt; Friedländer argued that the study of the Nazi period was "global", that it belongs to everyone and that by focusing on everyday life was a particular interest for German historians.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 225"/&gt; Friedländer asserted that for non-Germans, the history of Nazi ideology in practice especially in regards to war and genocide were vastly more important then ''Alltagsgeschichte''.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 225"/&gt; The third problem for Friedländer was that the Nazi period was unique so that it could not easily fit into the long-range view of German history as advocated by Broszat.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 226"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' London: Edward Arnold, 2000 page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer maintained that the essence of National Socialism was that it "tried to determine who should and should not inhabit the world" and the genocidal politics of the Nazi regime resisted any attempt to integrate it as part of the "normal" development of the modern world.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 226"/&gt; The debate between Broszat and Friedländer were conducted through a series of letters between 1987 until Broszat's death in 1989. In 1990, the Broszat-Friedländer correspondence were translated into English and published in ''Reworking the Past Hitler, The Holocaust and the Historians' Debate'' edited by [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]].

In a letter of 28 September 1987, Broszat conceded to Friedländer that the "historicization" concept was open to abuse but argued that the concept was needed as the Nazi period had to be subject to rational historical analysis and was needed to provide a sensible way of understanding the Nazi era&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin &amp; Friedländer, Saul "A Controversy About the Historicization of National Socialism" pages 102–132 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldwin Boston: Beacon Press, 1990 page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Friedländer wrote that he did not feel that there was a "blockade" severing the Nazi period from the rest of German history, used Hillgruber's essay in his 1986 book ''Zweierlei Untergang'' calling for historians to sympathize with German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in 1944–45 as an example of the abuse of "historicization" and described Broszat's condemnation on a "moralistic" history written that assigned a leading role to the "victims" of National Socialism as a very troubling&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin &amp; Friedländer, Saul "A Controversy About the Historicization of National Socialism" pages 102–132 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldwin Boston: Beacon Press, 1990 pages 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter of 26 October 1987, Broszat wrote he was concerned that because of the iconic status of Auschwitz too much history was being written backwards with historians starting with Auschwitz and treating everything in Nazi Germany as a long countdown to genocide&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin &amp; Friedländer, Saul "A Controversy About the Historicization of National Socialism" pages 102–132 from ''Reworking the Past'' edited by Peter Baldwin Boston: Beacon Press, 1990 page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

An even harsher assessment of Broszat's "historicization" concept than Friedländer's came from the Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]], who accused Broszat of being a German apologist and of seeking to diminish Jewish suffering in the Holocaust, indeed the Holocaust as a study in history because as a German historian he was not comfortable with dealing with Germans as perpetrators of genocide and Jews as victims of German genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Bartov, Omer ''Germany's war and the Holocaust'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2003 pages 232–234&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the American historian [[John Lukacs]] approved of Broszat's call for "historicization," but also suggested "that the 'historicization' of the Nazi period had begun more than thirty years before Professor Broszat pronounced its desirability."&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'', New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pages 5, 11&lt;/ref&gt; The German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] wrote that Broszat had written "convincingly" on the need for "historicization"&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing" pages 34–44 from ''Forever In the Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Mommsen]] praised Broszat's call for "historicization" as a way to avoid "...this ubiquitous tendency to "shake off the mortgages of a past now happily made morally neutral"".&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Hans "The Search for the 'Lost History'" pages 101–113 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 107&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] praised Broszat's "historicization" concept as offering a "rational" way of understanding the German past and as a "gain" to history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York : Pantheon Books, 1989 page 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Broszat saw his work as ''kritische Aufklärungsarbeit'' ("critical enlightenment work") and criticized his colleagues for adopting what he perceived as an ahistorical, moralistic approach to history.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat's motto was "''Geschichte ist nicht Wissen, sondern Leben''" (History is not knowledge, but experience").&lt;ref name="Deborah Andrews page 602"/&gt; Broszat often attacked historians such as [[Klaus Hildebrand]], [[Andreas Hillgruber]] and [[Eberhard Jäckel]] for concentrating upon Hitler and his beliefs as explanations for Nazi actions.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Broszat saw professional history as a social science that should examine society and culture rather than an individual in explaining the past.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/&gt; Though in disagreement with some of Broszat's conclusions, the British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] is Broszat's leading disciple.

In 2002, the American historian Nicholas Berg revealed that Broszat had joined the N.S.D.A.P, and then had hidden his party membership after the war, which Berg used to suggest that Broszat's work was an apologia for National Socialism.&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"/&gt; Berg's attack generated much controversy about the legacy of Broszat.&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"/&gt; In response, Kershaw wrote that though Broszat's letters to Wulf were a "mistake", Berg's claims that Broszat was a Nazi apologist were "absurd".&lt;ref name="Kershaw 2004"/&gt;

==History==
===Historical outline summary===
The city was named by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Vespasian]] in 72 CE as ''Flavia Neapolis''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. The Roman period was followed by the Byzantine period, where in the 5th and 6th centuries, conflict between the city's [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city.

In 636, in the early Muslim period, ''Neapolis'', along with most of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], came under the rule of the [[Islam]]ic [[Rashidun|Arab Caliphate]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]]; its name [[Arabic language|Arabicized]] to ''Nablus''. In 1099, the [[Crusade]]rs took control of the city for less than a century, leaving its mixed Muslim, Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed. This was followed by the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. After [[Saladin]]'s [[Ayyubid]] forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187, Islamic rule was reestablished, and continued under the [[Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires to follow.

Following its incorporation into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the ''Jabal Nablus'' ("Mount Nablus") district. In 1657, after a series of upheavals, a number of [[Arab]] clans from the northern and eastern [[Levant]] were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority, and loyalty from among these clans staved off challenges to the empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like [[Zahir al-Umar]] in the 18th century, and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]—who briefly ruled Nablus—in the 19th century. When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.

After the city was captured by British forces during [[World War I]], Nablus was incorporated into the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in 1922. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the city was captured by [[Jordan|Transjordan]], and became subsequently part of Jordan in 1952 together with the rest of the West Bank. Jordanian authority was held until [[Israel]]i [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation]] took control of the city in the wake of the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Since 1995, the city has been governed by the [[Palestinian National Authority]].

===Classical antiquity===
{{further|Samaritan Revolts|Samaria}}
Flavia Neapolis ("new city of the emperor [[Flavius]]") was named in 72 CE by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Vespasian]] and applied to an older [[Samaritan]] village, variously called ''Mabartha'' ("the passage")&lt;ref name=Negevp175&gt;Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Mamorpha''.&lt;ref&gt;(a) ὅθεν διὰ τῆς Σαμαρείτιδος καὶ παρὰ τὴν Νέαν πόλιν καλουμένην, Μαβαρθὰ δ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιχωρίων, καταβὰς εἰς Κορέαν, [[Josephus]], ''[[Bellum Judaicum]]'',4:449

Due to the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former [[Judea]]n [[toparchy]] of [[Aqraba, Nablus|Acraba]].&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;

Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman [[grid plan]] and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists.&lt;ref name=Negevp175/&gt; In the 2nd century CE, Emperor [[Hadrian]] built a grand [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people.&lt;ref name="Semplici"/&gt; Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as [[Zeus]], [[Artemis]], [[Serapis]], and [[Asklepios]].&lt;ref name=Negevp175/&gt; Neapolis was entirely [[Paganism|pagan]] at this time.&lt;ref name=Negevp175/&gt; [[Justin Martyr]] who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with [[Platonism]], but not with Christians there.&lt;ref name=Negevp175/&gt; The city flourished until the civil war between [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]] in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] instead.&lt;ref name=Negevp175/&gt;

In 244 CE, [[Philip the Arab]] transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named ''Julia Neapolis''. It retained this status until the rule of [[Trebonianus Gallus]] in 251 CE. The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE.&lt;ref name="OCHA"/&gt; It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325 CE.&lt;ref name=Negevp176&gt;Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE.&lt;ref name=Negevp176/&gt; As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.&lt;ref name=Negevp176/&gt;

[[File:Ancient ruins in a Nablus neighborhood.JPG|thumb|right|Ruins from antiquity (foreground) in a residential area in Nablus, 2008]]

Conflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the [[Palaestina Prima]] province under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The tension was a result of [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] Christian attempts to prevent the return of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Juvenal of Jerusalem|Juvenal]], to his [[episcopal see]].&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.

As tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the [[Samaritans]] grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of [[Aaron]]'s sons and grandsons [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]] and [[Phinehas]]. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to [[Constantinople]], requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] erected a church dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;

Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of [[Julianus ben Sabar]] in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop [[Ammonas]] was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of [[saint]]s. The forces of Emperor [[Justinian I]] were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;

===Early Islamic era===
[[File:Nablus Great Mosque-cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Minaret and entrance of 10th century Great Mosque of Nablus, 1908]]
Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the [[Muslim]]s under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], a general of the [[Rashidun army]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]], in 636 after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]].&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNTA"/&gt; The city's name was retained in its [[Arabic language|Arabicize]]d form, ''Nabulus''. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of [[Islam]]ic [[Arab]] rule under the [[Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid]] dynasties. Under Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and [[Persian people|Persian]]s, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; In the 10th century, the Arab geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]], described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved [[Great Mosque of Nablus|Great Mosque]], houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills.&lt;ref name=Muqaddasip55&gt;Muqaddasi, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028534265#page/n83/mode/2up/search/neapolis p. 55].&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that it was nicknamed "Little [[Damascus]]."&lt;ref name="Semplici"&gt;Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario.

===Crusader period===
{{see also|Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
The city was captured by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in 1099, under the command of [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Prince Tancred]], and renamed ''Naples''.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there.&lt;ref name="Andersonp72"/&gt; Nablus became part of the [[royal domain]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the [[Council of Nablus]] out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church.&lt;ref name="Andersonp72"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIcWAoiRhgAC|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TIcWAoiRhgAC&amp;pg=PA72 72]|title=The Keepers: an introduction to the history and culture of the Samaritans|first1=Robert T.|last1=Anderson|first2=Terry|last2=Giles|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=2002|ISBN=1565635191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s.&lt;ref name=Smithp70&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-noOrtrox4C|title=The crusades: a history|first1=Jonathan|last1=Riley-Smith|edition=2nd, illustrated|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2005|ISBN= 9780826472700|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-noOrtrox4C&amp;pg=PA70 70]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1137, Arab and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] troops stationed in [[Damascus]] raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and Resurrection of [[Jesus]], and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;

===Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===
[[File:Interior view of Nasr Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|Interior view of the [[An-Nasr Mosque]], converted from a [[Crusades|Crusader]] church to a mosque in the 13th century]]
Crusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the [[Ayyubid]]s led by [[Saladin]] captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Christians]] fled Nablus, but the original [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian inhabitants remained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Syrian geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a "celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district." He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city.&lt;ref name="le Strange"&gt;Le Strange, 1890, pp.511–515.&lt;/ref&gt;
After its recapture by the Muslims, the [[Great Mosque of Nablus]], which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a [[mausoleum]] in the old city.&lt;ref name="OCHA"/&gt; 

{{anchor|Battle of Nablus (1242)}}
In October 1242, Nablus was raided by the [[Knights Templar]]. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, [[An-Nasir Dawud]], against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].
The successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of [[San Bevignate]], [[Perugia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xifq5OE7174C&amp;pg=PA169|title=Crusader Art in the Holy Land, From the Third Crusade to the Fall of Acre|first1=Jaroslav|last1=Folda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1244, the Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon and converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into [[al-Khadra Mosque]]. Two other Crusader churches became the [[An-Nasr Mosque]] and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersonp72"/&gt;

The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]] gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools.&lt;ref name="DNTA"/&gt; Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many [[Turkish bath]]s and exported olive oil and [[Nabulsi soap|soap]] to [[Egypt]], Syria, the [[Hejaz]], several [[Mediterranean]] islands, and the [[Arabian Desert]]. The city's olive oil was also used in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Damascus. [[Ibn Battuta]], the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city "full of trees and streams and full of olives." He noted that the city grew and exported [[carob]] jam to [[Cairo]] and Damascus.&lt;ref name="le Strange"/&gt;

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Nablus jacob well 1912.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob's Well]], 1912]]
Nablus came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six ''[[sanjak|sanjaqs]]'' ("districts"): [[Safad]], [[Jenin]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ajlun]] and [[District of Nablus|Nablus]], all of which were part of [[Ottoman Syria]]. These five ''sanjaqs'' were subdistricts of the [[Vilayet of Damascus]]. Sanjaq Nablus was further subdivided into five ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the ''nahiya'' were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as [[Beita, Nablus|Beita]] and [[Aqraba, Nablus|Aqraba]], were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the ''nahiya''.&lt;ref name="Doumani3"&gt;Doumani, 1995, Chapter: The 1657 Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Lewis, Studies in the Ottoman Archives—I, ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1954), 469–501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutteroth"/&gt;

After decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab ''vilayets''. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab ''[[sipahi]]'' officers from central [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab ''sipahi'' officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the [[ulama]] and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, [[Turkish bath|bathhouses]], agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.&lt;ref name="Doumani3"/&gt;

The most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]'s rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from [[Balqa Governorate|Balqa]] and the [[Tuqan clan|Tuqan]]s from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of ''[[mutasallim]]'' (tax collector, strongman) of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Doumani3"/&gt;

[[File:Tristram142a.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus, by [[Medlycott baronets|W. C. P. Medlycott]], in [[Henry Baker Tristram|H. B. Tristram]], 1865&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Baker Tristram|H. B. Tristram]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qd8TAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=toc&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA142-IA2,M1 The Land of Israel: Travels in Palestine], p. 142, 1865&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the mid-18th century, [[Zahir al-Umar]], the autonomous Arab ruler of the [[Galilee]] became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the [[cotton]] and olive oil trade of the [[southern Levant]], including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the [[Ali Bey al-Kabir|Egyptian Mamluk]] invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, [[Jezzar Pasha]], maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.&lt;ref name="Doumani4"/&gt;

===Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival===
[[File:Nablus 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1898]]
In 1831-32 [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Khedivate Egypt]], then led by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of [[conscription]] and new [[taxation]] was instituted which led to a [[Peasants' Revolt of 1834 (Palestine)|revolt]] organized by the ''[[Palestinian nationalism#Notables|a'ayan]]'' (notables) of Nablus, [[Hebron]] and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area. In May 1834, [[Qasim al-Ahmad]]—the chief of the [[Jamma'in]] ''nahiya''—rallied the rural sheikhs and ''[[fellahin]]'' (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.&lt;ref name="Doumani4"&gt;Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Egyptian rule, 1831–1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] in 1840–41. However, the [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]]-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.&lt;ref name="Doumani4"/&gt;

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of [[Jaffa]] and Acre. [[Olive oil]] was the primary product of Nablus and fueled other related industries such as [[Nabulsi soap|soap-making]] and basket weaving.&lt;ref name="Doumani"/&gt; It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus.&lt;ref name="Doumani5"/&gt; Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of [[autonomy]] than other ''sanjaqs'' under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no "foreigners" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct "supervision" of the Ottoman government, according to historian [[Beshara Doumani]].&lt;ref name="Doumani"&gt;Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and British Mandate===
[[File:Nablus 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1918]]
Between 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the [[Battle of Sharon]] during the set piece [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. Fighting took place in the [[Judean Hills]] where the [[British Empire]]'s [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX Corps]] and airforce attacked the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Yildirim Army Group]]'s [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh Army]] which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] had attempted to retreat to, in vain.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P.

===Jordanian period===
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Nablus came under [[Jordan]]ian control. Thousands of Palestinian refugees fleeing from areas captured by [[Israel]] arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are [[Ein Beit al-Ma']], [[Balata]] and [[Askar (camp)|Askar]]. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of [[Rafidia]], [[Balata al-Balad]], al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Abujidi, 2014, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli period===
The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many [[Israeli settlement]]s were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

From the start of the [[Second Intifada]], Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) and Palestinians.

===Old City===
{{See also|Levantine archaeology#Nablus}}
[[File:Old city of Nablus.JPG|thumb|left|Alley in the Old City leading to and from the [[souk]], 2008]]

In the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the [[Abd al-Hadi Palace]] built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several [[mosque]]s in the Old City: The [[Great Mosque of Nablus]], An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, [[al-Khadra Mosque]], [[Hanbali Mosque]], al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others&lt;ref name="Semplici-a"&gt;Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario.

There are six ''hamaams'' ([[Turkish bath]]s) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa Hamaam was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last ''hamaam'' built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994.&lt;ref name="Semplici"/&gt; Several leather tanneries, ''[[souk]]s'', pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doumani2"/&gt; There are a number of historic monuments in the old city including the [[Khan al-Tujjar (Nablus)|Khan al-Tujjar]] and the [[Manara Clock Tower|al-Manara Clock Tower]] built in 1906.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;

===Religion===
In 891 CE, during the early centuries of [[Islam]]ic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, local [[Muslim]]s and Christians. Arab geographer [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city.&lt;ref name="le Strange"/&gt; At the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]], the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.&lt;ref name="Census1931"/&gt;  However, this census was taken after the [[1929 Palestine riots]] which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain, 1930: Report of the Commission on the disturbances of August 1929, Command paper 3530 (Shaw Commission report), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small [[Palestinian Christian|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] communities as well. Much of the local [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&amp;cat=18 The Political History of the Samaritans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119035811/http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&amp;cat=18 |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.&lt;ref name=Ireton&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samaritans – A Jewish Sect in Israel: Strategies for Survival of an Ethno-religious Minority in the Twenty First Century|author=Sean Ireton|publisher=Anthrobase|year=2003|accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/I/Ireton_S_01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrmea.com/archives/Jan_Feb_2008/0801050.html |title="We Need Justice," Says Father Yousef Sa’adah, a Melkite Priest in Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Corillet |first=Joel |date=February 2008 |work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Christian populace, there are seventy [[Orthodox Christian]] families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic &amp; Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty [[Anglican]] families.

==Economy==

===Historic===
[[File:Manara clocktower.JPG|thumb|Manara clock tower in the Old City]]

Beginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]] were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]] regions to the south and east, as well as in the [[Anatolian Peninsula]] and the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. Nablus also developed trade relations with [[Aleppo]], [[Mosul]], and [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="Doumani2"&gt;Doumani, 1995, Chapter: The City of Nablus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman government ensured adequate safety and funding for the annual [[hajj|pilgrimage]] caravan (''qafilat al-hajj'') from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. This policy benefited Nablus economically. Pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, [[Farrukh Pasha]], was appointed leader of the pilgrimage caravan (''[[amir al-hajj]]''), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.&lt;ref name="Doumani2"/&gt;

In 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 [[loom]]s exporting their products throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Semplici"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml |title="Little Damascus": Nablus City, West Bank |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Islam Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413023559/http://www.islamonline.net/English/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity — to Cairo by caravan through [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and by sea through the ports of [[Jaffa]] and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and [[Damietta]], Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, [[sugar]], and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.&lt;ref name="Doumani2"/&gt;

With regard to the local economy, agriculture was the major component. Outside of the city limits, there were extensive fields of [[olive]] groves, [[ficus|fig]] and [[pomegranate]] orchards and [[grape]] vineyards that covered the area's slopes. Crops, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and ''[[mulukhiyya]]'' were grown in the fields, vegetable gardens, and grain mills scattered across central [[Samaria]].&lt;ref name="Doumani2"/&gt; Nablus was also the largest producer of [[cotton]] in the Levant, producing over {{convert|225000|kg|0|abbr=on}} of the product by 1837.&lt;ref name="Doumani5"&gt;Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Cotton Production in Jabal Nablus.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:Placa dels màrtirs Nablus.jpg|thumb|Downtown Nablus, Martyrs Square]]

Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and a [[shopping mall]].&lt;ref name=Assadi&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110622051321/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F7%2F18%2Fworldupdates%2F2009-07-18T174715Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-411404-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates "Nablus shopping festival brightens up West Bank,"] Mohammed Assadi, July 18, 2009, Malaysia Star.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional industries continue to operate in Nablus, such as the production of soap, olive oil, and [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]]. Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and [[leather tanning]]. The city is also a regional trading center for live produce. Most of these industries are centered in the old city.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;

The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter from the factory is exported to [[Jordan]].&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="OCHA"/&gt; There are eight restaurants in the city and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen.&lt;ref name=KimLeep354&gt;Kim Lee, 2003, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Nablus' once-thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from [[West Bank closures]] and IDF incursions.

The Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.&lt;ref name="LevyHaaretz"&gt;[[Gideon Levy]], [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/twilight-zone/palestinian-ice-cream-s-big-comeback.premium-1.455762 'Palestinian ice cream's big comeback,'] at [[Haaretz]], 3 August 2012.'They buy the ingredients mainly from Israeli suppliers .'&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade.&lt;ref name="OCHA"/&gt; In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an [[OCHA]] report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city,&lt;ref name="ocha1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/OCHA_Body-ASP_Files/Coordination_Sec/OCHA-oPt_FCU_BIOs_PDFs/OCHA-oPt_Nablus-FCU_Bio_Data-22Nov04.pdf |title=Bio Data – Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |format=PDF |publisher=United Nation Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409050228/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/OCHA_Body-ASP_Files/Coordination_Sec/OCHA-oPt_FCU_BIOs_PDFs/OCHA-oPt_Nablus-FCU_Bio_Data-22Nov04.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the relocation of many businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/Commercial%20Crossings%20V5.pdf |title=Increasing Need, Decreasing Access: Tightening Control On Economic Movement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314071422/http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/commercial%20crossings%20v5.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the removal of the [[Hawara]] roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace.&lt;ref name="LevyHaaretz"/&gt; Nablus is home to the [[Palestine Securities Exchange]] (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on February 19, 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million [[Jordanian dinar]]s.&lt;ref name="Semplici"/&gt;

==Education==

Nablus is also home to [[an-Najah National University]], the largest [[List of Palestinian universities|Palestinian university]] in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the [[First Intifada]], but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the [[humanities]] and nine in the [[sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.najah.edu/nnu_portal/index.php?page=56&amp;lang=en |title=About An-Najah |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=An-Najah National University Official Website |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416155403/http://www2.najah.edu/nnu_portal/index.php?page=56&amp;lang=en |archivedate = April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==
There are six [[hospital]]s in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani(the National) and the Rafidia Surgery Hospital. The latter, located in Rafidia, a suburb in western Nablus, is the largest hospital in the city.

==Culture and arts==
[[File:Nablus1.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional Nablus dress featuring brightly colored coat draped over head and shoulders]]

Nablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the [[Arab world]] with significant and unique contributions to [[Palestinian culture]], [[Palestinian cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Palestinian costumes|costume]]. ''Nabulsi'', meaning "from Nablus", is used to describe items such as [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]] (e.g. [[Nabulsi soap]]) and food products (e.g. [[Nabulsi cheese]]) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.

===Traditional costume===
{{Main|Palestinian costumes}}
Nablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing ''[[souk]]'' ("market"), in late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] [[silk]] to [[Manchester]] [[cotton]]s and [[Calico (fabric)|calico]]s. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the [[Galilee]], both long and short [[Turkish culture|Turkish style]] jackets were worn over the ''thob'' ("robe"). For daily wear, ''thobs'' were often made of white cotton or [[linen]], with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the ''qabbeh'' ("square chest piece").&lt;ref name=PCA2&gt;{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-08-01 |url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020913101705/http%3A//www%2Epalestinecostumearchive%2Eorg/regional%2Ehtm |archivedate= September 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Kinafa.jpg|right|thumb|A ''siniyyeh'' of [[Kanafeh]] ]]
Nablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of "high cuisine", such as that of [[Damascus]] or [[Baghdad]]. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the [[Arab world]] and the former [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]].

''[[Kanafeh]]'' is the most famed ''Nabulsi'' sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, ''kanafeh Nabulsi'' enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called ''[[Nabulsi cheese|jibneh Nabulsi]]''. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for ''kanafeh''.

Other sweets made in Nablus include ''[[baklawa]]'', "Tamriya", ''mabrumeh'' and ''ghuraybeh'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/nablus.html |title=Nablus, Holy Land |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an "S"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nablusculture.ps/nablus,sweets.htm |title=Nabulsi Sweets |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus the Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural centers===
There are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/child_cult_center.htm |title=Child Cultural Center |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998.

Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day [[Jordan]] in large [[Camel train|caravans]]. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural [[alkaline]] soda powder called ''qilw''.&lt;ref name=SEMP/&gt; Today, ''qilw'' is still used in combination with lime.

==Local government==
[[File:Clocktower downtown Nablus.JPG|thumb|right|New clock tower at Martyrs Square in downtown Nablus]]
The city of Nablus is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) of the [[Nablus Governorate]], and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.&lt;ref name="NMMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/aboutus/municipal_council.htm |title=Nablus Municipal Council |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two primary political parties in the municipal council are [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]]. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the [[Palestinian People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.&lt;ref name="Results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ps/admin/pdf/Municipal_Elections_Results_EN_(4).pdf |title=2005 Palestinian Local Elections, round 4 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |publisher=Higher Commission for Local Elections }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled due to Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor [[Ghassan Shakaa]] and one headed by Amin Makboul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=117616#axzz0xEaOeWPj |title=A Palestinian election is aborted, again |publisher=Daily Star |accessdate=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Lynfield |title=Hamas election boycott leaves West Bank Palestinians with only one choice |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/1006/Hamas-election-boycott-leaves-West-Bank-Palestinians-with-only-one-choice |work= |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Danny |last=Whatmough |url=http://nablus.dannywhatmough.com/2012/10/21/west-bank-elections-demonstrate-extent-of-political-divide/ |title=West Bank elections demonstrate extent of political divide |date=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayors===
{{Main|List of mayors of Nablus}}
Modern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On July 2, 1980, [[Bassam Shakaa]], then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a [[car bombing]] carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the [[Gush Emunim Underground]] movement.&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=600596 |first=Danny |last=Rubenstein |authorlink=Danny Rubenstein |title=Fighting words/Far from the madding crowd |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current mayor, [[Adly Yaish]], a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during [[Operation Summer Rains]], launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] by Hamas.&lt;ref name="ynet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403756,00.html |title=Palestinians report IDF forces raid Nablus overnight in arrest operation, taking 33 Hamas leaders into custody, including PA minister of education, mayors of Nablus, Qalqiliya |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Waked |first=Ali |date=24 May 2007 |work=Ynet News |publisher=Yedioth Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa "Dweikat", Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested.&lt;ref name="NMMC"/&gt; He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicweb.ca/scene/2009/07/globe-mails-patrick-martin-on-the-booming-west-bank/ |title=CIC Scene » Globe &amp; Mail’s Patrick Martin on the Booming West Bank |publisher=www.cicweb.ca |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706173636/http://www.cicweb.ca/scene/2009/07/globe-mails-patrick-martin-on-the-booming-west-bank/ |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=245 |title=Electricity Department Statistics |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725051139/http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=245 |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the reminaing 7% connected through cesspits.&lt;ref name="PCBS4"&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/nab_t10.aspx Occupied Housing Units by Locality and Connection to Electricity Network in Housing Unit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118181751/https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/nab_t10.aspx |date=2008-11-18 }} &lt;br&gt;

===Fire department===
Nablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the "fire brigade" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and [[Tubas Governorate]]s. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=256&amp;id_csub=279 |title=Fire Brigade |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728173315/http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=256&amp;id_csub=279 |archivedate=2009-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
In the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the [[Jezreel Valley railway]]'s [[Afula]] station, itself a spur from the [[Hejaz railway]]. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabataea.net/hejazbk3.html The Hejaz Railroad] Nabataea.&lt;/ref&gt; During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and [[Jenin]]. The railway was destroyed during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and the route of the line bisected by the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].

The main [[Highway 60 (Israel)|Beersheba–Nazareth road]] running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to [[Tulkarm]], [[Qalqilya]] and [[Jenin]] by roads which are now blocked by the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|checkpoint]]s such as [[Huwwara checkpoint]] which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4027584,00.html |title=Palestinians: More barriers to be removed |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus.&lt;ref name="OCHA"/&gt; Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-to-remove-major-west-bank-checkpoint-to-enable-palestinian-movement-1.342612 IDF to remove major West Bank checkpoint to enable Palestinian movement]. Haaretz. Feb.11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest airport is the [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] in [[Lod]], [[Israel]], but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] to use the [[Queen Alia International Airport]], which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |title=Taxi offices |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217044118/http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |archivedate = February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22098">The '''national symbols of Serbia''' are things which are emblematic, representative or otherwise characteristic of [[Serbia]] and the [[Serbs|Serbian people]] or [[Culture of Serbia|Serbian culture]]. Some are established, official symbols; for example, the [[Coat of arms of Serbia]], which has been codified in [[heraldry]]. Other symbols may not have official status, for one reason or another, but are likewise recognised at a national or international level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2056">'''Nomad studies''' ({{lang-ru|Кочевниковедение}}, kochevnikovedenie; {{lang-ru|Номадистика}}, nomadistika) is branch of historical and anthropological studies specialised in cultures and history of [[nomad]] peoples, particularly the [[Eurasian nomads]] and history of the [[Eurasian steppes]]. Studies of the [[Eurasian nomads]] influence the political idea of [[Eurasianism]].

Among notable researchers in that field were [[Lev Gumilyov]], Pyotr Savitskiy, [[Sergei Rudenko]], [[George Vernadsky]], [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], Hara-Davan Erendzhen, [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]], and others.

According to Savitskiy, the history of [[Scythian]]s and huns encompasses in general (within historically foreseeable events) over 12 centuries. Savitskiy claims that the nomad culture of Scythians and Huns should be considered as culture of horse and iron.

The '''Norse exploration of North America''' began in the late 10th century [[AD]] when [[Vikings|Norsemen]] explored and settled areas of the North [[Atlantic]] including the northeastern fringes of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pálsson |first=Hermann |title=The Vinland sagas: the Norse discovery of America |publisher=Penguin Classics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m-4rb_GhQ5EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Vinland%20sagas%3A%20the%20Norse%20discovery%20of%20America&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |page=28 |year=1965 |isbn=0-14-044154-9 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of Norse buildings were found at [[L’Anse aux Meadows]] near the northern tip of [[Newfoundland]] in 1960. This discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the Norse in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh, William W, ‘Vikings: The north Atlantic saga’, Anthronotes museum of natural history publication for education, available at www.anthropology.si.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse settlements in [[Greenland]] lasted for almost 500 years. Excluding the settlements in Greenland, the only confirmed North American settlement, L’Anse aux Meadows, was small and did not last as long. While voyages, for example to collect [[timber]], are likely to have occurred for some time, there is no evidence of any lasting Norse settlements on mainland North America.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Constance; Strange Footprints on the Land; Harper&amp;Row, New York, 1980; {{ISBN|0-06-022772-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], Norsemen from [[Iceland]] first settled Greenland in the 980s. There is no special reason to doubt the authority of the information that the sagas supply regarding the very beginning of the settlement, but they cannot be treated as primary evidence for the history of Norse Greenland because they embody the literary preoccupations of writers and audiences in medieval Iceland that are not always reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Jonathan. 2009.

[[Erik the Red]] (Old Norse: Eiríkr rauði), having been banished from Iceland for [[manslaughter]], explored the uninhabited southwestern coast of Greenland during the three years of his banishment.&lt;ref&gt;He remained there making explorations for three years and decided to found a colony there ({{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/nda/nda27.htm |title=Norse voyages in the tenth and following centuries |accessdate=2008-08-27 |last=Anderson |first=Rasmus B. |editor-first=John Bruno |editor-last=Hare |date=February 18, 2004 |origyear=1906 |work=The Norse Discovery of America}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reeves |first=Arthur Middleton |first2=Rasmus B. |last2=Anderson |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/nda/nda18.htm |title=Discovery and colonization of Greenland |accessdate=2008-08-27 |year=1906 |work=Saga of Erik the Red |publisher= |pages= |quote=The first winter he was at Eriksey, nearly in the middle of the eastern settlement; the spring after repaired he to Eriksfjord, and took up there his abode.

[[File:NorseExplorations-v2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of the Norse world]]
At its peak the colony consisted of two settlements. The [[Eastern Settlement|Eastern]] was at the southwestern tip of Greenland, while the [[Western Settlement]] was about 500&amp;nbsp;km up the west coast, inland from present-day [[Nuuk]]. A smaller settlement near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]]. The combined population was around 2,000–3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynnerup | first1 = N | year = 2014 | title = Endperiod Demographics of the Greenland Norse | url = | journal = Journal of the North Atlantic | volume = 7 | issue = sp7| pages = 18–24 | doi = 10.3721/037.002.sp702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=ROBW/&gt; Norse Greenland had a [[bishopric]] (at [[Garðar (Greenland)|Garðar]]) and exported walrus [[ivory]], furs, rope, sheep, whale or seal [[blubber]], live animals such as [[polar bear]]s, supposed "unicorn horns" (in reality [[Narwhal#In legend|narwhal tusks]]), and cattle hides. In 1126, the population requested a Bishop (headquartered at Garðar), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] King. They continued to have their own law and became almost completely independent after 1349, the time of the [[Black Death]]. In 1380, the Norwegian Kingdom entered into [[Kalmar Union|a personal union]] with the Kingdom of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name = TVA&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wahlgren |first1=Erik |title=The Vikings and America |date=1986 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=New York |isbn=0-500-02109-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western trade and decline===
There is evidence of Norse trade with the natives (called [[Skraelings]] by the Norse). The Norse would have encountered both [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] (the [[Beothuk]], related to the Algonquin) and the [[Thule People|Thule]], the ancestors of the [[Inuit]]. The [[Dorset culture|Dorset]] had withdrawn from Greenland before the Norse settlement of the island. Items such as [[comb]] fragments, pieces of [[iron]] cooking utensils and chisels, [[chess]] pieces, ship [[rivets]], carpenter's planes, and oaken ship fragments used in Inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of Norse colonization. A small [[ivory]] statue that appears to represent a [[European ethnic groups|European]] has also been found among the ruins of an Inuit community house.&lt;ref name = TVA /&gt;

The colony began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Garðar died in 1377.&lt;ref name = TVA /&gt; After a [[marriage]] was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent [[radiocarbon]] date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (±15 years). Several theories have been advanced to explain the decline.

The [[Little Ice Age]] of this period would have made travel between Greenland and [[Europe]], as well as farming, more difficult; although fishing and seal hunting provided a healthy diet, there was more prestige in cattle farming, and there was increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and [[Black Plague|plague]] epidemics. In addition, Greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in European markets by cheaper ivory from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="www.spiegel.de"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Stockinger |first=Günther |title=Archaeologists Uncover Clues to Why Vikings Abandoned Greenland |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/archaeologists-uncover-clues-to-why-vikings-abandoned-greenland-a-876626.html |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] Online |date=10 January 2012 |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss of contact with the Greenlanders, the Norwegian-Danish [[Monarchy|crown]] continued to consider Greenland a possession.

Not knowing whether the old Norse civilization remained in Greenland or not—and worried that if it did, it would still be [[Catholic]] 200 years after the [[Scandinavia]]n homelands had experienced the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]—a joint merchant-clerical expedition led by the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] missionary [[Hans Egede]] was sent to Greenland in 1721. Though this expedition found no surviving Europeans, it marked the beginning of [[Danish colonization of the Americas|Denmark's re-assertion of sovereignty]] over the island.

=== Climate and Norse Greenland ===
Norse Greenlanders were limited to scattered fjords on the island that provided a spot for their animals (such as cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats) to be kept and farms to be established.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Heather|date=1997-02-14|title=Death in Norse Greenland|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5302/924|journal=Science|language=en|volume=275|issue=5302|pages=924–926|doi=10.1126/science.275.5302.924|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugmore|first=Andrew J.|last2=McGovern|first2=Thomas H.|last3=Vésteinsson|first3=Orri|last4=Arneborg|first4=Jette|last5=Streeter|first5=Richard|last6=Keller|first6=Christian|date=2012|title=Cultural adaptation, compounding vulnerabilities and conjunctures in Norse Greenland|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=10|pages=3658–3663|doi=10.1073/pnas.1115292109|jstor=41507015|pmc=3309771}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these fjords, the farms depended upon byres to host their livestock in the winter, and routinely culled their herds in order to survive the season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Joel|date=1986|title=The Decline of the Norse Settlements in Greenland|journal=Arctic Anthropology|volume=23|issue=1/2|pages=109–135|jstor=40316106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coming warmer seasons meant that livestocks were taken from their byres to pasture, the most fertile being controlled by the most powerful farms and the church.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGovern|first=Thomas H.|date=1980|title=Cows, Harp Seals, and Churchbells: Adaptation and Extinction in Norse Greenland|journal=Human Ecology|volume=8|issue=3|pages=245–275|doi=10.1007/bf01561026|jstor=4602559}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was produced by livestock and farming was supplemented with subsistence hunting of mainly seal and caribou as well as walrus for trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Norse mainly relied on the ''Nordrsetur'' hunt, a communal hunt of migratory harp seals that would take place during spring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Trade was highly important to the Greenland Norse and they relied on imports of lumber due to the barrenness of Greenland. In turn they exported goods such as walrus ivory and hide, live polar bears, and narwhal tusks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ultimately these setups were vulnerable as they relied on migratory patterns created by climate as well as the well-being of the few fjords on the island.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A portion of the time the Greenland settlements existed was during the [[Little Ice Age]] and the climate was, overall, becoming cooler and more humid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As climate began to cool and humidity began to increase, this brought longer winters and shorter springs, more storms and affected the migratory patterns of the harp seal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Pasture space began to dwindle and fodder yields for the winter became much smaller. This combined with regular herd culling made it hard to maintain livestock, especially for the poorest of the Greenland Norse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In spring, the voyages to where migratory harp seals could be found became more dangerous due to more frequent storms, and the lower population of harp seals meant that ''Nordrsetur'' hunts became less successful, making subsistence hunting extremely difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The strain on resources made trade difficult, and as time went on, Greenland exports lost value in the European market due to competing countries and the lack of interest in what was being traded.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, it seemed that the Norse were unwilling to integrate with the indigenous Thule of Greenland, either through marriage or culture. There is evidence of contact as seen through the Thule archaeological record including ivory depictions of the Norse as well as bronze and steel artifacts. However, there is essentially no material evidence of the Thule among Norse artifacts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In older research it was posited that it was not climate change alone that lead to Norse decline, but also their unwillingness to adapt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, if the Norse had decided to focus their subsistence hunting on the ringed seal (which could be hunted year round, though individually), and decided to reduce or do away with their communal hunts, food would have been much less scarce during the winter season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGovern|first=Thomas H.|date=1991|title=Climate, Correlation, and Causation in Norse Greenland|journal=Arctic Anthropology|volume=28|issue=2|pages=77–100|jstor=40316278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, had Norse individuals used skin instead of wool to produce their clothing, they would have been able to fare better nearer to the coast, and wouldn't have been as confined to the fjords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, more recent research has shown that the Norse did try to adapt in their own ways.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/why-did-greenland-s-vikings-disappear|title=Why did Greenland’s Vikings disappear?|date=2016-11-07|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these attempts included increased subsistence hunting. A significant number of bones of marine animals can be found at the settlements, suggesting increased hunting with the absence of farmed food.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, pollen records show that the Norse didn't devastate the small forests and foliage as previously thought. Instead the Norse ensured that overgrazed or overused sections were given time to regrow and moved to other areas.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Norse farmers also attempted to adapt. With the increased need for winter fodder and smaller pastures, they would self-fertilize their lands in an attempt to keep up with the new demands caused by the changing climate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, even with these attempts, climate change was not the only thing putting pressure on the Greenland Norse. The economy was changing, and the exports they relied on were losing value.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Current research suggests that the Norse were unable to maintain their colonies because of economic and climatic change happening at the same time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/|title=The Fate of Greenland's Vikings - Archaeology Magazine Archive|website=archive.archaeology.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christian-krohg-leiv-eriksson.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Leif Erikson]] discovers North America&lt;br&gt; [[Christian Krogh]] (1893).]]

According to the [[Icelandic sagas]]{{mdash}}''[[Eirik the Red's Saga]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sephton|first=J.|url=http://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en |title=The Saga of Erik the Red |year=1880 |publisher=Icelandic Saga Database |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Saga of the Greenlanders]]'', plus chapters of the ''[[Hauksbók]]'' and the ''[[Flatey Book]]''{{mdash}}the Norse started to explore lands to the west of Greenland only a few years after the Greenland settlements were established.  In 985, while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400–700 settlers&lt;ref name=ROBW/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM2/&gt; and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named [[Bjarni Herjólfsson]] was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his discovery to [[Leif Erikson]] who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.&lt;ref name=ROBW/&gt;

The sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration: [[Helluland]], which means "land of the flat stones"; [[Markland]], "the land of forests", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and [[Vinland]], "the land of wine", found somewhere south of Markland. It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded.

===Leif's winter camp===
[[File:Skálholt-Karte.png|thumb|350px|The [[Skálholt#Skálholt Map|Skálholt Map]]]]
Using the routes, landmarks, [[ocean current|currents]], rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed from Greenland westward across the Labrador Sea, with a crew of 35—sailing the same [[knarr]] Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as "level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline."&lt;ref name=ROBW/&gt; Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it.  However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.&lt;ref name=ROBW/&gt;

Leif wintered in 1001, probably near [[Cape Bauld]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], where one day his foster father [[Tyrker]] was found drunk, on what the saga describes as "wine-berries." [[Viburnum edule|Squashberries]], [[gooseberries]], and [[Cranberry|cranberries]] all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing [[Fermentation (wine)|fermented berries]] as "wine."

Leif spent another winter at "Leifsbúðir" without conflict, and sailed back to [[Brattahlíð]] in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father.

===Thorvald's voyage (1004 AD)===
In 1004, Leif's brother [[Thorvald Eiriksson]] sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered [[canoe]]s. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the [[barricade]]. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland.&lt;ref name=ROBW/&gt;

===Karlsefni's expedition (1009 AD)===
In 1009, [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]], also known as "Thorfinn the Valiant", supplied three [[knarr|ships]] with livestock and 160 men and women&lt;ref name=NM2&gt;Oxenstierna, Eric; ''The Norsemen'' (1965), 320 pages, New York Graphic Soc.: {{ISBN|1-122-21631-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although another source sets the number of settlers at 250). After a cruel winter, he headed south and landed at [[Straumfjörð|''Straumfjord'']].  He later moved to ''Straumsöy'', possibly because the current was stronger there.  A sign of peaceful relations between the  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and the Norsemen is noted here. The two sides [[barter]]ed with furs and [[eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]] skins for [[milk]] and red cloth, which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of [[headdress]].

There are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to Karlsefni came storming out of the wood, so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats and rowed away.  They returned three days later, in force.  The natives used catapults, hoisting "a large sphere on a pole; it was dark blue in color" and about the size of a sheep's belly,&lt;ref name="VS"&gt;{{Cite book

The Norsemen retreated.  Leif Erikson's half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was pregnant and unable to keep up with the retreating Norsemen. She called out to them to stop fleeing from "such pitiful wretches", adding that if she had weapons, she could do better than that. Freydís seized the sword belonging to a man who had been killed by the natives. She pulled one of her breasts out of her bodice and struck it with the sword, frightening the natives, who fled.&lt;ref name=VS/&gt;

==Duration of Norse contact==
Settlements in continental North America aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]]: ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear why the short-term settlements did not become permanent, though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples, referred to as ''[[Skrælings]]'' by the Norse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Compact |first1=John M |last1=Murrin |first2=Paul E |last2=Johnson |first3=James M |last3=McPherson |first4=Gary |last4=Gerstle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4aNIeXqWz9YC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=1014:+The+first+European+colony+in+North+America+is+established+at+L%27Anse+aux+Meadows#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |page=6 |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-495-41101-7 |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it appears that sporadic voyages to Markland for forages, timber, and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Schledermann, Peter. 1996.

==Aftermath==
For centuries it remained unclear whether the Icelandic stories represented real voyages by the Norse to North America. The sagas first gained serious historic respectability when, in 1837, the Danish antiquarian [[Carl Christian Rafn]] pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name [[Winland]], first appeared in written sources in a work by [[Adam of Bremen]] from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], first reached written form only in the 13th and 14th centuries.{{Citation Needed|date=June 2017}}

Evidence of Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist [[Anne Stine Ingstad]] and her husband, outdoorsman and author [[Helge Ingstad]], excavated a Norse settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]].  The location of the various lands described in the sagas remains unclear, however. Many historians identify Helluland with [[Baffin Island]] and Markland with [[Labrador]]. The location of Vinland poses a thornier question. Most believe that the L'Anse aux Meadows settlement represents the Vinland settlement described in the sagas; others argue that the sagas depict Vinland as warmer than Newfoundland and therefore lying farther south.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Norumbega''', or '''Nurembega''', is a legendary settlement in northeastern [[North America]] which appeared on many early maps from the 1500s until American colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Did Leif Erikson once live in Cambridge, Massachusetts? | work = The Straight Dope | url =  http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mleifinma.html | accessdate = 2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andy Woodruff, [http://andywoodruff.com/blog/norumbega-new-englands-lost-city-of-riches-and-vikings/ Norumbega, New England’s lost city of riches and Vikings], May 24, 2010; accessed 2018.01.25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The houses were said to have pillars of gold and the inhabitants carried quarts of pearls on their heads.&lt;ref name = "Schweitzer" /&gt;

[[Jean Allefonsce]] in 1542 reported that he had coasted south from [[Newfoundland]] and had discovered a great river.&lt;!--this sentence doesn't fit, especially with the 1529 bap mentioned below--&gt; It often appeared on subsequent European maps of North America, lying south of [[Acadia]] in what is now [[New England]].  The town of [[Bangor, Maine]], embraced the legend in the nineteenth century, naming their municipal hall "Norumbega Hall".  In 1886 inventor [[Joseph Barker Stearns]] built a mansion named "[[Norumbega Castle]]", which still stands on [[US Route 1]] in [[Camden, Maine]], overlooking [[Penobscot Bay]].&lt;ref name = "Schweitzer"&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Eben Norton Horsford]] linked the name and legend of Norumbega to supposed [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse settlements]] on the [[Charles River]], and built the [[Norumbega Tower]] at the confluence of [[Stony Brook (Waltham)|Stony Brook]] and the Charles in [[Weston, Massachusetts]], where he believed Fort Norumbega was located. In honor of Horsford's generous donations to [[Wellesley College]], a building named Norumbega Hall was dedicated in 1886 and celebrated in a poem by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenleaf |first=John |title=The writings of John Greenleaf Whittier |volume=4 |year=1894 |publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ly0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Norumbega" was originally spelled ''Oranbega'' in [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]'s 1529 map of America, and the word is believed to derive from one of the [[Algonquian languages]] spoken in New England. It may mean "quiet place between the rapids" or "quiet stretch of water".&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Rev. Patrick J. McSwiney.JPG|thumb|Rev. Patrick J. MacSwiney]]

'''Rev. Patrick J. MacSwiney''' (frequently spelled ''McSwiney'' or ''MacSweeney'',&lt;ref&gt;He himself used the form MacSwiney, and sometimes the Irish form of his name, Mac Suibhne&lt;/ref&gt; 16 March 1885 – 16 November 1940) was an Irish Catholic priest, [[Irish language|Gaelic]] scholar, antiquarian, historian, teacher, founder of the [[Kinsale]] Regional Museum, and benefactor of the people in the parishes in which he worked.

==Life==
Born and educated in [[County Cork|Cork]], he studied for the priesthood at [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] and was ordained on 18 June 1911. Like all newly ordained Irish priests, he was sent to serve in Britain: he worked for three years in [[Liverpool]]. There, in addition to his pastoral duties, he studied at the [[University of Liverpool|University College Liverpool]] under the Celtic scholar Professor [[Kuno Meyer]], and was awarded a master's degree in 1914.&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;J.J. Horgan, "Obituary: Rev. Patrick McSwiney, C.C., M.A.", ''Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society'' Part 2, Vol. XLV, No. 162, July–Dec 1940, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;
He returned to Cork in 1914, became chaplain to Clifton Convalescent Home and convent in Montenotte, and was appointed to the staff of St Finbarr’s Seminary of Farranferris as professor of Irish, Greek and Latin. (In addition to these three languages, he was fluent in French, German and Italian).&lt;ref name="Horgan"/&gt;

He joined the [[Gaelic League]], was a member of the Cork Dramatic Society, which had been founded in 1908 by [[Daniel Corkery (author)|Daniel Corkery]] and Patrick MacSwiney's cousin [[Terence MacSwiney]]. The priest was a founding member of the Cork Twenty Club, set up in 1915 by twenty citizens to provide a forum for local writers and artists;&lt;ref&gt;See An t-Athair P. Mac Suibhne, Seán MacAonghusa, "The Cork Twenty Club", Cork n.d., and Patrick Maume, ''Life that is Exile: Daniel Corkery and the Search for Irish Ireland'', Belfast 1993, pp. 21, 53–4.&lt;/ref&gt; he was on the council of the Munster Society of Arts, established after the civil war, as Daniel Corkery wrote: “for the purpose of developing and fostering the fine arts, now practically nonexistent in our midst”.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Corkery, "The Munster Society of Arts", Letter to the Editor, ''The Cork Examiner'', 26 January 1924. See also: Joseph P. Cunningham, Ruth Fleischmann, ''Aloys Fleischmann (1880–1964; Immigrant Musician in Ireland'', Cork 2010, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his close friends were his cousins Annie, Mary and Terence MacSwiney, [[Daniel Corkery (author)|Daniel Corkery]], [[William F.P. Stockley]] and his Munich wife Germaine, née Kolb, [[John Horgan (Irish nationalist)|John Horgan]], [[Arnold Bax]], [[Aloys Fleischmann]] and [[Tilly Fleischmann]]. He studied the piano with the latter and gave lecture-recitals with her; he frequently delivered introductory talks before performances of Aloys Fleischmann's Cathedral choir at broadcasts from the [[Honan Chapel]] of [[University College Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Cunningham, Ruth Fleischmann, ''Aloys Fleischmann (1880–1964; Immigrant Musician in Ireland'', Cork 2010, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured regularly to the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, the Cork Literary and Scientific Society, the Cork School of Art, the Cork Twenty Club, the Munster Society of Arts, and at the University.

==In trouble with the bishop==
Towards the end of 1922, MacSwiney's time in Cork came to an abrupt end due to a conflict with his bishop, Dr [[Daniel Cohalan (bishop of Cork)|Daniel Cohalan]]. Mary MacSwiney was the unwitting cause of her cousin being banished to act as chaplain to the workhouse and to a convent in the remote parish of [[Dunmanway]].

During the civil war the MacSwiney sisters were on the republican, anti-Treaty side in opposition to the pro-Treaty Free State government. In the autumn of 1922, Patrick MacSwiney had, at Mary's request, taken charge of a bag for a friend whose premises were in danger of being raided by government forces. MacSwiney did not examine the contents and deposited the bag in the Clifton convent of which he was chaplain, which was raided shortly afterwards by Free State government forces. The bag was found to contain £3,000. It was rumoured by government supporters that this was part of the £100,000 that had been robbed by republican forces from the Customs House in Dublin and that the priest had abused the nuns' trust by hiding the stolen money in the convent on behalf of Mary MacSwiney.&lt;ref&gt;See "Bishop's Letter, Reply: From Father P. MacSwiney", ''The Cork Examiner'', 30 November 1923, in which MacSwiney describes the indicent, his role and that of Mary MacSwiney.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The incident led to his being removed from his clerical duties in Cork and sent to Dunmanway.&lt;ref&gt;On the website of the Diocese of Cork and Ross, section: Priests who served in the Diocese, the date given for MacSwiney’s removal to Dunmanway is 7 December 1923; but already on 30 November 1923 he signs his letter to the ''Cork Examiner'' as ‘Chaplain, Dunmanway’, so he was probably removed from his posts in Cork in December 1922 rather than in December 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banished to Dunmanway==
MacSwiney found his exile in [[Dunmanway]] difficult: he was now far from his friends, having to travel a considerable distance to hear their music, a luxury he could now only rarely afford. 
Sometimes duties were assigned to him which prevented him from attending concerts in Cork. On one such occasion, when he had been obliged to officiate at a funeral in the country, he had missed Tilly Fleischmann’s performance with the Brodsky Quartet. He wrote to her:&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Cunningham, Ruth Fleischmann, ''Aloys Fleischmann (1880–1964; Immigrant Musician in Ireland'', Cork 2010, pp 170–171: MacSwiney letter of 11 December 1924 to Tilly Fleischmann. The MacSwiney-Fleischmann correspondence is among the Fleischmann Papers in the Archives of University College Cork. The Fleischmann letters to MacSwiney have not survived.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"… you could not have felt my sense of loss: no musician could ever sound the depths of longing which a mere ignorant lover of music like I suffer from. I would have given kingdoms, yea the whole world (were I not alas, as I am, only a beggar) to have heard this music. To you and A[loys] music is a science, an ideal art, but to me it is the only thing in life that satisfies the gnawing of my soul-hunger, the terrible hunger of an untutored savage. Music alone makes me believe that even I have been moulded to 'the image and likeness of God' – as every Christian is supposed to believe."

His acute sense of deprivation illustrates the cultural stagnation of rural Ireland which Corkery spoke of when presenting the Munster Society of Arts, which [[Canon Sheehan]] had described with such feeling in ''My New Curate'', and which [[George William Russell|George Russell]] had combated with his work for the cooperative movement and his journal ''The Irish Homestead''. Like these three men, MacSwiney never faltered in his efforts to cultivate the wasteland. In Dunmanway he founded the West Cork Feis [festival].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cork Examiner'' 21 November 1940 p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and established a dramatic society, which put on numerous fine plays and co-operated with Fleischmann's Bantry Choral Society.

==Ministry in Kinsale==
[[File:Rev Patrick J. McSwiney c. 1935.JPG|thumb|left|Rev. Patrick J. MacSwiney c. 1935]]

In December 1927 he was sent, to his great joy, to work as curate in Kinsale, County Cork, albeit under a very conservative archdeacon.&lt;ref&gt;See Terry Connolly, "Rev. Patrick McSwiney", ''Kinsale Record 5.7.'', 1995 and W. Malachy Lynch, O. Carm. ''Pilgim's Newsletter Aylesford'', No. 113, Carmelite Priory Aylesford, Kent, May 1972, p. 1. Malachy Lynch was prior of the Aylesford Priory in England; he had been Master of Novices in the Kinsale monastery during MacSwiney's time in the town.&lt;/ref&gt;

The harbour town was at that period in an extremely depressed condition. Great damage had been done during the civil war, the fishing industry was dying, the railway line had been closed down, the British military bases had gone after Ireland won independence; there was great poverty, high unemployment and emigration and a sense of hopelessness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinsaleheritage.com See Dermot Ryan on the history of Kinsale]&lt;/ref&gt; MacSwiney spent the rest of his life working to alleviate the distress, his considerable organisational talents, his determination, dedication and kindly disposition leading to remarkable achievements.

The priest visited the poor regularly; he ministered to the orphans in the Convent of Mercy, putting on theatrical shows with them and taking them on annual excursions. He set about founding organisations for the development of the town: these included the Kinsale Development Association, the Kinsale Vocational Education Committee, the Creamery Committee, the Sea Fishing Association.

He worked for years for the establishment of a technical school which would offer vocational training to young people; it finally opened on 26 September 1940, less than seven weeks before his death. He campaigned for support for fishermen to revive the sea-fishing industry, which was in a dire state due to decline of stocks near the coast and lack of trawlers and adequate equipment.&lt;ref&gt;''Cork Examiner'', 4 August 1931 p.4&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for the founding of a creamery, which opened on 1 August 1940,&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Independent'', 2 August 1940, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; for a housing scheme for the poor, for the provision of an adequate water supply for the town, for the promotion of tourism, for a new graveyard. He had much support from citizens such as Séamas Breathnach and [[Eamonn O'Neill]], a local businessman and member of the Dáil who had brought electricity to Kinsale in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cadogan and Jeremiah Falvey, ''A Biographical Dictionary of Cork'', Dublin 2006, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

MacSwiney aimed at creating a sense of civic pride among the townspeople, particularly the young, and campaigned to save historic buildings; he succeeded in having Desmond Castle classified as a national monument and restored,.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Press'', 18 October 1937, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted Irish through the Gaelic League, produced plays in English and Irish, was president of the local branch of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] GAA, he organised a pageant to commemorate the [[Battle of Kinsale]] of 1601. He researched the rich history of the town, published scholarly articles on the subject, established the Kinsale History Society, and worked for years with the Society collecting material to set up the Kinsale Regional Museum, which opened on 11 September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Independent'', 12 September 1940 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

He was indefatigable in his efforts to remove the causes of poverty, to enable people to lead lives worth living, to contend against indifference and lack of concern. His sources of strength were music and literature, conversations with friends on subjects close to his heart, and his scholarly research. He was to produce three fine essays on the history of Kinsale; his untimely death cut short both his historical research as well as his studies of the life and music of Chopin for a book he had planned to write.

He died at Golding's Private Hospital in Wellington Road, Cork on 16 November 1940, aged 55.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Connolly, quoted on the website of the Diocese of Cork and Ross&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The esteem in which he was held was manifested at his death. ''The Southern Star'' wrote that business in the town came to a standstill from the news of his death to the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;''The Southern Star'', 23 November 1940, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Tributes came from all sections of the local community and from numerous organisations in Cork. He was buried in St Eltin's Cemetery, the graveyard which he had helped to establish.

John J. Horgan wrote: “Those who were privileged to witness his last silent homecoming, when the men of Kinsale carried his remains through the twilight streets amidst a reverent and stricken people to the old Church where he had ministered so long, knew that this saintly cultured priest and true patriot had not worked in vain.”&lt;ref&gt;John J. Horgan, "Obituary: Rev. Patrick McSwiney, C.C., M.A.", ''Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society'' Part 2, Vol. XLV, No. 162, July–Dec 1940, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Connolly said of him at a commemoration in 2012: “He found Kinsale on its knees and he raised it to its feet. The Vocational School, St Eltin’s Graveyard and the seat on the Low Road were all monuments to Fr McSwiney but it is the fact that so many people still remember and honour him after all these years that is the greatest memorial of all.”&lt;ref&gt;"Kinsale group restores seat honouring remarkable Fr.

'''Power in international relations''' is defined in several different ways. Modern discourse generally speaks in terms of state power, indicating both economic and military power. Those states that have significant amounts of power within the international system are referred to as [[small power]]s, [[middle power]]s, [[regional power]]s, [[great power]]s, [[superpower]]s, or [[hegemons]], although there is no commonly accepted standard for what defines a powerful state. [[NATO Quint]], the [[G7]], the [[BRICS]] nations and the [[G20]] are seen by academics as forms of governments that exercise varying degrees of influence within the international system.

Entities other than states can also be relevant in power acquisition in international relations. Such entities can include [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[international organizations]], military alliance organizations like [[NATO]], [[multinational corporation]]s like [[Wal-Mart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/03/03/338383/index.htm |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2010-05-22|title=One Nation Under Wal-Mart: How Retailing's Superpower—and our Biggest, Most Admired Company—Is Changing the Rules for Corporate America|date=2003-03-03|first=Jerry|last=Useem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[non-governmental organizations]] such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]], or other institutions such as the [[Hanseatic League]] and technology companies like [[Facebook]] and [[Google]].

==Concepts of political power==
[[Political science|Political scientists]], [[historian]]s, and practitioners of [[international relations]] ([[diplomat]]s) have used the following concepts of [[political power]]:
* Power as a '''goal''' of states or leaders;
* Power as a measure of '''[[Social influence|influence]]''' or control over outcomes, events, actors and issues;
* Power as victory in conflict and the attainment of '''[[international security|security]]''';
* Power as control over resources and '''capabilities''';
* Power as '''status''', which some states or actors possess and others do not.

===Power as a goal===
Primary usage of "power" as a goal in international relations belongs to political theorists, such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm|title=SIX PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL REALISM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially among Classical [[Realism in international relations|Realist]] thinkers, power is an inherent goal of mankind and of states.  Economic growth, military growth, cultural spread etc. can all be considered as working towards the ultimate goal of international power.  The German military thinker [[Carl von Clausewitz]]&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Richard H. "Hans Delbrück (1848-1929)." Bernadotte E. Schmitt. ''Some Historians of Modern Europe''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be the quintessential projection of European growth across the continent.  In more modern times, [[Baron Moser|Claus Moser]] has elucidated theories centre of distribution of power in Europe after the Holocaust, and the power of universal learning as its counterpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview--sir-claus-moser-735-per-cent-english-what-is-dangerous-in-the-sort-of-life-ive-had-is-that-there-are-moments-when-one-might-think-one-is-indispensable-1536025.html#|title=INTERVIEW / Sir Claus Moser: 73.5 per cent English: 'What is dangerous|author=ANGELA LAMBERT|date=27 July 1992|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Monnet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/founding-fathers/pdf/jean_monnet_en.pdf|title=About the EU - European Union website, the official EU website - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French left-wing social theorist, stimulating expansive Eurocommunism, who followed on the creator of modern European community, the diplomat and statesman [[Robert Schuman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/founding-fathers/pdf/robert_schuman_en.pdf|title=About the EU - European Union website, the official EU website - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power as influence===
[[File:North Atlantic Treaty Organization (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|upright|[[NATO]] accounts for over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military expenditure]],&lt;ref name="sipri1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States]] alone accounting for 43% of global military expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders|title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2009|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Political science|Political scientists]] principally use "power" in terms of an actor's ability to exercise [[Sphere of influence|influence]] over other actors within the [[international relations|international system]]. This influence can be [[coercive]], attractive, [[cooperative]], or [[competitive]]. Mechanisms of influence can include the threat or use of force, economic interaction or pressure, diplomacy, and cultural exchange.

Under certain circumstances, states can organize a [[sphere of influence]] or a bloc within which they exercise predominant influence. Historical examples include the spheres of influence recognized under the [[Concert of Europe]], or the recognition of spheres during the [[Cold War]] following the [[Yalta Conference]]. The [[Warsaw Pact]], the "[[Free World]]", and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] were the blocs that arose out of the Cold War contest. Military alliances like [[NATO]] and the Warsaw Pact are another forum through which influence is exercised. However, "[[political realism|realist]]" theory attempted to maintain the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] from the development of meaningful diplomatic relations that can create a [[hegemony]] within the region. [[British foreign policy]], for example, dominated Europe through the [[Congress of Vienna]] after the defeat of France.  They continued the balancing act with the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, to appease Russia and Germany from attacking Turkey.  Britain has sided against the aggressors on the European continent—i.e. the [[German Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[Napoleonic France]] or [[Habsburg Austria]], known during the Great War as the [[Central Powers]] and, in the World War Two were called the [[Axis Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P.Taylor, "Origins of the First World War"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, Sir Robert (1962) 2nd ed. "Britain 1870-1914" The Oxford History of England.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power as security===
''Power'' is also used when describing states or actors that have achieved [[military]] victories or security for their state in the international system. This general usage is most commonly found among the writings of historians or popular writers.

===Power as capability===
American author [[Charles W. Freeman, Jr.]] described power as the following:
{{quote|Power is the capacity to direct the decisions and actions of others. Power derives from strength and will. Strength comes from the transformation of resources into capabilities. Will infuses objectives with resolve. Strategy marshals capabilities and brings them to bear with precision. Statecraft seeks through strategy to magnify the mass, relevance, impact, and irresistibility of power. It guides the ways the state deploys and applies its power abroad. These ways embrace the arts of war, espionage, and diplomacy. The practitioners of these three arts are the paladins of statecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gabriel|last=Marcella|chapter=Chapter 17: National Security and the Interagency Process|chapterurl=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/army-usawc/strategy2004/17marcella.pdf|title=U.S. Army War College Guide to National Security Policy and Strategy|editor-first=J. Boone|editor-last=Bartholomees, Jr.|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/army-usawc/strategy2004/index.htm|pages=239–260|date=July 2004|publisher=United States Army War College}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Power'' is also used to describe the [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and [[Capability (systems engineering)|capabilities]] of a state. This definition is quantitative and is most often{{Dubious|''Power as resources most often used by geopoliticians and the military''|date=February 2017}} used by geopoliticians and the military. Capabilities are thought of in tangible terms—they are measurable, weighable, quantifiable assets. A good example for this kind of measurement is the ''Composite Indicator on Aggregate Power'', which involves 54 indicators and covers the capabilities of 44 states in [[Asia-Pacific]] from 1992 to 2012.&lt;ref name="Fels2017a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fels, Enrico|title=Shifting Power in Asia-Pacific? The Rise of China, Sino-US Competition and Regional Middle Power Allegiance|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319456881|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-45689-8|pages=225–340|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard power can be treated as a potential and is not often enforced on the international stage.

[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] strategists have such a concept of national power that can be measured [[Quantitative property|quantitatively]] using an index known as [[comprehensive national power]].

==Power as status==

===Definitions===
Much effort in academic and popular writing is devoted to deciding which countries have the status of "power", and how this can be measured. If a country has "power" (as influence) in military, diplomatic, cultural, and economic spheres, it might be called a "power" (as status). There are several categories of power, and inclusion of a state in one category or another is fraught with difficulty and controversy. In his famous 1987 work, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]],'' British-American historian [[Paul Kennedy]] charts the relative status of the various powers from AD 1500 to 2000. He does not begin the book with a [[theoretical definition]] of a "great power"; however he does list them, separately, for many different eras. Moreover, he uses different [[working definitions]] of a great power for different eras. For example:
{{blockquote|"France was not strong enough to oppose Germany in a one-to-one struggle... If the mark of a Great Power is country which is willing to take on any other, then France (like Austria-Hungary) had slipped to a lower position. But that definition seemed too abstract in 1914 to a nation geared up for war, militarily stronger than ever, wealthy, and, above all, endowed with powerful allies."&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000|year=1989|origyear=1987|publisher=Fontana|location=London|isbn=0006860524|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Categories of power===

In the modern geopolitical landscape, a number of terms are used to describe various types of powers, which include the following:
* '''''[[Superpower]]''''': In 1944, [[William T. R. Fox]] defined ''superpower'' as "great power plus great mobility of power" and identified three states, the [[British Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=G.|last2=Newnham|first2=J.|year=1998|title=Dictionary of International Relations|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the decolonisation of the British Empire following World War II, and then the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States is currently the only country considered to be a superpower.&lt;ref name="Nossal"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/papers/hyperpower.htm|title=Lonely Superpower or Unapologetic Hyperpower?

A.|last=Roberson|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|accessdate=2013-08-11|isbn=9780415140447}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[Middle power]]''''': A subjective description of influential second-tier states that could not quite be described as great or small powers. A middle power has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others (particularly in the realm of [[security]]) and takes diplomatic leads in regional and global affairs.&lt;ref name="Fels2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fels, Enrico|title=Shifting Power in Asia-Pacific?

* '''''[[Small power]]''''': The International System is for the most part made up by ''small powers''. They are instruments of the other powers and may at times be dominated; but they cannot be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Vital, D. (1967) The Inequality of States: A Study of Small Power in International Relations&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other categories====
* '''''[[Regional power]]''''': This term is used to describe a nation that exercises influence and power within a region. Being a ''regional power'' is not mutually exclusive with any of the other categories of power. The majority of them exert a strategic degree of influence as minor or secondary regional powers. A primary regional power (like [[Australia]]) has often an important role in international affairs outside of its region too.&lt;ref&gt;Schenoni, Luis (2017) "Subsystemic Unipolarities?" in Strategic Analysis, 41(1): 74-86 [https://www.academia.edu/30528886/_Subsystemic_Unipolarities_Power_Distribution_and_State_Behaviour_in_South_America_and_Southern_Africa_in_Strategic_Analysis_41_1_74-86]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Cultural superpower''''': Refers to a country whose [[culture]], [[arts]] or [[entertainment]] have worldwide appeal, significant international popularity or large influence on much of the world.

==Hard, soft and smart power==
{{Main|Hard power|Soft power|Smart power}}
Some political scientists distinguish between two types of power: Hard and Soft. The former is coercive (example: [[military invasion]]) while the latter is attractive (example: [[broadcast media]] or cultural invasion).

Hard power refers to coercive tactics: the threat or use of [[armed forces]], [[economic]] pressure or [[International sanctions|sanctions]], assassination and subterfuge, or other forms of intimidation. Hard power is generally associated to the stronger of nations, as the ability to change the domestic affairs of other nations through military threats. Realists and [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealists]], such as [[John Mearsheimer]], are advocates of the use of such power for the balancing of the international system.

[[Joseph Nye]] is the leading proponent and theorist of soft power. Instruments of soft power include debates on cultural values, dialogues on ideology, the attempt to influence through good example, and the appeal to commonly accepted human values. Means of exercising soft power include diplomacy, dissemination of information, analysis, propaganda, and cultural programming to achieve political ends.

Others have synthesized soft and hard power, including through the field of [[smart power]]. This is often a call to use a holistic spectrum of statecraft tools, ranging from soft to hard.

==European powers of the modern age==
During the time of the Renaissance, powers in Europe included [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], the [[Habsburg Empire]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland–Lithuania]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Bolstered by shipments of gold and silver from the Americas, the Spanish Habsburg dynasty emerged as a dominant force and regularly launched military interventions to project its power and defend Catholicism, while its rival, France, was torn apart by religious civil war. Meanwhile,
in Eastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire reached its zenith and completed its conquest of the [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan]] region.

During the 17th century the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] were added to the group, whilst the Ottomans, Poland and Spain gradually declined in power and influence. France progressively grew stronger and by the latter part of the century found itself repeatedly facing alliances designed to hold its military power in check.

In the 18th century, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] (formed from a union of England and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]) progressively gained strength and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] also saw their importance increase, while Sweden and the Dutch Republic declined. Great Britain and France increasingly struggled for dominance both on the continent and abroad (notably in [[North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[India]]). By the century's end, the British had established themselves as the foremost naval power while the French were dominant on land, conquering many of their neighbors during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and establishing client republics. The struggle between the two nations ended only in 1815 with the final defeat of the French under [[Napoleon]].

During the 19th century, there was an informal convention recognising five Great Powers in Europe: the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], the [[British Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Austrian Empire]] (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]). In the late 19th century the newly united [[Italy]] was added to this group.

[[File:Nobleman offering cocoa paste.jpg|thumb|The Mayans created one of the most successful Pre-Columbian empires. This sculpture depicts a Mayan nobleman holding cacao, which was essential in the Mayan diet as a component of chocolate drinks.]]
'''Pre-Columbian cuisine''' refers to the food and drink consumed by the people who inhabited the [[Americas]] before [[Christopher Columbus]] explored the region and introduced food and crops from [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas C.|title=pre-Columbian civilizations|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/pre-Columbian-civilizations|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Columbian Exchange]] introduced many new animals and plants to the Americas, cultures of their own already existed there, including the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Incan]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]. The development of agriculture allowed the many different cultures to transition from hunting to staying in one place.&lt;ref name ="Magoc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magoc|first1=Chris J.|title=Chronology of Americans and the Environment|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781598844122}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major element of this cuisine is [[maize]], which began being grown in central [[Mexico]]. Other crops that flourished in the Americas include [[amaranth]], [[wild rice]], and [[lima beans]].&lt;ref name ="Janick"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janick|first1=Jules|title=Development of New World Crops by Indigenous Americans|journal=HortScience|date=1 April 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=406–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine by culture==
===Mayan===
{{Main|Mayan cuisine}}
Maize dough made up a majority of Mayan cuisine, used for tortillas and tamales. The technique that Mayans used was to use a stone slab and a rolling pin-like object to grind up ingredients. The ground maize created by this process was used in the tortillas. Popular drinks included chocolate drinks, made from ground cacao and cinnamon in water or milk, and ''atoles'' and ''pinoles,'' which were made from ground up seeds.&lt;ref name= "Albala" /&gt; The Mayans were likely the first group of people to depict cacao in writing.&lt;ref name="Ornelas" /&gt; A popular tradition was to prepare unique tamales in commemoration of special events. In addition, corn was a symbol of life and health. Each family took one ear of corn and did not plant it or eat it. Rather, they blessed it at the beginning of the harvest.&lt;ref name="Albala" /&gt;

*[[Inca cuisine]]:
The Incan Empire was located in modern-day [[Peru]]. Both the potato and the sweet potato originally hail from the Incan region. Maize was also cultivated in the region since 3000 B.C. A major component of the Incan diet that has recently become popular again is quinoa, another native plant.
A traditional meat comes from the Peruvian guinea pig, considered a delicacy. The Incan people drank chicha de jora, a traditional drink.

People used clay pots known as ''ollas de barro'' for the flavor they add to cooked food. Families gathered to celebrate ranch anniversaries through outdoor cooking pits known as ''pachamanca.'' These large feasts include meat, tubers, and corn.&lt;ref name="Albala" /&gt;

*[[Native American cuisine]]:
Foodways typically included the hunting of wild animals, gathering of wild plants, and cultivating of fruits and vegetables. The Southwestern region of the United States, now made up of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and parts of Texas, was initially settled by different groups of Native Americans. The Puebloan people turned to agriculture, holding small farms along the [[Rio Grande]] in New Mexico, surviving on corn, beans, and squash. Conversely, other groups retained their hunter-gatherer roots, including the Navajo, Apache, and Utes.

Among all tribes, maize is the most important food, while beans and squash are also held in high regard. These three crops, known as the "Three Sister Crops" were typically planted together, supporting each other as they grow. Chokecherries were also an important crop, mostly for the Blackfoot and Cheyenne tribes.&lt;ref name="Albala"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albala|first1=Ken|title=Food cultures of the world encyclopedia|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313376276}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many tribes used their knowledge of the natural words to hunt for meat both on land and in the sea. Fish, shellfish, and small grassland game animals were staples for hunter-gatherer tribes in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska such as the Salish and the Tlingit, respectively. Plains tribes extensively hunted bison, using them for meat, clothing, and weapons. All parts of the animal were consumed in one way or another.&lt;ref name ="Albala" /&gt;

Another universal custom among all tribes was the role of women in food consumption. They were always given the jobs of preparation and gathering. Many types of tools were used to prepare food. Made from bones of hunted game, these tools included stirring sticks, ladles, and kettles. Kettles were the primary method of cooking, but other vessels were used, such as clay bowls and baskets. Natives had to develop preservation techniques to avoid the possibility of starvation during the winter. They did this through drying, smoking, and salting.&lt;ref name= "Albala" /&gt;

==Important crops==
[[File:A visual treat of Maize.JPG|thumb|Maize was the quintessential crop for much of the Americas both before and after the Columbian Exchange.]]

===Maize===
{{Main|Maize}}
This crop was initially farmed by members of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], and [[Incan]] cultures. It is an extremely important staple, and is considered to be the most important throughout the native peoples of the New World. Its cultivation allowed people to stop hunting and begin to settle down. Its contribution to the rise of civilization is made clear in its godlike status among native people, frequently being used a subject of art and pottery.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt; Maize was the focal point of many Pre-Columbian religions, playing an analogous role to bread in Western religion. Humans themselves are both physically and spiritually melded from corn.&lt;ref name="food ways"&gt;{{cite book|last1=editors|first1=John Edward Staller, Michael Carrasco,|title=Pre-Columbian foodways interdisciplinary approaches to food, culture, and markets in ancient Mesoamerica|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-0471-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that maize may have even been a staple food in the Pre-Columbian Caribbean. Evidence of its cultivation has been found around the region, suggesting its status as an important foodstuff.&lt;ref name="Mickleburgh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mickleburgh|first1=Hayley, L.|title=New insights into the consumption of maize and other food plants in the pre-Columbian Caribbean from starch grains trapped in human dental calculus|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1 January 2012|volume=39|issue=7|pages=2468–2478|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.02.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Phaseolus]]'' bean
This bean was very important due to its compatibility with another essential crop, [[maize]]. It acted as a companion for maize in farming, nutrition, and cooking. While the bean could contribute nitrogen to the soil, maize could prop up the bean and help it to grow. In addition, the combination of beans and maize was rich in protein, and could be easily combined to become a reliable source of it.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt;

*[[Capsicum]] peppers
These peppers were also prominently featured in pottery, and served many medicinal uses.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt;

*Starches ([[cassava]], [[potato]], and [[sweet potato]]):
The significance of these root crops is made clear by their prominence in sculpture and art.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt; Both potatoes and sweet potatoes were initially cultivated by the Incas.&lt;ref name="Albala" /&gt;

*[[Blueberry]]
This fruit was used in conjunction with dried meat in a dish known as pemmican, common among indigenous tribes.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt;

*[[Brambles]]
Species of ''Rubus'' were not necessarily cultivated by indigenous people, but all modern cultivars originate from species native to North America.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt;

*[[Cacao tree|Cacao]]
The seeds of this plant held monetary value to the Aztecs, and were also common in ceramics. The chocolate that comes from it gave rise to a variety of beverages.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt; Due to the specificity of the environments in which they can succeed, cacao bean cultivation was highly regionalized, grown in plantation-like monocultures.&lt;ref name ="Ornelas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ornelas|first1=editors, Kenneth F. Kiple, Kriemhild Coneè|title=The Cambridge world history of food.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781139058636|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Cactus]]
Also hailing from the New World, cactus crops are now frequently used for fruit, vegetables, and dye.&lt;ref name="Janick"/&gt;

*[[Chokecherries]]
Important for Plains tribes of Native Americans, these cherries were pounded and sun-dried.&lt;ref name="Albala"/&gt;

*''Mannomi''
This wild rice, native to the Great Lakes region of America was extremely important for the Anishinaabe tribe.

==History==
===15,000-13,000 BCE===
Big-game hunters first moved into North America. These people, who came from Siberia through the Bering Plain, then dispersed throughout the Americas and resulted in a variety of different cultures.&lt;ref name="Magoc" /&gt;

*13,000-10,000 B.C.E.
Large mammals start to become extinct, possibly due to human overhunting.&lt;ref name="Magoc" /&gt;

*9500-2000 B.C.E.
People hunt for smaller animals, including fish. People also begin to forage for plants. The foraging of plants and hunting of small animals leads to the formation of settlements along the coast of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Magoc" /&gt;

*3000-1200 B.C.E.
Agriculture begins with the creating of flour and the cultivation of maize. This allows for a more settled lifestyle and spirituality begins to formulate.&lt;ref name="Magoc" /&gt;

*Slightly before 1000 B.C.E.
Seafood essentially disappears from the diets of Peruvians.&lt;ref name ="Callen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callen|first1=E. O.|title=Food Habits of Some Pre-Columbian Mexican Indians|journal=Economic Botany|date=1965|volume=19|issue=4|pages=335–343|jstor=4252642|doi=10.1007/bf02904803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1000 B.C.E. - 1000 C.E.
Cultures of people living in forests live in urban settlements, flourishing thanks to the cultivation of vegetables such as squash. This includes the Adena people, who furthered spirituality by linking works of art to the natural world.&lt;ref name="Magoc" /&gt;

*After 900 B.C.E.
Most Mesoamerican societies begin to rely on maize as their primary source of food.&lt;ref name="food ways" /&gt;

*After 800 B.C.E.
''Phaseolus'' becomes known to the people of Peru.&lt;ref name="Callen" /&gt;

*1100 C.E.
The Hopi people have an agriculture largely based on maize, with beliefs grounded in the power of nature and the "corn mother," who sustains them and gives them life.&lt;ref name="Magoc" /&gt;

*1519 C.E.
Hernan Cortes found the Aztec Empire in the heart of present-day Mexico, amazed at their comprehensive knowledge about health, illness, and treatment.&lt;ref name="Padilla"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padilla|first1=Amado M.|title=Psychology in Pre-Columbian Mexico|journal=Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences|date=March 1988|volume=10|issue=1|pages=55–66|doi=10.1177/07399863880101004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on modern society==
Various crops found in the New World are of monumental importance in today's society, especially [[maize]]. Its value exceeds the monetary gain that the conquistadores had due to silver and gold, and is the most important  world grain. Its production worldwide is over 800 million tons, and is the primary ingredient in animal feed, human food, artificial sweeteners, and even gasoline. For example, maize is still the basis of much of Mexican cuisine.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt; In fact, maize ended up being the Native Americans' downfall when European settlers came to America. Squanto taught them how to plant it, giving them the tool that would allow them to survive and thrive in the new environment. It was the most prolific crop that could be grown in the New World soil, and it could survive in every climate imaginable in North America. By helping the settlers survive, corn contributed to their success.&lt;ref name="Pollan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollan|first1=Michael|title=The Omnivore's Dilemma|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, New York|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countless other New World crops were spread among other countries thanks to [[Christopher Columbus]]. The [[peanut]] became widely used in Africa. Capsicum peppers are a significant part of Asian cuisine. Tomatoes are essential to Italian cuisine and are very common worldwide. The potato is among the most important vegetables. Fruits including pineapple, papaya, and strawberry were widely spread to other countries as well.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt;
 
Industrial crops, especially [[cotton]], [[rubber]], [[quinine]], and [[tobacco]], have become widely grown for non-food purposes. Cotton is common in clothing, rubber has many industrial uses, quinine contributed to the destruction of [[malaria]], and tobacco contributed to many negative health effects.&lt;ref name="Janick" /&gt;

*[[Mexican cuisine]]:
Just like the cultures that inhabited Mexico before the Columbian exchange, the modern Mexican diet is heavily based on corn, beans, and peppers. Corn possesses the same importance in the region today that it did in the past. It remains the essential food product in Mexico and is utilized in a variety of ways. Also, beans are consumed in conjunction with corn like in the past. Other native plants that remain prevalent in Mexico's cuisine include: tomatoes, squash, onions, tomatillos, chayote, avocados, and cactus.&lt;ref name="Albala" /&gt;

Historian Morris Rossabi calls Rashid-al-Din "arguably the most distinguished figure in Persia during Mongolian rule".&lt;ref&gt;''Genghis Khan: World Conqueror?''

==Biography==
[[File:Mongol soldiers by Rashid al-Din 1305.JPG|thumb|Mongol soldiers in the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh|Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh]]'' of Rashid al-Din, 1305–1306.]] 
Rashid al-Din was born into a Persian Jewish family in Hamadan, now in [[Hamadan Province]]. His grandfather had been a courtier to the founder Ilkhanate ruler [[Hulagu Khan]], and Rashid al-Din's father was an [[apothecary]] at the court. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane, ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule,''Hackett Publishing , 2009 p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashid was trained as a physician and started service under Hulagu's son, [[Abaqa Khan]]. He rose to become the [[Grand Vizier]] of the Ilkhanid court at [[Soltaniyeh]], near [[Qazvin]]. He served as [[vizier]] and physician under the Ilkhanate emperors Ghazan and Öljaitü before falling to court intrigues during the reign of [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan]], whose ministers had him killed at the age of seventy. His son, [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din]], briefly served as vizier after him.

==''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh''==
The ''[[Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh]]'' ("Compendium of Chronicles") was commissioned by Ghazan and initially was a history of the [[Mongols]] and their dynasty, but gradually expanded to include the entire history since the time of [[Adam]] to Rashid al-Din's time.

Rashid was assisted by [[Bolad]], a Mongol nobleman who was the emissary of the Great Khan to the Ilkhanid court. Bolad provided him with much background about Mongol history, especially about the [[Borjigin]] clan.

The ''Compendium'' was completed between 1307 and 1316, during the reign of Öljaitü.

===Calligraphy workshop: Rab' i-Rashidi===
The work was executed at the elaborate [[scriptorium]] [[Rab'-e Rashidi]] at [[Qazvin]], where a large team of calligraphers and illustrators were employed to produce lavishly illustrated books.  These books could also be copied, while preserving accuracy, using a printing process imported from China.

Hulagu conquered Muslim Syria, in collaboration with Christian forces from [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Antioch]]. From Rashid al-Din's work.]]

The work was at the time of completion, {{circa|1307}}, of monumental size. Several sections have not survived or been discovered. Portions of the ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'' survive in lavishly illustrated manuscripts, believed to have been produced during his lifetime and perhaps under his direct supervision at the Rab'-e Rashidi workshop.&lt;ref&gt;The large literatre on these includes: S. Blair, ''A compendium of chronicles : Rashid al-Din’s illustrated history of the world'', 1995, 2006 {{ISBN|1-874780-65-X}} (contains a complete set of the folios from Khalili collection, with discussion of the work as a whole); B. Gray, ''The 'World history' of Rashid al-Din: A study of the Royal Asiatic Society manuscript'', Faber, 1978  {{ISBN|0-571-10918-7}}.  See the article on the work for more&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiographical significance===
Volumes I and II of the ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'' have survived and are of great importance for the study of the Ilkhanate. Volume I is "contains the history of the Turkish and Mongol tribes, including their tribal legends, genealogies, myths and the history of the Mongol conquests from the time of [[Genghis Khan]] to the end of the reign of Ghazan Khan"&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lunde|first1=Paul|last2=Mazzawi|first2=Rosalind|title=A History of the World|journal=Saudi Aramco World|date=1981|volume=32|issue=1|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198101/a.history.of.the.world.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; while volume II describes "the history of all the peoples with whom the Mongols had fought or with whom they had exchanged embassies".&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt; In his narration down to the reign of [[Möngke Khan]] (1251–1259), [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]] was Rashid al-Din's main source; however, he also utilized numerous now-lost Far Eastern and other sources. The ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'' is perhaps the single most comprehensive Persian source on the Mongol period. For the period of [[Genghis Khan]], his sources included the now lost ''[[Altan Debter]]'' ("Golden Book"). His treatment of the Ilkhanid period seems to be biased, as he himself was a high official, yet it is still seen as the most valuable written source for the dynasty.

The third volume is either lost or was never completed; its topic was "historical geography".&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

The most important historiographic legacy of the ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'' may be its documentation of the cultural mixing and ensuing dynamism that led to the greatness of the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s, many aspects of which were transmitted to Europe and influenced the [[Renaissance]]. This was the product of the geographical extension of the Mongol Empire, and is most clearly reflected in this work by Rashid al-Din. The text describes the different peoples with whom the Mongols came into contact and is one of the first attempts to transcend a single cultural perspective and to treat history on a universal scale. The ''Jāmiʿ'' attempted to provide a history of the whole world of that era,&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt; though many parts are sadly lost.

One of the volumes of the ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'' deals with an extensive ''History of the Franks'' (1305/1306), possibly based on information from Europeans working under the Ilkhanates such as [[Isol the Pisan]] or the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friars]], which is a generally consistent description with many details on Europe's political organization, the use of ''[[Mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'' by [[Italians|Italian]] [[sailor|mariners]] and regnal chronologies derived from the chronicle of [[Martin of Opava]] (d. 1278).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.329–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book transmission: printing and translation===
[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders I.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mongol military tactics and organization#Cavalry|Mongol cavalry]] pursuing their enemy.]]
[[File:GhazanOnHorse.JPG|thumb|[[Ghazan]] on his horse. Rashid al-Din, ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh''.]]
Rashid al-Din also collected all of his compositions into a single volume, entitled ''Jami' al-Tasanif al-Rashidi'' ("The Collected Works of Rashid"), complete with maps and illustrations. He even had some of his shorter works, on medicine and government, translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Anyone who wished was given access to his works and encouraged to copy them. In order to facilitate this, he set aside a fund to pay for the annual transcription of two complete manuscripts of his works, one in Arabic and one in Persian.

The printing process used at the workshop has been described by Rashid al-Din, and bears very strong resemblance to the processes used in the large printing ventures in China under [[Feng Dao]] (932–953):
{{quote|[W]hen any book was desired, a copy was made by a skillful calligrapher on tablets and carefully corrected by proof-readers whose names were inscribed on the back of the tablets. The letters were then cut out by expert engravers, and all pages of the books consecutively numbered. When completed, the tablets were placed in sealed bags to be kept by reliable persons, and if anyone wanted a copy of the book, he paid the charges fixed by the government. The tablets were then taken out of the bags and imposed on leaves of paper to obtain the printed sheets as desired. In this way, alterations could not be made and documents could be faithfully transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''Science and Civilisation in China''. v.5, "Paper and Printing", ed. [[Tsien Tsuen-hsuin]]. Cambridge University Press, 1985. p. 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system he had copies made, lent them to friends, and urged them to transcribe them and return the originals. He had Arabic translations made of those works he composed in Persian, and Persian translations of works composed in Arabic. When the translations had been prepared, he deposited them in the [[mosque]] library of the ''Rab'-e Rashidi''.&lt;ref name="nation" /&gt;}}

=== Authorship and plagiarism accusations ===

The authorship of the ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'' has been questioned on several grounds.

Abu al-Qasim Kashani (d. 1324), who wrote the most important extant contemporary source on Öljaitü, maintained that he himself was the true author of the ''Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh'', "for which Rashid al-Din had stolen not only the credit but also the very considerable financial rewards."&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 8| pages = 145–148| last = Morgan| first = D.O.| title = Rāshid Al-Dīn Tabīb| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| isbn = 9004098348| date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', "While there is little reason to doubt Rašid-al-Din’s overall authorship of the ''Jāmeʿ al-tawāriḵ'', the work has generally been considered a collective effort, partly carried out by research assistants."&lt;ref name="Melville"&gt;{{Iranica|jame-al-tawarik|Jāmeʿ al-Tawāriḵ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashani may have been one of those assistants.&lt;ref name="Melville"/&gt;

Some also contended that it was a translation of a Mongol original.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt;

==Authorship of his ''Letters''==

Scholars are in dispute about whether Rashid al-Din's ''Letters'' are a forgery or not.  According to [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] in ''The Mongols'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Mongols'', 2nd ed., p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Morton has shown them to be a forgery, probably from the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] period.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Morton, "The Letters of Rashid al-Din: Ilkhanid fact or Timurid fiction?", in R. Amitai-Preiss and D.O. Morgan, ''The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy'' (1999), pp. 155–199.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar who has attempted to defend the letters' authenticity is Abolala Soudovar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soudovar|first1=Abolala|title=In defense of Rašid-od-din and his Letters|journal=Studia Iranica|date=2003|volume=32|page=77–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fahlavi poems==
There are some [[fahlavīyāt]] by him apparently in his native dialect: a hemistich called ''zabān-e fahlavī'' (1976, I, p.&amp;nbsp;290), a quatrain with the appellation ''bayt-efahlavī'', and another hemistich titled ''zabān-e pahlavī'' ("Fahlavi language").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fahlaviyat Ahmad Tafazzoli, "Fahlaviyat" in Encyclopedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of influence and death==
[[Image:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ruler, [[Ghazan]], studying the [[Quran]]]]

In 1312, his colleague [[Sa'd al-Dawla]] fell from power and was replaced by [['Ali Shah]]. Then, in 1314, Öljaitü died and power passed to his son, Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, who sided with 'Ali Shah. In 1318, Rashid al-Din was charged with having poisoned Öljaitü and was executed on July 13, at the age of seventy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Lewis|title=The Jews of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C&amp;pg=PA101|year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2029-4}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; His Jewish ancestry was referenced numerous times in the court. His head was carried around the city after the execution and people were chanting: "This is the head of the Jew who abused God's name, may God's curse be upon him." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Littman|first=David|authorlink=David Littman (activist)|title=Jews Under Muslim Rule: The Case of Persia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENrHHAAACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Institute of Contemporary History}}, page 3. &lt;/ref&gt;

His property was confiscated and ''Rab'-e Rashidi'', with its scriptorium and its precious copies, were turned over to the Mongol soldiery. A century later, during the reign of [[Timur]]'s son [[Miran Shah]], Rashid al-Din's bones were exhumed from the Muslim cemetery and reburied in the Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Douglas|first=William O.|authorlink=William O. Douglas|title=West of the Indus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ikEQfhEeSYC|year=1958|publisher=Doubleday}}, p. 417]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and political thoughts==
Rashid al-din was an Iranian patriot and also an admirer of the Iranian state traditions. The name of "Iran" is mentioned in his ''Jami' al-tawarikh'', and he showed dislike for Mongols (whom he refers to as Turks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PETRUSHEVSKY|first1=I. P.|title=RASH͟ĪD AL-DĪN'S CONCEPTION OF THE STATE|journal=Central Asiatic Journal|date=1 January 1970|volume=14|issue=1/3|pages=148–162|jstor=41926869}}
* Although Rashid al-Din was of a family of Jewish origin nevertheless in his correspondence (as well as in the ''Jami' al-tawarikh'') he invariably speaks as an ardent Sunni Muslim and Iranian patriot, an admirer of the Iranian state traditions.
* Equally, the state of the Ilkhans was to Rashid al-Din not a Mongol ulus, but "the state of Iran" (Mamalik-i Irãn) (...)
* In the ''Jami' al-tawarikh'', a work of semi-official historiography, this Iranian patriotic tendency shows itself only here and there, and then in a disguised form. In his letters Rashid al-Din is more outspoken. There he speaks sharply about the Turks (i. e. the Mongols) as tyrants and oppressors of the Iranian ra'iyyats. Rashid al-Din's dislike for the Turks was also due to the fact that under the last Ilkhans the Mongol-Turkish tribal aristocracy was the main bearer of the centrifugal tendency and a wilful element not always obedient to the central authority in the person of the Ilkhan. In a letter Rashid al-Din calls the Turkish (= Mongol) amirs "pure swindlers and accomplices of the devil".

The local, state, federal and global reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] was unprecedented. The equally unsurpassed events of that day elicited the largest response of local emergency and rescue personnel to assist in the evacuation of the two towers and also contributed to the largest loss of the same personnel when the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|towers collapsed]]. After the attacks, the media termed the [[World Trade Center site]] "[[Ground zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]]", while rescue personnel referred to it as [[Cultural influence of 9/11#Jargon inspired by 9/11|"the Pile"]].

In the ensuing recovery and cleanup efforts, personnel related to metalwork and construction professions would descend on the site to offer their services and remained until the site was cleared in May 2002. In the years since, investigations and studies have examined effects upon those who participated, noting a variety of afflictions attributed to the debris and stress.

==Building evacuation==
After [[American Airlines Flight 11]] crashed into the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, a standard announcement was given to tenants in the South Tower (2 WTC) to stay put and that the building was secure. However, many defied those instructions and proceeded to evacuate the South Tower&lt;ref name="Fritsch"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Day of Terror - The Response: Rescue Workers Rush In, and Many Do Not Return |date=September 12, 2001 |publisher=New York Times |author=Fritsch, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; (most notably, [[Rick Rescorla]], [[Morgan Stanley]] Security Director, evacuated 2687 of the 2700 Morgan Stanley employees in the building). All people evacuating were ordered through a door on the mezzanine level that led to a bridge to another building, and everyone was evacuated through the neighboring building. The firefighters in charge did not want anyone going through the front doors at first due to falling debris, and then because of falling people who had jumped from the towers.

Standard evacuation procedures for [[fire]]s in the World Trade Center called for evacuating only the floors immediately above and below the fire, as simultaneous evacuation of up to 50,000 workers would be too chaotic.&lt;ref name="Fritsch"/&gt;

==Emergency response==
{{See also|Emergency workers killed in the September 11 attacks}}

=== Firefighters ===
[[File:WTC-remnant highres.jpg|thumb|left|upright|250px|A firefighter looks up at the remains of the South Tower. (September 13, 2001)]]
Firefighters from the [[New York City Fire Department]] rushed to the World Trade Center minutes after the first plane struck the north tower. Chief Joseph Pfeifer and his crew with Battalion 1 were among the first on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Terrorist Attack At New York World Trade Center |url=http://www.firehouse.com/terrorist/911/magazine/harvey.html |author=Eisner, Harvey |publisher=Firehouse Magazine |date=April 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042853/http://www.firehouse.com/terrorist/911/magazine/harvey.html |archivedate=2008-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 8:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., an [[Incident Command Post]] was established in the lobby of the North Tower. By 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., shortly before [[United Airlines Flight 175]] hit the South Tower, the FDNY chief had arrived and took over command of the response operations. Due to falling debris and safety concerns, he moved the incident command center to a spot located across [[West Side Highway|West Street]], but numerous fire chiefs remained in the lobby which continued to serve as an operations post where alarms, elevators, communications systems, and other equipment were operated. The initial response by the FDNY was on rescue and evacuation of building occupants, which involved sending firefighters up to assist people that were trapped in elevators and elsewhere. Firefighters were also required to ensure all floors were completely evacuated.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-exec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/executive_summary.pdf |title=FDNY McKinsey Report - Executive Summary |date=August 2002 |publisher=FDNY / McKinsey &amp; Company |accessdate=2007-07-10|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[staging area]]s were set up near the World Trade Center, where responding fire units could report and get deployment instructions.  However, many firefighters arrived at the World Trade Center without stopping at the staging areas.  As a result, many chiefs could not keep track of the whereabouts of their units.  Numerous firefighters reported directly to the building lobbies, and were ordered by those commanding the operating post to proceed into the building.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-exec"/&gt;

Problems with [[Communication during the September 11 attacks#Radio communications|radio communication]] caused commanders to lose contact with many of the firefighters who went into the buildings.  The [[radio repeater|repeater system]] in the World Trade Center, which was required for portable radio signals to transmit reliably, was malfunctioning after the impact of the planes.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-exec"/&gt;  As a result, firefighters were unable to report to commanders on their progress, and were unable to hear evacuation orders. Also, many off-duty firefighters arrived to help, without their radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=9/11 Inspires Call to Review Response Plan For Crises |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 23, 2002 |author1=Lipton, Eric  |author2=James Glanz |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  FDNY commanders lacked communication with the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], who had helicopters at the scene, or with [[Emergency Medical Service]] (EMS) dispatchers.  The firefighters on the scene also did not have access to television reports or other outside information, which could help in assessing the situation.  When the South Tower collapsed at 9:59&amp;nbsp;a.m., firefighters in the North Tower were not aware of exactly what had happened.  The battalion chief in the North Tower lobby immediately issued an order over the radio for firefighters in the tower to evacuate, but many did not hear the order, due to the faulty radios. Because of this, 343 firefighters died in the collapse of the towers.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-exec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"NY Firefighters attack Giuliani," BBC News, July 12, 2007 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6294198.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The command post located across West Street was taken out when the South Tower collapsed, making command and control even more difficult and disorganized.  When the North Tower collapsed, falling debris killed [[Peter Ganci]], the FDNY chief.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-exec"/&gt;  Following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]], a command post was set up at a firehouse in [[Greenwich Village]].

The FDNY deployed 200 units (half of all units) to the site, with more than 400 firefighters on the scene when the buildings collapsed.&lt;ref name="Fritsch"/&gt;  This included a total of 121 engine companies, 62 ladder companies, and other special units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/x7_fire_apparatus_deployment.pdf |title=Fire Apparatus Deployment on September 11 |publisher=FDNY / McKinsey &amp; Company |date=August 2002 |accessdate=2007-07-10|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FDNY also received assistance from fire departments in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], and other neighboring jurisdictions, but with limited ability to manage and coordinate efforts.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-exec"/&gt;
Besides assisting with recovery operations at Ground Zero, volunteer firefighters from Long Island and Westchester manned numerous firehouses throughout the city to assist with other fire and emergency calls.

=== Doctors, EMTs, and other medical staff ===
FDNY [[Emergency medical technician]]s (EMTs), along with 9-1-1 system ambulances operated by voluntary hospitals and volunteer ambulance corps, began arriving at 8:53&amp;nbsp;a.m., and quickly set up a staging area outside the North Tower, at West Street, which was quickly moved over to the corner of Vesey and West Streets.  As more EMTs responded to the scene, five triage areas were set up around the World Trade Center site.  EMS chiefs experienced difficulties communicating via their radios, due to the overwhelming volume of radio traffic.  At 9:45, an additional [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] channel was set aside for use by chiefs and supervisors only, but many did not know about this and continued to operate on the other channel. The communication difficulties meant that commanders lacked good [[situational awareness]].&lt;ref name="mckinsey-ems"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/ems_response.pdf |title=McKinsey Report - Emergency Medical Service response |publisher=FDNY / McKinsey &amp; Company |date=August 9, 2002 |accessdate=2007-07-12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dispatcher]]s at the [[9-1-1]] call center, who coordinate EMS response and assign units, were overwhelmed with incoming calls, as well as communications over the radio system.  Dispatchers were unable to process and make sense of all the incoming information, including information from people trapped in the towers, about conditions on the upper floors.  Overwhelmed dispatchers were unable to effectively give instructions and manage the situation.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-ems"/&gt;

EMS personnel were in disarray after the collapse of the South Tower at 9:59&amp;nbsp;a.m.  Following the collapse of the North Tower at 10:28&amp;nbsp;a.m., EMS commanders regrouped on the North End of [[Battery Park City, Manhattan|Battery Park City]], at the [[Embassy Suites Hotel]].  Around 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., EMS triage centers were relocated and consolidated at the [[Chelsea Piers]] and the [[Staten Island Ferry]] Terminal.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-ems"/&gt;  Throughout the early afternoon, the soundstages at the pier were separated into two areas, one for the more seriously injured and one for the walking wounded. On the acute side, multiple makeshift tables, each with a physician, nurse, and other health care workers, and non-emergency service volunteers, were set up for the arrival of mass casualties.

Supplies, including equipment for airway and vascular control, were obtained from neighboring hospitals. Throughout the afternoon, local merchants arrived to donate food. Despite this, few patients arrived for treatment, the earliest at about 5 p.m., and were not seriously injured, being limited to smoke inhalation. An announcement was made around 6–7 p.m. that a second shift of providers would cover the evening shift, and that an area was being set up for the day personnel to sleep. Soon after, when it was realized that few would have survived the collapse and be brought to the piers, many decided to leave and the area was closed down.

===Amateur radio===
[[Amateur radio]] played a role in the rescue and clean-up efforts. Amateur radio operators established communications, maintained emergency networks, and formed bucket brigades with hundreds of other volunteer personnel. Approximately 500 amateur radio operators volunteered their services during the disaster and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-arecs.org/ARRLWeb+ARES-RACES+NYC+Effort+Stands+Down;+REACT+Still+Seeking+Amateur+Operators.htm|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=27 July 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134117/http://www.nyc-arecs.org/ARRLWeb%20ARES-RACES%20NYC%20Effort%20Stands%20Down;%20REACT%20Still%20Seeking%20Amateur%20Operators.htm|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/arrlletter?issue=2001-09-21|title=ARRL Letter|author=|date=|website=www.arrl.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey Legislature honored the role of Amateur Radio operators in a proclamation on December 12, 2002.

{{blockquote|"I would like to take this opportunity to commend you for your hard work and efforts," said Assembly Speaker Albio Sires. "During times of disaster, your group has displayed superior service and dedication to the safety of our citizens.

==Search and rescue efforts==
On the day following the attacks, 11 people were rescued from the rubble, including six [[firefighter]]s and three [[police officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/12/lkl.00.html |title=America Under Attack: The Aftermath, Larry King Live |publisher=CNN |date=September 12, 2001&lt;!-- - 21:00 ET--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One woman was rescued from the rubble, near where a West Side Highway pedestrian bridge had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stunned Rescuers Comb Attack Sites, But Thousands are Presumed Dead |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 13, 2001 |author=McFadden, Robert D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two PAPD officers, [[John McLoughlin (9/11 attacks survivor)|John McLoughlin]] and [[Will Jimeno]], were also rescued.

In total, only twenty survivors were pulled out of the rubble. The final survivor, [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] secretary Genelle Guzman-McMillan, was rescued 27 hours after the collapse of the North Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaer|first1=Matthew|title=Survivor, Last Pulled Out|url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/last-survivor/|accessdate=10 September 2016|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firefighters and civilians who survived made cell phone calls from voids beneath the rubble, though the amount of debris made it difficult for rescue workers to get to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Searchers Sift Through Grim Scene |publisher=The Miami Herald |date=September 13, 2001 |author=Greene, Ronnie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rescue efforts were paused numerous times in the days after the attack, due to concerns that nearby buildings, including [[One Liberty Plaza]], were in danger of collapsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A fight vs. steel, despair &amp; weather Rescuers press on valiantly, despite odds |publisher=Daily News (New York) |date=September 14, 2001 |author=Heisler, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery efforts==
[[File:FEMA - 5401 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-28-2001 in New York.jpg|thumb|right|A firefighter watches debris removal at the World Trade Center on September 28th.]]
The search and rescue effort in the immediate aftermath at the World Trade Center site involved [[ironworker]]s, [[structural engineering|structural engineer]]s, heavy machinery operators, [[asbestos]] workers, [[boilermaker]]s, [[carpenter]]s, cement masons, construction managers, [[electrician]]s,  insulation workers, [[machinist]]s, [[plumber]]s and [[pipefitter]]s, [[rigger (industry)|rigger]]s, [[sheet metal]] workers, steelworkers, [[trucker]]s and [[teamsters]], [[American Red Cross]] volunteers, and many others.&lt;ref name="osha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/dangerous_worksite.pdf The US Congress (in concert with The Minetta Transportation Institute) has determined that in the initial weeks after Sep11th, 60% of The Rescue &amp; Recovery personnel at WTC/Ground Zero were NYC Transit workers.

===Organization===
[[New York City Office of Emergency Management]] was the agency responsible for coordination of the City's response to the attacks. Headed by then-Director [[Richard Sheirer]], the agency was forced to vacate its headquarters, located in 7 World Trade Center, within hours of the attack. The building later collapsed. OEM reestablished operations temporarily at the police academy, where Mayor Giuliani gave many press conferences throughout the afternoon and evening of September 11. By Friday, rescue and reliefs were organized and administered from Pier 92 on the Hudson River.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen, Steven, William Eimicke and Jessica Horan |title=Catastrophe and the Public Service: A Case Study of the Government Response to the Destruction of the World Trade Center |journal=Public Administration Review |date=September 2002 |volume=62 | pages = 24 | doi = 10.1111/1540-6210.62.s1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers quickly descended on Ground Zero to help in the rescue and recovery efforts.  At [[Jacob Javits Convention Center]], thousands showed up to offer help, where they registered with authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stamey, Mark |title=Volunteers are Lining Up by the Thousands |publisher=The New York Post |date=September 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction projects around the city came to a halt, as workers walked off the jobs to help at Ground Zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=As Hard Hats Volunteer in Rubble, City's Building Boom Falls Into Doubt |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2001 |author1=Blumenthal, Ralph  |author2=Charles V. Bagli |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ironworkers, welders, steel burners, and others with such skills were in high demand.  By the end of the first week, over one thousand ironworkers from across North America had arrived to help, along with countless others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ironworkers Offer Help at WTC |publisher=Newsday |date=September 15, 2001 |author=Hetter, Katia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Department of Design &amp; Construction]] oversaw the recovery efforts.  Beginning on September 12, the [[Structural Engineers Association of New York]] (SEAoNY) became involved in the recovery efforts, bringing in experts to review the stability of the rubble, evaluate safety of hundreds of buildings near the site, and designing support for the cranes brought in to clear the debris.  The City of New York hired the engineering firm, LZA-[[Thornton Tomasetti]], to oversee the structural engineering operations at the site.&lt;ref name="domel"&gt;{{cite web |author=Domel, Jr., August |date=November 2001 |url=http://www.ncsea.com/downloads/wtcseerp.pdf |title=World Trade Center Disaster: Structural Engineers at Ground Zero|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the effort more manageable, the World Trade Center site was divided into four quadrants or zones.  Each zone was assigned a lead contractor, and a team of three structural engineers, subcontractors, and rescue workers.&lt;ref name="domel"/&gt;

* [[AMEC]] - North Tower along [[West Side Highway|West Street]]
* [[Bovis Lend Lease]] - South Tower along Liberty Street
* Tully Construction Company, Inc. - Eastern portion of the WTC site
* Turner/Plaza Construction Joint Venture - Northern portion and [[7 World Trade Center]]

The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), and the New York City Office of Emergency Management (OEM) provided support.&lt;ref name="domel"/&gt;  Forestry [[incident management team]]s (IMTs) also provided support beginning in the days after the attacks to help manage operations.&lt;ref name="mckinsey-fireops"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/fire_operations_response.pdf |title=FDNY McKinsey Report - Fire Operations Response |date=August 2002 |publisher=FDNY / McKinsey &amp; Company |accessdate=2007-07-10|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearby [[Burger King]] restaurant was used as a center for police operations.&lt;ref name="hamill"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hamill, Denis |title=Rescue Workers Keep Up Quest for Signs of Life Ruin All Over, But Not One Unkind Word |publisher=Daily News (New York) |date=September 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that workers worked at the site, or ''[[World Trade Center site|The Pile]]'', for shifts as long as twelve hours, a specific culture developed at the site, leading to workers developing their own [[argot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groundzeromuseumworkshop.com/lingo.htm|title=GROUND ZERO MUSEUM WORKSHOP: GARY MARLON SUSON|author=|date=12 January 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112130645/http://www.groundzeromuseumworkshop.com/lingo.htm|archivedate=12 January 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debris removal===
"The Pile" was the term coined by the rescue workers to describe the 1.8 million tons of wreckage left from the collapse of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="hamill"/&gt; They avoided the use of "[[ground zero]]", which describes the epicenter of a [[bomb]] explosion.

Numerous volunteers organized to form "bucket brigades", which passed 5-gallon buckets full of debris down a line to investigators, who sifted through the debris in search of evidence and human remains.  Ironworkers helped cut up steel beams into more manageable sizes for removal.  Much of the debris was hauled off to the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on [[Staten Island]] where it was further searched and sorted.&lt;ref name="hamill"/&gt;

====Reuse of steel====
[[File:Steel from WTC for USS New York.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Steel from the World Trade Center is poured for construction of USS ''New York''.]]

Some of the steel was reused for memorials. New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Twenty-four tons of the steel used in construction of [[USS New York (LPD-21)|USS ''New York'' (LPD-21)]] came from the small amount of rubble from the World Trade Center preserved for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Baldwin, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2191181,00.html "Warship built out of Twin Towers wreckage"], Times Online, May 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hazards====
Hazards at the World Trade Center site included a [[diesel fuel]] tank buried seven stories below.&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt;  Approximately 2,000 [[automobile]]s that had been in the [[parking garage]] also presented a risk, with each containing, on average, at least five gallons of gasoline.  Once recovery workers reached down to the parking garage level, they found some cars that had exploded and burned.&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt;  The [[United States Customs Service]], which was housed in [[6 World Trade Center]], had 1.2 million rounds of ammunition and weapons in storage in a third-floor vault, to support their [[firing range]].&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt;

In the hours immediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center, [[Raising the Flag at Ground Zero|three firefighters raised an American flag over the rubble]]. The flag was taken from a yacht, and the moment, which was captured on a well-known photograph, evoked comparisons to the iconic [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima photograph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/03/06/2004-03-06_sue_city_in_9-11_flag_flap.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Sue City In 9-11 Flag Flap | date=March 6, 2004 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David W.|journal=New York Times|title=With 9/11 Flag, a Mystery Unfurls|date=September 4, 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/nyregion/with-9-11-flag-a-mystery-unfurls.html|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morale of rescue workers was boosted on September 14, 2001 when President [[George W. Bush]] paid a visit to Ground Zero.  Standing with retired firefighter [[Bob Beckwith]], Bush addressed the firefighters and rescue workers with a bullhorn and thanked them.&lt;ref name = "NYDN1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-26/news/18186914_1_president-bush-fire-truck-bullhorn|title=Bush is given WTC megaphone|first1=Kenneth|last=Bazinet|date=26 February 2002|accessdate=5 September 2011|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/09/14/bushnyc_010914.html | work=CBC News | title=Bush visits 'ground zero' in New York | date=September 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, rescue workers realized that they were not going to find any more survivors.  After a couple of weeks, the conditions at Ground Zero remained harsh, with lingering [[odor]]s of decaying human remains and smoke.  Morale among workers was boosted by letters they received from children around the United States and the world, as well as support from thousands of neighbors in [[TriBeCa]] and other Lower Manhattan neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Up From Zero |date=2003 |publisher=Production Link LLC |people=Sutherland, Ann DeStefano and Tim Baney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This support continued to spread and eventually led to the founding of over 250 non-profit organizations of which raised almost $700 million within their first two years of operation.&lt;ref name="morale"&gt;{{cite news|first=Inside Staff|title=Public Administration Experts Track 9-11 Nonprofits|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/inside/index.php/inside/story/public-administration-expert-tracks-9-11-nonprofits|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=Inside Bingham University|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the nonprofits included One Day's Pay, later changed to MyGoodDeed, which championed the effort to designate [[September 11 National Day of Service|September 11 as an official National Day of Service]] (9/11 Day).

By 2012, many of the 250 plus organizations had disbanded due to lack of funding as the years progressed. Of the ones that remain, a handful remained functioning for those who remain in need. One of these organizations, Tuesday's Children, was founded the day after September 11 in hopes of supporting the children immediately affected by the attacks. The founder of this non-profit, [[David Weild|David Weild IV]],  now calls them one of the "last men standing" in that they are now one of the few remaining organizations who "provide direct services for what social-service groups and survivors of the attacks call the '9-11 Community.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berkman|first=Jacob|title=As Anniversary Nears, 9/11 Charities Struggle to Raise Money|journal=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=25 August 2011|volume=23|issue=17|pages=25|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/As-Anniversary-Nears-9-11/128761/|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable non-profits who are "still standing" include:
# VOICES of September 11 who are "built on the mission of providing a 'voice' for those who died in the attacks" and "provide case management services, focus groups, depression and anxiety screenings, among other help for victims' families."
#  New York Says Thank You which is based on the idea of reaching out and giving back to "the communities who helped the city when it needed it the most"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prois|first=Jessica|title=9/12: How Forming Nonprofits Eased The Grief For Victims' Families|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/12/the-impact-of-912-how-for_n_957419.html|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=09/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military support==

=== Civil Air Patrol ===

Immediately following the attacks, members of the [[Civil Air Patrol]] (CAP) were called up to help respond.  Northeast Region placed their region personnel and assets on alert mere moments after they learned of the attack.  With the exception of CAP, civilian flights were grounded by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]].  CAP flew [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance from air and space vehicles|aerial reconnaissance]] missions over Ground Zero, to provide detailed analysis of the wreckage and to aid in recovery efforts, including transportation of blood donations.

=== National Guard ===
Elements of the New York Army National Guard's 1-101st Cavalry (Staten Island), 258th Field Artillery, 442nd Military Police Company, and [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Infantry Regiment]] based in Manhattan were the first military force to secure Ground Zero on September 11th. The 69th Infantry's armory on Lexington Avenue became the Family Information Center to assist persons in locating missing family members.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Sean. ''The Fighting 69th: One Remarkable National Guard Unit's Journey from Ground Zero to Baghdad'', Penguin Books, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:National Guard at WTC.jpg|thumb|left|Two members of the [[New York Army National Guard]] standing at the World Trade Center site]]
The National Guard supplemented the NYPD and FDNY, with 2,250 guard members on the scene by the next morning.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt; Eventually thousands of New York Army and [[Air National Guardsmen]] participated in the rescue/recovery efforts. They conducted site security at the WTC, and at other locations. They provided the NYPD with support for traffic control, and they participated directly in recovery operations providing manpower in the form of "bucket brigades" sorting through the debris by hand.

Additionally service members provided security at a variety of location throughout the city and New York State to deter further attacks and reassure the public.

Members of the Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing out of Scotia, and Syracuse's 174th Fighter Wing immediately responded to New York City, setting up camp at places such as Fort Hamilton.  Mostly civil engineers, firefighters and military police, they greatly aided in the clean-up effort.  F-16s from the 174th Fighter Wing also ramped up their flying sorties and patrolled the skies.

The [[New Jersey National Guard]] assisted the New York National Guard's efforts following the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/military/publications/guardlife/volume34no1/6.html|title=Guardlife - The Magazine of the New Jersey National Guard|author=|date=|website=www.nj.gov|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. Marine Corps ===
[[File:Jason Thomas.JPG|thumb|Marine [[Jason Thomas (Marine)|Sgt. Jason Thomas]] standing at the site of the ruined World Trade Center, several days after the attacks]]

[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were also present to assist in the rescue efforts. No official numbers of men who helped out was released but there was evidence that they were there.
Films such as 2006 docudrama ''[[World Trade Center (film)|World Trade Center]]'' talked of two Marines who rescued two trapped police officers in the rubble. US Marines were headquartered at 340  Westside Hwy Bloomberg News Building. The commanding officer was Navy Commander Hardy, and executive officer was Maj Priester. These two oversaw 110 military personnel of various branches, various police departments and EMTs.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== U.S. Navy ===
The U.S. Navy deployed a hospital ship [[USNS Comfort (T-AH-20)|USNS ''Comfort'' (T-AH-20)]] to Pier 92 in Manhattan. Crew members provided food and shelter for more than 10,000 relief workers. Comfort's 24-hour galley also provided an impressive 30,000 meals. Its medical resources were also used to provide first-aid and sick call services to nearly 600 people. The ship's psychological response team also saw more than 500 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Handling of cleanup procedure==
{{See also|United States Environmental Protection Agency September 11 attacks pollution controversy}}
A May 14, 2007, ''New York Times'' article, "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy," gave the interpretation that thousands of workers at Ground Zero have become sick and that "many regard Mr. Giuliani's triumph of leadership as having come with a human cost." The article reported that the mayor seized control of the cleanup of Ground Zero, taking control away from established federal agencies, such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].  He instead handed over responsibility to the "largely unknown" city Department of Design and Construction.  Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of [[respirators]].  Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony DePalma, "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy," "New York Times," May 14, 2007, 1, or https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html?hp&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers at the Ground Zero pit worked without proper respirators.  They wore painters' masks or no facial covering.  Specialists claim that the only effective protection against toxins, such as airborne asbestos, is a special respirator.  New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health industrial hygienist David Newman said, "I was down there watching people working without respirators." He continued, "Others took off their respirators to eat.  It was a surreal, ridiculous, unacceptable situation."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Michael Mason, "The 9/11 Cover-Up," ''Discover,'' October 2007, p. 24 http://discovermagazine.com/2007/oct/the-9-11-cover-up&lt;/ref&gt;

The local EPA office sidelined the regional EPA office.  Dr. Cate Jenkins, a whistle-blower EPA scientist, said that on September 12, 2001, a regional EPA office offered to dispatch 30 to 40 electron microscopes to the WTC pit to test bulk dust samples for the presence of [[asbestos]] fibers.  Instead, the local office chose the less effective polarized light microscopy testing method. Dr. Jenkins alleged that the local office refused, and said, "We don't want you fucking cowboys here. The best thing they could do is reassign you to [[Alaska]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===Health effects===
{{Main|Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks}}
[[File:EPA WTC 2001-10-10.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] employee checks one of the many air sampling locations set up around the site of the World Trade Center.]]

There were many health problems caused by the toxins. 99% of exposed firefighters reported at least one new respiratory problem while working at the World Trade Center site that they had not experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9/11 Health|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/html/rescue/know.shtml|accessdate=3 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128042040/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/html/rescue/know.shtml|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic airway disease is the main lung injury among firefighters who were exposed to toxins during 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiden MD|author2=Ferrier N. |author3=Nolan A |journal= Chest|year=2010|volume=137|issue=3|pages=566–574|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1086333&amp;issueno=3|accessdate=3 December 2012|doi=10.1378/chest.09-1580|title=Obstructive Airways Disease With Air Trapping Among Firefighters Exposed to World Trade Center Dust|pmc=2832867|pmid=19820077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after the attacks, among those who never smoked, approximately 13% of firefighters and 22% of EMS had lungs that did not function as well as others around the same age. Steep declines in pulmonary lung function has been a problem since first detected among firefighters and EMS within a year of 9/11 have persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldrich|first=TK|author2=Gustave, Hall |journal=Lung Functions in Rescue Workers at the World Trade Center after 7 years|year=2010|volume=362|pages=1263–1272|pmid=20375403|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0910087|title=Lung function in rescue workers at the World Trade Center after 7 years.|pmc=4940972}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Increasing numbers of Ground Zero workers are getting [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks|illness]]es, such as cancer. Between September 11, 2001, through 2008, there were 263 new cases of cancer found in 8,927 male firefighters who responded to 9/11 attacks. This number is 25 more than what is expected from men from a similar age group and race. There is a 19% increase in cancer overall, between firefighters who responded to the attacks and those who were not exposed to toxins from responding to the attacks on September 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rescue and recovery workers|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2007, Ground Zero workers and groups such as [[Sierra Club]] and Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes met at the Ground Zero site and urged President [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] to spend more money on aid for sick Ground Zero workers.  They said that the $25 million that Bush promised for the ill workers was inadequate.  A Long Island iron-worker, John Sferazo, at the protest rally said, "Why has it taken you 5½ years to meet with us, Mr. President?"&lt;ref&gt;Emi Endo, "Sick 9/11 workers protest at Ground Zero" Newsday, January 31, 2007 http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/am-groundzero0201,0,1528416.story?coll=ny-main-bigpix&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefighters, police and their unions, have criticized Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] over the issue of protective equipment and illnesses after the attacks.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Ben Smith, "Rudy's Black Cloud", ''New York Daily News'', September 18, 2006, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; An October study by the National Institute of Environmental Safety and Health said that cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/09/08/1349248|title=Democracy Now! - New Yorkers Tell Federal Officials To Stop Ignoring 9/11's Health Effects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=democracynow.org|accessdate=8 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115002115/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F09%2F08%2F1349248|archivedate=15 November 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Director of the National Fraternal Order of Police reportedly said of Giuliani: "Everybody likes a Churchillian kind of leader who jumps up when the ashes are still falling and takes over. But two or three good days don't expunge an eight-year record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660203115,00.html|title=Giuliani will miss firefighters event|author=|date=14 March 2007|website=deseretnews.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sally Regenhard]], said, "There's a large and growing number of both FDNY families, FDNY members, former and current, and civilian families who want to expose the true failures of the Giuliani administration when it comes to 9/11."  She told the ''New York Daily News'' that she intends to "[[Swiftboating|Swift Boat]]" Giuliani.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Smith, Rudy's Black Cloud: WTC Health Risks may hurt Prez Bid." "New York Daily News," September 18, 2006, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various health programs arose after the attacks to provide treatment for 9/11-related illnesses among responders, recovery workers, and other survivors. When the [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]] became federal law in January 2011, these programs were replaced by the [[World Trade Center Health Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/politics/911.bill_1_first-responders-funding-votes-house-members?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=Bloomberg urges passage of 9/11 health bill | date=December 20, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327152416/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/politics/911.bill_1_first-responders-funding-votes-house-members?_s=PM%3APOLITICS | archivedate=March 27, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WTCHP faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center Health Program FAQ|url=https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/faq.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==
Soon after the attacks, [[Government of New York City|New York City]] commissioned [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] to investigate the response of both the [[New York City Fire Department]] and [[New York City Police Department]] and make recommendations on how to respond more effectively to such large-scale emergencies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2002b/pr223-02.html |title=Mayor Michael R.

Kelly, and Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta Release McKinsey &amp; Company Studies of NYPD's and FDNY's Responses to World Trade Center Attack |date=August 19, 2002 |publisher=The City of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials with the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]] have also criticized [[Rudy Giuliani]] for failing to support modernized radios that might have spared the lives of more firefighters. Some firefighters never heard the evacuation orders and died in the collapse of the towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-firefighters8apr08,0,4483360,full.story | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Giuliani foes plan to use 9/11 against him | first=Peter | last=Wallsten | date=April 8, 2007 | accessdate=Sep 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconstruction==
{{Main|World Trade Center (2001–present)}}
Plans for the World Trade Center rebuilding started in July 2002 which was headed by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. There were many proposals on how to build the World Trade Center back however many lacked creativity.  Several architects were chosen throughout this construction process, but all of them ran into many problems with the design. The financial crisis in 2008 also forced the construction process over to the Port Authority; however, the Port Authority construction is not going as smoothly as planned. City officials are looking for better ways to lower the problems and delays. The World Trade Center completion of construction was scheduled for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suddath|first=Claire|title=What Took So Long?

'''Richard Stanley Nickel''' (May 31, 1928 – April 13, 1972) was a [[Polish Americans|Polish American]] [[architectural photographer]] and [[historical preservationist]], who was based in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He is best known for his efforts to preserve and document the buildings of architect [[Louis Sullivan]], and the work of the architecture firm of Adler &amp; Sullivan.&lt;ref name=book&gt;Cahan, Richard; "They All Fall Down: Richard Nickel's Struggle to Save America's Architecture"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Richard Nickel was born in the Chicago neighborhood of [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] in a two-flat located at 4327 W. Haddon.&lt;ref name=p31&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by first-generation Polish Americans with his grandfather John Nikiel, born in Posen, Germany in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;They All Fall Down: Richard Nickel's Struggle to Save America's Architecture by Richard Cahan p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's father, Stanley, a driver for the [[Polish Daily News]], [[Americanized]] the surname to Nickel in the face of [[Anti-Polish sentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The family soon moved to 4329 W. Crystal where a young Richard attended grammar school at St. Cyril and Methodius.&lt;ref name=p31/&gt; It was here that Richard first became fascinated by light as he stared at the saintly figures drawn in [[stained glass]]. Nickel would tell a reporter in 1969 ''"That makes an impression on you that you never completely forget. It might be subconscious and, at some point, something triggers it".&lt;ref name=p31/&gt;

The family moved to a second floor apartment at 2457 N. Rockwell in the [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]] community, while Nickel was in fifth grade and enrolled at St. John Berchman's School.&lt;ref name=p32&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the neighborhood was predominately Polish, and years later Nickel described it as the "Polish neighborhood where I became happily abnormal".&lt;ref name=p32/&gt; The family lived near Logan Boulevard, an area lined with historic mansions and wide parkways that would later become recognized as a [[Chicago Landmark]]. More important was his father Stanley's acute interest in photography which Richard would take up as well.&lt;ref name=p32/&gt;

In 1948 after leaving the Army, Nickel was given a victory medal and subsequently enrolled at the Institute of Design, which became part of IIT- The Illinois Institute of Technology. The school was housed in the former Chicago Historical Society building, located at 632 N. Dearborn Street (Northwest corner of Dearborn and Ontario streets, now called the Excaliber nightclub).&lt;ref&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickel married a young Polish American girl named Adrienne Dembo at [[St. Wenceslaus in Chicago|St. Wenceslaus church]], noted for its [[Art Deco]] design, on June 10, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Richard was recalled to serve in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; After Richard's return a few years later, he was a changed man, with recurring nightmares he was still in Korea. His mother-in law commented that she saw him as a "casualty of war." The marriage finally ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;They All Fall Down: p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography and historic preservation==

During the [[urban regeneration]] of the 1960s and 1970s, scores of 19th century buildings in Chicago were being demolished. Among these were the works of [[Louis Sullivan]] and of other architects designing in the [[Prairie School architecture|Prairie School style]].

By this time many of the buildings were neglected, with little public interest in their retention.  Nickel encountered Sullivan's work while photographing the architect's buildings for a school project at the [[IIT Institute of Design]] in Chicago under [[Aaron Siskind]]. Studying and photographing Sullivan's buildings quickly became an obsession for him. Ultimately, he devoted much of his life to photographing them, hoping to produce a comprehensive photographic [[compendium]]. Some were documentation projects for the federal [[Historic American Buildings Survey|HABS—Historic American Buildings Survey]].

Richard Nickel came to believe that such buildings were an important part of Chicago's architectural and cultural heritage. Realizing that the pace of [[urban renewal]] and development seriously threatened many of these historic buildings, Nickel campaigned and lobbied for their preservation.  Celebrated buildings such as the [[Garrick Theater (Chicago)|Garrick Theater]] and the [[Chicago Stock Exchange]] were torn down despite the best efforts of Nickel and others to preserve them. However, after Nickel's death, his crusade gained momentum and was responsible for many of Sullivan's buildings eventually being spared. Of the ongoing threat to Chicago's buildings Nickel said "Great architecture has only two natural enemies: water and stupid men."

In the cases where he was unable to protect a building, Nickel extensively photographed both its interior and exterior to archive the craftsmanship and attempt to preserve the buildings' character in his images. He also stripped some of the doomed buildings of their distinctive ornamentation before their destruction.  Dozens of such items were sold to [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] (SIUE) and are still on display.

Richard Nickel documented many of the architectural masters of Chicago, photographing the work of [[Burnham &amp; Root]], [[Holabird &amp; Roche]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], C. F. Murphy Associates, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]].

===Residence===
Nickel's home at 1810 West Cortland Street in [[Logan Square, Chicago#Bucktown|Bucktown]], Logan Square (Chicago) served as his base for photography and salvage operations. Infatuated with the brick building's front elevation, simple floor plan, and history, Nickel referred to it as his "Polish Palazzo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationchicago.org/success-story/19 reservationchicago.org: "Success Story"]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked hard to restore the building.

==Death and legacy==
Richard Nickel was killed on April 13, 1972, while attempting to salvage more architectural items when a portion of the [[Old Chicago Stock Exchange]] building collapsed on him. He is buried in Chicago's [[Graceland Cemetery]], not far from Louis Sullivan.

The 1994 book by Richard Cahan, ''They All Fall Down: Richard Nickel's Struggle to Save America's Architecture'', is about Nickel's lifelong effort, with friend and architect [[John Vinci]], to preserve Chicago's architectural heritage.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; Richard Cahan and Michael Williams co-edited a collection of Nickel's photography, titled ''Richard Nickel's Chicago: Photographs of a Lost City''.

===Works===
Nickel's black-and-white photos have been displayed at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and elsewhere. The Richard Nickel Committee and Photographic Archive, a non-profit organization was devoted to preserving the photographer's work for more than 40 years, and holds the copyrights for most of his pictures.

Nickel died without completing a book that he had begun in the 1950s, of his large collection of photographs of Sullivan's work that he took. The book was finally completed and published in 2010, ''The Complete Architecture of Adler &amp; Sullivan'' — by Richard Nickel, with Aaron Siskind, John Vinci, and Ward Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/arts/design/31antiques.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0  "Richard Nickel's Study of Louis Sullivan Is Published" (Dec. 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Richard Nickel Archive====
Richard Nickel's works, which include negatives, photographs, and research papers, have been donated to the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago by the Richard Nickel Committee in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/press_pdf/Richard_Nickel_Archi.pdf Department of Public Affairs of the Art Institute of Chicago: "Donation of the Richard Nickel Archive" (17 Nov. 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Richard Nickel Archive collection is accessible to the public at the Art Institute, along with a finding aid to the collection&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Nickel,%20Richard,%20Archive/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1 Ryerson and Burnham Libraries: Richard Nickel Archive Finding Aid]&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, more than 1,300 images from the Richard Nickel Committee's donated collection are available for viewing online at the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries' website pages for the Richard Nickel Archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Nickel,%20Richard,%20Archive/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1 Ryerson and Burnham Libraries: Richard Nickel Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous duplicate photographs have been donated over time to other institutions, including The Arts Club of Chicago, the Society of Architectural Historians, Landmarks Illinois, and Preservation Chicago. Photographs of the Garrick Theatre were donated by the Richard Nickel Committee to the collection of the [[Polish Museum of America]] in Chicago.

'''Rural Heritage Southland''' is a Heritage Trust that was established in 2002. Originally it was designed to illustrate family farm life in [[Southland Region|Southland]], [[New Zealand]] from the [[inter-war]] period of 1925–1935. The focus has now shifted to include all southern rural heritage (such as agriculture, horticulture, machinery, farm equipment and oral history). As such, the Rural Heritage Southland now has assumed more of a [[stewardship]] role of safeguarding and promoting the rural past through its various projects.
[[Image:SRHT Logo.png|thumb|right|Southland Rural Heritage Trust Logo]]

==Projects==
'''Rural Heritage Day''' — This [[living history]] event is held every two years. It includes a wide range of rural domestic and working exhibitions from: blade shearing to dog handling, and jam making to blacksmithing.  Competitions such as hay bale throwing (over rugby posts) and rides on traction engines are particularly popular.

'''Oral History Project''' — this project begun in 2006 aims to record as many stories about Southland's rural heritage as possible before they are gone. It also acts as a training ground for new oral historians to learn interview techniques and how to use digital recording equipment. The recorded stories are accessible from the [[Invercargill Public Library]].

'''Southland Regional Heritage Forum''' - First held at Southland Boys High School in April 2012. The Heritage Forum is chance for Southland heritage organisations to get together, share ideas and network.

==Overview==
The theoreticians of the "Screen theory" approach—[[Colin MacCabe]], [[Stephen Heath]] and [[Laura Mulvey]]—describe the "[[Apparatus theory|cinematic apparatus]]" as a version of [[Althusser|Althusser's]] [[ideological state apparatus]]. According to Screen theory, it is the spectacle that creates the spectator and not the other way round. The fact that the subject is created and subjected at the same time by the narrative on screen is masked by the apparent realism of the communicated content. This is also explained by Screen's conceptualization of the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] theory, which regards a text as an act of intervention in the present so that the film is considered a work of production of meanings rather than reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arts in the 1970s: Cultural Closure|last=Moore-Gilbert|first=Bart|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0415099056|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of taking representation as a means of reproducing what is real, representation serves as a point of departure. 

Screen theory's origins can be traced to the essays "Mirror Stage" by [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jacques-Alain Miller|Jacques-Alain Miller's]] ''Suture: Elements of the Logic of the Signifier''.&lt;ref name="rule"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArEQCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=Psychoanalytic Film Theory and The Rules of the Game|last1=McGowan|first1=Todd|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=|isbn=9781628920857|location=New York|page=|pages=57-58|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory describes an infant who has a fragmented experience of its body but once he looks in a mirror, he sees a whole being instead of fragmentary one.&lt;ref name="rule" /&gt; Lacan called this a deception, one that is essential to the function of imaginary order that creates illusory wholeness.

The '''Serb-Hungarian Baranya-Baja Republic''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Baranya-Bajai Szerb-Magyar Köztársaság'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Српско-мађарска република Барања-Баја, ''Srpsko-mađarska republika Baranja-Baja'') was a short-lived, Soviet-oriented mini-state, proclaimed in [[Pécs]] on 14 August 1921, on occupied Hungarian territory during the peacemaking aftermath of the first World War, tolerated and fostered by the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. Its territory included the geographical region of [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] and the northern part of [[Bačka]] region.

== History ==
The republic was established on 14 August 1921&lt;ref name="Szűts" /&gt; and was dissolved on 20 August 1921.&lt;ref name="Szűts" /&gt; The area of southern Hungary was occupied by the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]' army and was administrated by the [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja|people's administration]] from [[Novi Sad]]. Following the defeat of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in the summer of 1919, many communist dissidents from [[Budapest]], escaping from the "white terror" of Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], emigrated to Baranya, where [[Béla Linder]], mayor of Pécs, gave them refuge. Linder, the military attaché of the Hungarian Soviet Republic based in [[Vienna]] in [[Austria]], became the mayor of Pécs in September 1920.

In the Great People's Assembly of Pécs on 14 August, where in front of 15-20,000 people&lt;ref name="Szűts"&gt;Szűts Emil: Az elmerült sziget. A Baranyai Szerb-Magyar Köztársaság (Pécs, 1991) {{ISBN|963-7272-42-9}}, p. 44, 167-168, 206-207&lt;/ref&gt; painter [[Petar Dobrović]] suggested the formation of independent republic that would include region of Baranya and northern part of Bačka around [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]]. Petar Dobrović became president of executive committee of the new Republic.

The [[lobbying]] at the peace conference in Paris under the Belgrade-appointed Yugoslav Prefect Pandurovitch, it is said to have included two great Hungarian landowners, Count Pavao [[House of Keglević|Keglević]] and Count Ivan [[House of Drašković|Drašković]], in addition to the leading Baranya jurist Tivadar Andrits, a former member of the Hungarian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporate governance]] of the Magyar Jelzálog-Hitelbank/Hungarian Mortgage-Credit Bank by Theodor Draskovich and by Emmerich Keglevich in 1900, Historijski zbornik, Band 53, Povijesno društvo Hrvatske, Društvo za hrvatsku povjesnicu, Nakladni zavod Hrvatske, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Jelzálog-Hitelbank - Budapest, Dokumentensammlung 1870, Statuten, Geschäftsordnung (1881-1935); Jahres- sowie Geschäftsberichte (1870-1937) (Finanzwesen, Bilanzen); Zirkularmitteilungen an Aktionäre und Investoren, darunter auch Emissionsprospekte (1884-1914); Zeitungsausschnitte (1899-1913).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Baranya dispute, 1918-1921: diplomacy in the vortex of ideologies, Leslie Charles Tihany, p.28, East European quarterly, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a [[miscarriage of justice]] [[Ivo Andrić]] was arrested some years before. Laszlo Pandurovitch certainly did not know this Pavao Keglević personally. Živko Petričić a far relative of this Pavao Keglević was the chief-negotiator of the Yugoslav peoples committee of the Croatian Parliament with the Government of Hungary. This Pavao Keglević (1911–2004) was one of the grandsons of the wholesaler of pork Franjo/Ferenc Keglević/Keglovich (1859 [baptized 1864]-1916) who in 1905 had emigrated from Hungary to Croatia and changed his name from Ferenc Keglovich to Franjo Keglević, and was at that time about 8 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Prva hrvatska štedionica / First croatian savings-bank, [http://www.hic.hr/dom/351/dom04.htm Tragične pouke iz povijesti Prve hrvatske štedionice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for his surmised illegitimate child see:[[Josip Broz Tito]], S Krležom iz dana u dan: Trubač u pustinji duha, Enes Čengić, [[Miroslav Krleža]], Globus, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: [[Pig War (Serbia)]], [[Sándor Wekerle]], 1848-1921, Géza Andreas von Geyr, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Der Weltkrieg, Band 3, [[Karl Helfferich]], Ullstein &amp; Co. 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; It came to an inquiry in Hungary on this Committee of Pandurovitch, because Pandurovitch was an Austro-Hungarian officer.

However, the authorities of the new republic did not manage to gain international recognition, and since the withdrawal of the Yugoslav kingdom's army, Horthy's forces entered into region and put an end to the Republic. From 21–25 August 1921, the region was reintegrated into Hungary, represented by Commissioner [[Károly Soós Bádoki]], as had been allocated at the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920.

{{confusing section|date=June 2012}}
On 12 October 1921, [[Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer|Ferenc Fischer]], the [[tutor]] of Paul Keglevich (1911–2004), became the supreme governor of [[Baranya County]]. Furthermore, the history of Paul Keglevich is very controversial and not well researched, perhaps because of the changes in 1918 in the [[Tatra (company)|Tatra company]], with which he was connected through his family, or may be because tutor Fischer had financed the so-called ''zeleni kadar'' ([[green cadres]]), which both became the reasons for the [[compulsory purchase]] of Paul Keglevich by his tutor Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic nationalism and the fall of empires: central Europe, Russia, and the Middle East, 1914-1923, Aviel Roshwald, Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics, Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avantgarde des Widerstands: Modellfälle militärischer Auflehnung im 19. und 20.

Maybe because he was poor, what was better for his protection in those times.&lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavia genocide: a documented analysis, Ante Beljo, Northern Tribune Pub. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Or because he lived in Yugoslavia near [[Legrad]], but the name of the train station in Hungary was until a few years ago also Legrad even if Legrad was not in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Denkschrift Konsul Höffinger (geheim), ADÖ 2/219, 25.April 1919, AdR, NPA, Präsidium NL/Bauer, Außenpolitische Dokumente der Republik Österreich 1918-1938: Im Schatten von Saint-Germain: 15.März 1919 bis 10.September 1919, Arnold Suppan, Klaus Koch, Walter Rauscher, Österreichisches Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Or because of the upcoming nationalistic propaganda among Germans in Hungary in 1930, or because of the upcoming [[Nazi propaganda]] against also his surname in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Judenviertel Europas: die Juden zwischen Ostsee und Schwarzen Meer, Hans Hinkel, Volk und Reich Verlag, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Österreichische Geschichte, Band 10, Roman Sandgruber, Ueberreuter Verlag, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Arisierungen," beschlagnahmte Vermögen, Rückstellungen und Entschädigungen in Oberösterreich, Daniela Ellmauer, Michael John, Regina Thumser, Historikerkommission der Republik Österreich, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see: [[Franz Anton Basch|Franz A.

== Population ==
Most of the inhabitants of the republic were ethnic Hungarians, while other ethnic groups that lived in the area included Croats, Serbs, Germans, Romanians, Slovaks and others.

*According to the Serbian census in 1919, population of Pécs consisted of 14485 south Slavs, 17,901 Hungarians, 14549 Germans&lt;ref name="Szűts" /&gt;
*According to the Hungarian census in 1920, population of Pécs consisted of  45 Serbs,  326 Croats, 40,655 Hungarians, 5034 Germans&lt;ref name="Szűts" /&gt;
This differences clearly demonstrate the Serb efforts of annexation, moreover, at the Serbian Census, they had to calculate the members of the Serbian Army into the census because there was a classified order about this.&lt;ref name="Szűts" /&gt;

== President ==
The President of the Executive Committee (14–20 August 1921), i.e. President of the Republic, was [[Petar Dobrović]] (1890–1942), an ethnic Serb.

==Gregorian Code discovery==

In 2010 the Volterra database was used by Corcoran and [[Benet Salway|Salway]] to  identify previously unknown fragments of the [[Gregorian Code]]. The "Fragmenta Londiniensia" are seventeen pieces of parchment estimated to date from AD400, the document having been cut up and re-used as book-binding material. This is the  first direct evidence yet discovered of the Gregorian Codex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/?p=3466  |title=Lost Roman legal text found |first=Roger |last=Pearse |date=27  January 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News/Podcasts/Pages/lostromanlaw.aspx |title=Lost Roman law code discovered in London |publisher=[[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2010 |format=Podcast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314192605/http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News/Podcasts/Pages/lostromanlaw.aspx |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jack2010 &gt;{{cite news |title=Cracking  the codex: Long lost Roman legal document discovered |last=Jack  |first=Malcolm |date=28 January 2010 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/cracking-the-codex-long-lost-roman-legal-document-discovered-1881769.html|quote=These  fragments are the first direct evidence of the original version of the  Gregorian Code.

{{Quotation
|Greed is a motive everyone can understand. [[Lactantius]] includes greed and avarice as a notable part of the tetrarchic maladministration practised by [[Diocletian]], [[Maximian]], [[Galerius]], and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]], and indeed the cause of the inflation the edict seeks to curb. Thus it is Diocletian's greed that gives rise to the [[Edict on Maximum Prices|Prices Edict]] itself.

{{Campaignbox Somali Civil War}}
The '''Somali Rebellion''' was the beginning of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war in Somalia]] that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1990s. The rebellion started in 1986 when [[Siad Barre]] began attacking clan-based dissident groups opposed to his rule with his special forces, the "Red Berets" (''Duub Cas''). The dissidents had been becoming more powerful for nearly a decade following his abrupt switch of allegiance from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]] and the disastrous [[Ogaden War]] of 1977–1978.

When Barre was injured in an automobile accident on May 23, 1986, rivals within Barre's own government and opposition groups became bolder and entered into open conflict. Siad Barre's flight from the capital, on January 26, 1991, marked a distinct shift in the conflict. From that date until April 1992, fighting continued up until the arrival of the UN missions to Somalia ([[UNOSOM I]] and [[UNOSOM II]]). Siad Barre's ''collective punishment''&lt;ref&gt;Clan Cleansing in Somalia: The Ruinous Legacy of 1991 - Page 80, Lidwien Kapteijns - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; refers to clan-based violent actions by former Somalia president [[Siad Barre]] against what he viewed as rival clan members during the anti-Barre Somali Rebellion. The most egregious forms of clan-based violence perpetrated by the Barre dictatorship were against the [[Isaaq]] and [[Majeerteen]] clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nafziger|first1=E|title=Economic Development, Inequality and War|date=2003|page=85|quote=... not to mention that many of Barre's acts against clans (especially Issaq and, after 1978, Majerteen) themselves were acts of...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crackdowns by the Barre administration==

===Against the Majeerateen===
In the aftermath of the [[Ogaden War|Ogaden]] debacle, a group of disgruntled army officers attempted a coup d'état against the regime in April 1978. Their leader was Colonel Mahammad Shaykh Usmaan, a member of the [[Majeerteen]] clan, which resides mostly in northeastern [[Somalia]]. The coup failed and seventeen alleged ringleaders, including Usmaan, were summarily executed. All but one of the executed were of the [[Majeerteen]] clan. One of the plotters, Lieutenant Colonel [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] escaped to Ethiopia and founded an anti-Siad Barre organization initially called the Somali Salvation Front (SSF; later the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]], SSDF).

One of Barre's earliest forms of collective punishment targeting non-combatant clans was against the Majeerteen in 1979. Between May and June 1979, his presidential Guard called the red beret killed over 2000 Majeerteen clan members. The Umar Mahmud sub-lineage of [[Majeerteen]] particularly became the victims of this violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lXJ6nHj5HIC&amp;dq|title=Somalia: a country study|last=Division|first=Library of Congress Federal Research|date=1993|publisher=The Division|isbn=9780844407753|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Although this violence was in response to the Majeerteen-based SSDF, Barre on the other hand began to target the entire clan.&lt;ref name="Bau" /&gt; Each subsequent attack by the SSDF resulted in collective punishment against the wider Majeerteen. This included sieges and blockades against Majeerteen-inhabited areas, closure of schools, closure of health-facilities, and the destruction of subsistence facilities such as water reservoirs and cattle. Each action by the Barre government, strengthened Majeerteen resolve against the Barre-led government.&lt;ref name="Bau" &gt;“My Clan Against the World”: U.S. and Coalition Forces in Somalia 1992-1994, Robert F. Baumann 2011, p 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Red Berets systematically smashed the small reservoirs in the area around [[Galkayo|Galcaio]] so as to deny water to the Umar Mahamuud [[Majeerteen]] sub-clans and their herds. In May and June 1979, more than 2,000 Umar Mahamuud, the [[Majeerteen]] sub-clan of Colonel Ahmad, died of thirst in the waterless area northeast of Galcaio, [[Garoowe]], and [[Jariban District|Jerriiban]]. In Galcaio, members of the [[Victory Pioneers]], the urban militia known for harassing civilians, raped large numbers of [[Majeerteen]] women. In addition, the clan lost an estimated 50,000 camels, 10,000 cattle, and 100,000 sheep and goats.

===Against the Isaaq===
{{Main|Isaaq genocide}}

In April 1981, a group of Isaaq businesspeople, students, former civil servants and former politicians who lived in the United Kingdom founded the [[Somali National Movement]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir-cCFqv7RAhUrCcAKHUtVA6YQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=businessmen,%20students,%20former%20civil&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland|last=Richards|first=Rebecca|date=2016-02-24|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317004660|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the aim of the various groups that merged to create the SNM was not to create an armed liberation front, but rather these groups formed as a direct response to the harsh policies enacted by the Barre regime against the Isaaq people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xAKgCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1317004655&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbtaO5rf7TAhVJBcAKHRCABX0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland|last=Richards|first=Rebecca|date=2016-02-24|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317004653|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982 the SNM transferred their headquarters to [[Dire Dawa]] in Ethiopia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IXdqkSH4S7EC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNycbqlv7RAhUiI8AKHRvGDHEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dire%20dawa&amp;f=false|title=Somalia: Issues, History, and Bibliography|last=Fitzgerald|first=Nina J.|date=2002|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781590332658|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as both Somalia and Ethiopia at the time offered safe havens of operation for resistance groups against each other. From there the SNM successfully launched a guerrilla war against the Barre regime through incursions and [[Hit and run (military)|hit and run]] operations on army positions within Isaaq territories before returning to Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The SNM continued this pattern of attacks from 1982 and throughout the 1980s, at a time the Ogaden Somalis (some of whom were recruited refugees) made up the bulk of Barre's armed forces accused of committing acts of genocide against the Isaaq people of the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ul7vAAAAMAAJ|title=The Weekly Review|date=1991|publisher=Stellascope Limited|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy letter written by Barre's son-in-law and viceroy in the north General [[Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan]] known as The Morgan Report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiumMTe2YXSAhVIBcAKHQ1hDZwQ6AEIIDAB#v=snippet&amp;q=morgan%20report&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland|last=Richards|first=Rebecca|date=2016-02-24|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317004660|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed the basis of the Barre regime's retaliation against the Isaaq following a successful SNM attack on Hargeisa and Burao. The policy letter provided “implemented and recommended measures” for a “final solution” to Somalia's “Isaaq problem”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AX3UCk_PdEwC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFlP7324XSAhWKD8AKHSvFCQAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=isaaq%20problem&amp;f=false|title=Genocides by the Oppressed: Subaltern Genocide in Theory and Practice|last=Robins|first=Nicholas A.|last2=Jones|first2=Adam|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253220777|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rebecca Richards, a systematic state violence that followed was linked to the Barre government's belief that SNM attacks were receiving assistance from the Ethiopian government. The harsh reprisals, widespread bombing and burning of villages by Barre regime followed every time there was an attack by SNM believed to be hiding in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Richards2016p98"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Richards|title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00466-0|pages=98–100 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regime violence in the north and northwest was disproportionate, affected many communities, particularly Isaaq. The number of civilian deaths in this massacre is estimated to be between 50,000-100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZybbAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=By+then,+any+surviving+urban+Isaaks+-|title=Genocide, war crimes and the West: history and complicity|last=Jones|first=Adam|date=2017-05-20|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=9781842771914|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to various sources, whilst local reports estimate the total civilian deaths to be upwards of 200,000 Isaaq civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/investigating-genocide-somaliland-20142310820367509.html|title=Investigating genocide in Somaliland|last=Reinl|first=James|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government attack included the levelling and complete destruction of the second and third largest cities in Somalia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=somalia+second+largest+city+destruction+hargeisa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio-cPnzsjRAhXBWhoKHUaMAvwQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=somalia%20second%20largest%20city%20destruction%20hargeisa&amp;f=false|title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: From Conflict to Cooperation|last=Tekle|first=Amare|date=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=9780932415974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hargeisa]] (which was 90 per cent destroyed)&lt;ref&gt;[https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/somaliland-time-for-african-union-leadership.pdf ''Somaliland: Time for African Union Leadership''.] https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/somaliland-time-for-african-union-leadership.pdf: International Crisis Group. 2006. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Burao]] (70 per cent destroyed) respectively through a campaign of aerial bombardment, and had caused 400,000 Somalis&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOMALIA/Resources/conflictinsomalia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (primarily of the Isaaq clan) to flee their land and cross the border to Hartasheikh in Ethiopia as refugees, creating the world's largest refugee camp then (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WV0TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=isaaq+400,000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iwV5IJSLjb&amp;sig=qwS_Q38mseLNz_0ruvyv-4dgrjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi105zco9bRAhVE7hoKHavtDysQ6AEIIzAC#v=snippet&amp;q=400,000&amp;f=false|title=The Early Morning Phonecall: Somali Refugees' Remittances|last=Lindley|first=Anna|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782383284|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with another 400,000 being internally displaced.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

A [[United Nations]] investigation concluded that the Barre regime's killing of Isaaq civilians was a genocide, and that the crime of genocide was "conceived, planned and perpetrated by the Somali government against the Isaaq people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7w8VAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22+against+the+Isaaq+people.+and+was+not%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Based+on+the+totality+of+evidence+collected+in+Somaliland%22|title=Past human rights abuses in Somalia: report of a preliminary study conducted for the United Nations (OHCHR/UNDP-Somalia)|last=Mburu|first=Chris|last2=Rights|first2=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human|last3=Office|first3=United Nations Development Programme Somalia Country|date=2002-01-01|publisher=s.n.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the Hawiye===
The [[Hawiye]] moved quickly to occupy the south portion of Somalia. The capital of Mogadishu is located in the country of the [[Abgaal]] subclan of Hawiye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIubitkpjUAhVHCMAKHegZD4oQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mogadishu%20was%20identified%20as%20an%20Abgal%20city%20even%20before%20the%20colonial%20era%20%22&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|last=Mukhtar|first=Mohamed Haji|date=2003-02-25|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810866041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the independence era, the Hawiye tribe had occupied important administrative positions in the bureaucracy and in the top army command. However, in the late 1980s disaffection with the regime set in among the Hawiye, who felt increasingly marginalized by the Siad Barre regime.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Taisier M. Ali states that Barre assuaged the Majeerteen, and targeted other groups like the [[Hawiye]]. According to Ali, "with funds and clan appeals, he [Barre] was able to entice the bulk of SSDF fighters to return from Ethiopia and participate in his genocidal wars against the Isaaq in the north and later against the Hawiye in the South, including Mogadisho".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcu-hmpVLUYC&amp;pg=PA175 |title=Civil Wars in Africa: Roots and Resolution|last=Ali|first=Taisier M.|date=1999|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773518834|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mohamed Haji Ingiriis, the vicious atrocities during the reign of Barre were not an isolated event nor unusual in Somalia's history. Barre also targeted the Hawiye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed Haji Ingiriis|title=The Suicidal State in Somalia: The Rise and Fall of the Siad Barre Regime, 1969–1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vzi6CwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-6720-3|pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with saboteurs by day and sniper fire by night, Siad Barre ordered remaining units of the badly demoralized [[Red Berets]] to kill civilians on a large scale. By 1989 torture and killing became the order of the day in Mogadishu.

The Red Berets killed 450 Muslims demonstrating against the arrest of their spiritual leaders. More than 2,000 were seriously injured. The next day, forty-seven people, mainly from the Isaaq clan, were taken to Jasiira Beach west of the city and summarily executed. The July mass killings prompted a shift in United States policy as the United States began to distance itself from Siad Barre.

With the loss of United States support, the regime grew more desperate. An anti-Siad Barre demonstration on July 6, 1990, at a soccer match in the main stadium deteriorated into a riot, causing Siad Barre's bodyguard to panic and open fire on the demonstrators. At least sixty-five people were killed. A week later, while the city reeled from the impact of what came to be called the Stadia Corna Affair, Siad Barre sentenced to death 46 prominent members of the Manifesto Group, a body of 114 notables who had signed a petition in May calling for elections and improved human rights. During the [[show trial]] that resulted in the death sentences, demonstrators surrounded the court and activity in the city came to a virtual halt. On July 13, a shaken Siad Barre dropped the charges against the accused. As the city celebrated victory, Siad Barre, conceding defeat for the first time in twenty years, retreated into his bunker at the military barracks near the airport.

The most shocking and gruesome revenge Siad Barre took against the [[Hawiye]], in particular the Hawadle (Xawadle) sub-clan was the massacre he ordered in January 1991, just before he escaped Mogadishu for his clan strongholds in the deep south of Somalia. It is estimated that over 6,000 individuals died in the massacre of Beledweyne, including women and children. This was a major turning point for the USC and further fueled the need to overthrow Siad Barre's regime - eventually proving successful as he was overthrown in late January. This incident in [[Beledweyne]] was the major cause for clan tensions as Siad Barre's militias mainly consisted of [[Marehan]], [[Ogaden]] and [[Majeerteen]] militias, led by General Morgan ([[Majeerteen]]) - who had caused many civilian deaths towards Isaaq's (SNM) by sending bombers to attack the northern cities, including [[Hargeisa]] ([[Somalia]]'s second largest city).

In response to mutinies by Hawiye soldiers in October 1989, Barre's presidential guard called the Red Berets, began attacking [[Hawiye]] civilians. According to history professor Robert f. Baumann, this shift of antagonism towards to Hawiye was a major military blunder since Barre's stronghold happened to be in Mogadishu, whose environs are majority Hawiye. These actions by Barre sealed his fate, as by 1990 the predominantly Hawiye USC (United Somali Congress) military group had beset the capital of Mogadishu.&lt;ref name="Bau" /&gt;

===Against Ogaden===
The bulk of Darood refugees who fled the Ethiopia-Somalia war were Ogaden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayall|first1=James|title=The New Interventionism, 1991-1994|date=1996|page=104|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1bi9FNk0ZsC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz2OWssqrbAhVHBMAKHdWEC8UQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barre's hostility towards the Ogaden was in part derived from the huge influx of their clan members in the aftermath of war with Ethiopia, which resulted in a swelling of their numbers. This surge in their population resulted in what he viewed as an undue influence, with a change in the balance of power away from his own [[Marehan]] clan towards the Ogaden clan. This resulted in Barre dismissing several military officers who were of Ogaden lineage. The friction escalated when Barre purged the minister of defense, Aden Gabiyo from office, who was of Ogaden lineage. In May 1989, this culminated into a revolt by Ogaden soldiers stationed in Kismaayo, the formation of an anti-Barre military faction formed of Ogaden clansmen called SPM (Somali Patriotic Movement) and the defection of Ogaden colonel Omar Jess.&lt;ref name="Bau" /&gt;

==Somaliland and Puntland==
In 1991, the [[Somali National Movement]] declared the northwestern portion of the country independent. Although internationally [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised]] as an [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous region]] of Somalia, [[Somaliland]], as with neighboring [[Puntland]], has remained relatively peaceful.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Signs Say Somaliland, but the World Says Somalia |work=New York Times |date=2006-06-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/world/africa/05somaliland.html|accessdate=2010-02-02 |first=Marc |last=Lacey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sorginak''' ([[Root (linguistics)|root form]]: ''sorgin'', [[Absolutive case|absolutive case (singular)]]: ''sorgina'') are the assistants of the goddess [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]] in [[Basque mythology]]. It is also the Basque name for witches or pagan priestesses (though they could also be male), it being difficult to distinguish between the mythological and real ones. 

Sometimes ''sorginak'' are confused with [[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamia]]k (similar to [[nymphs]]). Along with them, and specially with [[Jentilak]], ''sorginak'' are said often to have built the local [[megalith]]s.

''Sorginak'', like other European witches, used to participate in the [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|sabbat]], called [[Akelarre (witchcraft)|akelarre]] locally. These [[Western esotericism|mysteries]] happened on Friday nights, when Mari and [[Sugaar]] are said to meet in the locally sacred cave to engender storms. 

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name is disputed. The common suffix ''-gin'' (''actor'', from ''egin'': ''to do'') is the only agreement.
*One theory claims that ''sor'' derives from ''sorte'' (''fortune''), and hence it would be rendered as fortune-teller.
*The other states that ''sor'' is the radical of ''sor(tu)'' (''to create''), and hence sorgin means literally: ''creator''.

== Most common references to sorginak ==
''Sorginak'' are often said to recite the following spell to travel to and back from the ''akelarre'': ''Under the clouds and over the brambles'', or variants of it. In many legends a failed witch (normally a man) says the spell inverted (''Under the brambles and over the clouds'') and arrives to the akelarre quite bruised.

''Sorginak'' also chant the following:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
:''Ez geala, ba geala,''
:''Hamalau mila hemen geala''
{{col-break}}
''We aren't, we are indeed,''&lt;br&gt;
''Fourteen thousand here we are''
{{col-end}}
Other variants of this song are also known.

''Sorginak'' often are said to transform themselves into animals, most commonly cats. These cats are sometimes said to bother pious women that do not wish to go the akelarre. It has also been recorded that they collected monetary fines from the people that did not wish to go to their ecstatic gatherings or those witches that absented themselves from them. 

Inquisitorial documents describe horrific practices of witches, like eating children or poisonings. But popular legends do not speak of these practices, instead mentioning kissing "the devil's arse" or an animal's genitals, occasional poisoning of crops, bothering modest women (in the shape of cats or other animals) and anointing their bodies with [[flying ointment]] (containing [[entheogenic]], [[Solanaceous]] plants) to "fly" to and from the akelarre and perform other supposed feats.

== Major persecutions against Basque witches ==
{{main|Basque witch trials}}

While in the late Middle Ages there are a handful of references to witchery, they are mostly fines for accusing someone of being one. 

This changes in the 16th and 17th centuries with the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and the pan-European witch panic that plagued the Early [[Modern Age]]. Since being conquered by Castile in 1512–21, Navarre (and to a lesser extent areas of the Basque Country) suffered numerous inquisitorial processes, mainly against Jews and Muslims, but occasionally also against Basque ''sorginak''. Particularly important was the 1610 process of Logroño that focused on the akelarre of [[Zugarramurdi]]. The previous year, in 1609, French judge [[Pierre de Lancre]] had initiated a massive process in Labourd, focusing mainly on Basque women and priests. He was eventually displaced but not without causing many deaths and much suffering. The witch panic extended beyond the frontier and accusations of witchcraft proliferated among the local population until the Spanish Inquisition intervened. The Logroño process ended with 12 women burnt at the stake (five of them symbolically, as they had died under the tortures inflicted in the process) and shattered Pyrennean Navarre and led also to a serious reconsideration of the Inquisition's attitude towards accusations of witchcraft. The Spanish and Italian Inquisition generally approached accusations of sorcery and witchcraft with skepticism and similar processes were rare in comparison to other European countries where no such centralised institution existed.

== Places associated with sorginak ==
Throughout the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] there are many places associated with sorginak, often also associated with Mari or other mythological characters. This is an incomplete list of the most famous ones:

===Álava===
*[[Aramaio]]: the places of Abadelaueta, Anbotondo and Amezola, as well as an undetermined field at the [[Gorbea]] mountain are said to have been places of ''akelarres''.
*[[Maeztu]]: a woman from this village, Margarita Jauri, was one of the "witches" tried by the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the case of the [[Zugarramurdi]] covenant. Though finally acquitted, she was so traumatised by the detention and torture that she committed suicide soon after her release.
*[[Peñacerrada-Urizaharra|Urizaharra]]: the field of Urkiza or Urkizo seems to have been the site of the local ''akelarre''.

===Biscay===
*[[Anboto]] peak is the well established principal home of [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]], also known as ''Anbotoko Sorgina'' (Witch of Anboto) and ''Anbotoko Damie'' (Lady of Anboto). Her home was said to be specifically in an unreachable cave known as Sorginkoba (witch's cave).
*[[Dima, Spain|Dima]]: the farmhouse of Petralanda was the main site of the ''akelarre'' of [[Arratia]] Valley in the 16th century, according to inquisitional records.
*[[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] was the center of a medieval [[Beguine]] heresy that ended with 13 people burnt at the stake. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries other inquisitional trials were held in this town.
*[[Mañaria]]: the cave of Azkondo was the witches' meeting place, according to local legend. [[José Miguel Barandiaran]] also mentions that the cliffs between the field of Akelarre and the cave of Silibranka (a paleolithic site) were the playfield of demons.
*[[Murueta]]: the place of Etxebartxuko-landa, according to local legend.
*[[Muxika]]: several places attributed as akelarre-sites are called generically ''eperlanda'' (partridges' field). 
*[[Orozko]]: local legend points to Garaigorta mountain as site of the local ''akelarre'' Also the cave of Supelegor, in the karstic area of [[Itxina]], is associated with witches and especially ''lamiak'', and it is even considered one of the mansions of Mari herself. 
*[[Zeberio]]: the local witches went to the akelarre of Petralanda (in Dima) but also met locally at Hereinoza household. 

===Gipuzkoa===
*[[Andoain]]: an old bridge is said to have been built by witches.
*[[Ataun]]: the sites of Txabaltxo (near a creek), Iraubeltz (a wood), Mendabiita (a bridge), Zelaun (a plain), a creek near the Artzate farmhouse, the spring of Negarregi and the place of Dantzaleku are all said to have frequented by ''sorginak''. Additionally several local sites bear their name: Sorginiturri (witches' spring), Sorginpelota (witches' ball game), Sorginzulo and Sorgizuloeta (witches' niche and niches respectively).
*[[Azkoitia]]: the farmhouse of Kimutxo.
*[[Bergara]]: Itxu mountain was the local site of ''akelarres''.
*[[Errenteria]]: a woman from this village (now an industrial town), María Zozoaia, was one of the main accused in the process of Zugarramurdi. According to inquisitional records, they gathered in the field of Matxarena, that they called ''Atsegin Soro'' (pleasure orchard).
*[[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]]: the cave of Sorgintxulo, as recorded by Barandiaran.
*[[Hondarribia]]: a local (but none-the-less brutal) series of inquistorial trials in 1530 ''discovered'' that witches met at Jaizkibel mountain, near the hermitage of St. Barbara. Other sites that the accused declared to be their meeting places were: near the hermitage of St. Philip and St. James, or near the hermitage and castle of St. Telmo. Local popular legend instead says that the ''akelarres'' happened near one of the local bridges: either Mendelo, Puntal or Santa Engracia, during the feast of St. Agatha.
*[[Lezo, Spain|Lezo]]: Inquisitor Ugarte was supposedly poisoned by the local witches in this village in 1531. 
*[[Lizartza]]: near a fence at Aini mountain.
*[[Mendaro]]: the house of Silerokua or Silerene once was inhabited by a witch that, typically, transformed herself as cat to bother more chaste women, legend says.
*[[Oiartzun]]: witches met near the cliffs of Irantzi and Puilegi, according to legend. 
*[[Oñati]]: the cave of Gaiztozulo (evil hole) is said to be one of the main homes of Mari and her court of ''sorginak''.
*[[Pasaia]]: local woman Mari Zuloko was imprisoned in St. Sebastian, accused of witchery. Later she was stoned and expelled from her hometown, settling in [[Donibane-Lohitzune]].
*[[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]]: it is said that witches used to wash clothes near Ugartebide. They also met in Edar Iturri and Sorginerreka. 
*[[Zegama]] here goddess Mari, also often considered a witch, is known as Aketigiko Sorgina (witch of Aketegi mountain). It is also believed that she lives in Sorginzulo cave.

===Labourd===
Lapurdi was particularly shaken by the large-scale trials of 1609 led by [[Pierre de Lancre]], who was convinced that most people in the country were witches. 
*[[Arcangues]]: the people of this village had the fame of all being witches.
*[[Ascain]]: in the 1609 trials, the priest of this village was burnt at the stake as a witch.
*[[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]: Alakoandia field and the bridges that are between this village and Ciboure.
*[[Hendaye]]: the local beach was the favorite site for the ''akelarre'', specifically in a site then known as Lakua (the lake). In the 1609 trials it was declared by one of the accused that there was as many people in the local akelarre ''as stars are in the sky''.
*[[Lahonce]]: the apparently many witches of this village met in Sohouta (Soule).
*[[Sare]]: several legends place witches as living in the houses of Egoainea, Ihartzegaraia and Larraburua. The local akelarre was sometimes celebrated at the Fikozelai field. Many local witches were tried in 1609, including several minors and the lady of Txantokorena household. 
*[[Saint-Pée-sur-Nivelle]]: Pierre de Lancre lived here during the witch-hunt of 1609, in the castle of Amou, whose lord had asked for the trials to be initiated. According to the judicial records, the local akelarre took place either in the cemetery, in private houses or even in the castle of Amou itself, while the trial was active. What this means, if the record is true, is that it was done in the sight of de Lancre himself, which is very unlikely. Other unlikely akelarre-sites mentioned in the process are the hotel Barbarenena, on the very night when de Lancre was sleeping there, and in the home of ''maistre'' Segura, de Lancre's criminal advisor. Many local presumed witches were accused of plotting to kill de Lancre. 
*[[Urrugne]]: two local witches were executed by de Lancre here. Others managed to flee to Lower Navarre.
*[[Ustaritz]]: in 1576 Marie Txorropike of the Ianetabarta household was burnt at the stake. Forty other supposed witches were also executed. Several people, including minors, were also processed here in 1609. The akelarre was celebrated at a site called Pagola.
*[[Ciboure]]: a large number of people from this town were processed in 1609, including five priests.

===Navarre===
Large portions of Navarre were severely affected by an inquisitorial process in 1610, focused in the akelarre of Zurgarramurdi.
*[[Abaurregaina]]: there's a local [[natural bridge]] named Sorginzubi (witches' bridge).
*[[Altsasu]]: local legend states that Mari lives in the cave of Odabe, having by main servant a ''sorgina''.
*[[Araitz]]: the local witches met at Urrizola slope before ''flying'' to the ''akelarre''.
*[[Arantza]]: the cliff of Arrutxipi is said to have been the living place of ''sorginak'' in the past.
*[[Areso]]: the cave of Uli, at Ulizar mountain, was the favorite site for the ''akelarre''.
*[[Burguete – Auritz|Auritz]]: the sites of Basajaunberro (probably modern Patxaranberro), near Ortzanzurieta mountain and Sorginarizaga, near [[Roncesvalles]]. Two witch-hunts affected this municipality: in 1525–27 and in 1575.
*[[Bargota]]: Local priest Juanis de Bargota was also a famous witch. He had special relationship with a female witch of Biana, Endregoto (Lady Goto in [[Basque language|Basque]]). Both were processed by the Inquisition in 1610 but, while Endregoto was burned at the stake, Juanis de Bargota avoided punishment by showing extreme repentance. 
*[[Baztan (municipality)|Baztan]]: Abbot Aranibar of Urdazubi made many people confess guilty of witchery by means of torture in 1610, including many children. In 1612 a civil process was initiated against 7 local women. The tortures inflicted in the towers of Jauregizar and Jauregizuri were so brutal that the accused women claimed insistently to be moved to [[Logroño]], to be judged by the Inquisition itself, as a lesser evil. It seems that the site of Dutxuketa (in Elbetea) might have been a meeting place for the witches. There is also a dolmen called Sorginetxe (witch's home).
*[[Bera, Navarre|Bera]]: the local witches met apparently on [[La Rhune|Larrun]] mountain, along with their colleagues of Sara and Azkaine.
*[[Bertizarana]]: according to the inquisitorial records, witches met at Nabarte village. In 1611, also impelled by Abbot Aranibar, there was a witch-hunt in Legasa. Graciana de Maribertizena and her daughter were tortured brutally and ''confessed'' to all asked.
*[[Viana, Spain|Biana]]: a hill near the Las Cañas lagoon was apparently the site of the local akelarres, to which people came also from [[Logroño]]. Biana was also the hometown of Endregoto, the partner of famous male witch Juanis de Bargota, burnt at the stake in 1610.
*[[Burgi, Navarre|Burgi]]: according to an inquisitorial process of 1569, witches met in Larraionoa and Los Linares, as well as on a barrage at the river.
*[[Ergoiena]]: Arleze cave is said to have been used by witches. Putxerri cave (also Putterri or Bueitarri), in the [[Aralar Range|Aralar]] range is said to be inhabited by genii that show themselves as animals, now red, now black, now white; another legend says it is a mansion of Mari and her sorginak, called in the area ''Putxerriko Damea'' (Lady of Putxerri).
*[[Esparza (Spain)|Esparza]]: Inquisitor Avellaneda tells how he tried to dismiss the incipient belief in witchery contacted local witches here and was initiated by anointing their ''magic oil'' on all them. He then believed to have seen his partners to have done unbelievable feats. After that experience he retook his inquisitorial duties with even greater dedication. The processes that shattered the [[Salazar Valley|Salazar]] valley in 1532 and 1539 record a place called ''Soto de Tarragona'', impossible to locate, as site of the local ''akelarre''. Sometimes the hermit of St. Tirso has been named as place of sabbats as well. 
*[[Etxalar]] was also affected by the 1610 process. In the process, the field of Aranduriaretxa (also Urristilde or Sarueta) and the site of Larbure, were named as ''akelarre'' locations.
*[[Garaioa]]: in 1525, local Martin Lizuain was burnt at the stake in Auritz. In 1577, accused by a 5-year-old boy, seven women were processed and acquitted. Two of them died during the tortures. 
*[[Hiriberri/Villanueva de Aezkoa|Hiriberri]]: the mountain of Petxuberro (also Petiriberro) is said to have been the site of the akelarre of the [[Aezkoa]] Valley. 
*[[Izaba]]: a possible ''akelarre'' is said to have taken place in Berin-pikua. 
*[[Ituren]]: the local ''akelarre'' apparently used to take place on the heights of Mendaur mountain, near the summit. The processes of 1525 and 1610 affected this village.
*[[Itza]]: the peak of Oskia or Arkaitz is said to be meeting place for witches here. 
*[[Larraun]]: in Alli cave a nearby, where the dolmen of Akelar is located. Also in the field of Urrizolaegia. 
*[[Lerga]]: the site of Campoluengo.
*[[Lesaka]]: in the process of 1610 was said that the local ''akelarre'' took place in the field of Kolunba.
*[[Miranda de Arga]]: field of Baiona.
*[[Otxagabia]]: legend says that [[Joan I of Navarre]] was killed by the [[black magic]] of the [[Bishop of Troyes]] (who was effectively accused of witchery in 1308–13); since then this queen's ghost dwells in the [[Irati forest]], seeking revenge. The local akelarre apparently took place in the main plaza of the village, though sometimes took place in Aboddibidea, deep in the mountains.
*[[Pamplona]]: the capital of Navarre was affected by the trial of 1527.
*[[Piedramillera]]: near Dos Hermanas twin peaks. 
*[[Roncal – Erronkari|Erronkari]]: Bedagin-pikoa was the site of the local akelarre. The valley was affected by the persecution of 1532.
*[[Ultzama]]: the mountains of Aldaun, Xuxurro, Urbilaga and Elizamendia have been said to be sabbatic sites.
*[[Urdazubi]]: In the 1609 witch-hunt of Labourd, several accused declared to have celebrated the sabbat inside the church of this village. According to Barandiaran, all neighbours of Alkerdi, where there is an important Paleolithic cave-site, as considered to be witches. 
*[[Ziordi]]: Bekatu-Larre (field of sins) was apparently the site of local akelarres. This village was affected by inquisitorial processes in 1575–76 and 1610.
*[[Zugarramurdi]]: Akelarrenlezea (cave of the akelarre) is just 500 meters away from the village. Actually witches met in the field of Berroskoberro outside the caves. This village was the focus of the largest and more infamous inquisitorial process, that took place in 1610 in Logroño. Seven people were burnt at the stake and other five were burnt symbolically, along with their remains (they had died during the process). A local legend says that all women of Azkar are witches. Modernly the caves of Akelarrenlezea are used for a summer solstice festival, memorial of what witchery once may have been.

===Lower Navarre===
*[[Bidarray]]: Ebrain bridge, known also as ''Infenuko zubia'' (Hell's bridge) is said to have been built by ''[[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamia]]k'' or ''sorginak'' in a single night. 
*[[Saint-Michel, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Michel]]: the people of this village have been traditionally considered witches as a whole. In other time they were nicknamed ''akelartarrak'' (''akelarreans'').
*[[Iholdy]]: the local witches apparently washed clothes at Oxarti creek.

===Soule===
*[[Alçay-Alçabéhéty-Sunharette]]: Arlegiko Kutxia (Arlegi's cross) is a place that was said that witches made appearances. Another site of ''akelarres'' is  Artegaina. Near this place there's a cave named ''Ertzagainako karbia'', where legend says a dragon once dwelt.
*[[Chéraute]]: the witches of this village and that of Lahuntza met a some field near [[Mauléon-Licharre|Mauléon]].

'''Stesimbrotos of Thasos''' ({{lang-grc|Στησίμβροτος}}; c. 470 BC – c. 420 BC), doubtless raised at [[Thasos]], was a [[sophist]], a [[rhapsode]] and [[Logographer (history)|logographer]], a writer on history, and an opponent of [[Pericles]] and reputed author of a political pamphlet ''On [[Themistocles]], [[Thucydides]], and [[Pericles]]''. [[Plutarch]] used writings by Stesimbrotos in his ''Life of Pericles'', asserting that the coolness between Pericles and his son Xanthippos was due to Pericles seducing his daughter-in-law. [[Walter Burkert]] has suggested Stesimbrotos as the author of the ''[[Derveni papyrus]]'' (Burkert 1987:44, 58 n.6).

'''''Strip Search''''' is a drama film made for the [[HBO]] network, first aired on April 27, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/arts/television-review-when-the-nation-is-at-risk-did-you-say-civil-rights.html|title=TELEVISION REVIEW; When the Nation Is at Risk, Did You Say Civil Rights?|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|date=April 27, 2004|website=The New York Times|language=en-US|access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/hbo-london-adds-lumet-martel-pix-1117886372/|title=HBO London adds Lumet, Martel pix|last=Gaydos|first=Steven|date=May 16, 2003|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film explores the status of [[civil liberties|individual liberties]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the approval of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. The film was directed by [[Sidney Lumet]] and written by ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'' creator [[Tom Fontana]]. It stars [[Glenn Close]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Ken Leung]], Bruno Lastra and [[Dean Winters]]. The film was first screened at the [[Monaco Film Premiere]] with Lumet in person presenting it, in the presence of Fontana.

==Plot==
The film is built around two main parallel stories, each containing almost identical dialogues. One story line involves Linda Sykes (Gyllenhaal), an [[United States|American]] woman detained in the [[People's Republic of China]], being interrogated by a military officer (Leung). In the other storyline, Sharif Bin Said (Lastra), an [[Arab]] man detained in [[New York City]], is interrogated by two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents (Winters and Close). Both characters are graduate students detained with no hard evidence and interrogated about unspecified activities which may or may not be related to [[terrorist]] plots.

In the course of the increasingly brutal interrogations, both Sykes and Bin Said are [[strip search]]ed against their will by their interrogators and are subjected to a [[cavity search]]. In both cases the protagonists appear to have only tenuous connections with the suspected terrorist plots.

The film ends with the question: "Must security and safety come at the price of freedom?"

'''Sumit Sarkar''' (born 1939) is an Indian historian of modern [[India]]. He is the author of ''Swadeshi Movement''.

==Education and career==
He studied at [[Presidency College, Calcutta]] and at the [[University of Calcutta]]. He taught for many years as a lecturer at the University of Calcutta, and later as a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] at the [[University of Burdwan]]. He was Professor of History at the [[University of Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upscportal.com/store/author/sumit-sarkar]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the founding members of the [[Subaltern Studies|Subaltern Studies Collective]], but later distanced himself from the project. He noted that arguments made by the later issues of the journal as well as books by [[Partha Chatterjee (scholar)|Partha Chatterjee]] in that they blanketly criticized the Enlightenment, the nation-state and secularism lined up with indigenist critiques that were at home with the Hindu right. In his view this error was traceable to a basic confusion in the early project that posed an absolute separation between the elite and subaltern domains.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sarkar, "The Decline of the Subaltern in Subaltern Studies," in Writing Social History pp. 82-108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
He was awarded the [[Rabindra Puraskar]] literary award for his book Writing Social History by the [[West Bengal]] government in 2004. He returned the award in 2007 in protest against [[Nandigram violence|the expulsion of farmers]] from their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Nandigram was more shocking than Jallianwala Bagh' |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1774467.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=2007-03-17 |accessdate=2008-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
He contributed a volume to the ''Towards Freedom'' project of the [[Indian Council of Historical Research]] (ICHR), publication of which was blocked in 2000 by the ICHR under the influence of then Indian government administered by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] as alleged by Sarkar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Righting or rewriting Hindu history |url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/BB23Df01.html |work=[[Asia Times]] |date=2000-02-23 |accessdate=2008-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the volume was eventually allowed by the Government of India once the Congress party came to power after the general election of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Towards Freedom' project revived |url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/09/21/stories/2004092115021100.htm |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2008-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Old Timers''''' is a rare, privately printed book published in 1957 by the school teacher, map-maker, publisher and author [[J. L. Carr]] during his second visit to teach at a public school in [[Huron, South Dakota]], United States.

At the age of 25 years, after training as a teacher, J. L. Carr applied to the [[English-Speaking Union]] for a year's exchange as a teacher and arrived in Huron, South Dakota on 1 October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Byron (2003). ''The Last Englishman.  The life of J.L. Carr.'' London: Aurum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his experiences in Huron were incorporated into the novel ''[[The Battle of Pollocks Crossing]]''.

After military service during the war in the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[West Africa]] and in military intelligence in England, Carr returned to teaching.  In 1951 he was appointed as the first headmaster of Highfields primary school in [[Kettering]], [[Northamptonshire]]. He took a [[sabbatical]] in 1956 to return to Huron with his wife Sally and son Robert, to spend another year at Huron Public School.&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;Carr, J. L. (1991) ''The Passport Interview''. Huntingdon, Cambridge: Passport magazine, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Carr wrote and illustrated a book of reminiscences of some of the first settlers in [[Beadle County, South Dakota]] which he entitled: ''The Old Timers.  A social history of the way of life of the home-steading pioneers in the [[prairie]] states during the first few years of settlement, as shown by a typical community, the 'old-timers' of Beadle County in South Dakota''.&lt;ref name=Carr2&gt;Carr, J. L. (1957). ''The Old Timers''.  Huron, South Dakota: mimeographed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of reminiscences of the men and women who established settlements on the land around Huron in South Dakota from the 1880s onwards, or descriptions of those pioneers given by people who knew them. Carr recorded in an interview in 1991 how he found the notes left by speakers at a defunct historical society that he had attended during his first visit in 1938.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt;  The notes and verbatim records of the County Historical Society meetings had been kept by Sherman Davis, Dr Ketelle and Mrs J. P. Walsh and these formed the basis of Carr's book.&lt;ref name=Carr2/&gt;

''The Old Timers'' describes with small line drawings by Carr how people lived: how they built houses, wells and cyclone shelters; the domestic implements they used such as table lamps, coffee grinders and hand irons; the weather and terrible winters they endured; the children and how they were taught, played and dressed; and the machinery used on the farm such as ploughs and a [[stone-boat]] for hauling large rocks.  Carr wanted to record the lives of the [[Homestead Acts|homesteading]] pioneers of the prairie before it was all forgotten.

The credit for the book states: "Written in Huron, State of South Dakota, by J.L. Carr of Kettering, the United Kingdom, as a service to the people of the prairie states".

The copyright pages states: "Copyright James Carr, 1957, All Rights reserved".  This could be regarded as Carr's first book as his first novel, ''[[A Day in Summer]]'', was not published until 1963.

''The Old Timers'' was printed on thin, acidic [[Letter (paper size)|letter-size]] paper (279 x 216&amp;nbsp;mm) using a [[Cyclostyle (copier)|Cyclostyle copier]] with both typed and hand-written text and 180 hand-drawn illustrations and decorations of things in common use such as equipment, buildings, vehicles, plants and flowers.

The ex-library copy described here is bound in light brown cloth (282 x 222&amp;nbsp;mm) and is collated as follows.

Free endpaper; title page; copyright page; contents and acknowledgements page; an introduction, signed by Carr in the page dated May 29, 1957; a decorated ownership page; a map of Huron and vicinity; pages 1 – 2 numbered; pages 3 – 6 un-numbered; page 7; page 8 un-numbered; pages 9 – 13 numbered; page 14 un-numbered; pages 15 – 53; page 54 missing; pages 55 – 57; page 58 un-numbered; pages 59 – 60; pages 61 – 63 un-numbered; pages 63 (mis-numbered) - 65, which is dated May 20, 1957; 2 pages of index (prepared by Wilma K Bliss of Huron); a one-page list of illustrations; 1 page endpiece; and two free end papers.

Carr reported that he printed 82 copies and paid $18 to have them bound. He gave 40 copies to people who had lent furniture to his family during their stay in Huron and sold the remainder at $2 each to university departments and public libraries.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt;

According to the [http://www.sdln.net/ South Dakota Libraries Network] copies can be found in the library of [[South Dakota State University]]; [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]]; [[Northwestern State University]]; South Dakota State Library; [[Rapid City Public Library]]; Brookings Public Library; and the Siouxland Public Library.  There is also a copy in the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]], [[New York City]].  There is no copy listed in [[Copac]], the catalogue of UK copyright and university libraries.

Carr was obviously proud of his work because it is listed as one of his publications in the first editions of his novels ''[[A Season in Sinji]]'', ''[[The Harpole Report]]'', ''[[How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup]]'' (as ''The Dakota Old-Timers'') and in all his novels published by [[The Quince Tree Press]], his own publishing house, where it is dated 1956 and listed as ''The Old Timers of Beadle County'' or similar.

"Why did I write it?" Carr wrote in his introduction to the book: "Because it needed to be written; because the tremendous qualities of these pioneering men and women needed to be shown to our generation; because, to a historian, this prairie country is virgin soil ready for the plough; because it has been great fun talking to many, many people, and very exciting to unearth things worn by the use of a past generation; because it gave me a reason to traipse around the prairie and to admire the great sweep of land and the sky".

=== 1843-1923: From electromechanics to electronics ===

[[File:Phonograph Meyers.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Thomas Edison]]'s [[phonograph]]]]
* 1843: Watchmaker [[Alexander Bain (inventor)]] develops the basic concept of displaying images as points with different [[brightness]] values.
* 1848: [[Frederick Collier Bakewell]] invents the first [[wirephoto]] machine, an early fax machine
* 1861: Grade school teacher [[Philipp Reis]] presents his [[Reis telephone|telephone]] in Frankfurt, inventing the [[loudspeaker]] as a by-product.
* 1867: French poet and philosopher [[Charles Cros]] (1842 - 1888) presents the construction principle of a [[phonograph]] in his 'paréophone', which turned out not to be a commercial success at the time.
* 1867: [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831 - 1879) develops a theory predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves and establishes [[Maxwell's equations]] to describe their properties. Together with the [[Lorentz force]] law, these equations form the foundation for classical electrodynamics and classical optics as well as electric circuits.
* 1874: [[Ferdinand Braun]] discovers the [[rectifier]] effect in [[metal sulfide]]s and [[metal oxide]]s.
* 1877: [[Thomas Edison]] (1847 - 1931) invents the first [[phonograph]], using a tin foil cylinder. For the first time sounds could be recorded and played. A [[horn loudspeaker|phonograph horn]] with membrane and needle was arranged in such a way that the needle had contact to the tinfoil.
* 1880: the American physicist [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] discovers that many disadvantages of Edison's cylinders can be eliminated if the [[soundtrack]] is arranged in spiral form and engraved in a flat, round disk. Technical problems soon ended these experiments. Still, Tainter is regarded as the inventor of the [[gramophone record]].
* 1884: [[Paul Nipkow]] obtains a patent for his [[Nipkow disk]], an image scanning device that reads images serially, which constitutes the foundation for [[mechanical television]]. Two years later his patent runs out.
* 1886: [[Heinrich Hertz]] succeeds in proving the existence of electromagnetic waves for the first time - now the groundwork for [[wireless telegraphy]] and [[radio broadcasting]] in physical science is laid.
* 1887: Unaware of [[Charles Sumner Tainter]]'s experiments, German-American [[Emil Berliner]] has his phonograph patented. He used a disk instead of a cylinder, primarily to avoid infringing on Edison's patent. Quickly it becomes obvious that flat [[Gramophone record]]s are easier to duplicate and store. 
* 1888:
** [[Alexander Graham Bell]] (1847 - 1922) significantly reduces [[interfering noise]]s by using a wax cylinder instead of tin foil. This paves the way to commercial success for the improved phonograph.
** American [[Oberlin Smith]] describes a process to record audio using a cotton thread with integrated fine wire clippings. This makes [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]] possible.
* 1890:
** The phonograph becomes faster and more convenient due to an [[electric motor]]. The electric motor brings on the first [[juke box]] with cylinders - even before flat disk records were widely available.
** Thomas Edison discovers [[thermionic emission]]. To this day, this effect forms the basis for the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[cathode ray tube]].
* approximately 1893: The invention of the selenium [[phototube]] allows the conversion of brightness values into electrical signals. The principle is applied in [[wirephoto]] and [[television]] technology for a short time. [[Selenium]] is used in [[light meter]]s for the next 50 years.
[[File:Musée français de la photographie de Bièvres 2011 29.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cinematograph|Cinématographe]] camera by the Lumière brothers in 1895 (ref 86.5822) at the French Museum of Photography in Bièvres, Essonne, France]]
* 1895: [[Auguste Lumiere]]'s [[cinematograph]] displays moving images for the first time. In the same year, brothers [[Max Skladanowsky|Emil and Max Skladanowsky]] present their "Bioscop" in Berlin.
* 1897
** Ferdinand Braun invents the "inertialess cathode ray [[oscillograph]] tube", a principle which remained unchanged in television picture tubes.
** The Italian [[Guglielmo Marconi]] transmits [[wireless telegraph]] messages by electromagnetic waves over a distance of five kilometers.
* 1898
** The Danish physicist [[Valdemar Poulsen]] creates the world's first [[magnetic recording]] and reproduction, using a 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick steel [[Wire recording|wire]] as a magnetizable carrier.
** [[Nikola Tesla]] demonstrated the first wireless [[remote control]] of a model ship.
* 1899: The dog "Nipper" is used in "[[His Master's Voice]]", the trademark for gramophones and records.
* 1902
** [[Otto von Bronk]] patented his "Method and apparatus for remote visualization of images and objects with temporary resolution of the images in parallel rows of dots". This patent, originally developed for phototelegraphy, impacted the development of [[color television]], particularly the [[NTSC]] implementation.
** For the first time audio records are printed with paper labels in the middle.
* 1903: [[Guglielmo Marconi]] provides evidence that wireless telegraphic communication is possible over long distances, such as across the Atlantic. He used a transmitter developed by [[Ferdinand Braun]].
* 1904
** For the first time, double-sided records, and those with a diameter of 30&amp;nbsp;cm are produced, increasing playing time up to 11 minutes (5.5 minutes per side). These are created by Odeon in Berlin and debuted at the Leipzig Spring Fair.
** The German physicist [[Arthur Korn]] developed the first practical method for [[telegraphy]].
* 1905: The Englishman Sir [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invents the first [[Fleming valve|electron tube]].
* 1906
** [[Robert von Lieben]] patented his "inertia working cathode-ray-relays". By 1910 he developed this into the first real [[tube amplifier]], by creating a [[triode]]. His invention of the triode is almost simultaneously created by the American [[Lee de Forest]].
** [[Max Dieckmann]] and [[Gustav Glage]] use the [[Braun tube]] for playback of 20-line black-and-white images.
** The first [[jukebox]] with records comes on the market.
** American Brigadier General [[Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody]] files for a patent for a carborundum steel detector for use in a [[crystal radio]], an improved version of the [[Cat's-whisker detector]]. It is sometimes credited as the first [[semiconductor]] in history.  The [[envelope detector]] is an important part of every radio receiver.   
* 1907: Rosenthal puts in his image telegraph for the first time a [[photocell]].
* 1911: First [[film studio]]s are created in Hollywood and Potsdam- Babelsberg .
* 1912: The first [[radio receiver]] is created, in accordance with the [[Audion principle]].
* 1913: The legal battle over the invention of the electron tube between [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee de Forest]] is decided. The electron tube is replaced by a high [[vacuum]] in the glass flask with significantly improved properties.
** [[Alexander Meissner]] patented his process "feedback for generating oscillations", by his development of a [[radio station]] using an electron tube .
** The Englishman Arthur Berry submits a patent on the manufacture of [[printed circuit]]s by etched metal.
* 1915: [[Carl Benedicks]] leads basic studies in Sweden on the electrical properties of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Due to the emerging tube technology, however, interest in semiconductors remains low until after the Second World War.
* 1917
** Based on previous findings of the Englishman [[Oliver Lodge]], the Frenchman Lucien Levy develops a radio receiver with frequency tuning using a resonant circuit.
* 1919: [[Charlie Chaplin]] founded the Hollywood film production and distribution company [[United Artists]]
* 1920: The first regularly operating radio station [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] goes on air on 2 November 1920 in [[Philadelphia]], USA. It is the first time electronics are used to transmit information and entertainment to the public at large. The same year in Germany an instrumental concert was broadcast on the radio from a long-wave transmitter in Wusterhausen.
* 1922: J. McWilliams Stone invents the first portable radio receiver. George Frost builds the first "car radio" in his Ford Model T.

'''Yahad-In Unum (YIU)''' is a French organization founded to locate the sites of [[mass grave]]s of Jewish victims of the Nazi mobile killing units, especially the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', in [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], [[Poland]] and [[Moldova]]. It was founded in [[Paris]] in 2004 by leaders in the French Roman Catholic and Jewish communities. YIU is led by Father [[Patrick Desbois]], a [[Roman Catholic priest|Catholic priest]] whose grandfather was a French soldier deported to the Nazi [[internment|prison camp]] [[Rava-Ruska]], located in a Ukrainian town that borders [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/12/desbois.html|title=A Priest Bears Witness - Moment Magazine|publisher=Momentmag.com|date=7 February 2012|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its United States fundraising branch is known as the '''American Friends of Yahad-In Unum'''.

==Historical background==
In less than two years, from June 1941 until the spring of 1943, an estimated 1.25 million Jews were massacred in [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] by Nazi mobile killing units, or ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' rounded up the Jewish populations of the villages and towns they passed through, led them to the country-side and summarily executed them. The victims were buried (many of them still alive) in mass graves. Very little is known about these atrocities because there were so few survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Einsatzgruppen Reports: Selections from the dispatches of the Nazi Death Squads' campaign against the Jews: July 1941–January 1943|editor=[[Yitzhak Arad]]|editor2=Shmuel Krakowski|editor3=Shmuel Spector|author=Stella Schossberger (translator)|publisher=United States Holocaust Museum|date=1990|isbn=978-0896040571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowe|first=David|title=The Holocaust: Roots, History, and Aftermath|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|date=2008|isbn=978-0813343259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2015}}
YIU seeks to find evidence of the massacres on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] and locate the mass graves of Jews killed by the ''Einsatzgruppen''. YIU's objective is to counter the claims of [[Holocaust deniers]] who use the lack of official documentation of the murders to make claims about the validity of [[Holocaust]] evidence, and to account for the graves that remain undiscovered to pay respect to the dead.

YIU approaches its work on two fronts—archival research and research trips. The archival research is primarily undertaken by [[PhD]] and [[Graduate school|graduate students]] in the [[United States]] and [[Germany]]. The researchers spend several months at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], where they study the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archives of the Extraordinary State Commission of 1944 and the archives from the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]] at [[Ludwigsburg]], Germany.

After the research is complete, an 11-person team, usually led by [[Patrick Desbois]], travels to Belarus and Ukraine to collect testimonial and [[Forensic identification|forensic evidence]] of the murders. Each trip lasts 15–20 days. The team includes a photographer, ballistics expert, translators, drivers, daily report recorders, a witness interviewer and [[camera operator]]. During each trip, the team travels from village to village, where they interview and film the surviving eyewitnesses, using testimony of witnesses to discover the locations of the graves. Once the graves are located, the team uses high-tech equipment to obtain forensic evidence that validates the testimonies. When the team returns to Paris, the translated video testimony and the [[physical evidence]] is archived.

==Publications==
In August 2008, [[Palgrave MacMillan]] published ''Holocaust By Bullets'', written by Father Desbois about the work of YIU. Father Desbois titled the book after one of the methods the [[Nazism|Nazis]] used to kill their victims. The [[Jewish Book Council]] awarded the book the 2008 [[National Jewish Book Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/njba-list|title=NJBA Winners|publisher=Jewishbookcouncil.org|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, YIU published its ten-year anniversary book. Called Broad Daylight, the book encapsulates the horror of the Jewish genocide in which Germans in Eastern Europe massacred the Jews in broad daylight. The bilingual book (written in French and English)covers each territory that the organization has researched, splitting each into a chapter. These include, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Poland, Romania, Moldova and Lithuania.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==Future projects==
YIU continues to work in Ukraine and Belarus and plans to expand to [[Russia]] and [[Poland]]. Since 2009, the ''Archives and Research Center'' (CERRESE - ''Centre Européen de Ressources pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement sur la Shoah à l'Est''), a unique research center in Paris, features unique archival resources and the new results from Father Desbois' [[field research]], including video testimonies and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yahadinunum.org/index.php/about-yahad/archives-and-research-center-cerrese YIU website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702075809/http://www.yahadinunum.org/index.php/about-yahad/archives-and-research-center-cerrese |date=July 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, YIU is planning to bring a special touring exhibit to schools in Ukraine. YIU will also continue the global tour of its educational exhibits, which include trainings and [[public education]] programs. Finally, they plan to host a conference at the [[Sorbonne]] about [[Sonderaktion 1005]], the Nazis' attempts to erase evidence of the mass murder of Jews.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The organization is also expanding an interactive map on its website, on which users can see the extent to which the Nazis attempted to wipe out the Jewish population in remote villages. The map covers all the countries in which the organization has expanded its research. It enables users to choose a specific country and location and to read information about the testimonies and/or watch a video regarding the town's mass murder.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10495">'''Çelik Gülersoy''' (September 23, 1930 [[Hakkâri]] - July 6, 2003 [[Istanbul]]) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] lawyer, [[historical preservation]]ist, writer and poet. He is best remembered for the heritage conservation works he carried out on historical sites during his long-time post as director general of the [[Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey]] (TTOK).

He was born in [[Hakkâri]], the south easternmost city of [[Turkey]] as his father was on duty as a [[Gendarmerie (Turkey)|gendarmerie]] officer. The family moved to [[Istanbul]] in 1933. After completing his primary, secondary and high school education in Istanbul, Çelik Gülersoy attended [[Istanbul University]] and graduated from the Law School. Following his military service between 1959-1960, he was employed in 1961 by the TTOK as law consultant, where he had worked already at various posts since 1947.&lt;ref name="turen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turing.org.tr/eng/celikgulersoy/main.htm |publisher=TTOK |title=Çelik Gülersoy |accessdate=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Çelik Gülersoy became the director general of the TTOK, a position he held 38 years long until his death. Reorganizing the TTOK, he brought in many much-needed services. He contributed to tourism and attended traffic conferences and congresses abroad. He published numerous books on historic sites mainly in Istanbul, and contributed so to the redevelopment of the cultural and touristic places.&lt;ref name="turen" /&gt;

Çelik Gülersoy died on July 6, 2003 due to [[pancreas cancer]] during a classical music concert he attended at the Fabiato Mansion in [[Büyükada]].&lt;ref name="sab"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2004/01/02/gun104.html |publisher=Sabah |title=Çelik Gülersoy'un Korktuğu Başına Geldi |author=Dişbudak, Atilla |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried next to his mother's grave at Demirciköy Cemetery in [[Sarıyer]] following a funeral service held at the [[Teşvikiye Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=80802 |publisher=Radikal |title=Çelik Gülersoy Toprağa Verildi |date=July 8, 2003 |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived alone and left all his assets to the Çelik Gülersoy Foundation he had established.&lt;ref name="sab" /&gt;
