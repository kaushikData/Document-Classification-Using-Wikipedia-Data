Born in the [[South Jamaica, Queens|South Jamaica]] neighborhood of the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]], Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s [[crack epidemic]]. He later began pursuing a musical career and in 2000 he produced ''[[Power of the Dollar]]'' for [[Columbia Records]], but days before the planned release he was shot and the album was never released. In 2002, after Jackson released the compilation album ''[[Guess Who's Back?]]'', he was discovered by [[Eminem]] and signed to [[Shady Records]], under the aegis of [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]].

With the aid of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] (who produced his first major-label album, ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with [[East Coast hip hop]] group [[G-Unit]] (which he leads ''de facto''). In 2003, he founded [[G-Unit Records]], signing his G-Unit associates [[Young Buck]], [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, ''[[The Massacre]]'', which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, ''[[Animal Ambition]]'', in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album, ''[[Street King Immortal]]''. He executive produces and stars in the show ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]'', which airs on [[Starz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.starz.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=982143 |title=Starz announces it extended Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson's exclusive premium overall deal |last= |first= |date=1 August 2016 |website= |access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14 a neighbor opened a boxing [[gym]] for local youth.

===2000–01: Shooting===
On May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} After Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a [[9 mm caliber|9mm]] [[handgun]].

Its first [[promo single]], "[[New Day (50 Cent song)|New Day]]" with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Alicia Keys]], was released on July 27. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by [[Eminem]] and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, [[Royce da 5'9"]] and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Keys was [[News leak|leaked]] by her husband, [[Swizz Beatz]]. "[[My Life (50 Cent song)|My Life]]", the album's second promo single (with Eminem and [[Maroon 5]] lead singer [[Adam Levine]]), was released on November 26, 2012.

It's also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don't want me to be uncomfortable.

One of Jackson's first business ventures was a partnership with [[Energy Brands|Glacéau]] to create an [[enhanced water]] drink called Formula 50.

The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that "they do such a good job making water taste good." After becoming a minority shareholder and celebrity spokesperson, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape flavored "Formula 50" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. In 2007, [[Coca-Cola]] purchased Glacéau for $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion and, according to ''[[Forbes]]'', Jackson, who was a minority shareholder, earned $100&amp;nbsp;million from the deal after taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Lea (September 30, 2007).

Jackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of [[Pearl River, New York]], on July 21, 2007 for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a MySpace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with "Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a "vile, tasteless and despicable" use of Jackson's image which "quite literally call[ed] for violence against him", sought unspecified [[punitive damages]] and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=CBC Arts |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/21/50cent-lawsuit-ad.html? |title=50 Cent says ad threatens his life, files lawsuit |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 21, 2007 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127011438/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/21/50cent-lawsuit-ad.html |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070911043335/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Jul20/0%2C4670%2CPeople50Cent%2C00.html 50 Cent Sues over 'Shoot the Rapper'].

====Janitor incident====
While walking through [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] in May 2016, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being [[Altered state of consciousness|under the influence]]. The janitor was a [[hearing-impaired]], [[autistic]] teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue Jackson for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to [[Autism Speaks]] and his apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlisted.com/2016/05/05/making-fun-of-an-autistic-janitor-cost-50-cent-100000/|title=Making Fun Of An Autistic Janitor Cost 50 Cent $100,000|date=May 5, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot1061.com/50-cent-makes-fun-of-autistic-teen/ |title=50 CENT MAKES FUN OF AUTISTIC TEEN |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521194448/http://www.hot1061.com/50-cent-makes-fun-of-autistic-teen/ |archivedate=May 21, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.datalounge.com/thread/16865038-50-cent-insults-a-kid-with-autism-|title=50 Cent "insults" a kid with autism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/50-cent-autism-tweet_n_1651256.html|title=50 Cent Faces Backlash Over Offensive Autism Tweets|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/50-cent-donates-100000-to-autism-speaks-after-mocking-teen-with-autism_us_572b7ddbe4b016f37894f190|title=50 Cent Donates $100,000 To Autism Speaks After Mocking Teen|first1=Julia Brucculieri Entertainment|last1=Writer|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=May 5, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other civil and criminal matters ===
One of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4&amp;nbsp;million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"/&gt; On August 5, 2013, Jackson pleaded not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court. If convicted of all charges, he faced up to five years in prison and a $46,000 fine. Model-actress Daphne Joy accused Jackson of kicking her and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her condominium in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 23. He allegedly caused $7,100 in property damage, leaving the scene before police arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/05/showbiz/50-cent-plea|title=50 Cent pleads not guilty in domestic violence case|first=Alan|last=Duke|date=August 5, 2013|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Ann Nevins has ordered Jackson back to court because of Instagram messages he made over several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/50-cent-called-back-to-bankruptcy-court-because-of-instagram-posts-news.20269.html|title=50 Cent brought back to court for not being fully transparent|first=Low|last=Carver |date=February 20, 2016|work=Hotnewhiphop}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said Jackson was not fully clear about his funds and indicated posts of the rapper showing stacks of his money.

==Feuds==

===Ja Rule===
Before he signed with Interscope Records, Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper [[Ja Rule]] and his label, [[Murder Inc. Records]], saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery.&lt;ref name=Playboy&gt;Tannenbaum, Rob (April 2004). "Playboy Interview: 50 Cent". ''Playboy'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him "getting so much love" from the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/j/ja_rule/news_feature_031103/index.jhtml |title=Ja Rule on 50 Cent, God and Hip-Hop |publisher=Mtv.com |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820000603/http://www.mtv.com/bands/j/ja_rule/news_feature_031103/index.jhtml |archivedate=August 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[The Hit Factory]] in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound.&lt;ref name=Playboy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dominic (July 2005).

An [[affidavit]] by an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and [[Kenneth McGriff|Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]], a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of [[Jam Master Jay]] and Jackson's shooting. An excerpt read:

{{quote|The investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff's criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target.&lt;ref name=TSG/&gt;}}

The end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, "I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world.

On August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between [[Meek Mill]] and [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]. Enraged, Jackson later responded back with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Natalie Weiner |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6655633/50-cent-ja-rule-beef-drake-meek-mill-beef-twitter-instagram |title=50 Cent &amp; Ja Rule Beef Reignited by Drake &amp; Meek Mill Feud |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud resurfaced three years later on January 19, 2018 when Ja Rule took to Twitter, calling out 50 Cent on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Micah Peters|url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/1/19/16911394/ja-rule-50-cent-beef-twitter-den-of-thieves|title=Ja Rule Takes to Twitter to Reignite Early-2000s Beef With 50 Cent|publisher=The Ringer|date=January 19, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Game===
Although Jackson was close to [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] before the latter released his debut album, ''The Documentary'', they grew apart. After ''The Documentary''{{'}}s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers (such as [[Nas]], [[Jadakiss]] and [[Fat Joe]]) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Shaheem (March 1, 2005).

[[File:50 cent in concert.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white closeup of 50 Cent singing onstage|At a 2007 concert]]
Jackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on [[WQHT|Hot 97]]. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Shaheem (February 28, 2005).

Several days later, Jackson released "Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)" in response to "Mafia Music". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem's Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.

Before leaving for [[Venezuela]], Jackson uploaded a video ("Warning Shot", telling Ross "I'ma fuck your life up for fun"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}) and the first of a series of "Officer Ricky" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed "Tia", the mother of one of Ross' children; according to her, Ross is in reality a [[Prison officer|correctional officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/videos/id.2138 |title=– 50 Cent – Interviews Rick Ross' Baby Mama |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=February 2, 2009 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]].

On his album ''[[Deeper Than Rap]]'', Ross refers to Jackson in "In Cold Blood" and Jackson's mock funeral is part of the song's video.

'''A1 B-boy Sasa''' is an African American street dancer credited as the first number one B-boy dancer of Hip-Hop &lt;ref&gt;Hip Hop: The Complete Archives&lt;/ref&gt; at [[DJ Kool Herc]] parties in 1973. It was Kool Herc who coined the term B-boy and B-girls for the [[African American]] teenage [[Funk]] dancers that attended his earliest parties. Sasa along with the first generation B-boys, Trixie, Wallace, Dancing Doug, The Legendary Twins, DJ Clark Kent, Chip The Mad Hatter and a few others from Kool Herc's parties, set the foundation for the B-boy dance style in Hip-Hop taking it to the floor, performing acrobatic moves.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Anthony Mark. That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader. Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis group New York 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-96918-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from the music of [[James Brown]] records and breakbeats, along with many other funk hits. The 3rd generation of dancers later introduced the B-boy dance as (Breakdancing) into the mass media, because of the popularity of Hip-Hop becoming a mainstream genre in the early 1980's.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sasa was born in Manhattan [[New York City]] and raised in the West Bronx. From childhood he grew up dancing to [[R&amp;B]], [[Soul]] and [[Funk]] music, early on he began getting recognition from his school peers for his fine dancing skills at school parties and later in his teenage years. Many of his friends began inviting him to house parties where he made a name for himself on the dance floor with his unique style, especially at Kool Herc parties where the best dancers from all over the [[Bronx]] and [[Harlem]] went to get down, and even dancers from [[Brooklyn]]. The best B-boy dancer was given the title "(A1)." Sasa, like most of the "first generation originals," stopped B-boy dancing by 1977. He retired undefeated never losing a B-boy battle. The original (1975-77) Zulu king's B-boys popularity and influence brought in the era of forming break crews also known as rockers, with the Zulu's adding "new footwork and acrobatic tricks" to the foundation of the dance, causing it to become a city-wide competitive trend amongst the youth, "which established this performing art form between the years of 1973 to 1977. After that, new generation B-boy crews began to pop up in communities all across the city."&lt;ref&gt;Universal Hip Hop Museum Editorial Director &amp; Writer Eddie Lane&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">'''Abbo''' (died 937) was the [[bishop of Soissons]] from 909. Throughout his episcopate, he was "under the thumb" of Count [[Herbert II, Count of Vermandois|Herbert II of Vermandois]] (907–943).{{sfn|McKitterick|1983|pp=311–12}}

In 925, Abbo attended the uncanonical synod convoked in [[Reims]] by Count Herbert, who had his five-year-old son [[Hugh of Vermandois (bishop)|Hugh]] elected archbishop by the pliant clergy (including Bishop [[Bovo II (bishop of Châlons)|Bovo of Châlons]]) and the people of the city.{{sfn|McKitterick|1983|pp=311–12}} This synod was retroactively approved by both King [[Rudolph of France]] and Pope [[Pope John X|John X]], who gave Herbert the administration of the archdiocese's temporalities and Abbo, technically Hugh's [[suffragan]], responsibility for its spiritual functioning, including its services.{{sfn|McKitterick|1983|pp=311–12}}

In 927 the pope revoked Abbo's charge and gave the spiritual administration of Reims to [[Odalric (bishop of Aix-en-Provence)|Odalric]], the [[bishop of Aix-en-Provence]], who had fled his see in the face of raids from the Muslim pirates based at [[Fraxinetum]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1983|pp=311–12}}{{sfn|Duckett|1967|p=155}}

'''Abtolemus''' ({{lang-he|'''אבטולמוס '''}}, ''Avtolemus''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''Εὔτολμος''') was a Jewish [[Tannaim|Tanna]] sage of the third Generation. [[Jose ben Halafta]] was his disciple. He is cited in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], attesting on the Jewish law of [[Halkha]], on the authority of "Five Elders".&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]], Erubin, ch. 2:11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some are in the opinion that he may be the same '''Abtolemus b. Reuben''', that is cited in the [[Babylon]]ian [[Talmud]]:

{{quote

The '''Asthma Life Impact Scale''' (ALIS) measure is a disease specific [[patient reported outcome]] questionnaire which assesses the impact that [[asthma]] has on a patient’s [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name="meads mckenna"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meads|first=David M.|author2=McKenna, Stephen P.|author3=Doward, Lynda C.|author4=Pokrzywinski, Robin|author5=Revicki, Dennis|author6=Hunter, Cameron|author7= Glendenning, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11957">'''BCM theory''', '''BCM synaptic modification''', or the '''BCM rule''', named for [[Elie Bienenstock]], [[Leon Cooper]], and Paul Munro, is a physical theory of learning in the [[visual cortex]] developed in 1981. Due to its successful experimental predictions, the theory is arguably the most accurate model of [[synaptic plasticity]] to date{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

The BCM model proposes a sliding threshold for [[Long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[Long-term depression]] (LTD) induction, and states that synaptic plasticity is stabilized by a dynamic adaptation of the time-averaged postsynaptic activity. According to the BCM model, when a pre-synaptic neuron fires, the post-synaptic neurons will tend to undergo LTP if it is in a high-activity state (e.g., is firing at high frequency, and/or has high internal calcium concentrations), or LTD if it is in a lower-activity state (e.g., firing in low frequency, low internal calcium concentrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Izhikevich|first=Eugene M.|last2=Desai|first2=Niraj S.|date=2003-07-01|title=Relating STDP to BCM|pmid=12816564|journal=Neural Computation|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1511–1523|doi=10.1162/089976603321891783|issn=0899-7667}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is often used to explain how cortical neurons can undergo both LTP or LTD depending on different conditioning stimulus protocols applied to pre-synaptic neurons (usually high-frequency stimulation, or HFS, for LTP, or low-frequency stimulation, LFS, for LTD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coesmans|first=Michiel|last2=Weber|first2=John T.|last3=Zeeuw|first3=Chris I.

== Development ==
In 1949, [[Donald Hebb]] proposed a working mechanism for memory and computational adaption in the brain now called [[Hebbian learning]], or the maxim that ''cells that fire together, wire together''. This law formed the basis of the brain as the modern [[neural network]], theoretically capable of [[Turing complete]] computational complexity{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, and thus became a standard materialist model for the mind.

However, Hebb's rule has problems, namely that it has no mechanism for connections to get weaker and no upper bound for how strong they can get. In other words, the model is unstable, both theoretically and computationally. Later modifications gradually improved Hebb's rule, normalizing it and allowing for decay of synapses, where no activity or unsynchronized activity between neurons results in a loss of connection strength. New biological evidence brought this activity to a peak in the 1970s, where theorists formalized various approximations in the theory, such as the use of firing frequency instead of potential in determining neuron excitation, and the assumption of ideal and, more importantly, linear synaptic integration of signals. That is, there is no unexpected behavior in the adding of input currents to determine whether or not a cell will fire.

These approximations resulted in the basic form of BCM below in 1979, but the final step came in the form of mathematical analysis to prove stability and computational analysis to prove applicability, culminating in Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro's 1982 paper.

Since then, experiments have shown evidence for BCM behavior in both the [[visual cortex]] and the [[hippocampus]], the latter of which plays an important role in the formation and storage of memories. Both of these areas are well-studied experimentally, but both theory and experiment have yet to establish conclusive synaptic behavior in other areas of the brain. It has been proposed that in the [[cerebellum]], the [[Parallel fiber|parallel-fiber]] to [[Purkinje cell]] synapse follows an "inverse BCM rule", meaning that at the time of parallel fiber activation, a high calcium concentration in the Purkinje cell results in LTD, while a lower concentration results in LTP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, a biological mechanism for [[synaptic plasticity]] in BCM has yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=L.N. |authorlink=Leon Cooper |year=2000 |title=Memories and memory: A physicist's approach to the brain |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A |volume=15 |issue=26 |pages=4069–4082 |id= |url=http://physics.brown.edu/physics/researchpages/Ibns/Lab%20Publications%20(PDF)/memoriesandmemory.pdf |accessdate= 2007-11-11 |quote= |doi=10.1142/s0217751x0000272x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
{{Confusing|date=January 2012}}
The basic BCM rule takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;\,\frac{d m_j(t)}{d t} = \phi(\textbf{c}(t))d_j(t)-\epsilon m_j(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_j&lt;/math&gt; is the synaptic weight of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th synapse, &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; is that synapse's input current, &lt;math&gt;\textbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the weighted presynaptic output vector, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the postsynaptic [[activation function]] that changes sign at some output threshold &lt;math&gt;\theta_M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the (often negligible) time constant of uniform decay of all synapses.

This model is merely a modified form of the [[Hebbian learning]] rule, &lt;math&gt;\dot{m_j}=c d_j&lt;/math&gt;, and requires a suitable choice of activation function, or rather, the output threshold, to avoid the Hebbian problems of instability. This threshold was derived rigorously in BCM noting that with &lt;math&gt;c(t)=\textbf{m}(t)\cdot\textbf{d}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the approximation of the average output &lt;math&gt;\bar{\textbf{c}}(t) \approx \textbf{m}(t)\bar{d}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, for one to have stable learning it is sufficient that

:&lt;math&gt;\,\sgn\phi(c,\bar{c}) = \sgn\left(c-\left(\frac{\bar{c}}{c_0}\right)^p\bar{c}\right) ~~ \textrm{for} ~ c&gt;0, ~ \textrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\,\phi(0,\bar{c}) = 0 ~~ \textrm{for} ~ \textrm{all} ~ \bar{c},&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently, that the threshold &lt;math&gt;\theta_M(\bar{c}) = (\bar{c}/c_0)^p\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; are fixed positive constants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bienenstock |first=Elie L. |authorlink=Elie Bienenstock |author2=[[Leon Cooper]] |author3=[[Paul Munro]] |date=January 1982|title=Theory for the development of neuron selectivity: orientation specificity and binocular interaction in visual cortex |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=32–48 |id= |url=http://www.physics.brown.edu/physics/researchpages/Ibns/Cooper%20Pubs/070_TheoryDevelopment_82.pdf |accessdate= 2007-11-11 |quote= |pmid=7054394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When implemented, the theory is often taken such that

:&lt;math&gt;\,\phi(c,\bar{c}) = c(c-\theta_M) ~~~ \textrm{and} ~~~ \theta_M = \langle c^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{\tau}\int_{-\infty}^t c^2(t^\prime)e^{-(t-t^\prime)/\tau}d t^\prime,&lt;/math&gt;

where angle brackets are a time average and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time constant of selectivity.

The model has drawbacks, as it requires both [[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression]], or increases and decreases in synaptic strength, something which has not been observed in all cortical systems. Further, it requires a variable activation threshold and depends strongly on stability of the selected fixed points &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. However, the model's strength is that it incorporates all these requirements from independently derived rules of stability, such as [[Normalisable wave function|normalizability]] and a decay function with time proportional to the square of the output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nin/Courses/NC05/BCM.ppt |title=The BCM theory of synaptic plasticity |accessdate=2007-11-11 |last=Intrator |first=Nathan |date=2006–2007 |work=Neural Computation |publisher=School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiment ==
The first major experimental confirmation of BCM came in 1992 in investigating [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] and [[Long-term depression|LTD]] in the [[hippocampus]]. The data showed qualitative agreement with the final form of the BCM activation function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dudek |first=Serena M. |authorlink=Serena Dudek |author2=Mark Bear |authorlink2=Mark F.

Experimental evidence has been non-specific to BCM until Rittenhouse ''et al.'' confirmed BCM's prediction of synapse modification in the visual cortex when one eye is selectively closed. Specifically,

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(\frac{m_{\rm closed}(t)}{m_{\rm closed}(0)}\right) \sim -\overline{n^2}t,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; describes the variance in spontaneous activity or noise in the closed eye and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time since closure. Experiment agreed with the general shape of this prediction and provided an explanation for the dynamics of monocular eye closure ([[monocular deprivation]]) versus binocular eye closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rittenhouse |first=Cynthia D. |authorlink= |author2=Harel Z.

== Applications ==
While the algorithm of BCM is too complicated for large-scale [[parallel distributed processing]], it has been put to use in lateral networks with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nin/Courses/NC05/bcmppr.pdf |title=BCM Learning Rule, Comp Issues |accessdate=2007-11-11 |last=Intrator |first=Nathan |date=2006–2007 |work=Neural Computation |publisher=School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some existing computational network learning algorithms have been made to correspond to BCM learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baras |first=Dorit |authorlink= |author2=Ron Meir |year=2007 |title=Reinforcement Learning, Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity, and the BCM Rule |journal=Neural Computation |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=2245–2279 |id=2561 |url=http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00002561/01/RL-STDP_Final.pdf |accessdate=2007-11-11 |quote= |doi=10.1162/neco.2007.19.8.2245 |pmid=17571943 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721081006/http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00002561/01/RL-STDP_Final.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, a '''biomarker''' is  a measurable [[wikt:indicator|indicator]] of the severity or presence of some disease state. More generally a [[biomarker]] is anything that can be used as an indicator of a particular disease state or some other [[physiological]] state of an organism.

A biomarker can be a substance that is introduced into an organism as a means to examine organ function or other aspects of health. For example, [[rubidium chloride]] is used in [[isotopic labeling]] to evaluate perfusion of heart muscle. It can also be a substance whose detection indicates a particular disease state, for example, the presence of an [[antibody]] may indicate an [[infection]]. More specifically, a biomarker indicates a change in expression or state of a protein that correlates with the risk or progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. Biomarkers can be characteristic biological properties or molecules that can be detected and measured in parts of the body like the blood or tissue. They may indicate either normal or diseased processes in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Biomarkers Consortium |publisher=Foundation for the National Institutes of Health |url=http://www.biomarkersconsortium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomarkers can be specific cells, molecules, or genes, gene products, enzymes, or hormones. Complex organ functions or general characteristic changes in biological structures can also serve as biomarkers. Although the term biomarker is relatively new, biomarkers have been used in pre-clinical research and clinical diagnosis for a considerable time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomarker.co.uk/whatisabiomarkers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025075643/http://www.biomarker.co.uk/whatisabiomarkers.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, body temperature is a well-known biomarker for fever. Blood pressure is used to determine the risk of stroke. It is also widely known that cholesterol values are a biomarker and risk indicator for coronary and vascular disease, and that C-reactive protein ([[C-reactive protein|CRP]]) is a marker for inflammation.

Biomarkers are useful in a number of ways, including measuring the progress of disease, evaluating the most effective therapeutic regimes for a particular cancer type, and establishing long-term susceptibility to cancer or its recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biomarker Technology Platforms for Cancer Diagnoses and Therapies |publisher=TriMark Publications, LLC |date=July 2014 |url=http://www.trimarkpublications.com/products/Biomarker-Technology-Platforms-for-Cancer-Diagnoses-and-Therapies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameter can be chemical, physical or biological. In molecular terms biomarker is "the subset of markers that might be discovered using genomics, proteomics technologies or imaging technologies. Biomarkers play major roles in medicinal biology. Biomarkers help in early diagnosis, disease prevention, drug target identification, drug response etc. Several biomarkers have been identified for many diseases such as serum LDL for cholesterol, [[blood pressure]], and [[TP53|P53 gene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loukopoulos P, Thornton JR, Robinson WF |title=Clinical and pathologic relevance of p53 index in canine osseous tumors |journal=Vet.

== Disease-related biomarkers and drug-related biomarkers ==

It is necessary to distinguish between ''disease-related'' and ''drug-related biomarkers''. Disease-related biomarkers give an indication of the probable effect of treatment on patient (risk indicator or predictive biomarkers), if a disease already exists (diagnostic biomarker), or how such a disease may develop in an individual case regardless of the type of treatment (prognostic biomarker). Predictive biomarkers help to assess the most likely response to a particular treatment type, while prognostic markers shows the progression of disease with or without treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tevak|first=Z|author2=Kondratovich M|author3=Mansfield E|title=US FDA and Personalized Medicine: In vitro Diagnostic Regulatory Perspective|journal=Personalized Medicine|year=2010|volume=7|issue=5|pages=517–530|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/730331_7|accessdate=1 May 2011|doi=10.2217/pme.10.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, drug-related biomarkers indicate whether a drug will be effective in a specific patient and how the patient’s body will process it.

In addition to long-known parameters, such as those included and objectively measured in a [[blood count]], there are numerous novel biomarkers used in the various medical specialties. Currently, intensive work is taking place on the discovery and development of innovative and more effective biomarkers. These "new" biomarkers have become the basis for preventive medicine, meaning medicine that recognises diseases or the risk of disease early, and takes specific countermeasures to prevent the development of disease. Biomarkers are also seen as the key to [[personalised]] medicine, treatments individually tailored to specific patients for highly efficient intervention in disease processes. Often, such biomarkers indicate changes in metabolic processes.

The "classic" biomarker in medicine is a laboratory parameter that the doctor can use to help make decisions in making a diagnosis and selecting a course of treatment. For example, the detection of certain [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] in patient blood is a reliable biomarker for [[autoimmune disease]], and the detection of [[rheumatoid factor]]s has been an important diagnostic marker for [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) for over 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waaler E |title=On the occurrence of a factor in human serum activating the specific agglutintion of sheep blood corpuscles. 1939 |journal=APMIS |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=422–38; discussion 439 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17504400 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2007.apm_682a.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0903-4641&amp;date=2007&amp;volume=115&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rose HM, Ragan C |title=Differential agglutination of normal and sensitized sheep erythrocytes by sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Proc.

For the diagnosis of this [[autoimmune disease]] the antibodies against the bodies own citrullinated proteins are of particular value. These [[Anti-citrullinated protein antibody|ACPAs]], (ACPA stands for ''A''nti-''c''itrullinated ''p''rotein/peptide ''a''ntibody) can be detected in the blood before the first symptoms of RA appear. They are thus highly valuable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of this autoimmune disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/art.22817 |vauthors=Bang H, Egerer K, Gauliard A, Lüthke K, Rudolph PE, Fredenhagen G |title=Mutation and citrullination modifies vimentin to a novel autoantigen for rheumatoid arthritis |journal= Arthritis Rheum |year=2007 |volume=56 |issue=8 |pages=2503–11 |pmid= 17665451|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they indicate if the disease threatens to be severe with serious damage to the bones and joints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szodoray P, Szabó Z, Kapitány A |title=Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide autoantibodies in association with genetic and environmental factors as indicators of disease outcome in rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Autoimmun Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=140–3 |date=January 2010 |pmid=19427413 |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2009.04.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1568-9972(09)00111-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathsson L, Mullazehi M, Wick MC |title=Antibodies against citrullinated vimentin in rheumatoid arthritis: higher sensitivity and extended prognostic value concerning future radiographic progression as compared with antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=36–45 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18163519 |doi=10.1002/art.23188 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an important tool for the doctor when providing a diagnosis and developing a treatment plan.

There are also more and more indications that ACPAs can be very useful in monitoring the success of treatment for RA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicaise Roland P, Grootenboer Mignot S, Bruns A |title=Antibodies to mutated citrullinated vimentin for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis in anti-CCP-negative patients and for monitoring infliximab therapy |journal=[[Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy]] |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=R142 |year=2008 |pmid=19077182 |pmc=2656247 |doi=10.1186/ar2570 |url=http://arthritis-research.com/content/10/6/R142|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would make possible the accurate use of modern treatments with [[Biological response modifiers|biological]]s. Physicians hope to soon be able to individually tailor rheumatoid arthritis treatments for each patient.

According to Häupl T. et al. prediction of response to treament will become the most important aim of biomarker research in medicine. With the growing number of new [[biological|biological agents]], there is increasing pressure to identify molecular parameters such as ACPAs that will not only guide the therapeutic decision but also help to define the most important targets for which new biological agents should be tested in clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Häupl T, Stuhlmüller B, Grützkau A, Radbruch A, Burmester GR |title=Does gene expression analysis inform us in rheumatoid arthritis? |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |pmid=19995742 |doi=10.1136/ard.2009.119487|volume=69 |issue=Suppl 1 |date=January 2010 |pages=i37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An NIH study group committed to the following definition in 1998: "a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention." 
In the past, biomarkers were primarily physiological indicators such as blood pressure or heart rate. More recently, biomarker is becoming a synonym for molecular biomarker, such as elevated prostate specific antigen as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer, or using enzyme assays as liver function tests. There has recently been heightened interest in the relevance of biomarkers in oncology, including the role of [[KRAS]] in [[colorectal cancer]] and other [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]]-associated cancers. In patients whose tumors express the mutated KRAS gene, the KRAS protein, which forms part of the EGFR signaling pathway, is always ‘turned on’. This overactive EGFR signaling means that signaling continues downstream – even when the upstream signaling is blocked by an EGFR inhibitor, such as [[cetuximab]] (Erbitux) – and results in continued cancer cell growth and proliferation.  Testing a tumor for its KRAS status (wild-type vs. mutant) helps to identify those patients who will benefit most from treatment with cetuximab.

Currently, effective treatment is available for only a small percentage of cancer patients. In addition, many cancer patients are diagnosed at a stage where the cancer has advanced too far to be treated. Biomarkers have the ability to greatly enhance cancer detection and the drug development process. In addition, biomarkers will enable physicians to develop individualized treatment plans for their cancer patients; thus allowing doctors to tailor drugs specific to their patient's tumor type. By doing so, drug response rate will improve, drug toxicity will be limited and costs associated with testing various therapies and the ensuing treatment for side effects will decrease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancer-biomarkers.com/introduction{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomarkers also cover the use of molecular indicators of environmental exposure in epidemiologic studies such as human papilloma virus or certain markers of tobacco exposure such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK).  To date no biomarkers have been established for [[head and neck cancer]].

== Biomarkers in Drug Development ==

Once a proposed biomarker has been validated, it can be used to diagnose disease risk, presence of disease in an individual, or to tailor treatments for the disease in an individual (choices of drug treatment or administration regimes). In evaluating potential drug therapies, a biomarker may be used as a surrogate for a natural [[Clinical endpoint|endpoint]] such as survival or irreversible morbidity. If a treatment alters the biomarker, which has a direct connection to improved health, the biomarker serves as a [[surrogate endpoint]] for evaluating clinical benefit.
Some of the main areas in which molecular biomarkers are used in the drug development process are: early drug development studies, safety studies, [[proof of concept]] studies, and molecular profiling.

Molecular biomarkers are often used in early drug development studies. For instance, they are used in phase I study for establishing doses and dosing regimen for future phase II studies. PD biomarkers are commonly observed to respond (either decrease or increase) proportionally with dose. This data, in conjunction with safety data, help determine doses for phase II studies. 
In addition, Safety molecular biomarkers  have been used for decades both in preclinical and [[Clinical trial|clinical research]]. Since these tests have become mainstream tests, they have been fully automated for both animal and human testing. Among the most common safety tests are those of liver function (e.g., transaminases, bilirubin, [[alkaline phosphatase]]) and [[Renal physiology|kidney function]] (e.g., [[Creatinine|serum creatinine]], creatinine clearance, cystatin C). Others include markers of [[skeletal muscle]](e.g., myoglobin) or [[cardiac muscle]] injury (e.g., CK-MB, troponin I or T), as well as bone biomarkers (e.g., bone-specific alkaline phosphatase).

== Biomarker requirements ==

For chronic diseases, whose treatment may require patients to take medications for years, accurate diagnosis is particularly important, especially when strong side effects are expected from the treatment. In these cases, biomarkers are becoming more and more important, because they can confirm a difficult diagnosis or even make it possible in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Pharma Matters White Paper: Establishing the standards in biomarker research (2008). Thomson Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[Rheumatoid arthritis#Blood tests|rheumatoid arthritis]], often begin with an early, symptom-free phase. In such symptom-free patients there may be more or less probability of actually developing symptoms. In these cases, biomarkers help to identify high-risk individuals reliably and in a timely manner so that they can either be treated before onset of the disease or as soon as possible thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craig-Schapiro R, Fagan AM, Holtzman DM |title=Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Neurobiol. Dis. |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=128–40 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19010417 |pmc=2747727 |doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2008.10.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0969-9961(08)00254-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Egerer K, Feist E, Burmester GR |title=The serological diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis: antibodies to citrullinated antigens |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=106 |issue=10 |pages=159–63 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19578391 |pmc=2695367 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2009.0159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to use a biomarker for diagnostics, the sample material must be as easy to obtain as possible. This may be a blood sample taken by a doctor, a urine or saliva sample, or a drop of blood like those diabetes patients extract from their own fingertips for regular blood-sugar monitoring.

For rapid initiation of treatment, the speed with which a result is obtained from the biomarker test is critical. A [[point-of-care testing|rapid test]], which delivers a result after only a few minutes, is optimal. This makes it possible for the physician to discuss with the patient how to proceed and if necessary to start treatment immediately after the test.

Naturally, the detection method for a biomarker must be accurate and as easy to carry out as possible. The results from different laboratories may not differ significantly from each other, and the biomarker must naturally have proven its effectiveness for the diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment of the affected diseases in independent studies.

A biomarker for clinical use needs good [[sensitivity and specificity]] e.g. ≥0.9, and good [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] e.g. ≥0.9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brower V |title=Biomarkers: Portents of malignancy |journal=Nature |volume=471 |issue=7339 |pages=S19–21 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21430715 |doi=10.1038/471S19a }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they should be chosen with the population in mind so [[positive predictive value]] and [[negative predictive value]] are more relevant.

== Biomarker classification and application ==
Biomarkers can be classified based on different criteria. 

Based on their characteristics they can be classified as [[imaging biomarker]]s (CT, PET, MRI) or [[molecular biomarkers]] with three subtypes: [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], like breath&lt;ref&gt;N. SivaSubramaniam et al. Emergence of breath testing as a new non-invasive diagnostic modality for neurodegenerative diseases, Brain Research, Volume 1691, 15 July 2018, Pages 75-86, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2018.04.017&lt;/ref&gt;, [[body fluid]] or [[Tissue (biology)|biopsy]] biomarkers. 

[[Molecular biomarkers]] refer to nonimaging biomarkers that have biophysical properties, which allow their measurements in biological samples (e.g., plasma, serum, [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[bronchoalveolar lavage]], biopsy) and include nucleic acids-based biomarkers such as gene mutations or polymorphisms and quantitative [[gene expression]] analysis, peptides, proteins, lipids metabolites, and other small molecules. 

Biomarkers can also be classified based on their application such as diagnostic biomarkers (i.e., cardiac troponin for the diagnosis of [[myocardial infarction]]), staging of disease biomarkers (i.e., [[brain natriuretic peptide]] for [[congestive heart failure]]), disease prognosis biomarkers (cancer biomarkers), and biomarkers for monitoring the clinical response to an intervention (HbAlc for antidiabetic treatment). 
Another category of biomarkers includes those used in decision making in early [[drug development]]. For instance, pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers are markers of a certain pharmacological response, which are of special interest in dose optimization studies.

=== Types ===
Biomarkers validated by genetic and molecular biology methods can be classified into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Firestein|first1=Gary|year=2006|title=A biomarker by any other name...|journal=Nature Clinical Practice Rheumatology|volume=2|issue=635|doi=10.1038/ncprheum0347|url=http://www.nature.com/nrrheum/journal/v2/n12/full/ncprheum0347.html|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Type 0 — Natural history markers
* Type 1 — Drug activity markers
* Type 2 — [[Surrogate marker]]s

== Discovery of molecular biomarkers ==
{{Main|Biomarker discovery}}
Molecular biomarkers have been defined as biomarkers that can be discovered using  basic and acceptable platforms such as genomics and proteomics. Many genomic and proteomics techniques are available for [[biomarker discovery]] and a few techniques that are recently being used can be found on that page. Apart from genomics and proteomics platforms biomarker assay techniques, metabolomics, lipidomics, glycomics, and [[secretomics]] are the most commonly used as techniques in identification of biomarkers.

==Imaging biomarkers==
{{main|Imaging biomarker}}
Many new biomarkers are being developed that involve imaging technology.  Imaging biomarkers have many advantages.  They are usually noninvasive, and they produce intuitive, multidimensional results.  Yielding both qualitative and quantitative data, they are usually relatively comfortable for patients.  When combined with other sources of information, they can be very useful to clinicians seeking to make a diagnosis.

Cardiac imaging is an active area of biomarker research.  [[Coronary angiography]], an invasive procedure requiring [[catheterization]], has long been the gold standard for diagnosing arterial stenosis, but scientists and doctors hope to develop noninvasive techniques.  Many believe that cardiac [[computed tomography]] (CT) has great potential in this area, but researchers are still attempting to overcome problems related to “[[calcium blooming]],” a phenomenon in which calcium deposits interfere with image resolution.   Other intravascular imaging techniques involving [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT), and [[near infrared spectroscopy]] are also being investigated.

Another new imaging biomarker involves [[radiolabeling|radiolabeled]] [[fludeoxyglucose]].  [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) can be used to measure where in the body cells take up glucose.  By tracking glucose, doctors can find sites of [[inflammation]] because macrophages there take up glucose at high levels.  [[Tumors]] also take up a lot of glucose, so the imaging strategy can be used to monitor them as well.   Tracking radiolabeled glucose is a promising technique because it directly measures a step known to be crucial to inflammation and tumor growth.

===Imaging disease biomarkers by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ===
{{main|molecular imaging}}
[[MRI]] has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging.  MRI does have several disadvantages though.  First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; [[concentration#Molarity|mol/L]] &lt;!--is this what M was supposed to be, molarity?  if not, explain and link as appropriate--&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; mol/L which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting.  This problem stems from the fact that the difference between atoms in the high energy state and the low energy state is very small.  For example, at 1.5 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and [[Hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]] via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.

To achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity (sensitivity) are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as [[HER-2]] [[affibody molecule|affibodies]], have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xue S, Qiao J, Pu F, Cameron M, Yang JJ |title=Design of a novel class of protein-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for the molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=January 2013 |pmid=23335551 |doi=10.1002/wnan.1205 |pages=163–79 |pmc=4011496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential disadvantages ==
Not all biomarkers should be used as surrogate endpoints to assess clinical outcomes.  Biomarkers can be difficult to validate and require different levels of validation depending on their intended use.  If a biomarker is to be used to measure the success of a therapeutic intervention, the biomarker should reflect a direct effect of that medicine.

== Company history ==
'''1983''': [[Erich Erber]] opened Biomin in a small warehouse in Pottenbrunn, Austria with a staff of three, starting with a livestock premix product line containing probiotics. Founder Erich Erber named the product and company based on the idea of combining “'''bio'''logical '''min'''erals” and so the brand name "Biomin" was born.&lt;ref name="AllAboutFeed_ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ErberGroup_ref1"&gt;{{cite web|title= History of ERBER Group|url= http://www.erber-group.net/history_at.html|website= ErberGroup.net |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1985''': Biomin bought Interpremix, a small premix factory, as its first production facility. The acquired firm also made a product called Antitox Plus, the first product available that ‘binds’ mycotoxins through a process known as [[adsorption]].&lt;ref name="AllAboutFeed_ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ErberGroup_ref1" /&gt;

'''1988''': Biomin signed a research agreement with the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]], Austria, and Dr. Josef Leibetseder to further improve the efficacy of Antitox Plus to a wider range of mycotoxins. Only several years later the second generation of the mycotoxin deactivation product was launched under the brand name Mycofix&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="AllAboutFeed_ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ErberGroup_ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThePigSite_ref1"&gt;{{cite web|title= Biomin to Launch Mycofix 5.0 Mycotoxin Risk Management Solution to Date|url= http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/39083/biomin-to-launch-mycofix-50-the-most-complete-mycotoxin-risk-management-solution-to-date|date=4 March 2015|website= ThePigSite.com |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994''': The Biomin brand name was separated from the Interpremix product line. Erber AG became the holding company of Biomin.&lt;ref name="AllAboutFeed_ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ErberGroup_ref1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25811">A '''Capsule Neural Network''' ('''CapsNet''') is a machine learning system that is a type of [[artificial neural network]] (ANN) that can be used to better model hierarchical relationships. The approach is an attempt to more closely mimic biological neural organization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The idea is to add structures called capsules to a [[convolutional neural network]] (CNN), and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable (with respect to various perturbations) representations for higher order capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinton|first=Geoffrey E.|last2=Krizhevsky|first2=Alex|last3=Wang|first3=Sida D.|date=2011-06-14|title=Transforming Auto-Encoders|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21735-7_6|journal=Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning – ICANN 2011|volume=6791|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=44–51|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-21735-7_6|isbn=9783642217340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The output is a vector consisting of the [[Realization (probability)|probability of an observation]], and a [[Pose (computer vision)|pose for that observation]]. This vector is similar to what is done for example when doing&amp;nbsp;''classification with localization''&amp;nbsp;in CNNs.

Among other benefits, capsnets address the "Picasso problem" in image recognition: images that have all the right parts but that are not in the correct spatial relationship (e.g., in a "face", the positions of the mouth and one eye are switched). For image recognition, capsnets exploit the fact that while viewpoint changes have nonlinear effects at the pixel level, they have linear effects at the part/object level.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE676/9.12%20CapsuleNets.pdf|title=Capsule Nets|last=Srihari|first=Sargur|publisher=[[University of Buffalo]]|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be compared to inverting the rendering of an object of multiple parts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1710-learning-to-parse-images.pdf|title=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 12|last=Hinton|first=Geoffrey E|last2=Ghahramani|first2=Zoubin|last3=Teh|first3=Yee Whye|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|editor-last=Solla|editor-first=S.

== History ==
In 2000 [[Geoffrey Hinton]] et. al. described an imaging system that combined segmentation and recognition into a single inference process using [[Parse tree|parse trees]]. So-called credibility networks described the joint distribution over the latent variables and over the possible parse trees. That system proved useful on the [[MNIST database|MNIST]] handwritten digit database.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A dynamic routing mechanism for capsule networks was introduced by Hinton and his team in 2017. The approach was claimed to reduce error rates on [[MNIST database|MNIST]] and to reduce training set sizes. Results were claimed to be considerably better than a CNN on highly overlapped digits.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

In Hinton's original idea one minicolumn would represent and detect one multidimensional entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Meher Vamsi|title=Geoffrey Hinton Capsule theory|date=2017-11-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S1_WqE55UQ|accessdate=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name=":0" /&gt;

==  Equivariance ==
Equivariance&amp;nbsp;is the detection of objects that can transform to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jhui.github.io/2017/11/14/Matrix-Capsules-with-EM-routing-Capsule-Network/|title=“Understanding Matrix capsules with EM Routing (Based on Hinton's Capsule Networks)”|website=jhui.github.io|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spatial relationship can be characterized represented by its ''pose'', data that describes the object's [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]&amp;nbsp;and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. Translation is a change in location in one or more dimensions, while rotation is a change in orientation.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[Unsupervised learning|Unsupervised]] capsnets learn a global [[Affine space|linear manifold]] between a whole object and its pose (as a matrix of weights). As such, the&amp;nbsp;''translation invariance''&amp;nbsp;is encapsulated in the weights, rather than in neural activity (recognition), making the network&amp;nbsp;''translation equivariant''. Multiplying the object by the manifold thereby poses the object (for an object, in space).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kndrck.co/posts/capsule_networks_explained/|title=Capsule Networks Explained|last=Tan|first=Kendrick|date=November 10, 2017|website=kndrck.co|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pooling ==
Capsnets reject the pooling layer strategy of conventional CNNs that reduces the amount of detail to be processed at the next higher layer. Pooling allows a degree of translational invariance (it can recognize the same object in a somewhat different location) and allows a larger number of feature types to be represented. Capsnet proponents argue that pooling:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
* violates biological shape perception in that it has no intrinsic coordinate frame;
* provides invariance (discarding positional information) instead of equivariance (disentangling that information);
* ignores the linear manifold that underlies many variations among images;
* routes statically instead of communicating a potential "find" to the feature that can appreciate it;
* damages nearby feature detectors, by deleting the information they rely upon.

==Capsules ==
A capsule is a set of neurons that individually activate for various properties of a type of object, such as position, size and hue. Formally, a capsule is a set of neurons that collectively produce an ''activity vector'' with one element for each neuron to hold that neuron's instantiation value (e.g., hue).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Graphics programs use instantiation value to draw an object. Capsnets attempt to derive these from their input. The probability of the entity's presence in a specific input is the vector's length, while the vector's orientation quantifies the capsule's properties.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

[[Artificial neuron]]s traditionally output a scalar, real-valued activation that loosely represents the probability of an observation. Capsnets replace scalar-output feature detectors with vector-output capsules and max-pooling with routing-by-agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

Because capsules are independent, when multiple capsules agree, the probability of correct detection is much higher. A minimal cluster of two capsules considering a six-dimensional entity would agree within 10% by chance only once in a million trials. As the number of dimensions increase, the likelihood of a chance agreement across a larger cluster with higher dimensions decreases exponentially.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Capsules in higher layers take outputs from capsules at lower layers, and accept those whose outputs cluster. A cluster causes the higher capsule to output a high probability of observation that an entity is present and also output a high-dimensional (20-50+) pose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Higher-level capsules ignore outliers, concentrating on clusters. This is similar to the [[Hough transform]], the [[Randomized Hough Transform|RHT]] and [[RANSAC]] from classic [[digital image processing]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==  Routing by agreement ==
The outputs from one capsule (child) are routed to capsules in the next layer (parent) according to the child's ability to predict the parents' outputs. Over the course of a few iterations, each parents' outputs may converge with the predictions of some children and diverge from those of others, meaning that that parent is present or absent from the scene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For each possible parent, each child computes a prediction vector by multiplying its output by a weight matrix (trained by [[backpropagation]]).&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Next the output of the parent is computed as the [[Dot product|scalar product]] of a prediction with a coefficient representing the probability that this child belongs to that parent. A child whose predictions are relatively close to the resulting output successively increases the coefficient between that parent and child and decreases it for parents that it matches less well. This increases the contribution that that child makes to that parent, thus increasing the scalar product of the capsule’s prediction with the parent’s output. After a few iterations, the coefficients strongly connect a parent to its most likely children, indicating that the presence of the children imply the presence of the parent in the scene.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The more children whose predictions are close to a parent's output, the more quickly the coefficients grow, driving convergence. The pose of the parent (reflected in its output) progressively becomes compatible with that of its children.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

The coefficients' initial logits are the log prior probabilities that a child belongs to a parent. The priors can be trained discriminatively along with the weights. The priors depend on the location and type of the child and parent capsules, but not on the current input. At each iteration, the coefficients are adjusted via a "routing" [[Softmax function|softmax]] so that they continue to sum to 1 (to express the probability that a given capsule is the parent of a given child.) Softmax amplifies larger values and diminishes smaller values beyond their proportion of the total. Similarly, the probability that a feature is present in the input is exaggerated by a nonlinear "squashing" function that reduces values (smaller ones drastically and larger ones such that they are less than 1).&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

This dynamic routing mechanism provides the necessary deprecation of alternatives ("explaining away") that is needed for segmenting overlapped objects.

This learned routing of signals has no clear biological equivalent. Some operations can be found in cortical layers, but they do not seem to relate this technique.

=== Math/code ===
The pose vector &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{u}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is rotated and translated by a matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{W}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; into a vector &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}_{j|i}&lt;/math&gt; that predicts the output of the parent capsule.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}_{j|i} = \mathbf{W}_{ij} \mathbf{u}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

Capsules &lt;math display="inline"&gt;s_{j}&lt;/math&gt; in the next higher level are fed the sum of the predictions from all capsules in the lower layer, each with a coupling coefficient &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;s_{j} = \sum{c_{ij} \mathbf{\hat{u}}_{j|i}}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Procedure softmax ====
The coupling coefficients from a capsule &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; to all capsules in layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;l+1&lt;/math&gt; sum to one, and are defined by a "[[Softmax function|routing softmax]]". The initial [[Logit|logits]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are prior [[Log probability|log probabilities]] for the routing. That is the [[prior probability]] that capsule &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; should connect to capsule &lt;math display="inline"&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;l+1&lt;/math&gt;. Normalization of the coupling coefficients:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
1: \mathbf{procedure}~ \mathrm{softmax} ( \mathbf{b}, i ) \\
2: \quad \triangleright \mbox{argument matrix} \\
3: \quad \triangleright \mbox{argument scalar} \\
4: \quad \triangleright \mbox{memorize on}~\mathbf{b} \\
5: \quad \triangleright \mbox{return vector} \\
6: \quad \mathbf{foreach}~\mbox{index}~i,j~\mathbf{do} \\
7: \qquad c_{ij} \leftarrow \frac{e^{b_{ij}}}{\sum_{k}{e^{b_{ik}}}} \\
8: \quad \mathbf{return}~ \mathbf{c}_{i} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

For this procedure to be optimum it would have to memorize several values, and reset those values on each iteration. That is if the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; changes, then the memorized values must be updated. It is not shown how this should be done. Neither memorizing the divisor is shown.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==== Procedure squash ====
Because the length of the vectors represents probabilities they should be between zero (0) and one (1), and to do that a squashing function is applied:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
1: \mathbf{procedure}~ \mathrm{squash} ( \mathbf{a} ) \\
2: \quad \triangleright \mbox{argument vector} \\
2: \quad \triangleright \mbox{return vector} \\
3: \qquad \mathbf{a} \leftarrow \frac{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2}{1+\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \frac{\mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|} \\
4: \quad \mathbf{return}~ \mathbf{a} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

A vector squashed to zero has a vanishing gradient.

==== Procedure routing ====
One approach to routing is the following&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
~~1: \mathbf{procedure}~ \mathrm{routing} ( \mathbf{\hat{u}}_{j|i}, r, l ) \\
~~2: \quad \triangleright \mbox{argument vector} \\
~~3: \quad \triangleright \mbox{argument scalar} \\
~~4: \quad \triangleright \mbox{argument scalar} \\
~~5: \quad \triangleright \mbox{return vector} \\
~~6: \quad \mathbf{foreach}~\mbox{capsule}~i~\mbox{in layer}~l,~\mbox{capsule}~j~\mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~\mathbf{do}~b_{ij} \leftarrow 0 \\
~~7: \quad \mathbf{for}~\mbox{iteration}~r~\mathbf{do} \\
~~8: \qquad \mathbf{foreach}~\mbox{capsule}~i~\mbox{in layer}~l~\mathbf{do}~\mathbf{c}_{i} \leftarrow \operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{b}, i) \\
~~9: \qquad \mathbf{foreach}~\mbox{capsule}~j~\mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~\mathbf{do}~\mathbf{s}_{j} \leftarrow \sum_{i}{c_{ij}\mathbf{\hat{u}}_{j|i}} \\
10: \qquad \mathbf{foreach}~\mbox{capsule}~j~\mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~\mathbf{do}~\mathbf{v}_{j} \leftarrow \operatorname{squash}(\mathbf{s}_{j}) \\
11: \qquad \mathbf{foreach}~\mbox{capsule}~i~\mbox{in layer}~l,~j~\mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~\mathbf{do}~\mathbf{b}_{ij} \leftarrow \mathbf{b}_{ij} + \mathbf{\hat{u}}_{j|i} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{j} \\
12: \quad \mathbf{return}~\mathbf{v}_{j} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

At line 8, the softmax function can be replaced by any type of [[Winner-take-all (computing)|winner-take-all]] network. Biologically this somewhat resembles [[Chandelier cell|chandelier cells]], but they can also be involved in calculation of coupling coefficients (line 9) or calculation of agreements (line 11).

At line 9, the weight matrix for the coupling coefficients and the hidden prediction matrix are shown. The structure in layer I and II is somewhat similar to  the [[cerebral cortex]] if [[stellate cell]]s are assumed to be involved in transposing input vectors. Whether both types of stellate cells have the same function is not clear, as layer I has excitatory spiny cells and layer II has inhibitory aspiny cells. The latter indicates a much different network.

At line 10, the squash function can be replaced by other functions and network topologies that retain the vector direction.

The procedure conducts &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; iterations, usually 4–5, with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; the index for the source capsule layer or primary layer, where the routing goes ''from'', and the capsule layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;l+1&lt;/math&gt; the next higher layer.

== Training ==
Learning is [[Supervised learning|supervised]].&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; The network is trained by minimizing the [[euclidean distance]] between the image and the output of a CNN that reconstructs the input from the output of the terminal capsules.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The network is discriminatively trained, using iterative routing-by-agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The activity vectors of all but the correct parent are masked.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Margin loss ===
The length of the instantiation vector represents the probability that a capsule’s entity is present in the scene. A top-level capsule has a long vector if and only if its associated entity is present. To allow for multiple entities, a separate [[Hinge loss|margin loss]] is computed for each capsule. Downweighting the loss for absent entities stops the learning from shrinking activity vector lengths for all entities. The total loss is the sum of the losses of all entities.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In Hinton's example the loss function is:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_{k} &amp; = \underbrace{T_{k} ~ { \max \left ( 0, m^{+} - \| \mathbf{v}_{k} \| \right )}^{2}}_\mbox{class present}
+ \underbrace{\lambda \left ( 1 - T_{k} \right ) ~ { \max \left ( 0, \| \mathbf{v}_{k} \| - m^{-} \right )}^{2}}_\mbox{class not present}
, &amp; T_{k} = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; \mbox{digit of class}~k~\mbox{present} \\
0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This type of loss function is common in ANNs. The parameters &lt;math display="inline"&gt;m^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;m^{-}&lt;/math&gt; are set so the length does not max out or collapse, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;m^{+} = 0.9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;m^{-} = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;. Down-weighting of initial weights for absent classes are controlled by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lambda = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; as a reasonable choice.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Reconstruction loss ===
An additional reconstruction loss encourages entities to encode their inputs' instantiation parameters. The final activity vector is then used to reconstruct the input image via a CNN decoder consisting of 3 fully connected layers. The reconstruction minimizes the sum of squared differences between the outputs of the logistic units and the pixel intensities. This reconstruction loss is scaled down by 0.0005 so that it does not dominate the margin loss during training.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==  Example configuration ==&lt;!-- Article states that there are 256 x 81 activations. That seems to be wrong. Isn't it 256 x 20 x 20? And the weight matrix. Isn't it [32x6x6] x 10 instead of 8x16? --&gt;

The first convolutional layers perform feature extraction. For the 28x28 pixel MNIST image test an initial 256 9x9 [[pixel]] convolutional [[Kernel (statistics)|kernels]] (using stride 1 and [[Rectifier (neural networks)|rectified linear unit]]&amp;nbsp;(ReLU) activation, defining 20x20 [[Receptive field|receptive fields]]) convert the pixel input into 1D feature activations and induce nonlinearity.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The primary (lowest) capsule layer divides the 256 kernels into 32 capsules of 8 9x9 kernels each (using stride 2, defining 6x6 receptive fields). Capsule activations effectively invert the graphics rendering process, going from pixels to features. A single weight matrix is used by each capsule across all receptive fields. Each primary capsule sees all of the lower-layer outputs whose fields overlap with the center of the field in the primary layer. Each primary capsule output (for a particular field) is an 8-dimensional vector.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

A second, digit capsule layer has one 16-dimensional capsule for each digit (0-9). Dynamic routing connects (only) primary and digit capsule layers. A [32x6x6] x 10 weight matrix controls the mapping between layers.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Capsnets are hierarchical, in that each lower-level capsule contributes significantly to only one higher-level capsule.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

However, replicating learned knowledge remains valuable. To achieve this, a capsnet's lower layers are [[Convolution|convolutional]], including hidden capsule layers. Higher layers thus cover larger regions, while retaining information about the precise position of each object within the region. For low level capsules, location information is “place-coded” according to which capsule is active. Higher up, more and more of the positional information is [[Neural coding|rate-coded]] in the capsule's output vector. This shift from place-coding to rate-coding, combined with the fact that higher-level capsules represent more complex objects with more degrees of freedom, suggests that capsule dimensionality increases with level.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Human vision ==
Human vision examines a sequence of focal points (directed by [[Saccade|saccades]]), processing only a fraction of the scene at its highest resolution. Capsnets build on inspirations from [[Cortical minicolumn|cortical minicolumns]] (also called cortical microcolumns) in the [[cerebral cortex]]. A minicolumn is a structure containing 80-120 neurons, with a diameter of about 28-40 µm, spanning all layers in the cerebral cortex. All neurons in the larger minicolumns have the same [[receptive field]], and they output their activations as [[Action potential|action potentials]] or spikes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Neurons within the microcolumn receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected and may constitute a fundamental computational unit of the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~ccruz/micros/research.html|title=Microcolumns in the Brain|website=www.physics.drexel.edu|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capsnets explore the intuition that the human visual system creates a [[Parse tree|tree]]-like structure for each focal point and coordinates these trees to recognize objects. However, with capsnets each tree is "carved" from a fixed network (by adjusting coefficients) rather than assembled on the fly.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Alternatives ==
CapsNets are claimed to have four major conceptual advantages over [[Convolutional neural network|convolutional neural networks]] (CNN):
* Viewpoint invariance: the use of pose matrices allows capsule networks to recognize objects regardless of the perspective from which they are viewed.
* Fewer parameters: Because capsules group neurons, the connections between layers require fewer parameters.
* Better generalization to new viewpoints: CNNs, when trained to understand rotations, often learn that an object can be viewed similarly from several different rotations. However, capsule networks generalize better to new viewpoints because pose matrices can capture these characteristics as linear transformations.
* Defense against white-box adversarial attacks: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) is a typical method for attacking CNNs. It evaluates the gradient of each pixel against the loss of the network, and changes each pixel by at most epsilon (the error term) to maximize the loss. Although this method can drop the accuracy of CNNs dramatically (e.g: to below 20%), capsule networks maintain accuracy above 70%.

Purely convolutional nets cannot generalize to unlearned viewpoints (other than translation). For other [[affine transformation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, either feature detectors must be repeated on a grid that grows exponentially with the number of transformation dimensions, or the size of the labelled training set must (exponentially) expand to encompass those viewpoints. These exponential explosions make them unsuitable for larger problems.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Capsnet's transformation matrices learn the (viewpoint independent) spatial relationship between a part and a whole, allowing the latter to be recognized based on such relationships. However, capsnets assume that each location displays at most one instance of a capsule's object. This assumption allows a capsule to use a distributed representation (its activity vector) of an object to represent that object at that location.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Capsnets use neural activities that vary with viewpoint. They do not have to normalize objects (as in [[spatial transformer networks]]) and can even recognize multiply transformed objects. Capsnets can also process segmented objects.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">'''Coisogenic strains''' are one type of [[inbred strain]] that differs by a mutation at a single [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] and all of the other loci are identical.  There are numerous ways to create an inbred strain and each of these strains are unique.  [[Genetically modified mouse|Genetically engineered mice]] can be considered a coisogenic strain if the only difference between the engineered mouse and a wild-type mouse is a specific locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bult|first1=CJ|last2=Eppig|first2=JT|last3=Blake|first3=JA|last4=Kadin|first4=JA|last5=Richardson|first5=JE|last6=Mouse Genome Database|first6=Group.|title=Mouse genome database 2016.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=4 January 2016|volume=44|issue=D1|pages=D840-7|pmid=26578600|pmc=4702860}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice|title=MGI-Guidelines for Nomenclature of Mouse and Rat Strains: Coisogenic|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/strains.shtml#coisogenic|publisher=Mouse Genome Informatics website, The Jackson Laboratory|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coisogenic strains can be used to investigate the gene function of a certain locus.

Coisogenic strains can be induced chemically or through radiation however, other types of alterations within the genome may also occur.  Coisogenic strains may also occur through a spontaneous mutation that occurs in an inbred strain.&lt;ref name=Gondo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conn|first1=P.

Mouse Models for Human Diseases by Forward and Reverse Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To create a coisogenic strain through breeding, a mouse with the specific mutation on a locus is mated to an inbred strain (e.g., [[C57BL/6]]J) mouse.

The offspring of the mutated mouse with the inbred strain has a 50% chance of [[Heredity|carrying the mutation]].  From this, the offspring with the mutation can be mated to a heterozygous carrier which then creates offspring with 75% of the genetic background.  This [[backcrossing]] is then continued until more than 99% is genetic background and the mutated locus is inherited.&lt;ref name=Gondo/&gt;  However, if the specific mutation cannot be passed on, heterozygous animals should be used to breed with the original inbred strain. Full-sib mating are used to maintain coisogenic strains if the specific gene locus is homozygous. However, a regular backcrossing of these coisogenic strains with their standard parental strain is preferred in order to avoid subline divergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Research Council; Institute for Laboratory Animal Research; Commission on Life Sciences; Committee on Rodents|title=Rodents|publisher=The National Academies Press|page=23ff|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/2119/chapter/4#23|chapter=3.

'''Luis Andrés Colmenares Escobar''' (May 23, 1990 in [[Villanueva, La Guajira|Villanueva (La Guajira)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.co/en-rioacha-pidieron-justicia-para-luis-colmenares,73d566d2bb4d5310VgnVCM20000099f154d0RCRD.html|title=En Rioacha pidieron justicia para Luis Colmenares|date=March 2, 2012|publisher=[[Terra Networks]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia - October 31, 2010 in [[Bogotá D.C.]], Colombia) was an [[economics]] and [[industrial engineering]] major student at [[Los Andes University (Colombia)|Los Andes University]] in Bogotá D.C., Colombia, who was found dead under suspicious circumstances on October 31, 2010, after going to a [[Halloween]] party at a club in the popular "[[Zona Rosa de Bogotá|Zona Rosa]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/misteriosa-noche-halloween/166564-3.aspx |title=La misteriosa noche de Halloween, Articulo Impreso Archivado |publisher=Semana.com |date=March 11, 2012 |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial investigations explained Luis Andres' death as a result of a [[suicide]], but almost a year later [[prosecutor]]s found enough [[evidence]] to consider that Colmenares did not commit suicide, but rather was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/83125188/Acusacion-RCN-sin-direcciones |title=Acusación RCN sin direcciones |publisher=Scribd.com |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months after Luis' death, the investigation was re-opened and suspects were named in the case. The prosecutor in this case was removed in a controversial decision by [[Office of the Attorney General of Colombia|Colombia's Attorney General]] in May 2012 after constant complaints by counselor for the defense. In June 2012, Carlos Cárdenas was charged with Luis Colmenares' murder and detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citytv.com.co/videos/798436/captura-de-carlos-cardenas-por-caso-colmenares |title=Captura de Carlos Cárdenas por caso Colmenares  - Citytv.com.co |website=www.citytv.com.co |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607004501/http://www.citytv.com.co/videos/798436/captura-de-carlos-cardenas-por-caso-colmenares |archivedate=June 7, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
On October 30, 2010, Luis Andrés went to a Halloween [[costume party]] at a night club in the popular [[Zona Rosa de Bogotá|Zona Rosa]] in Bogotá with his date, Laura Moreno, as well as Jessi Quintero, and several other friends and classmates.

According to Moreno and Quintero, they left the party around 3:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time on October 31, 2010. Luis was allegedly very anxious and he went out walked away. Jessi and Laura said they followed him and that Luis claimed he was feeling hungry, so the three of them went to eat while the rest of the group got Laura's [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] from the parking lot. Moreno and Quintero later told law enforcement that, after buying a hot dog, all of a sudden and without any explanation, Colmenares started to run "like crazy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=por KIEN&amp;KE |url=http://www.kienyke.com/2012/02/27/la-maquina-que-declaro-inocente-a-laura-moreno/?fb_comment_id=fbc_10150832107297576_25261951_10150833990157576#f2fd58ebc |title=La confesión de Laura sobre la muerte de su novio |publisher=kienyke.com |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; towards El Virrey park, which was about 10 minutes walking distance from the hot dog stand. Jessi allegedly stayed at the hot dog stand waiting for her friends while Laura followed Luis. According to Laura, after she tried to stop him several times, Luis jumped into a drain located at El Virrey park. Jessi said that she was picked up by a group of friends, called Luis Andres' cell phone and Laura answered the call. She explained that Laura was frantic and told her that Luis jumped in the water channel (which was less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm deep) and that she was unable to see him anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/bogota/caso-de-luis-andrs-colmenares_11022019-4 |title=Caso de Luis Andrés Colmenares - Noticias de Bogotá - Colombia |publisher=Eltiempo.Com |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Supposedly, the group of friends met Laura at the park and started looking for Luis. After a couple of hours of not finding him, they sought police help at a station nearby. They also alerted Luis' family and a formal search began.

Oneida Escobar, mother of Luis Andrés, went to the park to look for her son at 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. after Laura and Jessi called Luis' brother. She initially started looking in hospitals and police stations. In the meantime, the police and firemen were conducting an exhaustive search around the area without any results. Around 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 31, 2010, Oneida Escobar begged the firemen and police officer to look again under the drift where, according to Moreno, Colmenares jumped. After finding nothing, the firemen retired. Another call was received around 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. and when the firemen returned to search again, they found the dead body of Colmenares about 400&amp;nbsp;feet away from where Moreno said Luis had jumped. The body was taken to the Colombian National Legal Medicine Institute for further evaluation. The result of the first autopsy, showed Colmenares had a grade&amp;nbsp;3 of [[alcohol intoxication]], which should have impaired him heavily, and confirmed the hypothesis of a suicide. Under this concept, the case was closed.

The authorities originally ruled Luis Andres' death as a suicide. However, the Colmenares family never accepted that theory. According to the autopsy performed at Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses, by Leslie del Pilar Rodríguez, Luis Colmenares suffered a violent death. A second autopsy by Máximo Duque, former director of the same Institute, hired by the Colmenares family and research done by Prosecutor Antonio González concluded that the body had eight wounds, none compatible with a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.co/nacional/fiscalia-encontro-60-inquietudes-en-necropsia-de-uniandino,c4c5690e0a723310VgnVCM20000099f154d0RCRD.html|title=Fiscalía encontró 60 'inquietudes' en necropsia de uniandino|website=Terra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
In September 2011, the case prosecutor and authorities have dismissed the suicide thesis, presented by Laura Moreno and her lawyers, that claimed that Colmenares ran into the water channel and thrown himself into it.

In October 2011, Laura Moreno and Jessi Quintero were arrested, accused of [[perjury]] and covering a crime. According to the prosecutors' office there is "strong evidence" that allow them to infer that these two young women participated in the murder of Luis Andrés Colmenares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harold Abueta C. |url=http://www.kienyke.com/2011/10/07/luis-%C2%BFel-estudiante-que-mataron-sus-companeros/ |title=Luis, ¿el estudiante que mataron sus compañeros? |publisher=kienyke.com |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, 2012, Antonio González, main prosecutor, was removed from the case by Eduardo Montealegre, General Attorney, after frequent clashes with Jaime Granados, defense attorney of Laura Moreno, and substituted by Martha Lucía Zamora. González stated he had full confidence in Zamora's abilities to win the case, that he was proud of delivering a case already in trial while it was almost closed when he received and said he will keep silence about some aspects of the trial because of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latarde.com/colombia/91-notas-nacionales/61311-asignan-nuevo-fiscal-en-el-caso-colmenares.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807015511/http://www.latarde.com/colombia/91-notas-nacionales/61311-asignan-nuevo-fiscal-en-el-caso-colmenares.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-08-07|title=Noticias de Pereira, Risaralda y Colombia - LaTarde.com|website=www.latarde.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 6, 2012, the prosecution stated that a witness of the events, Wilmer Ayola, came forward, claiming that the night of the events he saw a truck stopping in front of the park where the water channel is located. According to the witness, Luis Colmenares walked away from the truck and Laura Moreno ran after him and slapped Colmenares in the face. Carlos Cárdenas exited the truck and hit Colmenares in the head with a bottle and then Cárdenas and a group of friends kicked the victim while on the ground. After failed efforts by the group to reanimate Colmenares, they carried away the body in the truck. Ayola claimed he came forward because he had been threatened. He also explained that he was afraid because a partner that was with him that night, whom he identified only by the name of Cristian, had disappeared. Ayola added that Cárdenas offered one million [[Colombian peso|pesos]] (approximately $500) to Cristian in exchange for their silence and that he received part of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/judicial/articulo-354651-wilmer-ayola-ratifica-su-testimonio|title=Wílmer Ayola ratifica su testimonio|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day Carlos Cárdenas was detained on charges of aggravated homicide. He claimed it was a false accusation and that there were people interested in damaging his reputation and the well being of his family. The prosecutors stated in the trial files that they had intercepted conversations between Cárdenas and Laura Moreno about his family having an "important contact" in the General Attorney's Office so she should keep her calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafm.com.co/noticias/colombia/06-06-12/fue-capturado-carlos-cardenas--11|title=Fue capturado Carlos Cárdenas por caso Colmenares {{!}} LA F.m.|website=www.lafm.com.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mother of Carlos Cárdenas, María del Pilar Gómez, hired a lawyer, Aidé Acevedo, to press Armando Novoa, Director of the National Prosecution Office, into changing the prosecutor in charge of the case. Both are indicted with obstruction of justice. The prosecution intercepted cell phone calls between both women talking about the best way to change the course of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/capturado-carlos-cardenas-exnovio-de-laura-moreno_11924930-4|title=Capturado Carlos Cárdenas, exnovio de Laura Moreno - Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 - eltiempo.com|website=eltiempo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2012, Daniel Teleki, attorney for Jessi Quintero, renounced after claiming he and his family had been threatened on social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-353051-amenazas-renuncio-el-abogado-de-jessy-quintero-caso-colmenares|title=Por amenazas, renunció el abogado de Jessy Quintero en caso Colmenares|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2012, the prosecutor explained that Cristian, the other witness identified by Wilmer Ayola, had been located and that he was looking for protection from the police. Cristian said he had taken pictures of Moreno's truck taken with his cellphone the night of the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-354556-aparecio-el-otro-testigo-clave-el-caso-colmenares|title=Apareció el otro "testigo clave" en el caso Colmenares|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Cárdenas and Morenos' lawyer, Jaime Granados, came forward explaining that Ayola worked as security guard in a building complex far from the site of the events and that records proved he was working there that night. He accused Ayola of perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/judicial/articulo-354385-jaime-granados-sabiamos-wilmer-ayola-mentia|title=Jaime Granados: "Sabíamos que Wílmer Ayola mentía"|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview, the following day, Ayola explained that he had escaped his working place and that he signed the records after returning to work at 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. claiming he had proof of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/video-354555-testigo-caso-colmenares-dice-probara-estuvo-el-lugar|title=Testigo en caso Colmenares dice que probará que estuvo en el lugar|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt; That very same day, on June 20, 2012, the former General Attorney of Colombia, [[Mario Iguarán]] was hired by Cárdenas family as defense lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-354378-mario-iguaran-acepto-defender-carlos-cardenas-el-caso-colmenares|title=Mario Iguarán aceptó defender a Carlos Cárdenas por el caso Colmenares|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2012, the current General Attorney, [[Eduardo Montealegre]] stated that the initial prosecutor, Antonio González, expelled from the case after pressure from defense lawyers, and other auxiliary attorneys involved in the case, had to be protected from an assassination attempt detected by the CTI (Research Technical Corp or ''Cuerpo Técnico de Investigaciones'') and that his security scheme had been reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-355967-frustran-presunto-plan-atentar-contra-el-fiscal-del-caso-colmena|title=Frustran presunto plan para atentar contra el fiscal del caso Colmenares|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same day, Jaime Granados, defense lawyer for Cárdenas, denounced penally González for retiring blood samples taken from Colmenares body, but offered no explanations about the motives of the attorney. González stated that this was a regular procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-355981-defensa-de-laura-moreno-denuncio-al-fiscal-del-caso-colmenares|title=Defensa de Laura Moreno denunció al fiscal del caso Colmenares|website=ElEspectador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meat thermometer.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[meat thermometer]]]]

'''Doneness''' is a gauge of how thoroughly cooked a cut of meat is based on the colour, juiciness and internal temperature when cooked. The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to [[beef]] (especially [[steak]] and roasts) but are also applicable to [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[pork]], [[poultry]], [[veal]] and [[seafood]] (especially [[fish]]).

Gradations, their description, and the associated temperature ranges vary regionally from cuisine to cuisine and in local practice and terminology. For steaks, common gradations include ''rare'', ''medium rare'', ''medium'', ''medium well'' and ''well done''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iabeef.org/degreesofdoneness.aspx |title=Degrees of Doneness |publisher=Iowa Beef Industry Council |accessdate=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324025715/http://www.iabeef.org/degreesofdoneness.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internal Color and Tenderness of the Infraspinatus, Longissimus Thoracis, and Semimembranosus are Affected by Cooking Method and Degree of Doneness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsM_ovfRjw8C&amp;pg=PA2|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-96484-1|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature==
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] recommends an internal temperature of at least {{convert|145|°F|°C|abbr=on}} for cuts of beef, veal, and lamb in order to prevent [[foodborne illness]], and warns that color and texture indicators are not reliable.&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{cite web| title = Beef from Farm to Table  | publisher = ''[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'', Food Safety and Information Service| date = February 2003 | url = http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/c33b69fe-7041-4f50-9dd0-d098f11d1f13/Beef_from_Farm_to_Table.pdf?MOD=AJPERES | accessdate = 2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same meats should be thoroughly cooked to {{convert|160|°F|°C|abbr=on}} when ground or tenderized by cutting, since these processes distribute bacteria throughout the meat.

The interior of a cut of meat will still increase in temperature 3–5&amp;nbsp;°C (5–10&amp;nbsp;°F) after it is removed from an oven or other heat source. The meat should be allowed to "rest" for a suitable amount of time (depending on the size of the cut or steak) before being served, which makes the meat easier to carve and its structure firmer and more resistant to deformation; its water-holding capacity also increases and less liquid is lost from the meat during carving.&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|author-link=Harold McGee|title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|lccn=2004058999|oclc=56590708}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=165}} The whole meat and the center will also continue to cook slightly as the hot exterior continues to warm the comparatively cooler interior. The exception is if the meat has been prepared in a [[sous-vide]] process, as it will already be at temperature equilibrium.
The temperatures indicated above are the peak temperature in the cooking process, so the meat should be removed from the heat source a few degrees cooler.

{{details|Myoglobin#Meat color}}

As meat is cooked, it turns from red to pink to gray to brown to black (if burnt), and the amount of red liquid, [[myoglobin]] (not blood), and other juices decreases. The color change is due to changes in the oxidation of the [[iron]] atom of the [[heme]] group in the myoglobin protein: raw meat is red due to myoglobin protein in the muscles, not [[hemoglobin]] from blood (which also contains a heme group, hence the color).
Prior to cooking, the iron atom is in a +2 oxidation state, and bound to a [[dioxygen]] molecule (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a red color. As cooking proceeds, it loses an electron, moving to a +3 oxidation state, and coordinating with a water molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), turning brown in the process.

[[Searing]] raises the meat’s surface temperature to {{convert|150|C}}, yielding [[Browning (partial cooking)|browning]] via different reactions: [[caramelization]] of sugars, and the [[Maillard reaction]] of amino acids. Raised to a high enough temperature, meat blackens from [[burning]].

== Drying ==
Well done cuts, in addition to being brown, are drier and contain few or no juices.  Note that [[searing]] (cooking the exterior at a high temperature) in no way "[[Searing#Sealing in the juices|seals in the juices]]" – water evaporates at the same or higher rates as unseared meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Oga Janáčková 2509.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Portrait of Olga Janáčková. The title page of the manuscript of the composition bore the dedication ''"Mé Olze na památku"'' [In the memory of my Olga].&lt;ref name="Simeone130-131"&gt;[[#Simeone|Simeone (ed., 1997)]], p. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Elegy on the Death of Daughter Olga, JW 4/30''''' (also translated as the '''''Elegy on the Death of My Daughter Olga'''''; in [[Czech language|Czech]]: '''''Elegie na smrt dcery Olgy''''') is a [[cantata]] for [[tenor]] solo, [[mixed choir]] and [[pianoforte]], written by the [[Czechs|Czech]] composer [[Leoš Janáček]] in 1903. It was written to commemorate the death of composer's daughter, Olga Janáčková.&lt;ref name="Simeone130-131"/&gt; Janáček composed the piece to the text of the Russian teacher Marfa Nikolayevna Veveritsa.&lt;ref name="Simeone130-131"/&gt;

== Background ==
Olga was the first-born child of Leoš and Zdenka Janáček. She was born on 15 August 1882 in [[Brno]].&lt;ref name="HelfertVI"&gt;[[#Helfert|Helfert (2006)]], p. VI&lt;/ref&gt; From her childhood, she showed remarkable talent in various arts, though
not in music (to the mild disappointment of her father). Her mother later recalled that "[Olga] ''grew up into a lovely girl. Her skin was delicate and smooth with a peach-bloom to it; like her father, she had a dimple in her chin."''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Helfert|Helfert (2006)]], p. II ''(Ale hned od malička měla po tátovi tvrdou hlavičku.)'' {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadly, her health was poor from an early age, and her physical state brought a lot of anxiety to her parents. At the age of six, she fell ill with inflammation of joints. She recovered, however, the illness negatively affected the functioning of the heart. The situation worsened after her younger brother Vladimír died in November, 1890. Olga remained the only child of her parents, and also the only bond connecting the members of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Helfert|Helfert (2006)]], p. II ''(Od té doby byla Olgy jediná, která tvořila pouto rodiny Janáčkovy.)'' {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leoš Janáček and his daughter, both keen admirers and supporters of Russian culture, were members of the Russian Circle in Brno. In March, 1902, the composer accompanied Olga to [[Saint Petersburg]], in order to deepen her knowledge of Russian language and to let her become familiar with Russian life and society.&lt;ref name="HelfertVI"/&gt; His brother František worked there as a teacher. A month later, Olga fell ill with [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name="HelfertVI"/&gt; Her health deteriorated rapidly, and she was forced to return to Brno in July of the same year. After her return, she spent some time in [[Hukvaldy]] in order to recuperate; however, her illness reappeared with new and worse complications. After months of suffering, Olga Janáčková died on 26 February 1903.&lt;ref name="Simeone130-131"/&gt; 

Her parents were completely devastated. Janáček, raving with pain and despair, tore at his hair and cried: ''"My soul, my soul!"''. Zdenka later remembered their loneliness and despair in her memories: ''"We stayed in our dining room alone. Abandoned, silent. I looked at Leoš. He sat in front of me, destroyed, thin, grey-haired."''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Helfert|Helfert (2006)]], p. II ''(Zůstali jsme v jídelně sami dva. Opuštění, nemluvní. Zadívala jsem se na Leoše. Seděl přede mnou zničený, zhublý, prošedivělý.)'' {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janáček dedicated two of his works to his daughter.&lt;ref name="Ort48"&gt;[[#Ort|Ort (2005)]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; He inscribed the first published piano reduction of the opera ''[[Jenůfa]]'', his first masterwork and the composition which later opened him the way to the world opera stages, ''"To the memory of Olga Janáčková"''.&lt;ref name="HelfertVII"&gt;[[#Helfert|Helfert (2006)]], p. VII&lt;/ref&gt;

The second work, the ''Elegy'', was inspired by their common love of Russian culture. It was composed to original Russian verses written by Marfa Veveritsa, a member of the Russian Circle and a friend of Olga. The composition was completed on 28 April 1903, however, Janáček later (in March, 1904) altered some parts of it. The ''Elegy'' was apparently composed directly to the Russian original, and it was translated later by B. Zavadil. It was premiered after Janáček's death, on 20 December 1930, in the Brno Radio. The manuscript of the composition was not preserved. The duration of the work is approximately 6 minutes.&lt;ref name="Simeone130-131"/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Egerton''' (née '''Cavendish'''), countess of Bridgewater (1626 &amp;ndash; 14 July 1663), was an English writer&lt;ref&gt;*Travitsky, Betty S. "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/68253 Egerton , Elizabeth, countess of Bridgewater (1626–1663)]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2004. 4 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Egerton family]].

==Biography==
She was encouraged in her literary interests from a young age by her father, [[William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle]], himself an author and patron of the arts surrounded by a literary coterie which included [[Ben Jonson]], [[Thomas Shadwell]], and [[John Dryden]]. Her works consist of a series of manuscripts, some few of which have recently become available in modern editions.

She married [[John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater|John Egerton]] (Lord Brackley) in 1641, when she was fifteen. Her mother, Elizabeth Bassett, died in 1643, and her father was later remarried to noted writer [[Margaret Cavendish]]. William Cavendish and his sons relocated to France during the English Civil War, while Egerton and her sisters [[Jane Cavendish|Jane]] and Frances remained at the besieged family seat in Nottinghamshire until 1645 when she relocated to her husband's home where she was relatively sheltered from the rest of the war. Egerton's earliest manuscript compilation (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. poet. 16; Yale University, Beinecke Library, Osborn MS b. 233), an anthology of poems and dramas, ''Poems Songs a Pastorall and a Play by the Right Honorable the Lady Jane Cavendish and Lady Elizabeth Brackley'', co-written with her sister, dates from this period. ''The Concealed Fansyes'', the play of the title, "features two heroines who hold out for and get 'equall marryage,' having trained the gallants, Courtley and Praesumption, who were intending to train them."&lt;ref&gt;Blain et al. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Egerton's final manuscript collection, known as the "Loose Papers," is made up of prayers, meditations, and essays, some written in response to the illness and death of her children (four survived to adulthood), and to pregnancy and childbirth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O Lord, I knowe thou mightest have smothered this my Babe in the wombe, but thou art ever mercyfull, and hast at this time brought us both from greate dangers, and me from the greate torture of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;BL MS Egerton 607, f.30. Cit. Greer et al. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elizabeth Egerton died delivering her tenth child and was buried at Ashridge, Hertfordshire. Her manuscripts are held at the Nottingham University Library, Portland collection (letters); the Bodleian and Beinecke libraries (''Poems Songs'' &amp;c.); and the British and Huntington Libraries (her "Loose Papers"). Her essays on marriage and widowhood "open a highly unusual window on the thinking of a seventeenth-century woman."&lt;ref&gt;Travitsky, ''[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/68253 OED]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fire and Rain''''' is a 1989 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[disaster film]] directed by [[Jerry Jameson|Jerry J. Jameson]], starring [[Charles Haid]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Tom Bosley]], as well as an [[all-star]] ensemble television cast in supporting roles. It is based on the [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]] [[plane crash]] at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] on August 2, 1985, as depicted in ''Fire and Rain: A Tragedy in American Aviation'' (1986) by Jerome Greer Chandler.

Jerry J. Jameson had become known for his work on "movie-of-the-week phenomenon and group-jeopardy suspense and terror", although he also became a specialist in "one-off" television and film features.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 2009, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;The film was an example of the aviation "disaster" film, as well, it also very much fits the additional [[genre]] of the complex, heavily character-driven [[ensemble cast]] film, exploring the personal dramas and interactions that develop among the passengers and crew as they deal with a deadly onboard emergency. It, however, veers from the traditional format as it is based on a real-life accident.

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=November 2015}} 
On August 2, 1985, Delta Airlines Flight 191, flown by Captain Connors ([[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]) and First Officer Rudy Price ([[Dick Christie]]) is preparing to land at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] on its single stop, flying from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] to [[Los Angeles]]. Air Traffic controllers advise that a thunderstorm is present. The flight crew surmise that the plane might get washed, but have no other worries about the storm being so near. Passengers such as Lucille Jacobson ([[Patti Labelle]]), who is terrified of flying, however, are fearful about landing in a storm. Others, like Marilyn (Gloria Hocking) and Mike Steinberg (Joe Berryman) are thinking more about their California vacation. As the rain pelts down on the plane, there is no warning of an impending crisis.

Without warning, the plane is slammed into the ground, a mile short of the runway, slicing into a small car on the road, killing William Mayberry (Rudy Young), before skidding onto the field and exploding. Within a minute, all airport fire and emergency units are alerted.  Five minutes into the rescue, first responders Jack Ayers ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), Beth Mancini ([[Angie Dickinson]]), led by Bob Sonnamaker ([[Charles Haid]]) are rapidly deployed to the scene. The severed rear section of the plane is where most survivors are found although flight attendants at the front also survive.

==Production==
[[File:Screen shot Fire-and Rain.png|thumb|The film's utilized images of Delta's Lockheed L-1011 fleet, which had the same livery throughout the 28-year span of service with the airline.]]
Filmed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the film was a [[docudrama]] that recreated the events of August 2, 1985, when Delta Airlines Flight 191, a [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar]] airliner flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles was coming into Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on its single stop on the route.  It unexpectedly flew into an isolated thunderstorm hovering very close to the field. The storm created a dangerous "[[wind shear]]", or "[[microburst]]", dashing it into the ground just slightly more than a mile north of the outer perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-05.pdf "Delta Air Lines Flight 191 Crash."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817111801/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-05.pdf |date=2014-08-17 }} ''[[National Transportation Safety Board]]''. Retrieved: December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film incorporated the true-life stories of many of the 152 passengers and 11 crew members on board. In the end, 137 died and 28 survived; one other person on the ground was also killed. The prologue to the film indicated that the crash was one of the worst aircraft mishaps in U.S. history. Up to that time, the circumstances behind it regarding microbursts and wind shears of the kind that brought it down, as well as the kind of thunderstorm that caused them, were unknown. Subsequently, the investigation and review of procedures led to modifications in all big-body civil aircraft whereby their radar could detect the anomalies of major storm systems. At the time, it could only detect the actual presence of the storm itself. A groundbreaking legal action also resulted.&lt;ref name=time&gt;Magnuson, Ed. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050423-2,00.html "Like a Wall of Napalm."] ''Time,'' April 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firefighters and emergency personnel were portrayed by real first responders from the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]]. Some of them had been on duty during the actual rescue following the crash, and were, in effect, portraying themselves.

==Reception==
The crash of Delta Flight 191 was not only the subject of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0097360|Fire and Rain}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured on an episode of ''[[When Weather Changed History]]'' on [[The Weather Channel]],&lt;ref&gt;''When Weather Changed History'' episode {{IMDb title|1307432|Delta 191 Crash}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the episode "Deadly Weather" of ''[[Survival in the Sky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Survival in the Sky'' episode {{IMDb title|1383507|Deadly Weather}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The television series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' (aka ''Air Crash Investigation'' or ''Air Emergency'') on [[Discovery Channel Canada]] and [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] dramatized it in the episode "Invisible Killer" (aka "Slammed to the Ground").&lt;ref name=mayday&gt;"Slammed To The Ground."

A '''Gödel machine''' is a theoretical self-improving [[computer program]] that solves problems in an optimal way.{{clarify|date=June 2017}} It uses a recursive self-improvement protocol in which it rewrites its own code when it can prove the new code provides a better strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Universal Transfer Learning |last=Mahmud |first=M. M. Hassan |pages=16–18 |year=2008 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |isbn=9780549909880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Michael L. |author2=Tim Oates |date=Spring 2007 |title= A review of recent research in metareasoning and metalearning  |journal=[[AI Magazine]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=7 | url = https://vvvvw.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/2025/1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was invented by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (first proposed in 2003&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;), but is named after [[Kurt Gödel]] who inspired the mathematical theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gödel machine|url=http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/G%C3%B6del_machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel machine is often discussed when dealing with issues of [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta-learning]], also known as "learning to learn." Applications include automating human design decisions and transfer of knowledge between multiple related tasks, and may lead to design of more robust and general learning architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schaul|first1=Tom|last2=Schmidhuber|first2=Juergen|title=Metalearning|url=http://scholarpedia.org/article/Metalearning|website=Scholarpedia|accessdate=10 November 2014|pages=4650|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.4650|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though theoretically possible, no full implementation has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22887-2_29#page-2 |title= A Family of Gödel Machine Implementations |accessdate=13 November 2014|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-22887-2_29|pages=275–280|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel machine is often compared with [[Marcus Hutter]]'s [[AIXI]]tl, another formal specification for an [[artificial general intelligence]]. Schmidhuber points out that the Gödel machine could start out by implementing AIXItl as its initial sub-program, and self-modify after it finds proof that another algorithm for its search code will be better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ultimatecognition.pdf|website=Cognitive Computation|accessdate=13 November 2014|pages=177–193|doi=10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Traditional problems solved by a computer only require one input and provide some output. Computers of this sort had their initial algorithm hardwired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ultimatecognition.pdf|website=Cognitive Computation|accessdate=13 November 2014|pages=177–193|doi=10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doesn't take into account the dynamic natural environment, and thus was a goal for the Gödel machine to overcome.

The Gödel machine has limitations of its own, however. Any formal system that encompasses arithmetic is either flawed or allows for unprovable but true statements.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Gödel Machines: Self-Referential ¨ Universal Problem Solvers Making Provably Optimal Self-Improvements|date=December 2006|url=ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/gm6.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence even a Gödel machine with unlimited computational resources must ignore those self-improvements whose effectiveness it cannot prove.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

==Variables of interest==

{{Confusing|Section|date=September 2017}}

There are three variables that are particularly useful in the run time of the Gödel machine.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

* At some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the variable &lt;math&gt;time&lt;/math&gt; will have the binary equivalent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This is incremented steadily throughout the run time of the machine.

* Any [[input (computer science)|input]] meant for the Gödel machine from the natural environment is stored in variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. It is likely the case that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will hold different values for different values of variable &lt;math&gt;time&lt;/math&gt;.

* The outputs of the Gödel machine are stored in variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; would be the output bit-string at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

At any given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(1 \leq t \leq T)&lt;/math&gt;, the goal is to maximize future success or utility. A typical ''utility function'' follows the pattern &lt;math&gt;u(s, Env) : S \times E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;u(s, Env) = E_\mu \Bigg[ \sum_{\tau=time}^T r(\tau) \mid s, Env \Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued reward input (encoded within &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;) at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_\mu [ \cdot \mid \cdot ]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the
conditional expectation operator with respect to some possibly unknown distribution &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; from a
set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of possible distributions (&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; reflects whatever is known about the possibly probabilistic
reactions of the environment), and the above-mentioned &lt;math&gt;time = time(s)&lt;/math&gt; is a function of state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; which uniquely identifies the current cycle &lt;ref name="Gödel Machines."/&gt;. Note that we take into account the possibility of extending the expected lifespan through appropriate actions &lt;ref name="Gödel Machines."/&gt;.

==Instructions used by proof techniques==

{{Confusing|Section|date=September 2017}}

The nature of the six proof-modifying instructions below makes it impossible
to insert an incorrect theorem into proof, thus trivializing proof verification.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

===get-axiom(n)===

Appends the n-th [[axiom]] as a theorem to the current theorem sequence. Below is the initial axiom scheme:

* '''Hardware Axioms''' formally specify how components of the machine could change from one cycle to the next.
* '''Reward Axioms''' define the [[computational cost]] of hardware instruction and the physical cost of output actions. Related Axioms also define the lifetime of the Gödel machine as [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] quantities representing all rewards/costs.
* '''Environment Axioms''' restrict the way new inputs ''x'' are produced from the environment, based on previous sequences of inputs ''y''.
* '''Uncertainty Axioms/String Manipulation Axioms''' are standard axioms for arithmetic, calculus, [[probability theory]], and string manipulation that allow for the construction of proofs related to future variable values within the Gödel machine.
* '''Initial State Axioms''' contain information about how to reconstruct parts or all of the initial state.
* '''Utility Axioms''' describe the overall goal in the form of utility function ''u''.

===apply-rule(k, m, n)===

Takes in the index ''k'' of an inference rule (such as [[Modus tollens]], [[Modus ponens]]), and attempts to apply it to the two previously proved theorems ''m'' and ''n''. The resulting theorem is then added to the proof.

===delete-theorem(m)===

Deletes the theorem stored at index ''m'' in the current proof. This helps to mitigate storage constraints caused by redundant and unnecessary theorems. Deleted theorems can no longer be referenced by the above '''''apply-rule''''' function.

===set-switchprog(m, n)===

Replaces ''switchprog'' ''S&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m:n&lt;/sub&gt;'', provided it is a non-empty [[substring]] of ''S&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;''.

===check()===

Verifies whether the goal of the proof search has been reached. A target theorem states
that given the current axiomatized utility function ''u'' (Item 1f), the utility of a switch from
''p'' to the current switchprog would be higher than the utility of continuing the execution of
''p'' (which would keep searching for alternative switchprogs).&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt; This is demonstrated in the below image:

[[File:Equation2.png|thumb|left|Description of the decoded check() function for the Godel Machine]]

{{clear}}

===state2theorem(m, n)===

Takes in two arguments, ''m'' and ''n'', and attempts to convert the contents of ''S&lt;sub&gt;m:n&lt;/sub&gt;'' into a theorem.

==Example applications==

===Time-limited NP-hard optimization===

The initial input to the Gödel machine is the representation of a
connected graph with a large number of [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] linked by
edges of various lengths. Within given time ''T'' it should find
a [[cycle (graph theory)|cyclic]] path connecting all nodes. The only real-valued
reward will occur at time ''T''. It equals 1 divided by the
length of the best path found so far (0 if none was found).
There are no other inputs. The by-product of maximizing
expected reward is to find the shortest path findable within
the limited time, given the initial bias.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

===Fast theorem proving===

Prove or disprove as quickly as possible that all even integer &gt; 2 are the sum of
two primes ([[Goldbach’s conjecture]]). The reward is 1/''t'', where ''t'' is the time required to produce and verify the first
such proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidhuber|first1=Jürgen|title=Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel|website=Cognitive Computation|pages=177–193|doi=10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximizing expected reward with bounded resources===

A [[cognitive]] robot that needs at least 1 [[liter]] of gasoline per hour interacts with a partially unknown
environment, trying to find hidden, limited gasoline depots to occasionally refuel its tank. It is rewarded in proportion
to its lifetime, and dies after at most 100 years or as soon as its tank is empty or it falls off a cliff, and so on.
The [[probabilistic]] environmental reactions are initially unknown but assumed to be sampled from the axiomatized Speed Prior, according to which hard-to-compute environmental reactions are unlikely. This permits a computable strategy for making near-optimal predictions. One by-product of maximizing expected reward is to maximize expected lifetime.&lt;ref name="Gödel Machines." /&gt;

'''HMS ''Babet''''' was a 20-gun [[sixth-rate]] [[post ship]] of the British [[Royal Navy]]. She had previously been a [[corvette]] of the [[French Navy]] under the name '''''Babet''''', until her [[Action of 23 April 1794|capture in 1794]], during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. She served with the British, capturing several privateers and other vessels, and was at the [[Battle of Groix]]. She disappeared in the Caribbean in 1801, presumably having foundered.

==French career and capture==
''Babet'' was built at [[Le Havre]], one of a two-ship [[French corvette Prompte (1792)|''Prompte'']] class of 20-gun corvettes built to a design by Joseph-Marie-Blaise Coulomb.

In the [[Bay of Biscay]], on 18 May 1793, Captain [[Andrew Snape Douglas]]'s {{HMS|Phaeton|1782|6}} captured her sister, [[French corvette Prompte (1792)|''Prompte'']], which the Royal Navy took into service as HMS ''Prompte''.{{refn|''Prompte'' was launched in November 1782 and captured in May 1793. She served in the Royal Navy until sold in July 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Demerliac (1996), p.79, #509.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Babet'' was laid down in September 1792, fitted out in May 1793 and launched on 12 December 1793.&lt;ref name=Roche/&gt;{{refn|Winfield reports that she was launched on 12 February 1794.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; However, French records indicate that by that time she had already been to sea.|group=Note}}

Her commander from 9 January 1793 to October was ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Rolland. Rolland's replacement on 23 October was ''enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu'' Pierre-Joseph-Paul Belhomme.&lt;ref name=Fonds40&gt;Fonds, Vol. 1, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Actually, the rank was "Lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu", where "non entrentenu" means "not paid", or "without a salary". The rank was that of Lieutenant, but junior to "Lieutenant de vaisseau entretenu". In addition to not being paid, an officer "non entretenu" would wear the uniform and have authority only when on service. There was a fixed number of positions for "entretenus", which required a competitive examination, while there was an unlimited number of "non entretenus", and one could obtain the status by a simple examination or by captaining a merchantman.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Babet''{{'}}s French career was brief. Under Belhomme's command she sailed from Havre to Cherbourg via [[Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue|La Hogue]]. She then cruised the Channel before sailing from Honfleur to Cherbourg, on to [[Brest, France|Brest]], and returning to [[Cancale]].&lt;ref name=Fonds40/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonds, Vol. 1, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; She was part of a squadron consisting of two frigates and another corvette that a British squadron under [[Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet|John Borlase Warren]] engaged off the [[Île de Batz]] in the [[action of 23 April 1794]]. {{HMS|Flora|1780|6}} and {{HMS|Arethusa|1781|6}} captured ''Babet'' and brought her into [[Portsmouth]], arriving on 30 April.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; The action had cost ''Babet'' some 30 to 40 of her crew killed and wounded. ''Flora'' one man killed and three wounded; ''Arethusa'' had three men killed and five wounded.&lt;ref name=LG13646&gt;{{London Gazette|page=378|issue=13646|date=28 April 1794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British career==
''Babet'' was registered for service on 19 June 1794, and was commissioned in December that year under Captain the Honourable John Murray, for service with [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] fleet.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Captain Joshua Mulock replaced Murray in April 1795 while ''Babet'' was being fitted for service at Portsmouth, a process completed on 10 May that year, having cost £2,544.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Captain [[Edward Codrington]] replaced Mulock;&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; ''Babet'' was Codrington's first command after he had made [[post captain]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part 2, p.636.&lt;/ref&gt;

Codrington then sailed ''Babet'' to join [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport's]] fleet. On 23 June 1795 she was with the fleet at the battle of Groix.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; In 1847, the Admiralty awarded any remaining survivors who claimed it, the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "23rd June 1795".

Captain William Lobb replaced Codrington in December 1795 and sailed ''Babet'' to the [[Leeward Islands]] in February the following year.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; There ''Babet'' was present at the capture of [[Demerara]] on 23 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|pages=579–581|issue=13902|date=18 June 1796}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the capture of [[Berbice]] on 2 May 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=594|issue=13903|date=21 June 1796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1796, ''Babet'', ''Prompte'', {{HMS|Scipio|1782|2}} and {{HMS|Pique|1795|2}} captured the ''Catherina Christina'' in July 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15203|page=1172|date=12 November 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point ''Babet'' sailed in company with ''Prompte'' and the two vessels captured the Danish brig ''Eland Fanoe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15169|page=821|date=13 August 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July, ''Scipio'', ''Babet'', ''Pique'' and ''Prompte'' shared in the capture of the ''Ariel'' and the ''Zee Nymphe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15429|page=1404|date=21 November 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September {{HMS|Thorn|1779|2}}, ''Scipio'' and ''Babet'' captured the ''John and Mary''. The first, fourth and fifth-class shares of the prize money were shared, by agreement, with {{HMS|Madras|1795|2}} and ''Prompte''. ''Thorn'' captured the schooner ''Abigail'' on 24 September. This time the first, fourth and fifth-class shares were shared with ''Scipio'', ''Babet'', ''Madras'' and ''Prompte''. Then on 16 November ''Thorn'' and {{HMS|Resource|1778|2}} captured the Spanish schooner ''Del Carmen''. Once again the first, fourth and fifth class shares were shared with ''Scipio'', ''Babet'', ''Madras'' and ''Prompte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15418|pages=1267–1268|date=17 October 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 1797, ''Babet'' and {{HMS|Bellona|1760|2}} drove a small French privateer schooner ashore on Deseada. They tried to use the privateer ''Legere'', of six guns and 48 men, which ''Bellona'' had captured three days earlier, to retrieve the schooner that was on shore. In the effort, both French privateers were destroyed. Then ''Babet'' chased a brig, which had been a prize to the schooner, ashore. The British were unable to get her off so they destroyed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=289|issue=13996|date=25 March 1797}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Babet'' and {{HMS|Bellona|1760|2}} were paid headmoney in 1828, more than 30 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=14829|page=27|date=4 January 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Jemmett Mainwaring took command of ''Babet'' in June 1797. Between 25 July and 5 October '' Babet'' captured three merchant vessels:
*brig ''Decision'' (or ''Decisive'' or ''Maria''),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=528|issue=15140|date=28 May 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 200 tons and eight men, recaptured while sailing from Cape to Puerto Rico in ballast;&lt;ref name=LG14073&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1192|issue=14073|date=12 December 1797}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*brig ''Schylhill'' (probably ''Schuylkill''), of Philadelphia, of 100 tons and eight men, sailing from New York to Puerto Rico with a cargo of flour, supposedly Spanish property;&lt;ref name=LG14073/&gt; and
*barque ''Æolus'', of Copenhagen and of 180 tons and 10 men, sailing from Marseilles to St. Thomas, with a cargo of wine, French property.&lt;ref name=LG14073/&gt;

Then on 16 January 1798 ''Babet{{'}}''s boats captured the French schooner ''Désirée''. The schooner was sailing towards ''Babet'' as ''Babet'' was sailing between Martinique and Dominique. As soon as the schooner realized that ''Babet'' was a British warship she attempted to escape. The wind failed and the schooner then took to her sweeps. Lieutenant Pym of ''Babet'' took 24 men in her pinnace and launch and went after the schooner. After rowing several [[League (unit)|leagues]] the boats closed to within range of their cannon, which they then commenced to fire. The British closed on their quarry despite a strong counter-fire. The British then boarded ''Désirée'' and took her. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. The British lost one man killed and five wounded; the French had three men killed and 15 wounded. ''Désirée'' was six days out of Guadeloupe and had taken one American brig that had been sailing from St. Vincent to Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=295|issue=15005|date=7 April 1798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Babet'' was refitted at Portsmouth between July and December 1798 at a cost of £5,194.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Then, in December she recaptured the American ship ''Helena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=418|issue=15129|date=30 April 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 and 19 January 1799, ''Babet'' captured two French fishing vessels, ''Deux Freres Unis'', with a cargo of herring, and the ''Jacques Charles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=601|issue=15487|date=8 June 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June ''Babet'' was in company with {{HMS|Harpy|1796|2}} when they captured the John.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1455|issue=15758|date=1 December 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 24 June they captured the ship ''Weloverdagt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1466|issue=15759|date=27 November 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then ''Babet'' took part in the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799. There she briefly served as Vice-Admiral [[Andrew Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)|Andrew Mitchell's]] [[flagship]] in the [[Zuider Zee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|pages=995–996|issue=15188|date=28 September 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August 1799, the fleet captured several Dutch hulks and ships in the New Diep, in Holland. ''Babet'' was listed among the vessels qualifying to share in the prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=158|issue=15453|date=13 February 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time this was awarded in February 1802, ''Babet'' had been lost at sea. Similarly, ''Babet'' was also present at the subsequent [[Vlieter Incident]] on 30 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1213|issue=15533|date=16 November 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Babet'' was among the numerous vessels that shared in the proceeds after {{HMS|Dart|1796|2}} cut out the French frigate ''Desirée'' from Dunkirk harbour on 8 July 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1123|issue=15297|date=27 September 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
''Babet'' left Spithead on 14 September 1801, arrived at Fort Royal Bay, Martinique, on 24 October, and sailed the next day for Jamaica. She was not seen again; she had probably foundered at sea during a tropical storm.&lt;ref&gt;Grocott (1997), p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18640">'''Hebbian theory''' is a [[neuroscience|neuroscientific]] theory claiming that an increase in [[synapse|synaptic]] efficacy arises from a [[presynaptic cell]]'s repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain [[synaptic plasticity]], the adaptation of brain [[neuron]]s during the learning process. It was introduced by [[Donald Hebb]] in his 1949 book ''[[The Organization of Behavior]].''&lt;ref name="Hebb 1949"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hebb |first=D.O. |title=The Organization of Behavior |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=1949 |isbn= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is also called '''Hebb's rule''', '''Hebb's postulate''', and '''cell assembly theory'''. Hebb states it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or "trace") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. ... When an [[axon]] of cell ''A'' is near enough to excite a cell ''B'' and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that ''A''{{'}}s efficiency, as one of the cells firing ''B'', is increased.&lt;ref name="Hebb 1949"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory is often summarized as "Cells that fire together wire together."&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegrid Löwel]], Göttingen University; The exact sentence is: "neurons wire together if they fire together" (Löwel, S. and Singer, W. (1992) Science 255 (published January 10, 1992) {{cite news|last=| first= |title=Selection of Intrinsic Horizontal Connections in the Visual Cortex by Correlated Neuronal Activity |year= |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=United States |issn=0036-8075 |pages=209–212 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/255/5041/209.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; This summary, however, should not be taken too literally. Hebb emphasized that cell ''A'' needs to "take part in firing" cell ''B'', and such causality can occur only if cell ''A'' fires just before, not at the same time as, cell ''B''. This important aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]], which requires temporal precedence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Caporale N|author2=Dan Y|title=Spike timing-dependent plasticity: a Hebbian learning rule|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|date=2008|volume=31|pages=25–46|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125639|pmid=18275283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory attempts to explain [[associative learning|associative]] or '''Hebbian learning''', in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in [[synaptic strength]] between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for [[errorless learning]] methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of [[unsupervised learning]].

==Hebbian engrams and cell assembly theory==
Hebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engrams]]. Hebb's theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:&lt;ref name="Hebb 1949"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become 'associated', so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hebb also wrote:&lt;ref name="Hebb 1949"/&gt;{{rp|63}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the [[Soma (biology)|soma]] of the second cell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gordon Allport]] posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly interassociated. That is, each element will tend to turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the elements that do not form part of the pattern. To put it another way, the pattern as a whole will become 'auto-associated'.  We may call a learned (auto-associated) pattern an engram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Allport|first=D.A.|editor=Newman, S.K. |editor2=Epstein R. (Eds.)|authorlink=|chapter=Distributed memory, modular systems and dysphasia|title=Current Perspectives in Dysphasia|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|year=1985|isbn=0-443-03039-1|series=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hebbian theory has been the primary basis for the conventional view that, when analyzed from a [[Holism|holistic]] level, engrams are neuronal nets or [[neural networks]].

Work in the laboratory of [[Eric R. Kandel#Experimental support for Hebbian learning|Eric Kandel]] has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine [[Gastropoda|gastropod]] ''[[Aplysia californica]]''.

Experiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the [[central nervous system]] synapses of [[vertebrate]]s are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple [[peripheral nervous system]] synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long-lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as [[long-term potentiation]]) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study{{which|date=May 2013}} reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms.

==Principles==
From the point of view of [[artificial neuron]]s and [[artificial neural network]]s, Hebb's principle can be described as a method of determining how to alter the weights between model neurons. The weight between two neurons increases if the two neurons activate simultaneously, and reduces if they activate separately. Nodes that tend to be either both positive or both negative at the same time have strong positive weights, while those that tend to be opposite have strong negative weights.

The following is a formulaic description of Hebbian learning: (note that many other descriptions are possible)

:&lt;math&gt;\,w_{ij}=x_ix_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the connection from neuron &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; to neuron &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; the input for neuron &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. Note that this is pattern learning (weights updated after every training example). In a [[Hopfield network]], connections &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; are set to zero if &lt;math&gt;i=j &lt;/math&gt; (no reflexive connections allowed). With binary neurons (activations either 0 or 1), connections would be set to 1 if the connected neurons have the same activation for a pattern.

Another formulaic description is:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij} = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{k=1}^p x_i^k x_j^k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the connection from neuron &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; to neuron &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the number of training patterns, and &lt;math&gt;x_{i}^k&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;th input for neuron &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. This is learning by epoch (weights updated after all the training examples are presented). Again, in a Hopfield network, connections &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; are set to zero if &lt;math&gt;i=j &lt;/math&gt; (no reflexive connections).

A variation of Hebbian learning that takes into account phenomena such as blocking and many other neural learning phenomena is the mathematical model of [[Harry Klopf]].&lt;ref&gt;Klopf, A. H. (1972). [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/742259.pdf Brain function and adaptive systems—A heterostatic theory]. Technical Report AFCRL-72-0164, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, Bedford, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heterostatic theory|Klopf's model]] reproduces a great many biological phenomena, and is also simple to implement.

==Generalization and stability==
Hebb's Rule is often generalized as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_i = \eta x_i y &lt;/math&gt;

or the change in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th synaptic weight &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is equal to a learning rate &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; times the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th input &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; times the postsynaptic response &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Often cited is the case of a linear neuron,

:&lt;math&gt;y = \sum_j w_j x_j &lt;/math&gt;

and the previous section's simplification takes both the learning rate and the input weights to be 1. This version of the rule is clearly unstable, as in any network with a dominant signal the synaptic weights will increase or decrease exponentially. However, it can be shown that for ''any'' neuron model, Hebb's rule is unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnel.ufl.edu/courses/EEL6814/chapter6.pdf |title=Neural and Adaptive Systems: Fundamentals Through Simulations |accessdate=2016-03-16 |last=Euliano |first=Neil R. | date=1999-12-21 |work= Neural and Adaptive Systems: Fundamentals Through Simulations |publisher= Wiley |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225094329/http://www.cnel.ufl.edu/courses/EEL6814/chapter6.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, network models of neurons usually employ other learning theories such as [[BCM theory]], [[Oja's rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/homepage/shouval/Hebb_PCA.ppt |title=The Physics of the Brain |accessdate=2007-11-14 |last=Shouval |first=Harel |date=2005-01-03 |work=The Synaptic basis for Learning and Memory: A theoretical approach |publisher=The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610134104/http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/homepage/shouval/Hebb_PCA.ppt |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Generalized Hebbian Algorithm]].

==Hebbian learning of intrinsic excitability==
Neurons also exhibit plasticity in their intrinsic excitability ([[intrinsic plasticity]]).

==Exceptions==
Despite the common use of Hebbian models for long-term potentiation, there exist several exceptions to Hebb's principles and examples that demonstrate that some aspects of the theory are oversimplified. One of the most well-documented of these exceptions pertains to how synaptic modification may not simply occur only between activated neurons A and B, but to neighboring neurons as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horgan|first=John|title=Neural eavesdropping|journal=Scientific American|date=May 1994|page=16|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0594-16|volume=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to how Hebbian modification depends on [[retrograde signaling]] in order to modify the presynaptic neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzsimonds|first=Reiko|author2=[[Mu-Ming Poo]]|title=Retrograde Signaling in the Development and Modification of Synapses|journal=Psychological Review|date=January 1998|url=http://physrev.physiology.org/content/78/1/143.full|doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound most commonly identified as fulfilling this retrograde transmitter role is [[nitric oxide]], which, due to its high solubility and diffusibility, often exerts effects on nearby neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=López|first=P|author2=C.P. Araujo|title=A computational study of the diffuse neighbourhoods in biological and artificial neural networks |journal= International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence |year=2009 |url=http://www.dis.ulpgc.es/contenido/investigacion/trabajos_publicados/ICNC_2009_PaperCP.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of diffuse synaptic modification, known as volume learning, counters, or at least supplements, the traditional Hebbian model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchison|first=G|author2=N.

Hebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been used in an influential theory of how [[mirror neuron]]s emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keysers C|author2=Perrett DI|title=Demystifying social cognition: a Hebbian perspective|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2004|volume=8|issue=11|pages=501–507|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.09.005|pmid=15491904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keysers, C. (2011). ''The Empathic Brain''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when the individual sees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gallese V|author2=Fadiga L|author3=Fogassi L|author4=Rizzolatti G|title=Action recognition in the premotor cortex|journal=Brain|date=1996|volume=119|issue=Pt 2|pages=593–609|doi=10.1093/brain/119.2.593|pmid=8800951}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hears&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keysers C|author2=Kohler E|author3=Umilta MA|author4=Nanetti L|author5=Fogassi L|author6=Gallese V|title=Audiovisual mirror neurons and action recognition|journal=Exp Brain Res|date=2003|volume=153|issue=4|pages=628–636|doi=10.1007/s00221-003-1603-5|pmid=12937876}}&lt;/ref&gt; another perform a similar action. The discovery of these neurons has been very influential in explaining how individuals make sense of the actions of others, by showing that, when a person perceives the actions of others, the person activates the motor programs which they would use to perform similar actions. The activation of these motor programs then adds information to the perception and helps predict what the person will do next based on the perceiver's own motor program. A challenge has been to explain how individuals come to have neurons that respond both while performing an action and while hearing or seeing another perform similar actions.

[[Christian Keysers]] and David Perrett suggested that as an individual performs a particular action, the individual will see, hear, and feel himself perform the action. These re-afferent sensory signals will trigger activity in neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of the action. Because the activity of these sensory neurons will consistently overlap in time with those of the motor neurons that caused the action, Hebbian learning would predict that the synapses connecting neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of an action and those of the neurons triggering the action should be potentiated. The same is true while people look at themselves in the mirror, hear themselves babble, or are imitated by others. After repeated experience of this re-afference, the synapses connecting the sensory and motor representations of an action would be so strong that the motor neurons would start firing to the sound or the vision of the action, and a mirror neuron would have been created.

Evidence for that perspective comes from many experiments that show that motor programs can be triggered by novel auditory or visual stimuli after repeated pairing of the stimulus with the execution of the motor program (for a review of the evidence, see Giudice et al., 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Del Giudice M|author2=Manera V|author3=Keysers C|title=Programmed to learn? The ontogeny of mirror neurons|journal=Dev Sci|date=2009|volume=12|issue=2|pages=350–363|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For instance, people who have never played the piano do not activate brain regions involved in playing the piano when listening to piano music. Five hours of piano lessons, in which the participant is exposed to the sound of the piano each time he presses a key is proven sufficient to trigger activity in motor regions of the brain upon listening to piano music when heard at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lahav A|author2=Saltzman E|author3=Schlaug G|title=Action representation of sound: audiomotor recognition network while listening to newly acquired actions|journal=J Neurosci|date=2007|volume=27|issue=2|pages=308–314|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4822-06.2007|pmid=17215391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the fact that spike-timing-dependent plasticity occurs only if the presynaptic neuron's firing predicts the post-synaptic neuron's firing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bauer EP|author2=LeDoux JE|author3=Nader K|title=Fear conditioning and LTP in the lateral amygdala are sensitive to the same stimulus contingencies|journal=Nat Neurosci|date=2001|volume=4|issue=7|pages=687–688|doi=10.1038/89465}}&lt;/ref&gt; the link between sensory stimuli and motor programs also only seem to be potentiated if the stimulus is contingent on the motor program.

'''Hilarion Capucci''' (2 March 1922 – 1 January 2017) was a Syrian Catholic bishop who served as the titular [[archbishop]] of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] in the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]. 

==Early years==
He was born in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] to Bashir Capucci (father) and Chafika Rabbath (mother) and was educated at St. Anne's Seminary in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruyter|first1=Walter de|title=Who's Who in the Arab World 2007–2008|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Publitec Publications|isbn=9783110930047|page=232|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=NHCQBAFMwawC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=capougi+whos+who+in+arab+world&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cl_NWAyUyT&amp;sig=4ZRo8gbvzoS969pGYOE_nYDISUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in office, he was an opponent of the Israeli occupation of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and aligned himself with the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] cause.

On 20 July 1947, he was ordained a [[priest]] of the [[Basilian Alepian Order]]. On 30 July 1965, he was appointed archbishop and consecrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bcapucci|Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, B.A.|23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and imprisonment==
On 18 August 1974 he was arrested by security forces of Israel for smuggling weapons into the West Bank in a Mercedes sedan.&lt;ref name="Zile"&gt;{{citation|title=Gun-Running Bishop On Flotilla|date=8 June 2010|url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=7&amp;x_issue=11&amp;x_article=1870|number=2|last1=Zile|first1=Dexter Van|journal=The Camera: Media Report|volume=19|pages=10–11|ISSN=1086-7503}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently convicted by Israeli Martial court of using his [[diplomatic immunity|diplomatic status]] to smuggle arms to the [[Palestine Liberation Army]] and sentenced to 12 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3p2FZ-_0Z70C|title=The rape of Palestine and the struggle for Jerusalem|last=Casper|first=Lionel I.|publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd|year=2003|isbn=978-965-229-297-1|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2009/02/05/israel_impounds_gazabound_ship.html |title=Israel impounds Gaza-bound ship |accessdate=16 June 2017 |author=Steve Weizman |date=5 February 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |via=''[[Toronto Star]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maximos V Hakim|Maximos V]], the patriarch of the Melkite Church, was a vocal critic of Capucci's imprisonment. He was quoted as saying, "Is this Bishop reprehensible if he thought it was his duty to bear arms? If we go back in history we find other bishops who smuggled weapons, gave their lives and committed other illegal actions to save Jews from Nazi occupation. I do not see why a man who is ready to save Arabs should be condemned." Maximos also asserted that Israel had entered [[East Jerusalem]] illegally and against [[United Nations]] resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Corley, "Obituary – Patriarch Maximos," ''The Independent'', 5 July 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capucci was among the prisoners whose release was demanded by Palestinian hijackers of the [[Kfar Yuval hostage crisis]] in 1975,&lt;ref name="RubinRubin2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barry Rubin|author2=Judith Colp Rubin|title=Chronologies of Modern Terrorism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynNsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|date=28 January 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47465-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of German and Palestinian hijackers of [[Air France Flight 139]] (the Entebbe hostage crisis), in 1976.&lt;ref name="Dunstan2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Dunstan|title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&amp;pg=PA17|date=January 2011|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4488-1868-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released two years later, in 1978, due to intervention by the [[Holy See|Vatican]], after having served four years of the 12-years sentence.&lt;ref name="Zile"/&gt;

==Negotiating the 1979 Iran hostage crisis==
[[File:HilarionCapucci1988.jpg|alt=Capucci seated at a table|thumb|Hilarion Capucci (1988)]]
Capucci played a key role during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. He made several visits to the hostages, and in early May 1980 he obtained the release of the bodies of the American soldiers who had died in the refueling accident during the [[Operation Eagle Claw|rescue mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z6QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=921,875341|title=The Montreal Gazette – Google News Archive Search|publisher=News.google.com|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capucci also negotiated an agreement for the release of the hostages, but the plan collapsed because the French press published the story before the agreement had been approved by Iran's Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=trlJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kYQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3537,1492853|title=Youngstown Vindicator – Google News Archive Search|publisher=News.google.com|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the 2003 Iraq War==
An opponent of the [[Iraq War]], Capucci wrote the foreword for the book ''[[Neo-Conned!|Neo-Conned!: Just War Principles a Condemnation of War in Iraq]]'', by  [[John Sharpe (publisher)|John Sharpe]].

==Participation aboard the 2009 Gaza aid ship==
In 2009, Capucci was on a Lebanese ship bound for [[Gaza City|Gaza]] which was seized by Israeli forces when the ship attempted to violate the Israeli naval blockade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1061631.html "Archbishop who ran arms to PLO said aboard seized Gaza aid ship"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206110429/http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1061631.html |date=6 February 2009 }}, ''[[Haaretz]]'', 5 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arabwestreport.info/AWR/search_result_details.php?aweek=7&amp;ayear=2009&amp;a_num= |publisher =[[Arab-West Report]] |title= Archbishop Capucci, the "monk" of the Palestinian issue|date =2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation in the 2010 Gaza flotilla==
In May 2010, Capucci participated in the [[Free Gaza Movement]]'s [[Gaza Freedom Flotilla|aid flotilla]] to the Gaza Strip (see also [[Gaza flotilla raid]]). He was a passenger on {{MV|Mavi Marmara||6}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/world/tension-builds-as-flotilla-approaches-gaza-20100530-wnjb.html?autostart=1|title=Aboard MV Blue Marmara|work=Brisbane Times|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was seized in the early hours of Monday, 31 May, by the [[Israeli Navy]], with nine people killed and many injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/05/20105302134393644.html "Israel moves to stop Gaza aid fleet"], [[Al Jazeera]], 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was held in [[Beersheba]] prison and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=288818|title=Israel to deport former Jerusalem Archbishop on board flotilla|work=Maan News Agency|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a reception for the return of the ''Mavi Marmara'' to Istanbul, he gave a speech to the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9u4Lpcyc-lk|Video, 9;00 min}}. Retrieved 27 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors by Muslim countries==
The governments of [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Sudan]] and [[Syria]] have honored Capucci with postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adc.org/2017/01/in-memoriam-archbishop-hilarion-capucci/|title=ADC {{!}} In Memoriam: Archbishop Hilarion Capucci|last=|first=|date=|website=www.adc.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
On 14 June 2009 he spoke at the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC) convention's annual Palestine Luncheon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington-report.org/digital-issue/3085.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608074059/http://www.washington-report.org/digital-issue/3085.html |date=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 1 January 2017, the Vatican announced that Capucci had died in [[Rome]], aged 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khbrpress.com/post/87345/%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B9%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%8A|title=سفارة فلسطين في الفاتيكان تنعى مطران القد في المنفى "كابوتشي"|work=وكالة خبر الفلسطينية للصحافة|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattan.tv/news/194741.html|title=وفاة الأب الثائ "كابوتشي" عن 94 عاما|work=وكالة وطن للأنباء|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian Burn''' (29 December 1939 – 29 September 1993) was an influential [[Australia]]n [[conceptual art]]ist. He was a notable member of the [[Art and Language]] group that flourished in the 1970s. Ian Burn was also an [[art writing|art writer]], [[curator]], and [[scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n12_v85/ai_20094664 "Ian Burn's Conceptualism"], Art In America, December 1997. Accessed 11/12/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ian Burn was born on 29 December 1939 in [[Geelong]], Australia.

Burn studied art at the [[National School Of Art]] in [[Melbourne]]. He became affiliated with the [[Art and Language]] collective when he moved to [[London]] in 1964 and remained a part of the group when he moved to [[New York City]] in 1967.  In 1977, Burn returned to Australia to teach at [[Sydney University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ian Burn, 53, Artist, Writer, and Founder of an Artists' Union" New York Times 9 October 1993 accessed 11/13/08 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D81039F93AA35753C1A965958260]&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Burn [[drowning|drowned]] on 29 September 1993 while swimming in rough seas at [[Bawley Point]], [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/artists/2181/ ''Centre for Australian Art'',]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Campbell''' (c. 1576{{spaced ndash}}c. 1642) was a Scottish nobleman and knight, who was the son of Archibald Campbell, and Isabella Grant, a daughter of James Grant, laird of Freuchie and Elizabeth Forbes.

[[Angus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg]] sold the lands belonging to the [[Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg|MacDonald's]] on [[Islay]] to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor for 6,000 [[Merk (coin)|merks]] in 1612.  Several young chiefs of Clan MacDonald occupied [[Dunyvaig Castle]] and [[Loch Gorm Castle]] in defiance of Cawdor. Dunyvaig Castle was retaken by Cawdor and Loch Gorm Castle surrendered on 28 January 1615. He purchased the lands on [[Islay]] and [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] which had previously belonged to the [[Clan Maclean|Macleans of Duart]] in 1615.

'''Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg''' (26 June 1760 – 25 March 1799) was an Austrian military commander. He achieved the rank of [[Field Marshal]] and died at the [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Battle of Stockach]].

The third son of a [[cadet branch]] of the House of  [[House of Fürstenberg (Swabia)|Fürstenberg]], at his birth his chances of inheriting the family title of ''[[Fürst]] zu Fürstenberg'' were slight; he was prepared instead for a military career, and a tutor was hired to teach him the [[military science]]s. He entered the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] military in 1777, at the age of seventeen years, and was a member of the field army in the short [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1778–79). His career progressed steadily during the [[Austro-Turkish War (1788–1791)|Habsburg War with the Ottoman Empire]]. In particular he distinguished himself at [[Šabac]] in 1790, when he led his troops in storming the fortress on the [[Sava]] river.

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], he fought with distinction again for the [[First Coalition]], particularly at [[Ketsch]] and [[Battle of Froeschwiller (1793)|Frœschwiller]], and in 1796 at [[Battle of Emmendingen|Emmendingen]], [[Battle of Schliengen|Schliengen]] and [[Siege of Kehl (1796–97)|Kehl]]. He was stationed at key points to protect the movements of the Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German [[Rhineland]] at [[Kehl]], and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at [[Bellheim]]; his troops also overran [[Speyer]] without any losses. By the end of the [[War of the First Coalition]], at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the [[War of the Second Coalition]], he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]] on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a regiment of [[grenadiers]], he was hit by French [[Canister shot|case shot]] and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward.

==Childhood and early military training==
As the third son of a cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was prepared for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and came into contact with important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as ''Kreis-Obristen'', or Colonel of the [[Imperial Circle]], by the time he was ten years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ernst Hermann Joseph Münch. ''Geschichte des Hauses und Landes Fürstenberg''. Aachen: Mayer, 1847, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister [[Count Franz Moritz von Lacy]] and [[Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon]]; he was also invited to dine with [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. He started his service in 1777 as a ''[[Fähnrich]]'' (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Jens-Florian Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].'' [http://www.napoleon-online.de/ Napoleon Online: Portal zu Epoch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000408223833/http://www.napoleon-online.de/ |date=2000-04-08 }}. Markus Stein, editor. Mannheim, Germany. 14 February 2010 version. Accessed 28 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1780, at the age of twenty years, he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]], and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment, also known as the ''Anton Esterházy'', named for [[Paul II Anton Esterházy]], the general of cavalry, [[field marshal]] of the [[Seven Years' War]], and ambassador to Britain. While he was assigned to this unit, he participated in the border conflicts between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Habsburgs, 1787–92, and stormed the fortress at [[Šabac]] (German: ''Schabatz'') on the [[Sava|Sava River]] in Serbia on 27 April 1788. For his action at Šabac, he was personally commended by the Emperor; on the following day, he was promoted to [[major]] and given command of a [[grenadier]] battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Smith. [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/Austria/AustrianGenerals/c_AustrianGeneralsF.html#F37 "Fürstenberg"].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1790, at Laudon's explicit request, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was promoted to [[Major General|major general]]; at the end of June of that year, he received the coveted position of second colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment ''Anton Esterhazy'', where he served as the executive officer for [[Anton (Antal), Fürst Esterházy de Galántha|Antal, Prince Esterházy de Galántha]], the 34th Hungarian Regiment's [[Proprietor (Inhaber)|Colonel and Proprietor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Jens-Florian Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt; This was a customary appointment in which a less prominent officer completed the day-to-day administrative duties of the Colonel and Proprietor, who was usually a noble and was often posted in a different assignment, sometimes a different staff location.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Herold. [http://www.antiquesatoz.com/habsburg/1812/austarmy.htm ''The Austrian Army in 1812''.] In: [http://www.antiquesatoz.com/napoleon/ ''Le Societé Napoléonienne''.] Accessed 31&amp;nbsp;December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg also received the [[Chivalric order|confraternal]] [[Military Order of St. Hubert|Order of Saint Hubert]] from the [[Duke of Bavaria]] and married the "elegant" Princess Elisabeth of [[Thurn und Taxis]] (1767–1822), that year.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, p. 331. Princess Elisabeth of [[Thurn und Taxis]] (Regensburg, 30 November 1767 – 21 July 1822), was the youngest daughter of [[Alexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fight against Revolutionary France==
{{see also|French Revolutionary Wars}}
While Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois class—the [[Estates General (France)|First]] and [[Estates General (France)|Third]] estates—led a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the [[French Revolution]] as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]] succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, [[Marie Antoinette]], and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French ''émigré'' nobles and [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of Prussia, he issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of [[Louis XVI]] and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the [[French National Convention]] declared war on Austria. In the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792–1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Blanning.

===War of the First Coalition===

In the early days of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg remained as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps, approximately 10,000 men, under the overall command of [[Anton (Antal), Fürst Esterházy de Galántha|Anton, Prince Esterházy]]. He was stationed in the [[Breisgau]], a Habsburg territory between the [[Black Forest]] and the [[Rhine]]. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss Cantons]], or north-central Germany. His brigade defended [[Kehl]], a small village immediately across the Rhine from [[Strasbourg]], but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north, in present-day Belgium, near the cities of [[Speyer]] and [[Trier]], and at [[Frankfurt]] on the [[Main River]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second year of the war, Fürstenberg was transferred to the cavalry of [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser]], in the Army of the Upper Rhine, and placed in charge of the advance guard near [[Speyer]], which was still held by the French. On 30 March, he crossed the Rhine by [[Ketsch]] at the head of the advance guard, which included 9,000 men. He took the city of Speyer on 1 April, in the absence of the commander of the city, [[Adam-Philippe de Custine]], who was away with most of his troops; those that remained behind simply abandoned the city. On the following day, Fürstenberg occupied the town of [[Germersheim]]. His first combat action of the war occurred on 3 April, when Custine's infantry attacked him in a bayonet charge near the villages of [[Bellheim]], [[Hördt]] and [[Leimersheim]], and afterward at [[Landau]] and [[Lauterburg]]. During these attacks, he lost all the ground he had gained in the days before. After these events, he was again transferred, this time to the command of the Regiment ''Count von Kavanagh'', where he continued to distinguish himself during the French counter-offensive of October–November 1793. In the action around [[Geudertheim|Geidertheim]], on the [[Zorn River]], he assisted Lieutenant Field Marshal [[Gabriel Anton, Baron Splény de Miháldy]], in repelling a French counter-attack. Shortly afterward, he became very ill and, in December 1793, was sent to the [[Hagenau]] to recover. On 22 December, he rejoined Wurmser's Corps for the [[Battle of Froeschwiller (1793)|Battle of Froeschwiller]] against [[Lazare Hoche]] and [[Charles Pichegru]]. After the French retreated over the Rhine at [[Hüningen]], near [[Basel, Switzerland|Basel]], he directed the construction of its new fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Jens-Florian Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1796, Fürstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions, 13 artillery pieces, and the ''[[Freikorps]]'' (Volunteers) ''Gyulay'' and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and [[Rastatt]]. On 26 June 1796, the French troops of the [[Army of Rhin-et-Moselle|Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle]] crossed the Rhine and chased the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian Circle's military contingent]] out of Kehl. In June 1796, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] added the contingent to Fürstenberg's command, making him the [[Swabia]]n's ''Feldzeugmeister'', or General of Infantry. Fürstenberg's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived, and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the [[Danube|Upper Danube Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith. [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/Austria/AustrianGenerals/c_AustrianGeneralsF.html#F37 "Fürstenberg"].&lt;/ref&gt; The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July, and Fürstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter-offensive. At the [[Battle of Emmendingen]] on 19 October 1796, his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory. General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]]'s Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. Fürstenberg held [[Kenzingen]], {{convert|2.5|mi|0|sp=us}} north of [[Riegel am Kaiserstuhl|Riegel]] on the [[Elz (Rhine)|Elz River]]. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was ordered to [[feint]] against Riegel, to protect the primary Austrian positions at [[Rust, Germany|Rust]] and [[Kappel-Grafenhausen|Kappel]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Rickard. [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_emmendingen.html "Battle of Emmendingen," 19 October 1796]. [http://www.historyofwar.org ''History of War'']. Peter D. Antill, Tristan Dugdale-Pointon and J. Rickard, editors. February 2009 update. Accessed 7 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Battle of Schliengen]] (24 October 1796), Fürstenberg commanded the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed the force of General of Division [[Gouvion Saint-Cyr]], holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While [[Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour]], engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging [[Hüningen]], which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. Charles' confidence in his young field marshal was well-placed. On 27 November, Fürstenberg's chief engineer opened and drained the water-filled moat protecting the French fortifications. Fürstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead, General of Brigade [[Jean Charles Abbatucci]], the opportunity to surrender, which he declined. In the night of 30 November to 1 December, Fürstenberg's force stormed the bridgehead twice, but was twice repulsed. In one of these attacks, the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December. Fürstenberg maintained the [[Siege of Kehl (1796–97)|Siege of Kehl]] while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French capitulation at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional forces with which he could end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division [[Georges Joseph Dufour]], the new French commander, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as [[Proprietor (Inhaber)|Colonel and Proprietor]] of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace===
The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several victories at [[Battle of Verdun (1792)|Verdun]], [[Battle of Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]], [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]], [[Battle of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]] and [[Battle of Würzburg|Würzburg]], but in northern Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at [[Mantua]]. The efforts of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in northern [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italy]] pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at [[Peace of Leoben|Leoben]] on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, pp. 41–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the war ended, Fürstenberg stayed at the [[Donaueschingen]] estate of his cousin, Karl Joachim Aloys, who had recently inherited the family title as ''Fürst zu Fürstenberg''. Later in 1797, he traveled to Prague and remained with his family until May 1798, when he received a posting to a new division in [[Linz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Maria Anna, was born after he left, on 17 September 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, pp. 331—336.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities in the Second Coalition ==
{{details|Second Coalition}}
Despite the longed-for peace, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV of Naples]] refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the [[Parthenopaean Republic]]. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the [[Swiss Confederation]] and the establishment of the [[Helvetic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to [[Napoleon's invasion of Egypt|Egypt]] in Spring 1798, [[Napoleon]] had stopped on the [[Malta#History|Island of Malta]] and removed the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] from their possessions. This angered [[Paul I of Russia|Paul, Tsar of Russia]], who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|French occupation]] of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The [[French Directory]] was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;John Gallagher. ''Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme,'' Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3875-6}}, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General [[Jean Baptiste Jourdan]] and his 25,000-man [[Army of the Danube]] crossed the [[Rhine]] at Kehl.&lt;ref&gt;John Young, D.D. ''A History of the Commencement, Progress, and Termination of the Late War between Great Britain and France which continued from the first day of February 1793 to the first of October 1801'', in two volumes. Edinburg: Turnbull, 1802, vol. 2, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army of the Danube met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of [[Lake Constance]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, [[Generalissimo]] [[Alexander Suvorov]]. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, pp. 70–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Ostrach===
{{details|Battle of Ostrach}}

At the outbreak of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory, just north of the [[Free imperial city|free and Imperial]] city of [[Augsburg]]. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. Fürstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg, crossing the [[Lech River]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey Weston Phipps, ''The Armies of the First French Republic,'' volume 5: "The armies of the Rhine in Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Egypt and the ''coup  d'etat'' of ''Brumaire'',  1797–1799," Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French advanced guard arrived in [[Ostrach]] on 8–9 March, and over the next week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts, while the rest of the French army arrived. Jourdan disposed his 25,000 troops along a line from [[Salem Abbey]] and [[Lake Constance]] to the [[Danube]] river, centered in Ostrach. He established his command headquarters at the imperial city of [[Pfullendorf]], overlooking the entire Ostrach valley.  Jourdan was expecting [[Dominique Vandamme]]'s troops to arrive in time to support his far north flank near the river, but Vandamme had gone to [[Stuttgart]] to investigate a rumored presence of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the main army. Consequently, the French left flank, under command of [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|Gouvion Saint-Cyr]], was thinly manned. Jourdan thought he had more time, expecting Charles would need still three or four days to move his troops across the Lech, and march to Ostrach, but by the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000 mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to  Jourdan's, and his 72,000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at [[Kempten]], the center near [[Memmingen]], and the right flank extended to [[Ulm]].&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 21 March, the French and Austrian outposts overlapped, and skirmishing intensified.  Charles had divided his force into four columns. Fürstenberg covered the  northern flank of the Archduke's main force. Fürstenberg's force pushed the French out of [[Davidsweiler]], and then advanced on [[Ruppersweiler]]  and [[Einhard]], 5 kilometers (3&amp;nbsp;mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr did not have the manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with Fürstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Cust (Sir). ''Annals of the wars of the eighteenth century,  compiled from the most authentic histories of the period.'' London:  Mitchell's military library, 1857–1860, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Fürstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of the northern part of the French line. After their success in driving the French back from [[Ostrach]], and then from the heights of [[Pfullendorf]], the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach, and then another five miles or so to [[Engen, Germany|Engen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death at the Battle of Stockach (1799)===
{{see also|Battle of Stockach (1799)}}

[[File:Schlacht bei Liptingen 1799 2.jpg|thumb|left|Death of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg while leading Austrian infantry during the battle of Stockach.]]

On the morning of what they suspected would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the [[Holy Sacraments|sacraments]] because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the [[Danube]]. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, with the possible exception of [[Dominique Vandamme]], who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the battle, Jourdan's forces were supposed to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left, center and right of the Austrian line.&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; On the French right, Soulham's and Ferino's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back. Having stopped Soulham's and Ferino's assault, Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre's force. At that point, Vandamme's men moved into action.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt; Because Soulham's assault at the center had been stalled, Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat, but the Austrians were hard pressed and the action furious. At one point, Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action, to the dismay of the old soldiers. Fürstenberg reportedly said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the head of the grenadiers) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Münch, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; As Fürstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was carried alive off the field, he died almost immediately. Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle, and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, someone removed Fürstenberg's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague, with news of his death; Fürstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach, and his cousin erected a small monument there,&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Münch, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1857, his body was moved to the family cemetery, ''Maria Hof'' at Neudingen, near Donaueschingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ebert, "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Fürst zu Fürstenberg," ''[http://www.napoleon-online.de/AU_Generale/index.html Die Österreichischen Generäle 1792–1815].''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|House of Fürstenberg (Swabia)}}

Upon the death of Prosper Ferdinand, Count Fürstenberg, in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], in 1704 the Fürstenberg inheritance was divided between the count's two youngest sons, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic. The family of Fürstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716, with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, as the first Prince (''Fürst'') of Fürstenberg (German: ''Fürst zu Fürstenberg'').&lt;ref&gt;For a more complete description of the history of this family, see the entry by Hugh Chisholm. "Fürstenberg". ''The Encyclopædia Britannica: a Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information.'' Cambridge, England, New York: At the University Press, 1910–11 or {{de icon}} Ernst Hermann Joseph Münch; Carl Borromäus Alois Fickler. ''Geschichte des Hauses und Landes Fürstenberg: aus Urkunden und den besten Quellen.'' Aachen: Mayer, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; The first prince had three sons, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (1728–1783), Karl Borromäus Egon (1729–1787), and Prosper Maria, who died in infancy. The title passed through the line of the first son, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (as second prince), to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl (third prince, who died in 1796) and then to another son of the second prince, Karl Joachim Aloys (fourth prince). The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue. Consequently, the title passed to the male line of first prince's  second son. This son, Karl Borromäus Egon, had died in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, pp. 237–266.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Karl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), died as a small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), married in 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of the third and fourth princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but died at the age of 15 years. The other children of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, pp. 267, 281–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, two of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's children were still living. Karl Egon, as the surviving son, inherited the title Prince of Fürstenberg; he and his eldest sister lived into adulthood and produced families.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, pp. 318, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and [[Elisabeth zu Fürstenberg|Elizabeth, Princess of Thurn und Taxis]], were:

*Marie Leopoldine (Prague, 4 September 1791 – [[Kupferzell]], 10 January 1844); married at [[Heiligenberg]], 20 May 1813 to [[Charles Albert III, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst]] (Vienna, 29 February 1776 – [[Bad Mergentheim]], 15 June 1843)
*Maria Josepha (9 September 1792)
*Antonie (28 October 1794 – 1 October 1799)
*[[Charles Egon II, Prince of Fürstenberg|Karl Egon II]] (Prague, 28 October 1796 – [[Bad Ischl]] 22 October 1854), succeeded his cousin, Joachim, as the fifth ''Fürst zu Fürstenberg'' on 17 May 1804. He married on 19 April 1818, to Amalie Christine Karoline, of Baden ([[Karlsruhe]], 26 January 1795 – Karlsruhe, 14 September 1869).
*Maria Anna, 17 September 1798 – 18 July 1799&lt;ref&gt;Münch, pp. 316–336.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7286">'''Karl Bömelburg''' (28 October 1885, Elberfeld, today merged with [[Wuppertal]] – 1946) was an SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' (major) and head of the [[Gestapo]] in [[France]] during the [[Second World War]].  He notably had authority over section IV J, charged with the deportation of the Jews, for which [[Alois Brunner]] (sent in 1943 by [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]]) was responsible.  His aliases included Charles Bois, Mollemburg, and Bennelburger.

==Life==

===Before the war===
During his youth, he spent five years in Paris, in which he learned to speak nearly perfect French. He returned to Germany, was married and began working in his parents' bakery in Berlin. In 1931, Bömelburg became a member of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (Nazi Party), joining the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] then the [[SS]]. In 1933 he joined the Gestapo, in which he became a commissary directing the [[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]] in [[Berlin]].

In 1938 he joined the staff of [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in Paris.  At the start of November, he was put in charge of enquiries into the murder of [[Ernst vom Rath]].  When this affair was quickly resolved, he became attached to the German ambassador in Paris, setting up an unofficial Gestapo centre in Paris.  He worked in [[Lyon]] and [[Saint-Étienne]], making use of his French language ability.

In January 1939, he was expelled by [[Antoine Mondanel]], the inspector general of the judicial police, for helping extreme-right French organisations and fifth-columnists.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Berlière and Laurent Chabrun, ''Les policiers Français sous l'occupation'', Ed. Perrin, 2001, {{ISBN|2-262-01626-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved to [[Prague]], becoming police counsellor to the Gestapo and the head of its anti-[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] section. While in Prague, he played a crucial role in [[Nicholas Winton]]'s rescue of 669 Jewish children who escaped Czechoslovakia at the last moment, in exchange for bribes.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicholas Winton, Rescuer of 669 Children from Holocaust, Dies at 106, The NY Times, July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris===
On 14 June 1940, during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]], Bömelburg returned to France in colonel [[Helmut Knochen]]'s Kommando [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and acted as ''Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei'' (''KdS'', Commander of Security Police).  In August he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the SS and had [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] name him his personal representative and the head of the [[Gestapo]] (section IV of the BdS covering France), with the title of criminal director.  His activities during the time he spent in Paris passed from repression and interrogations to the frequent use of torture in the courts by his subordinates, but also fashionable soirées and little gifts offered by [[Henri Lafont]], derived from the black market or from war loot. One of Bömelburg's wishes was to have a poultry farm, and Henri Lafont obliged by giving him a farm near [[Giverny]] staffed by his own men.  His offices were situated at 11 [[rue des Saussaies]] (1940-1942), then [[84 Avenue Foch]], and his adjutants were ''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Josef Kieffer]] (criminal counsellor), [[Heimboldt]] and [[Wolf]].

In 1941 he succeeded [[Rudy de Mérode]] at 43, [[Avenue Victor-Hugo (Paris)|avenue Victor-Hugo]] in Neuilly, in a ''Gasthaus'' (a house reserved for "forced" guests), which came to be called villa Boemelburg.&lt;ref&gt;He was visited there by Général [[Maxime Weygand]], [[Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz|Geneviève de Gaulle]], the family of Général [[Henri Giraud]], president [[Albert Lebrun]], [[René Bousquet]], [[Paul Dungler]], [[Léopold Trepper]], [[Jean Moulin]].&lt;/ref&gt; He personally recruited agents, with the initial B or Boe.&lt;ref&gt;These agents included : Urraca, colonel Rado, [[Henri Barbé]], Ludovic Barthélémy, [[Joseph Joanovici|Joseph Joinovici]], [[Henri Déricourt]] (Boe 48), [[Mathilde Carré]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In summer 1941 he made a trip to the [[Vichy France|unoccupied zone]] to reactivate pre-war agents, and in the autumn he supervised the inquiry into Paul Collette, who had betrayed [[Pierre Laval]] and [[Marcel Déat]].  During that year, he also headed up the [[Red Orchestra (spy)|Red Orchestra]] Kommando and enacted Operation [[Funkspiel]] against the workers' Soviets.

In autumn 1942 he put ''Aktion Donar'' into effect, and in June 1943 he was the last German senior officer to see [[Jean Moulin]] alive. Moulin had been arrested on 21 June at [[Caluire]], and then spent two weeks (25 June to 8 July) at villa Boemelburg, before dying on his train journey to Berlin.  In November 1943 Bömelburg reached the age limit and was replaced by [[Stindt]].

Bömelburg was transferred to [[Vichy]], where he represented [[Carl Oberg]], and then in June 1944 replaced SS captain [[Hugo Geissler]] (killed in an ambush near [[Murat, Cantal|Murat]]) as head of the Gestapo in the southern zone of France.  On 28 August that year he ensured Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]'s safe journey to [[Sigmaringen]], as security-chief, and then on 29 April 1945 authorised Pétain's departure for Switzerland.

===Postwar===
In May 1945, after the German surrender, Bömelburg and his Gestapo chief in Berlin, Heinrich Müller, disappeared and were never recaptured. Bömelburg doctored the papers of a sergeant Bergman, killed in the bombardment, and adopted his identity. He was hired as a gardener near Munich, then promoted to librarian, and also directed a group of active Nazis fleeing to Francoist Spain. At Saint-Sylvestre, in 1946, he slipped on ice, broke his skull and died. Later his son Ralf engraved his name on the family tombstone.&lt;ref&gt;Source : Jean Lartéguy and Bob Maloubier&lt;/ref&gt;  He was condemned to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' on 2 March 1950 by a military tribunal meeting in Lyon, and the Czechoslovak authorities were also seeking him for trial for war crimes.

'''Kevin Carter''' (13 September 1960 – 24 July 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/30/kevin-carter-photojournalist-obituary-archive-1994|title=Photojournalist Kevin Carter dies - obituary: from the archive, 30 July 1994|first=Eamonn|last=McCabe|date=30 July 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[South Africa]]n [[photojournalism|photojournalist]] and member of the [[Bang-Bang Club]]. He was the recipient of a [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography|Pulitzer Prize]] for his photograph depicting the [[1993 Sudan famine|1993 famine in Sudan]]. He died by suicide at the age of 33. His story is depicted in the 2010 feature film ''[[The Bang Bang Club (film)|The Bang-Bang Club]]'', in which he was played by [[Taylor Kitsch]].

== Early life ==
Kevin Carter was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] and grew up in a middle-class, whites-only neighborhood. As a child, he occasionally saw police raids to arrest blacks who were illegally living in the area. He said later that he questioned how his parents, a [[Catholicism|Catholic]], "liberal" family, could be what he described as 'lackadaisical' about fighting against [[apartheid]].{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|pp=39–41}}

After high school, Carter dropped out of his studies to become a [[pharmacist]] and was drafted into the [[South African Army|army]]. To escape from the infantry, he enlisted in the [[South African Air Force|Air Force]] in which he served four years. In 1980, he witnessed a black mess-hall waiter being insulted. Carter defended the man, resulting in him being badly beaten by the other servicemen. He then went [[absent without leave]], attempting to start a new life as a radio disc-jockey named "David". This, however, proved more difficult than he had anticipated. Soon after, he decided to serve out the rest of his required military service. After witnessing the [[Church Street bombing]] in Pretoria in 1983, he decided to become a news photographer and journalist.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|pp=39–41}}

== Early work ==
Carter had started to work as a weekend sports photographer in 1983. In 1984, he moved on to work for the ''[[The Star (South Africa)|Johannesburg Star]]'', went on exposing the brutality of apartheid.

Carter was the first to photograph a public execution "[[necklacing]]" by black Africans in South Africa in the mid-1980s. Carter later spoke of the images: "I was appalled at what they were doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timporter.com/firstdraft/archives/000071.html|title=First Draft by Tim Porter: Covering War in a Free Society|website=www.timporter.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Sudan ==
In March 1993, Robert Hadley of the UN [[Operation Lifeline Sudan]] offered [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]] the opportunity to travel to Sudan and report about the famine in South Sudan embedding with the rebels in that area's civil war.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|p=110}} Silva told Carter, who felt it was an opportunity to expand his freelance career and use work as a way to address personal problems.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|pp=109-110}} Operation Lifeline Sudan had been having funding difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karim|first1=Ataul|last2=Duffield|first2=Mark|last3=Jaspers|first3=Susanne|last4=Hendrie|first4=Barbara|title=Operation Lifeline Sudan – A review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284727714_Operation_Lifeline_Sudan_-_A_review|website=www.researchgate.net|date=June 1996|publisher=ResearchGate|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UN believed that publicizing the area's famine and needs would help aid organizations sustain funding. Silva and Carter were apolitical and desiring only to photograph.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|p=113}}

After flying to [[Nairobi]], the two found out that new fighting in Sudan would force them to wait in that city indefinitely. During this time, Carter made a day trip with the UN to [[Juba]] in the south Sudan to photograph a barge with food aid for the region. Soon afterward, the UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to [[Ayod]]. Hadley invited Silva and Carter to fly there with him.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|p=114}} Once in Ayod, Silva and Carter separated to shoot photos of famine victims, discussing between themselves the shocking situations they were witnessing. Silva found rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority. Carter joined him. One of the soldiers, who did not speak English, was interested in Carter's wristwatch. Carter gave him the cheap watch as a gift.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|p=116}} The soldiers served as their bodyguards.{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|pp=152–153|loc=Marinovich explains the soldiers as bodyguards}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/201137365|title=Carter and soldiers|website=www.vimeo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulitzer Prize photograph in Sudan===
{{main|The vulture and the little girl}}
Carter shot an image of what appeared to be a little girl, fallen to the ground from hunger, while a vulture lurked on the ground nearby. He told Silva he was shocked by the situation he had just photographed, and had chased the vulture away. A few minutes later, Carter and Silva boarded a small UN plane and left Ayod for [[Kongor]].{{sfn|Marinovich|Silva|2000|p=118}}

Sold to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the photograph first appeared on 26 March 1993, and syndicated worldwide. Hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask the fate of the girl. The paper said that according to Carter, "she recovered enough to resume her trek after the vulture was chased away" but that it was unknown whether she reached the UN food center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editors' Note|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 September 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/nyregion/editors-note-513893.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1994, the photograph won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kevin-carter-free-lance-photographer  Pulitzer Prize&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of "fevers", according to his family.&lt;ref name="Kong Nyong, el niño que sobrevivió al buitre"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kong Nyong, el niño que sobrevivió al buitre / Kong Nyong, The Boy Who Survived the Vulture|first=Alberto|last= Rojas|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=29 August 2017|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/02/18/comunicacion/1298054483.html|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]| language=Spanish|archivedate=30 June 2017|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170630053614/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/02/18/comunicacion/1298054483.html| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other work ==
In March 1994 Carter took a photograph of the three [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] members being shot during their [[1994 Bophuthatswana crisis|abortive invasion]] of [[Bophuthatswana]] just before the [[South African general election, 1994|South African election]]. Halfway through the incident, Carter ran out of film, but still got enough pictures to supply newspapers around the world. Eamonn McCabe of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said: "It was a picture that made nearly every front page in the world, the one real photograph of the whole campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eamonn McCabe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/30/kevin-carter-photojournalist-obituary-archive-1994 |title=Photojournalist Kevin Carter dies – obituary: from the archive, 30 July 1994; Media |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=30 July 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In April 1994, [[The vulture and the little girl|Carter's photograph]] of a starving [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese]] child being eyed by a vulture won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography]].&lt;ref name="time-1994"&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=12 September 1994 |volume=144 |number=11 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981431,00.html |title=The Life and Death of Kevin Carter |last=MacLeod |first=Scott |location=Johannesburg |accessdate=27 October 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On 24 July 1994, Carter drove to [[Parkmore]] near the Field and Study Centre, an area where he used to play as a child, and committed suicide by taping one end of a hose to his pickup truck’s exhaust pipe and running the other end to the driver's side window. He died of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] at the age of 33. Portions of Carter's suicide note read:&lt;ref name="time-1994" /&gt;

{{quote|I'm really, really sorry. The pain of life overrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist. ...depressed ... without phone ... money for rent ... money for child support ... money for debts ... money!!! ... I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings &amp; corpses &amp; anger &amp; pain ... of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners ... I have gone to join Ken if I am that lucky.}}

The final line is a reference to his recently deceased colleague [[Ken Oosterbroek]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The 1996 song "[[Kevin Carter (song)|Kevin Carter]]" by rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]], from their fourth album ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'', was inspired by Carter's life and suicide.{{snf|Newark|2013|p=96}} The lyrics were written by [[Richey Edwards]] shortly before [[Richey Edwards#Disappearance|his own disappearance]].

The homing endonucleases are a special type of [[restriction enzymes]] encoded by [[intron]]s or [[intein]]s. They act on the cellular [[DNA]] of the cell that synthesizes them; to be precise, in the opposite [[allele]] of the [[gene]] that encode them.&lt;ref name="pmid8352597"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.62.070193.003103 |vauthors=Lambowitz AM, Belfort M | title = Introns as mobile genetic elements | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 62 | pages = 587–622 | pmid=8352597 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Further information: [[Homing endonuclease]]''.

==Homing endonucleases==
The list includes some of the most studied examples. The following concepts have been detailed:
* '''Enzyme''': Accepted name of the molecule, according to the internationally adopted nomenclature. Bibliographical references. ''(Further reading: see the section "[[homing endonuclease#Nomenclature|Nomenclature]]" in the article "[[Homing endonuclease]]".)''
* '''SF''' ([[Structural family]]): Any of the four established families for this kind of proteins, based in their shared [[structural motif]]s: &lt;code style="font-size:125%;"&gt;HI&lt;/code&gt;: [[LAGLIDADG family]] – &lt;code style="font-size:125%;"&gt;HII&lt;/code&gt;: GIY-YIG family – &lt;code style="font-size:125%;"&gt;HIII&lt;/code&gt;: H-N-H family – &lt;code style="font-size:125%;"&gt;HIV&lt;/code&gt;: His-Cys box family. ''(Further reading: see the section "[[homing endonuclease#Structural families|Structural families]]" in the article "[[Homing endonuclease]]".)''
* '''PDB code''': Code used to identify the structure of a protein in the [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] database.
* '''Source''': Organism that naturally produces the enzyme.
* '''D''': [[domain (biology)|Biological domain]] of the source: A: [[archaea]] – B: [[bacteria]] – E: [[eukarya]].
* SCL: Subcelullar location: chloro: [[chloroplast]] – chrm: [[chromosome|chromosomal]] – mito: [[mitochondria]]l – nuclear: [[extrachromosomal DNA|extrachromosomal nuclear]] – phage: [[bacteriophage]].
* '''[[Recognition sequence]]''': Sequence of DNA recognized by the enzyme. The enzyme is specifically bound to this sequence.
* '''Cut''': Cutting site and products of the cut. Both the recognition sequence and the cutting site match usually, but sometimes the cutting site can be dozens of nucleotides away from the recognition site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="133196">On a number of occasions throughout history, notable sporting participants have been involved in violent confrontations with spectators during a competition. This list includes events in which a spectator at a sporting event was engaged in such a confrontation with an athlete, coach or game official, either through the spectator's intrusion upon the field of play, or (as a result of such an event) a participant entering the spectator seating area. Incidents of object or snow throwing are included when it results in injuries to a match participant or causes significant delays or cancellation of the event.

It does ''not'' include incidents of [[riot]]s or other violence, often outside the event venue, which did not involve game participants.

==1879==
* February 7 – During the [[Sydney Riot of 1879]], up to 2,000 fans invaded the pitch and disrupted play after an umpiring dispute broke out between members of the visiting English cricket team and the New South Wales Cricket Association; two English players were assaulted, with three fans being arrested.

Page was also ejected.

They were given two 90-second ultimatums but the 65ers never came out. It was only then the Zoom Masters were declared champions by game forfeiture. Team manager Navarro later said that the decision to walkout was from his fear that something more untoward would happen if his team continued on with the game.  The 65ers were fined a total of P550,000 for the walkout.

Players and officials were escorted off the field by security and riot police, and the first leg of the two-game aggregate would be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Crazy+riot+breaks+out+at+soccer+game+following+missed+call&amp;id=574181|title=BarDown: Crazy riot breaks out at soccer game following missed call|author=BarDown|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Looting of Battleford''' began at the end of  March, 1885, during the [[North-West Rebellion]], in the town of [[Battleford]], Saskatchewan, then a part of the Northwest Territories.

Within days of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] victory at the [[Battle of Duck Lake]] on March 26, [[1885 in Canada|1885]]. [[Cree|Cree bands]] sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the [[District of Saskatchewan]] for  arms, ammunition and food supplies while civilians fled to the larger settlements and forts of the [[Districts of the Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]].

Prominent leaders of this uprising were Chief [[Poundmaker]] and Chief [[Big Bear]]. Poundmaker and his band had a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] near present-day [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]] about 50&amp;nbsp;km (31 miles) west of Fort Battleford. Big Bear and his band had settled near [[Frog Lake Massacre|Frog Lake]] about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) northwest of [[Battle of Fort Pitt|Fort Pitt]] but had not yet selected a reserve site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Geography==
The District of Saskatchewan in 1885 was divided into three sub-districts and had a population of 10,595. To the east the Carrot River sub-district with 1,770 people remained quiet. The Prince Albert sub-district located in the centre of the district had a population of 5,373 which included the [[Southbranch Settlement|Southbranch settlements]] with about 1,300. The Southbranch settlements was the centre of [[Louis Riel]]'s [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan|Provisional Government]] during the Rebellion. To the west where the Cree uprising led by Poundmaker and Big Bear occurred was the Battleford sub-district with 3,603 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The city of [[North Battleford]] was founded later in 1905 when the construction of the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] main line to [[Edmonton]] placed the line on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Siege of Battleford==
[[File:Map of Battleford 1885.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of Battleford 1885]]
On March 28 as news that several [[First Nations|Indian bands]] including Poundmaker's were on their way to Battleford settlers began moving into the nearby [[North-West Mounted Police]] post, [[Fort Battleford]] which was under the command of Colonel Morris and 25 police. Over the next several days 500 civilians would take refuge within the [[palisade]]s. Many crossed over an unstable ice bridge on the Battle River leaving most of their possessions behind in the Old Town. During the night of March 29 nearby [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteads]] were raided their horses and cattle rounded up by the bands.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;

Also on the trail to join Poundmaker in Battleford were the [[Mosquito-Grizzly Bear's Head-Lean Man|Assiniboine from the Eagle Hills]] approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km south of Battleford. On March 29 they killed their farm instructor John Payne and raided homesteads on the way killing a farmer by the name of Fremont.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;

On March 30 Poundmaker asked for a meeting with the Indian agent J. M. Rae. 
After Rae refused to meet with him the combined Battleford bands took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. The next day the bands camped a few miles away bringing with them their looted provisions including cattle and horses then eventually returned to Poundmaker's reserve.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;
 
While the New Town was protected by its proximity to the Fort and its cannon the Old Town was not. Every day until the arrival of [[William Dillon Otter|Colonel Otter]]'s column on April 24 the occupants of the Fort watched as the Old Town about a mile away was plundered. Stolen vehicles and horses carried away the supplies of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the other merchants. All the public buildings were sacked including the [[Battleford Industrial School]] (located in the Old Government House).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Aftermath==

On May 2 Colonel Otter's column attacked Poundmaker's camp at [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife Creek]] but was forced to retreat to Battleford. Poundmaker prevented his warriors from attacking the retreating troops.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"&gt;{{cite news

==Historiographical interpretation==
The nature of the Cree advance on Battleford, like the entire 1885 Rebellion, is a source of [[historiographical]] controversy.  Historian [[Douglas Hill (historian)|Douglas Hill]] characterized the Cree group as a "war party&amp;nbsp;... ready to take revenge for a winter of incalculable suffering" who "swooped on Battleford, killing six whites". [[George F. G. Stanley]]'s writing on the subject indicated that the Cree were not murderous but more haphazard and bumbling: they "[did] not appear to have in mind an attack upon the town" but were content with "prowling around the neighbourhood".  While [[John L. Tobias]] says that the Crees tried to demonstrate their "peaceful intent" by including women and children in their group, simply took food to sustain themselves after finding the town abandoned, and then withdrew to avoid conflict with the police.

[[File:Sketch_by_Marguerite_Martyn_of_accused_killer_Louise_Vermilya,_1911.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of the accused killer by journalist [[Marguerite Martyn]], November 1911]]

==Early life==
Louise Vermilya was born Louesa Woolf in [[Cook County, Illinois]], to parents Wilhemina (née Munaroe) and John Woolf, Prussian immigrants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was the oldest daughter of five girls and third oldest child out of 11 siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Tenth Census of the United States, 1880. (NARA microfilm publication T9, 1,454 rolls). Records of the Bureau of the Census, Record Group 29. National Archives, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; She married 24 year old Fred Brinkamp on 2 April 1885 at the age of 16 and moved to the village of Barrington within the Cuba township of Lake county in northern Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;"Illinois, Cook County Marriages, 1871–1920." Index. FamilySearch, Salt Lake City, Utah, 2010. Illinois Department of Public Health records. "Marriage Records, 1871–present." Division of Vital Records, Springfield, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early murders==
The string of homicides began in 1893, when Vermilya claimed the life of her first husband, Fred Brinkamp, while living on their farm near [[Barrington, Illinois]]. The coroner ruled Brinkamp's death to be attributed to a [[heart attack]]. Following his death, she inherited $5,000 from a [[life insurance]] policy Brinkamp had which named her as the beneficiary. Due to Brinkamp's age at death, no suspicions arose as it was thought to be due to natural causes. Brinkamp left behind six children, two of whom met similar fates to their father shortly after his death. Cora Brinkamp was the first to die at age eight, with her sister Florence following at three and a half years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/11/01/105033813.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Undertaker]] E.N. Blocks, who owned a [[mortuary]] in Barrington, recalled that Louise enjoyed working around bodies.  Despite not being a salaried employee, Vermilya seemed too eager to work in the mortuary with Blocks "while I never employed her for a couple of years I couldn't keep her out of the office". Blocks also stated that "at every death she would seem to hear of it just as soon as I and she would reach the house only a little behind me."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Subsequent murders==
Vermilya moved to Chicago in 1906 with her minor charges in tow. It was while living in Chicago that Vermilya claimed the life of her stepdaughter, 26 year old Lillian Brinkamp. The coroner, however, ruled her cause of death as "acute [[nephritis]]". Due to the unusually high number of deaths within the Brinkamp family, they were thought to be cursed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around this time, Vermilya remarried to a man named Charles Vermilya, aged 59. Three years later, he died, apparently victim to sudden illness. He left his widow with $1,000 in cash and a home in [[Crystal Lake, Illinois]], ten miles north of Chicago. Her stepson, Harry Vermilya, followed his father in death shortly after quarreling with Louise over the sale of the Crystal Lake estate. No suspicions arose after the deaths, and coincidence was blamed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The following year, in 1910, Vermilya inherited $1,200 after the death of her 23-year-old son from her first marriage, Frank Brinkamp. Frank has been married to a widow and divorced her, receiving $1,200 from the divorce proceedings. On his death bed, he voiced suspicion involving his stepmother to his fiancée, Elizabeth Nolan, stating he was "going the way his father did." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Uncharacteristically, Vermilya began poisoning acquaintances. Jason Rupert, a railroad fireman, fell ill after dining with Vermilya on January 15, 1910. He died two days later, but was only the first in series of deaths of boarders in Vermilya's home. In February 1910, Vermilya married Richard Smith, a [[train conductor]] and [[room and board|boarder]] at her home. On March 11, 1910, two days after eating a meal prepared by Vermilya, he met a similar fate to Vermilya's prior boarder. His death was determined to be caused by [[gastritis]]. Smith was still married at the time of his supposed nuptials to Vermilya. His estranged wife believed that the circumstances surrounding her husband's death were suspicious. She believed that Smith was murdered for one of three reasons, "either Mrs. Vermilya loved Smith and was afraid that he would desert her, or he was murdered for his money, or C. C. Boysen, the undertaker, thought to be in love with Mrs. Vermilya, was jealous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/28604795/|title=5 Nov 1911, Page 3 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018072025/https://www.newspapers.com/image/28604795/#|archive-date=2017-10-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her motive in the earlier deaths of her family members was pursuit of financial gain, they became unclear after the deaths of her boarders, for whom she gained no monetary rewards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Undoing==
It wasn't until Arthur Bissonette came to dine with Vermilya did she experience her undoing. While dining with his father at the Vermilya home in October 1911, both of the Bissonettes started experiencing abdominal pain. Homicide detectives became suspicious after questioning Bissonette's father who states he saw Vermilya sprinkling "white pepper" over their meals prior to serving them. This led the Chicago Police Department to do an autopsy on Bissonette's body revealing arsenic poisoning. Vermilya was taken into custody soon after its discovery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some speculation as to whether Bissonette's death was precipitated by financial motives. With Vermilya's assistance, Bissonette was accepted into the [[Home Guard]], a militia-like entity for those men who were unable to qualify for the military.  In return, Bissonette was to make a will naming Vermilya as the sole beneficiary of the insurance policy he would carry as a result of this employment. Vermilya was to name him as her beneficiary for the life insurance that she carried after their nuptials. Bissonette did author a will shortly before his death, but named his fiancé who lived in nearby [[Kankakee, Illinois|Kankakee]], Lydia Rivard, as the beneficiary of his estate. Though Vermilya was listed as the witness, she claimed to have no knowledge of ever signing the document.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Suicide attempts and trial==
On November 4, Vermilya was rushed to the hospital after playing victim to her own [[modus operandi]]. Authorities reported Vermilya had been ingesting the "white pepper" since her house arrest on October 28. By November 9, she was reported as being near her death with [[Comorbidity|comorbidities]] such as valvular heart problems adding to her demise. Vermilya was discharged from the county hospital on November 24, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1912-11-25/ed-1/seq-8/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109075609/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1912-11-25/ed-1/seq-8/# |archive-date=2017-11-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 9, she was stricken with paralysis, which physicians stated was a permanent condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1913-12-31/ed-1/seq-6/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120080323/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1913-12-31/ed-1/seq-6/# |archive-date=2017-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Vermilya was required to attend all her court proceedings, and usually did so in a wheelchair. Vermilya was arraigned before Municipal Judge Walker on 6 November 1911 for the death of Arthur Bissonette. On 7 March 1912, [[nolle prosequi]] was filed after it had been found that Bissonette had been taking medication containing arsenic. In an effort to expedite court proceedings, a conference was held between the presiding judge, Judge Kersten, attorney Joseph R. Barres, and the prosecutor on the case. The prosecutor was reticent as to the strongest points and the motive in Smith's death stating "There are several cases as to which Mrs. Vermilya may be tried and I don't want to try her more than once...For that reason, I want to pick out the strongest one and I have concluded the Smith one is the strongest one." Vermilya was rearrested and charged for the murder of Richard Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28620010/?terms=louise+vermilya|title=7 Mar 1912, Page 3 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030201/http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28620010/?terms=louise+vermilya#|archive-date=2017-11-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of arsenic poisoning was found in Smith's liver via autopsy conducted by Prof. Walter S. Haines, the Rush Medical College expert chemist. His findings showed "arsenic in sufficient quantities in the viscera of the two men to cause death." Vermilya was taken into custody and detained in the county jail where she attempted suicide again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28753966/?terms=vermilya|title=18 Apr 1915, Page 12 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011920/http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28753966/?terms=vermilya#|archive-date=2017-11-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on 21 March 1912 and lasted 16 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28948331/?terms=vermilya|title=7 Apr 1912, Page 1 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was resubmitted for trial ten days later, ending in another hung jury as evidence against her was deemed circumstantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1912-06-27/ed-1/seq-32/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109084956/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1912-06-27/ed-1/seq-32/# |archive-date=2017-11-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were subsequent difficulties that further complicated the progression of the trial. Juror selection had become an arduous process as men were unsure of if they could inflict the death penalty on a woman as freely as they would on a man. Nearly every man called forward had established a bias based on current newspaper accounts of the crime. A good percentage of these were sure that because of the impression made by the newspaper stories, they could not give a fair verdict. About 50% of those who passed this barrier had a prejudice against circumstantial evidence which necessitated their being excused. Up to this point, the jury had been composed of an all-male panel, who were unable to not only impose a death sentence on a woman, but whose attitudes toward woman defendants in murder cases also came into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28623075/?terms=vermilya|title=22 Mar 1912, Page 6 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018072117/http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28623075/?terms=vermilya#|archive-date=2017-10-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 12 October 1912, Vermilya was still in custody awaiting trial along with fellow murderess [[Louisa Lindloff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28618731/?terms=vermilya|title=12 Oct 1912, Page 3 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071918/http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28618731/?terms=vermilya#|archive-date=2017-10-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 1913, Vermilya was released on $5,000 bail due to concerns for her continued failing health and exposure to the summer heat in a non-airconditioned jail, pending her trial for the poisoning of Richard Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28708178/?terms=vermilya|title=28 Jun 1912, Page 11 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018072322/http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/28708178/?terms=vermilya#|archive-date=2017-10-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dismissal of charges==
On 18 April 1915, a conference was held between the Assistant State's Attorney, Michael Sullivan, and the State Attorney Hoyne regarding continuation of the trial. It was decided that it would be impossible to obtain a conviction on the Smith indictment, with Sullivan remarking "We could only see that another trial would entail a heavy cost without any assurance of being able to show any strong evidence." Per the request of Vermilya's attorney, all charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Vermilya led a quiet life following the dismissal of her charges as no further documentation exists of her in local papers past this point.

It is estimated that Vermilya amassed a total of $15,000 from the nine deaths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">'''Lucius Aemilius Carus''' (fl. 2nd century AD) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military officer and [[Senate of the Roman Empire|senator]] who served as ''[[Roman consul|consul suffectus]]'' for one of the ''[[nundinium|nundinia]]'' in the first half of AD 144, with [[Quintus Egrilius Plarianus]] as his colleague.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Eck]], "Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit Géza Alföldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand" in ''Studia epigraphica in memoriam Géza Alföldy'', hg. W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kovács (Bonn, 2013), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; His life is known primarily through inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably, {{CIL|6|1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of Lucius and a member of the [[Roman tribe]] ''Camilia'', Carus' career began with his appointment to the ''[[decemviri stlitibus judicandis]]'', one of the four boards of the ''[[vigintiviri]]''; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed by serving as a [[military tribune]], firstly of the [[Legio VIII Augusta]], at the time stationed at ''[[Argentoratum]]'' ([[Strasbourg]]), then of the [[Legio IX Hispana]], sometime after AD 122.{{sfn|Kleb|1897|p=27}}&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, R. ''Roman Legionary AD 69-161'' (2013), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to [[Rome]], Carus began his climb up the series of Republican magistracies: first appointed ''[[quaestor]]'' to the Emperor, then [[Tribune of the Plebs|Plebeian Tribune]] before achieving the [[Praetor]]ship.{{sfn|Kleb|1897|p=27}}

Returning to the military sphere, Carus was granted the rank of ''[[Legatus legionis]]'', commanding the [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]]. Anthony Birley notes this was unusual assignment, for Legio XXX and Legio IX were both stationed in the same province, [[Germania Inferior]], and men were rarely assigned command of a legion in the same army as they had held a tribunate; Birley could only list 14 men with that distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''The Fasti of Roman Britain'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 17f&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to civilian life, serving as curator of the [[Via Flaminia]]. His next assignment was as ''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]'' (or governor) of the [[Roman province]] of [[Arabia Petraea]] from AD 142 to 143.{{sfn|Campbell|2006|p=62}} In 144, he was appointed [[Roman consul|suffect consul]], and this was followed up with an appointment as imperial ''[[Censor (ancient Rome)#Census beyond Rome|censitor]]'' of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]]. Finally, Carus was made ''Legatus Augusti pro praetore'', or governor, of [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]].{{sfn|Campbell|2006|p=62}}

Carus was a member of the ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', the ''[[collegia|collegium]]'' of Roman priests entrusted with the care of the [[Sibylline oracles]], and the ''[[sodales|sodales Flaviales]]'', a less prominent ''collegium''.{{sfn|Campbell|2006|p=62}}

== Family ==
Carus' son, also named Lucius Aemilius Carus, was ''Legatus Augusti pro praetore'' of the province of ''[[Roman Dacia|Tres Daciae]]'' in AD 174/175, and suffect consul at some point between 170 and 175.&lt;ref&gt;Géza Alföldy, ''Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen'' (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 224 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Marriott Fawckner Nicholls''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England|FRCS]], (12 May 1898 – 25 August 1969) was an English [[surgeon]] who specialised in the [[genitourinary tract]]. He served in the British Army in both the First and Second World Wars and was dean of the medical school at [[St George's Hospital]] for 20 years. At the age of 64 he became professor of surgery at the [[University of Khartoum]] in [[Sudan]], where he maintained the position until his death five years later.

==Early life and family==
Marriott Fawckner Nicholls was born in London on 12 May 1898, the son of Marriott Edwin Nicholls.&lt;ref name=plarr&gt;[http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E005984b.htm Nicholls, Sir Marriott Fawckner (1898&amp;ndash;1969).] Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online, Royal College of Surgeons. Retrieved 18 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his basic education at the [[City of London School]] after which he attended [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]], University of Cambridge. His studies were interrupted due to the First World War during which he served in the [[Royal Fusiliers]]. He was demobilised in 1919 with the rank of captain. He finally graduated in 1921.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Terry, &amp; David Uttley|title=A History of the Atkinson Morley's Hospital 1869-1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUYb2CtCQ_0C&amp;pg=PA64|year=2000|publisher=Athlone|location=London|isbn=978-0-567-63304-0|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;

In 1925 he married the pathologist [[Norah Schuster]] (1892-1991).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/f238c681-52d5-3688-9c95-4da413ee165b?component=6a4acc3b-ace1-3ff9-b163-23d30c78fb57 Norah Henriette Schuster, 1892–1991.] JISC Archives Hub. Retrieved 11 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 he married Mary Edith Harrison (died 1972).&lt;ref&gt;"Deaths", ''The Times'', 25 April, 1972, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Nicholls", ''The Times'', 26 April 1972, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as "Nick", he was fond of fishing and cricket and supported his medical school cricket club.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lance" /&gt;

==Career==
Nicholls undertook his clinical training at [[St George's Hospital]], qualifying in 1923.&lt;ref name=lance&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673669902554/pdfft?md5=5f911b12e94087c2838762d80f5c091e&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0140673669902554-main.pdf "Obituary: Marriott Fawckner Nicholls"], ''[[The Lancet]]'', Vol. 294, No. 7619 (6 September 1969), p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (FRCS) in 1926, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|bachelor of surgery]] degree in 1928. He received a [[Master of Surgery|masters degree in surgery]] in 1932. He won the Allingham Scholarship in surgery at St George's in 1925 and the Sir Francis Laking Research Scholarship in 1928–29 and in 1929–30. Some of his happiest times were when he became assistant curator of the museum there in 1926.&lt;ref name=plarr/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

He joined the consultant staff at St George's in 1932 and began a successful career in surgery with a specialism in genito-urinary work.&lt;ref name=plarr/&gt; He was visiting surgeon at the [[Atkinson Morley's Convalescent Hospital]] in 1936,&amp;nbsp;replacing Bryan Burns. He was dean of the Medical School from 1936 to 1956, whilst still actively at work as a surgeon. One of his major difficulties stemmed from the move of St George's Hospital from [[Hyde Park Corner]] to [[Tooting]], and he was successful in being the first to effectively transfer his department to this new site.&lt;ref name=Gould/&gt; He was a consultant to the [[Belgrave Children's Hospital]] and the [[Royal Chest Hospital]] and held the position of general surgeon at the [[Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital]]. In addition, he was chairman of the Court of Examiners at the Royal College of Surgeons for 2 years.&lt;ref name="plarr" /&gt; He also stood for the 1952 Royal College of Surgeons Council elections, however, [[Clement Price Thomas|Price Thomas]] received most votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2377527/pdf/annrcse00267-0003.pdf|title=1952 Royal College of Surgeons Council Elections|last=|first=|date=August 1952|work=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he served on the council of the [[British Association of Urological Surgeons]] and was president of the Section of Urology of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in 1960–61.&lt;ref name=plarr/&gt;

He served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] during the Second World War (1940-1946), starting as a lieutenant-colonel running a surgical division in Freetown, Sierra Leone, before becoming a brigadier with the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]], serving with [[South East Asia Command]]. He was made [[Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=plarr/&gt;

In 1962, Nicholls became professor of surgery at the [[University of Khartoum]], Sudan, in succession to [[Julian Taylor (surgeon)|Julian Taylor]]. He was knighted in 1969.&lt;ref name=plarr/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Nicholls died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, on 25 August 1969.&lt;ref name=plarr/&gt; He received an obituary in ''The Lancet'' and is recorded in [[Plarr's Lives of the Fellows]]. The "Nicholls Ward", at St George's Hospital, London, is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KOEhAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=st+george's+nicholls+ward+named+marriott&amp;dq=st+george's+nicholls+ward+named+marriott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnwNTm9K_ZAhWqIMAKHXPYDNUQ6AEIJzAA|title=A Short History of St. George's Hospital and the Origins of its Ward Names|last=Gould|first=Terry|last2=Uttley|first2=David|date=1997|publisher=Athlone Press|year=|isbn=9780485121261|place=London|page=141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peter Bergmann case''' is an unsolved mystery pertaining to the death of an unidentified man in [[County Sligo]], Ireland. From 12 to 16 June 2009, a man using the alias "Peter Bergmann" visited the coastal seaport town of [[Sligo]], in northwest Ireland. He used this alias to check into the Sligo City Hotel, where he stayed during the majority of his visit, and was described by the hotel staff and tenants as having a heavy German accent. The man's movements were captured on [[CCTV]] throughout the town; however, the details of his actions and intentions remain unknown. His interactions with other people were limited, and little is known of his origins or the reason for his visit to Sligo.

On the morning of 16 June, the naked body of the unidentified man was discovered at [[Rosses Point]] beach, a popular recreation destination and fishing area near Sligo. Despite having conducted a five-month investigation into the death of "Peter Bergmann", the police have never been able to identify the man or develop any leads in the case.&lt;ref name="irishcentral.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/The-man-who-went-to-Ireland-to-disappear-VIDEO.html|title=The man who went to Ireland to disappear (VIDEO)|date=3 March 2016|publisher=irishcentral.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mystery is often compared to the [[Tamam Shud case]], of Australia, in which an unidentified man was found dead on a beach shortly after [[World War II]], though the Peter Bergmann case has not achieved nearly the same amount of notoriety or international coverage. This case remains obscure to the public, and the official investigation has not extended to outside of Ireland.&lt;ref name="julienguintard"/&gt; 

The case received renewed attention in the 2010s. It was the subject of a 2013 documentary, ''The Last Days of Peter Bergmann'', which was shown at the 2014 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and has developed a small following on social media websites such as [[Reddit]], where readers have constructed theories of the case.&lt;ref name="aeon.co"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aeon.co/videos/in-2009-a-man-arrived-in-an-irish-town-with-a-plan-to-disappear-forever|title=In 2009, a man arrived in an Irish town with a plan to disappear forever – Aeon Videos|work=aeon.co|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
Bergmann had a slender build, short grey hair, and appeared to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten and a half inches tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven and his hair was clean and combed.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The man was well dressed wearing a black leather jacket, blue trousers (size 50), blue socks, a black leather belt and a pair of black shoes (size 44). His clothes were from [[C&amp;A]], a popular fashion retail store in Europe with most of its stores in Germany and Austria. From the man's appearance it was assumed he was a professional worker. He was a frequent smoker and several surveillance videos show him smoking outside often.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"&gt;http://www.rte.ie/tv/eartotheground/this_month.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of events==
On Friday, 12 June, the unknown man was first spotted at the Ulster Bus Depot in Derry between the time of 14:30 and 16:00. He boarded a bus headed to Sligo Station, carrying a black shoulder bag and a standard carry-on luggage bag. He arrived at 18:28 at the Sligo Bus Station and took a taxi to the Sligo City Hotel where he paid €65 per night in cash. While checking in, he gave the false name of "Peter Bergmann" and listed his address as Ainstettersn 15, 4472, [[Vienna]], Austria.{{fact|date=December 2017}} 

During his stay at the hotel, the man was seen on security camera footage leaving the building with a purple plastic bag full of items or personal effects. However, when he returned from his long walk he was no longer carrying the bag. It is presumed that he was disposing of his belongings throughout the town of Sligo and then folding the bag and putting it in his pocket. Authorities were unable to identify what he was throwing away in the public rubbish bins as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical as if he knew where to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him.&lt;ref name="aeon.co"/&gt;

On Saturday, 13 June, the man is seen walking to the General Post Office at 10:49 and purchases eight 82-cent stamps and airmail stickers.&lt;ref name="aeon.co"/&gt; 

On Sunday, 14 June, between 11:00 and 11:30 the man left the Sligo City Hotel and asked a taxi driver recommendations for a nice quiet beach where he could swim. The taxi driver stated that Rosses Point would be the best place and proceeded to drive the unknown man to the beach. The man returned with the same taxi and was dropped off at the bus station in Sligo.{{fact|date=December 2017}}  

The next day (Monday, 15 June), the man checked out of the hotel at 13:06 and handed in his room key. He left with a black shoulder bag, a purple plastic bag, and a different black luggage bag. He did not have the same black carry-on luggage bag he had when he first arrived in Sligo. He walked to the bus station via Quay Street, Wine Street and stopped at Quayside Shopping Centre and awkwardly waited in the doorway for a number of minutes. At 13:16 he left the Quayside Shopping Centre and walked along Wine Street in the direction of the bus station, still carrying all three bags. At 13:38 he ordered a [[cappuccino]] and a ham and cheese toasted sandwich at the bus station. While eating his food, he looked at pieces of paper that he kept in his pocket. After reading the pieces of paper, he tore the paper in half and threw it away in a nearby rubbish bin. He then mounted a bus that departed at 14:20 for Rosses Point. It was reported that he was seen by 16 people while walking on the beach, casually greeting the passersby.&lt;ref name="irishcentral.com"/&gt;  

The following morning, Tuesday 16 June, Arthur Kinsella and his son Brian, who was training for a [[triathlon]], found his naked body lying on the beach at 6:45 in the morning. Arthur and Brian said the [[Lord's Prayer]] for the man, and then called the [[An Garda Siochána|Gardaí]]. At 8:10, Dr Valerie McGowan officially pronounced the man dead. Following the discovery of the man's dead body, a five-month investigation was conducted by Gardaí.&lt;ref name="irishcentral.com"/&gt;

Upon the police investigation following his death, the address he gave belonged to a vacant lot. This implies that the man wanted to remain unknown and he pre-emptively planned his moves so that he could not be identified.&lt;ref name="aeon.co"/&gt;

==After death==
According to the [[post mortem]] report, the body of the man was found naked on Rosses Point beach with his clothes scattered along the shore, with no wallet, money or form of identification. The Sligo [[medical examiner]] deemed the cause of death to be drowning and found no signs of foul play that would give reason to believe the man's death was a homicide. The man's teeth were in good condition and showed signs of frequent dental work in his life. He had bridging, root canals, crowns and had a full gold tooth on the upper back right side of his mouth and a small silver filling along the gum of a tooth on the left side of the lower jaw.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt; 

Despite his well-groomed and dressed exterior, the man was in very poor health. The post mortem showed that he had advanced stages of prostate cancer and bone tumours. His heart showed signs of previous heart attacks and he possessed only one kidney, the other being removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bka.de/nn_198456/DE/Fahndungen/Personen/UnbekannteTote/IrlandMann/IrlandMann.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a man who had serious health conditions, the toxicology report stated that he had no medication of any sort in his system. The medical examiner stated that, due to his heart attacks and health status, the man would have been in significant pain and required prescription pain medicine or at least over-the-counter pain relievers to manage his pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmireland.net/2014/08/11/the-last-days-of-peter-bergmann-at-melbourne/|title='The Last Days of Peter Bergmann' at Melbourne – Film Ireland|publisher=filmireland.net|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a five-month investigation the body was buried in Sligo. The funeral was attended by four [[Gardaí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newstvgenre.altervista.org/rt-tens-tv-picks-for-tuesday-january-6/|title=News RTÉ TEN'S TV picks for Tuesday January 6|work=News TV Genre|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092447/http://newstvgenre.altervista.org/rt-tens-tv-picks-for-tuesday-january-6/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that they had contacted the Austrian police about the case and that the Austrian police commented that the Irish police had never contacted them. ''Le Monde'' also reported that there is no [[Interpol]] notice for the unidentified man, stating that as the body is recovered he does not fall into the two Interpol categories of 'missing person' or a 'wanted person'. It is up to his country of origin to report him as missing.&lt;ref name="julienguintard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/m-moyen-format/article/2015/03/12/l-homme-qui-voulait-effacer-sa-vie_4592522_4497271.html|title=L'homme qui voulait effacer sa vie|author=Julien Guintard|work=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model''' is a [[biological neuron model]] and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes [[action potentials]] in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]], the QIF model seeks only to produce [[action potential]]-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

A quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the [[autonomous differential equation]],

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a "spike" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.

When implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (&lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt;) and a reset value (&lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold, &lt;math&gt;x(t) \geq V_t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is immediately reset to &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Microscope with stained slide.jpg|right|thumb|A stained histologic specimen, sandwiched between a glass [[microscope slide]] and coverslip, mounted on the stage of a light microscope.]]

'''Staining''' is an auxiliary technique  used in [[microscopy]] to enhance contrast in the [[Microscope|microscopic]] image. Stains and [[dye]]s are frequently used in [[biology]] and [[medicine]] to highlight structures in [[biological tissue]]s for viewing, often with the aid of different [[microscope]]s. Stains may be used to define and examine bulk tissues (highlighting, for example, [[muscle fiber]]s or [[connective tissue]]), [[cell (biology)|cell]] populations (classifying different [[blood cell]]s, for instance), or [[organelle]]s within individual cells.

In [[biochemistry]] it involves adding a class-specific ([[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and [[fluorescent tag]]ging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in [[flow cytometry]], and to flag [[protein]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s in [[gel electrophoresis]].

Simple staining is staining with only one stain/dye. There are various kinds of multiple staining, many of which are examples of [[counterstain]]ing, [[differential staining]], or both, including double staining and triple staining.

Staining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline [[polymer]]s or the domain structures of [[block copolymer]]s.

== ''In vivo'' vs ''In vitro'' ==
''[[In vivo]]'' staining (also called vital staining or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues—''in vivo'' means "in life" (compare with ''[[in vitro]]'' staining).  By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s), their form (morphology) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.

''[[In vitro]]'' staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone.  Combined with specific protocols for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A [[counterstain]] is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.
* For example, [[crystal violet]] stains only [[Gram-positive]] bacteria in [[Gram staining]]. A [[safranin]] counterstain is applied that stains all cells, allowing identification of Gram-negative bacteria.

While ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are "fixed". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the  already dead cells are called [[vital stain]]s (e.g. [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called [[supravital stain]]s (e.g. [[New Methylene Blue]] and [[brilliant cresyl blue]] for [[reticulocyte]] staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others.  Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. "reticulocyte" look versus diffuse "polychromasia"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from {{gaps|1|:|5|000}} to {{gaps|1|:|500|000}} (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.

=== In vitro methods ===

==== Preparation ====
The preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned; some or all of the following procedures may be required.

'''[[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]]'''–which may itself consist of several steps–aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible.  Sometimes [[heat fixation]] is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate [[chemical bond]]s between [[protein]]s and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity.  Common fixatives  include [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], and/or [[picric acid]].  Pieces of tissue may be embedded in [[paraffin wax]] to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.

'''Permeabilization''' involves treatment of cells with (usually) a mild [[surfactant]].  This treatment dissolves [[cell membrane]]s, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.

'''[[Microscope slide#Mounting|Mounting]]''' usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis.  In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide.  For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a [[pap smear]]) the sample can be directly applied to a slide.  For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a [[microtome]]; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.

==== Standardization ====

Most of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as '''BSC-certified stains'''. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the [[Biological Stain Commission]] ('''BSC'''), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques. These standards are published in the Commission's journal [[Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Penney DP, Powers JM, Frank M, Churukian C |title=Analysis and testing of biological stains—the Biological Stain Commission Procedures |pmid=12564600| journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry |year= 2002 |volume=77|issue=5–6|pages=237–275 |doi=10.1080/714028210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan" /&gt;

Some vendors sell stains "certified" by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission. Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologicalstaincommission.org/vendors-list/|title=Vendors List - The Biological Stain Commission|author=|date=|website=biologicalstaincommission.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Negative staining ====
A simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful, even when the "positive staining" methods detailed below fail, is to use a [[negative stain]]. This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying [[nigrosin]] (a black synthetic dye) or [[India ink]] (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them.&lt;ref&gt;Clark G (1981) ''Staining Procedures'', 4th ed., Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins, p. 412, {{ISBN|0683017071}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.

=== Specific techniques ===

==== Gram staining ====
{{main|Gram staining}}
[[Gram staining]] is used to determine gram status to classify bacteria broadly. It is based on the composition of their [[cell wall]]. Gram staining uses [[Gentian violet|crystal violet]] to stain cell walls, [[iodine]] as a mordant, and a [[fuchsin]] or [[safranin]] counterstain to mark all bacteria. Gram status is important in medicine; the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some [[antibiotic]]s.

[[Gram-positive]] bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their [[cell wall]] is typically &lt;!-- but not always !! --&gt; rich with [[peptidoglycan]] and lacks the secondary membrane and [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.

On most Gram-stained preparations, [[Gram-negative]] organisms appear red or pink because they are counterstained. Because of presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet – iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. Also, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.

==== Endospore staining ====
{{main|Endospore staining}}
[[Endospore staining]] is used to identify the presence or absence of [[endospore]]s, which make bacteria very difficult to kill. This is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''.

==== Ziehl-Neelsen stain ====
[[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing is used to stain species of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.

The stains used are the red coloured [[Carbol fuchsin]] that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as [[Methylene blue]]

==== Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining ====
[[Image:Emphysema H and E.jpg|right|thumb|Microscopic view of a histologic specimen of human [[lung]] tissue stained with [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]].]]
[[H&amp;E stain|Haematoxylin and eosin stain]]ing protocol is used frequently in [[histology]] to examine thin sections of tissue.  [[Haematoxylin]] stains cell nuclei blue, while [[eosin]] stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.  Eosin is strongly absorbed by [[red blood cell]]s, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H &amp; E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink. When the staining is done by a machine, the subtle differences in eosinophilia are often lost. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.

==== Papanicolaou staining ====
[[Papanicolaou stain]]ing, or Pap staining, is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from various bodily secretions. It is frequently used to stain [[Pap smear]] specimens. It uses a combination of [[haematoxylin]], [[Orange G]], [[eosin Y]], [[Light Green SF yellowish]], and sometimes [[Bismarck Brown Y]].

==== PAS staining ====
[[Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus [[Histoplasma]].]]
[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] staining is used to mark [[carbohydrate]]s ([[glycogen]], [[glycoprotein]], [[proteoglycan]]s). It is used to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases.

==== Masson's trichrome ====
[[Masson's trichrome]] is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol.  The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding [[connective tissue]].  Most recipes produce red [[keratin]] and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of [[collagen]] and [[bone]], light red or pink staining of [[cytoplasm]], and black [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].

==== Romanowsky stains ====
The [[Romanowsky stain]]s are all based on a combination of eosinate (chemically [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] [[eosin]]) and [[methylene blue]] (sometimes with its oxidation products [[azure A]] and [[azure B]]).  Common variants include [[Wright's stain]], [[Jenner's stain]], May-Grunwald stain, [[Leishman stain]] and [[Giemsa stain]].

All are used to examine [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] samples.  They are preferred over H&amp;E for inspection of blood cells because different types of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished.  All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as [[malaria]].

==== Silver staining ====
[[Image:Histoplasma in granuloma gms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gömöri methenamine silver stain]] demonstrating [[histoplasma]] (black round balls).]]
[[Silver stain]]ing is the use of [[silver]] to stain [[histologic section]]s. This kind of staining is important especially to show [[protein]]s (for example type III [[collagen]]) and [[DNA]]. It is used to show both substances inside and outside [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Silver staining is also used in [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]].

Some cells are ''argentaffin''. These [[Redox|reduce]] silver solution to metallic silver after [[formalin]] [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]. This method was discovered by Italian [[Camillo Golgi]], by using a reaction between [[silver nitrate]] and [[potassium dichromate]], thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see [[Golgi's method]]). Other cells are ''argyrophilic''. These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a [[Reducing agent|reductant]], for example [[hydroquinone]] or formalin.

==== Sudan staining ====
[[Sudan stain]]ing is the use of Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, usually [[lipid]]s. [[Sudan III]], [[Sudan IV]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Osmium tetroxide]], and [[Sudan Black B]] are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of [[fecal fat]] to diagnose [[steatorrhea]].

==== Conklin's staining ====
Special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye, once stained, they do not decolourize.

== Common biological stains ==
Different stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas.  Some of the most common biological stains are listed below.  Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.

=== Acridine orange ===
[[Acridine orange]] (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = A Technique for Staining the Superficial Cells of Plucked Hair Follicles and Other Solid Tissues | url = | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Bismarck brown ===
[[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck brown]] (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid [[mucin]]s.

=== Carmine ===
[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|[[Carmine]] staining of a parasitic flatworm.]]
[[Carmine]] is an intensely red dye used to stain [[glycogen]], while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain.  Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually [[aluminum]].

=== Coomassie blue ===
[[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie blue]] (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour.  It is often used in gel electrophoresis.

===Cresyl violet===

[[Cresyl violet stain|Cresyl violet]] stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically [[Nissl body|nissl]] bodies. Often used in brain research.

=== Crystal violet ===
[[Crystal violet]], when combined with a suitable mordant, stains [[cell wall]]s purple.  Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.

=== DAPI ===
[[DAPI]] is a [[fluorescent]] nuclear stain, excited by [[ultraviolet]] light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to [[DNA]].  DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.&lt;ref&gt;Levenfus, I.: ''An efficient method for counting DAPI-stained cells using Fiji''. Grin: Munich. 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-640-86284-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eosin ===
[[Eosin]] is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to [[cytoplasm]]ic material, [[cell membrane]]s, and some extracellular structures.  It also imparts a strong red colour to [[red blood cell]]s.  Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.  There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin.  Most often used is eosin Y (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast.  The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast.  The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.

=== Ethidium bromide ===
[[Ethidium bromide]] [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of [[apoptosis]] – such cells have much more permeable [[biological membrane|membranes]]. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in [[gel electrophoresis]]. The stain may also be used in conjunction with [[acridine orange]] (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.

=== Acid fuchsine ===
[[Fuchsine|Acid fuchsine]] may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].
Acid fuchsine is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsine stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome.  In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsine imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsine is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).

=== Haematoxylin ===
[[Haematoxylin]] (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain.  Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.  It is most often used with eosin in H&amp;E (haematoxylin and eosin) staining—one of the most common procedures in [[histology]].

=== Hoechst stains ===
[[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] is a ''bis''-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the ''minor groove'' of [[DNA]]. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]]: ''Hoechst 33258'' and ''Hoechst 33342''. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal [[hydroxyl]] group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the [[plasma membrane]]. Hoechst 33342 contains an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage

=== Iodine ===
[[Iodine]] is used in [[chemistry]] as an indicator for [[starch]]. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as [[Gram staining]], used in [[microbiology]].
[[Lugol's iodine|Lugol's solution]] or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] more visible. Iodine is also used as a mordant in Gram's staining, it enhances dye to enter through the pore present in the cell wall/membrane.

=== Malachite green ===
[[Malachite green]] (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the [[Gimenez stain|Gimenez staining technique]] for bacteria.  It can also be used to directly stain [[endospore|spores]].

=== Methyl green ===
[[Methyl green]] is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prieto|first1=Daniel|last2=Aparicio|first2=Gonzalo|last3=Morande|first3=Pablo E.|last4=Zolessi|first4=Flavio R.|title=A fast, low cost, and highly efficient fluorescent DNA labeling method using methyl green|journal=Histochemistry and Cell Biology|date=27 March 2014|volume=142|issue=3|pages=335–345|doi=10.1007/s00418-014-1215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.

=== Methylene blue ===
[[Methylene blue]] is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain the blood film and used in cytology.

=== Neutral red ===
[[Neutral red]] (or toluylene red) stains [[Nissl body|Nissl substance]] red.  It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.

=== Nile blue ===
[[Nile blue]] (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue.  It may be used with living cells.

=== Nile red ===
[[Nile red]] (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with [[sulfuric acid]].  This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue.  Nile red is a [[lipophilic]] stain; it will accumulate in [[lipid]] globules inside cells, staining them red.  Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.

=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===
[[Osmium tetraoxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.

=== Propidium Iodide ===
[[Propidium iodide]] is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining

=== Rhodamine ===
[[Rhodamine]] is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.

=== Safranine ===
[[Safranine]] (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye.  It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Berlyn GP, Miksche JP (1976). ''Botanical Microtechnique and Cytochemistry''. Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.

The incorrect spelling "safranin" is in common use. The -ine ending is appropriate  
for safranine O because this dye is an amine,&lt;ref&gt;Baker JR (1958). ''Principles of Biological Microtechnique''. pp. 329 ff. London: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11871748|year=2001|author1=Kiernan|first1=J. A.|title=Classification and naming of dyes, stains and fluorochromes|journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry|volume=76|issue=5–6|pages=261–78|doi=10.1080/bih.76.5-6.261.278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1859960995|title=Conn's Biological Stains: A Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Fluorochromes for Use in Biology and Medicine |year=2002|editor1=Horobin, Richard|editor2=Kiernan, John |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stainability of tissues==
Tissues which take up stains are called '''chromatic'''.  Chromosomes were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.

Positive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix ''-philic''. For example, tissues that stain with an [[azure stain]] may be referred to as [[azurophil]]ic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]] for tissues that stain by [[acidic]] stains (most notably [[eosin]]), [[basophilic]] when staining in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dyes, and ''amphophilic''&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/amphophilic thefreedictionary.com &gt; amphophilic] Citing: ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 3 ed. 2007 Elsevier, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, [[chromophobe|chromophobic]] tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.

== Electron microscopy ==
As in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]]. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.

===Phosphotungstic acid===
[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is a common [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es, [[nerve]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other biological tissue materials.

=== Osmium tetroxide ===
[[Osmium tetroxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.  Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. {{chem|OsO|4}} is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.

=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===
[[Ruthenium tetroxide]] is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.

Other chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:
[[ammonium molybdate]], [[cadmium iodide]], [[carbohydrazide]], [[ferric chloride]], [[hexamine]], [[indium trichloride]], [[lanthanum nitrate]], [[lead acetate]], [[lead citrate]], [[lead(II) nitrate]], [[periodic acid]], [[phosphomolybdic acid]], [[potassium ferricyanide]], [[potassium ferrocyanide]], [[ruthenium red]], [[silver nitrate]], [[silver proteinate]], [[sodium chloroaurate]], [[thallium nitrate]], [[thiosemicarbazide]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl nitrate]], and [[vanadyl sulfate]].

'''''The House of Tomorrow''''' is a 1949 animated theatrical short directed by [[Tex Avery]]. It was part of a series of cartoons Avery did satirizing technology of the future which included: ''[[The Car of Tomorrow (cartoon)|The Car of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Farm of Tomorrow]]'', and ''[[The T.V. of Tomorrow]]''. These were satires of live action promotional films that were commonly shown in theaters at the time.

The film is a straightforward narrated showcase of appliances said to be found in a typical house in the year 2050, roughly a hundred years after the cartoon was made, each one actually an outlandish joke. Most of the time the inventions following a similar pattern of being made for each member of the family ending with a fatal version for the "[[mother-in-law]]".

==Plot ==
{{plot|date=December 2016}}
*The cartoon starts as the narrator presents the audience "The House of Tomorrow", completely "pre-fabricated and ready to set up" (all in one little wrapped up gift). The narrator's voice is provided by radio actor [[Frank Graham (voice actor)|Frank Graham]].
*The narrator presents the doors for each member of the family: one for Fido (the dog), Junior (the child, which is stained with muddy handprints), the Mother (which is widened to accommodate her hips - "she just ''loves'' sweets"), the Father (a saloon doorway), and the mother-in-law (with chains, locks, boards, and welcome mat that reads ''"SCRAM"'').
*Inside the house, the narrator talks about the thick carpeting. The butler gets into the carpet and he sinks deeply inside it.
*The narrator then presents how to get moisture in the room. Just pressing a button reveals a rain cloud that floats across the room.
*Next is the trophy room ''"where it contains many rare exhibits of the hunt"''. The trophy of an elk shows that it was killed June 8, 1925, a ram was killed April 20, 1933, a tiger was killed September 3, 1942, and a champagne bottle was killed New Year's Eve (for which the song [[Auld Lang Syne]] is heard played on a wobbly violin).
*Next is for those whose house has that ''"too-rich appearance"'' and if those ''"mean [[tax assessor]]s knocks on your [audience] door"''. With a press of a button, the house (along with the husband and wife) will look poor.
*Next, the narrator presents a machine that helps parents answer Junior's many questions. The father's voice on the machine will yell: "Ah, shut up!", shoving a toilet plunger into Junior's mouth.
*Next, the narrator presents an "automatic sandwich-maker" that cuts salami and loaf of bread and throws each sandwich to the dishes, as if dealing cards.
*The narrator then presents a sun-lamp that helps people turn rich golden brown on both sides with a large spatula.
*The narrator presents a "new proposed guest chair that adjust itself to any type of visitor" for the tall, short, and the mother-in-law (an electric chair).
*Next, the narrator presents a three screened television set for each member of the family for the housewife (a cooking show), kiddies (a western), and the tired businessman (showing a beautiful lady, actress [[Joi Lansing]], which causes the narrator lose his train of thought).
*The narrator presents medicine cabinets for the father (shaving razors, pills, toothpaste, etc.), mother (various cosmetics and the like), Junior (a large bottle of [[caster oil]] with a spoon), and the mother-in-law (bottles of poison).
*The narrator presents an "auto-electric shaver" that literally takes everything (except the eyes); mouth, nose, and hair.
*The narrator then presents a new toaster that lets people pop up instead of the toast.
*The narrator shows an "auto-matic orange-juicer" that removes all the seeds from the juice, by throwing them into a spittoon.
*The narrator presents a frying pan that contains a small mallet to prevent the frying bacon from curling-up.
*The narrator presents a modern stove that has a clear view door to let people look into their oven (everything). A live roasted chicken screams and uses the blinds to cover itself.
*The narrator then presents a device that helps remove the burps from the radishes.
*The narrator ([[Don Messick]], in this sequence) presents a pressure cooker (the streamline job of tomorrow) that lets people simply put in their steak, peas, carrots, eggs, and tomatoes. As the cooker is turned on, it explodes within seconds, sending the food high up in the air, along with the now soot-covered wife.
*The narrator presents a refrigerator that helps clear of mystery of how the light goes on and off when one is closing the door. It has a small window that shows a little creature turning off the refrigerator light when it's closed.
*The narrator then finishes the tour of the house. Suddenly, a title card pops out of the screen:

:''PATRONS ATTENTION!!
:Due to numerous requests of the tired business-men in the audience, we are going to show you the girl again.''

:The [[Management]]

*The short ends with the shot of the woman ([[Joi Lansing]]) in the TV set for the tired businessman.

'''The Terrible Dogfish''' ({{lang-it|Il Terribile Pescecane}}) is a [[Squalidae|dogfish]]-like [[Sea monster|sea-monster]], which appears in [[Carlo Collodi]]'s 1883 book ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (''Le avventure di Pinocchio''). It is described as being larger than a five story building, a kilometre long (not including the tail) and sporting three rows of [[teeth]] in a mouth that can easily accommodate a [[train]]. So fearsome is its reputation, that in chapter XXXIV, it is revealed that the Dogfish is nicknamed "The [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] of fish and fishermen" (''L'Attila dei pesci e dei pescatori'').

==Role==
The Dogfish is first mentioned in chapter XXIV, when Pinocchio, searching for his creator [[Mister Geppetto]], is informed by a [[dolphin]] that he has likely been swallowed by the creature which "...for some days has come to wreak extermination and [[wikt:desolation|desolation]] in our waters". The Dogfish is later mentioned in chapter XXVI by Pinocchio's school friends on the Island of the Busy Bees (''Isola delle Api Industriose''), who tell him that the creature has been sighted on the coast, to coax Pinocchio away from school.

The Dogfish makes its first appearance in chapter XXXIV when Pinocchio, recently transformed from a donkey to his puppet form, has entered the sea to escape from his former handler. [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair]], in the form of a mountain goat, warns Pinocchio of the Dogfish too late, and the puppet is swallowed whole, along with a tuna whom Pinocchio befriends. Pinocchio discovers his father, who reveals that he has been trapped within the Dogfish for two years, surviving on ship supplies swallowed by the creature. When the Dogfish is revealed to suffer from [[asthma]], a condition that forces it to sleep with its head raised from the water, Pinocchio carries Geppetto on his back and swims out of the Dogfish's mouth. When Pinocchio's strength begins to fail, the tuna helps them reach the shore.

==In Disney version==
[[Image:Monstro wake.jpg|thumb|"Monstro" as portrayed in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940).]]
In the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the sea-monster (named '''Monstro''', the term for [[monster]] in Portuguese and in [[wikt:archaic#Adjective|archaic]] Italian) is portrayed as a terrible [[Whale|giant whale]] (a combination of a [[sperm whale]] and [[blue whale]]), and first mentioned in a message from the Blue Fairy that Geppetto, sailing to find Pinocchio, has been swallowed by the creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DvxHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=the+coachman+pinocchio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZiGVVZy1I8KyswHq-Z74Ag&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Monstro&amp;f=false |title=Pinocchio Goes Postmodern: Perils of a Puppet in the United States - Richard Wunderlich, Thomas J. Morrissey |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two search for the monster, but are frustrated by the fear the various [[nekton]] display at the mention of his name. After finally discovering Monstro, who swallows Pinocchio, he discovers Geppetto in Monstro's [[throat]]. There, Pinocchio frees them by starting a fire and thus prompting Monstro to expel them from his mouth, whereupon Monstro becomes enraged and pursues them, but fails to recapture them and, when Pinocchio pulls Geppetto into a cove, Monstro crashes against the rocks surrounding it, possibly killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DvxHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=the+coachman+pinocchio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZiGVVZy1I8KyswHq-Z74Ag&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=monstro&amp;f=false |title=Pinocchio Goes Postmodern: Perils of a Puppet in the United States - Richard Wunderlich, Thomas J. Morrissey |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monstro was animated by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the go-to man for action sequences among Disney's [[Nine Old Men]].

===In ''Kingdom Hearts''=== 
The Disney version of Monstro also appears in the [[video game]] ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' as a supporting world, where Pinocchio and Geppetto temporarily live until being rescued.  Within Monstro dwell many Heartless, including one called the Parasite Cage, which traps Pinocchio in its cage-like stomach, and delivers the puppet to Riku, who wishes to use Pinocchio's heart to rescue Kairi.  After Kingdom Hearts is sealed, Monstro presumably returns to his world. He later reappears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', as a figment of Sora and Riku's memories. Monstro himself is not physically seen, but card rooms resembling his bowels are explored. In the ''Final Mix'' version of ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', Monstro appears as a boss fight in the Mirage Arena. He reappears as a sub-world in his homeworld, Prankster's Paradise, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''.

===In ''Bonkers'' (TV series)===
In addition, Monstro had a guest star appearance in a ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' comic story titled "Whale of a Tale", published in the December 1994 issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]''. In this story, he is a polite actor playing a role in ''Pinocchio'', who has not found work in the movies since then; he is duped by a gang of crooks, posing as a movie company, into breaking into banks for them to rob, and upon finding out the truth, helps Bonkers catch the criminals.

===In ''Fantasmic!''===
The Whale also plays a notable role in the [[Disneyland]] version of [[Fantasmic!]], and also has a smaller role in the Dancing Bubbles scene in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] version.

==Portrayals in other media==
*In Giuliano Cenci's 1972 adaptation ''[[Un burattino di nome Pinocchio]]'', the Terrible Dogfish is portrayed similarly to that of the book, but not mentioned before its initial appearance.
*In the 1984 episode of ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', the Terrible Dogfish is replaced with a gigantic [[killer whale]].
*In the 1992 [[Direct-to-video|direct to video]] [[Pinocchio (1992 film)|adaptation]] by [[GoodTimes Entertainment]], the Terrible Dogfish is portrayed like its original.
*In [[Steve Barron]]s 1996 live action film ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the Terrible Dogfish (identified as "the sea monster") is combined with [[The Coachman]] and [[Mangiafuoco]] into the villainous Lorenzini (played by [[Udo Kier]]), who is transformed after being submerged in the cursed water which turned boys into donkeys.
*In the 2002 Italian film ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the Terrible Dogfish is depicted as a colossal [[Great white shark|Great White Shark]].
*In the anime manga series ''[[MÄR]]'', Pinocchio's Guardian ARM Fastico Galleon is an enormous whale-like creature based on Monstro of the Disney animated film.
*In ABC's ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon A Time]]'', Monstro makes a brief appearance in the episode "The Stranger", in which his Disney role is reiterated.
*It appears in the 2012 ''[[Pinocchio (2012 film)|Pinocchio]]'' film adaptation.

[[Chemistry]] is often called '''the central science''' because of its role in connecting the [[physical science]]s,&lt;ref&gt;John M. Malin “International Year of Chemistry - 2011 Chemistry – our life, our future” {{cite web |url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/CNBP_022050/pdf/CNBP_022050.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323220047/http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/CNBP_022050/pdf/CNBP_022050.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which include chemistry, with the [[biology|life sciences]] and [[applied science]]s such as [[medicine]] and [[engineering]].  The nature of this relationship is one of the main topics in the [[philosophy of chemistry]] and in [[scientometrics]]. The phrase was popularized by its use in a textbook by [[Theodore L. Brown]] and H. Eugene LeMay, titled ''Chemistry: The Central Science'', which was first published in 1977, with a thirteenth edition published in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore L. Brown and H. Eugene LeMay ''Chemistry: The Central Science''. Prentice Hall, 1977. {{ISBN|0-13-128769-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central role of chemistry can be seen in the systematic and hierarchical classification of the sciences by [[Auguste Comte]] in which each discipline provides a more general framework for the area it precedes (mathematics → astronomy → physics → chemistry → physiology and medicine → social sciences).&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Reinhardt. ''Chemical Sciences in the 20th Century: Bridging Boundaries''. Wiley-VCH, 2001. {{ISBN|3-527-30271-9}}. Pages 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Balaban and Klein have more recently proposed a diagram showing partial ordering of sciences in which chemistry may be argued is “the central science” since it provides a significant degree of branching.&lt;ref&gt;”Is chemistry ‘The Central Science’? How are different sciences related? Co-citations, reductionism, emergence, and posets” Alexandru T. Balaban, Douglas J. Klein ''Scientometrics'' '''2006''', ''69'', 615-637. {{doi|10.1007/s11192-006-0173-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In forming these connections the lower field [[Irreducible (philosophy)|cannot be fully reduced]] to the higher ones.  It is recognized that the lower fields possess [[Emergence|emergent]] ideas and concepts that do not exist in the higher fields of science.

Thus chemistry is built on an understanding of laws of physics that govern particles such as [[atoms]], [[protons]], [[neutrons]], [[electrons]], [[thermodynamics]], etc. although it has been shown that it has not been “fully 'reduced' to [[quantum mechanics]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Scerri “Philosophy of Chemistry” Chemistry International, Vol. 25 No. 3 [http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2003/2503/2_philosophy.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Scerri ''The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance''. Oxford University Press, '''2006'''. {{ISBN|0-19-530573-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts such as the [[Periodic table|periodicity]] of the elements and [[chemical bond]]s in chemistry are emergent in that they are more than the underlying forces that are defined by [[physics]].

In the same way, biology cannot be fully reduced to chemistry despite the fact that the machinery that is responsible for life is composed of [[molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R Livesay “At the crossroads of biomacromolecular research: highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the field” Chemistry Central Journal 2007, 1:4 {{DOI|10.1186/1752-153X-1-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the machinery of [[evolution]] may be described in terms of chemistry by the understanding that it is a [[mutation]] in the order of [[genetics|genetic]] [[base pair]]s in the [[DNA]] of an organism.  However, chemistry cannot fully describe the process since it does not contain concepts such as [[natural selection]] that are responsible for driving evolution.  Chemistry is fundamental to biology since it provides a methodology for studying and understanding the molecules that compose cells.

Connections made by chemistry are formed through various sub-disciplines that utilize concepts from multiple scientific disciplines.  Chemistry and physics are both needed in the areas of [[physical chemistry]], [[nuclear chemistry]], and [[theoretical chemistry]].  Chemistry and biology intersect in the areas of [[biochemistry]], [[medicinal chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[chemical biology]], [[molecular genetics]], and [[immunochemistry]]. Chemistry and the earth sciences intersect in areas like [[geochemistry]] and [[hydrology]].

==Operational history==

===First War Patrol===
Following shakedown off the East Coast, ''Harder'' sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]], and after a short stay there, she departed on her first war patrol 7 June 1943. Cruising off the coast of [[Japan]], the submarine worked her way inside a picket line and sighted her first target 22 June. She made a [[radar]] approach on the surface and fired four [[torpedo]]es at the two-ship [[convoy]], hitting the seaplane transport ''Sagara Maru'' (7189 BRT) (which was beached to prevent sinking, but later destroyed). She returned to Midway 7 July.

===Second War Patrol===
''Harder'' began her second war patrol 24 August 1943 from [[Pearl Harbor]], and after touching at [[Midway Island]], she again headed for the Japanese coast. While patrolling off [[Honshū]] on 9 September, she attacked and sank ''Koyo Maru'' and later that night ran by an escort ship at a range of {{convert|1200|yards|m|-2}} without being detected. Two days later the submarine encountered a convoy. After running ahead to improve her firing position, she sank cargo ship ''Yoko Maru'' with a spread of three torpedoes. Continuing her patrol, ''Harder'' sighted two more ships 13 September, but she was forced down by enemy planes while firing torpedoes. Escorts kept the submarine down with a severe [[depth charge]] attack which lasted for over two days and almost exhausted her batteries. After evading the Japanese ships, ''Harder'' detected her next target 19 September; a torpedo sent ''Kachisan Maru'' to the bottom almost immediately. Though running in bad weather, ''Harder'' continued to find good targets. On 23 September she sank the 4,500 ton freighter ''Kowa Maru'' and the 5,800 ton tanker ''Daishin Maru'', off [[Nagoya Bay]]. Her torpedoes expended, ''Harder'' turned eastward 28 September. After shooting up two [[Naval trawler|armed trawlers]] 29 September, she touched Midway 4 October and arrived Pearl Harbor four days later.

===Third War Patrol===
For her third war patrol ''Harder'' teamed with {{USS|Snook|SS-279|3}} and {{USS|Pargo|SS-264|3}} to form a deadly and coordinated attack group (a "[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]"). Departing 30 October 1943 for the [[Mariana Islands]], ''Harder'' encountered a target 12 November. Promptly dispatching this one, she surfaced and sighted a trawler-escort damaged by the explosion of one of her own depth charges. Submerging again until sunset, the submarine sank the damaged ship with gunfire, then turned toward [[Saipan]] in search of new targets. Sighting three ''marus'' on 19 November, she radioed her companions and closed for attack. After passing close by an escorting [[destroyer]], ''Harder'' fired six torpedoes at two ships, sinking ''Udo Maru''. As depth charges began to fall, she pressed the attack; two more torpedoes finished ''Hokko Maru''. ''Harder'' climbed to [[periscope depth]] after nightfall to finish off the third ''maru''. Shortly before midnight, she fired several more shots at 6,000-ton ''Nikkō Maru'', but the Japanese ship stubbornly refused to sink. A brave, but doomed, enemy crew kept the cargo ship afloat until ''Harder'' had expended all torpedoes, many of which ran erratically. Rough weather the next day finally sank the damaged target. ''Harder'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 30 November, then sailed to the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] for overhaul.

===Fourth War Patrol===

Returning to action in the Pacific, ''Harder'' reached Pearl Harbor on 27 February 1944 and departed on her fourth war patrol 16 March in company with {{USS|Seahorse|SS-304|3}}.

She headed for the western [[Caroline Islands]] where she was assigned duty as lifeguard ship for downed aviators. During American air strikes against [[Woleai]] on 1 April, ''Harder'' received word of an injured pilot awaiting rescue from the beach of a small enemy-held island west of Woleai. Protected by air cover, she nosed against a reef, maintained her position with both propellers, and sent a boat ashore through breaking surf. Despite Japanese snipers, boiling shoals, and the precarious position of the submarine, the daring rescue succeeded, and the intrepid submarine returned to the open sea.

[[File:Japanese destroyer Tanikaze at anchor in April 1941.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Japanese destroyer Tanikaze (1940)|Tanikaze]]'' in 1941]]
On 13 April an enemy plane sighted ''Harder'' north of the western Carolines and reported her position to the patrolling [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Ikazuchi (1931)|''Ikazuchi'']].  As the enemy ship closed to within {{convert|900|yd|m}} ''Harder'' fired a spread of torpedoes that sank the attacker within five minutes. Dealey's terse report became famous—"Expended four torpedoes and one Jap destroyer." Four days later ''Harder'' spotted a merchant ship escorted by destroyers. Firing four torpedoes, she sank the 7,000 ton ''Matsue Maru'' and damaged one of the escorts. Then, adding to the enemy's misery, she returned to [[Woleai]] where she surfaced on the morning of 20 April to deliver a shore bombardment under cover of a rain squall. She terminated this highly varied and successful patrol at [[Fremantle submarine base]], [[Western Australia]] 3 May.

===Fifth War Patrol: Philippine Mission===
Even greater successes lay ahead. Having sunk one destroyer, ''Harder'' joined the all-out hunt against Japanese destroyers, once considered the most dangerous of foes. Assigned the area around the Japanese fleet anchorage at [[Tawi-Tawi]], ''Harder'' departed Fremantle on 26 May 1944 with {{USS|Redfin|SS-272|3}} and headed for the [[Celebes Sea]].

On 6 June ''Harder'' entered the heavily patrolled [[Sibutu Passage]] between Tawi-Tawi and North [[Borneo]] and encountered a convoy of three [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s and two destroyers. She gave chase on the surface but was illuminated by the moon. As one of the destroyers turned to attack, ''Harder'' submerged, turned her stern to the charging destroyer, and fired three torpedoes at range of {{convert|1100|yd|m|-2}}. Two struck [[Japanese destroyer Minazuki (1926)|''Minazuki'']] and exploded; the destroyer sank within five minutes. After attacking the second escort without success, ''Harder'' was held down by a depth charge attack while the convoy escaped.

Early next morning an enemy plane spotted ''Harder''. The submarine soon sighted another destroyer searching the area for her. As before, ''Harder'' took the initiative as the enemy closed the range. The sub fired three torpedoes at short range, and two of them struck amidships, one detonating the ship's magazine with a tremendous explosion. [[Japanese destroyer Hayanami|''Hayanami'']] sank a minute later. Following the inevitable depth charge attack, ''Harder'' transited the Sibutu Passage after dark and steamed to the northeast coast of [[Borneo]]. There on the night of 8 June she picked up six Australian [[Coastwatcher]]s, and early next day she headed once more for Sibutu Passage.

That evening ''Harder'' sighted two enemy destroyers patrolling the narrowest part of the passage, just a few miles from Tawi-Tawi. After submerging, she made an undetected approach and at {{convert|1000|yd|m|-2}} fired four torpedoes at the overlapping targets. The second and third torpedoes blasted ''[[Japanese destroyer Tanikaze (1940)|Tanikaze]]''; she sank almost immediately, her boilers erupting with a terrific explosion. The fourth shot hit the second ship, which exploded with a blinding flash. Within minutes ''Harder'' surfaced to survey the results, but both ships had disappeared. Soon afterward, she underwent the inevitable depth charge attack by enemy planes, then she set course for a point south of Tawi-Tawi to reconnoiter.

On the afternoon of 10 June ''Harder'' sighted a large Japanese task force, including three [[battleship]]s and four [[cruiser]]s with screening destroyers. An overhead plane spotted the submarine at periscope depth and a screening escort promptly steamed at {{convert|35|kn|km/h}} toward her position. Once again, ''Harder'' became the aggressive adversary. As the range closed to {{convert|1500|yd|m}}, she fired three torpedoes on a "down the throat" shot, then went deep to escape the onrushing destroyer and certain depth charge attack. Within a minute two torpedoes blasted the ship with violent force just as ''Harder'' passed her some {{convert|80|ft|m}} below. The deafening explosions shook the submarine far worse than the depth charges and aerial bombs which the infuriated enemy dropped during the next two hours. When she surfaced, ''Harder'' saw only a lighted buoy marking the spot where the unidentified destroyer either sank or was heavily damaged.

''Harder'' reconnoitered Tawi-Tawi anchorage 11 June and sighted additional enemy cruisers and destroyers. At 16:00 she headed for the open sea and that night transmitted her observations which were of vital importance to Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]]'s fleet prior to the decisive [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. ''Harder'' steamed to Darwin on 21 June for additional torpedoes, and, after patrolling the [[Flores Sea]] south of the Celebes Islands (with Admiral [[Ralph Christie]] aboard), she ended the patrol at Darwin on 3 July.

The important results of ''Harder'''s fifth war patrol have caused some to call it the most brilliant of the war. Not only did ''Harder'' further deplete the critical supply of destroyers by sinking four of them and heavily damaging or destroying another one in four days, but her frequent attacks and a rash of enemy contact reports on this fleeting marauder so frightened Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]] that he believed Tawi-Tawi surrounded by submarines. As a result, Admiral [[Jisaburo Ozawa]]'s Mobile Fleet departed Tawi-Tawi a day ahead of schedule. The premature departure upset the Japanese battle plans, and forced Ozawa to delay his carrier force in the [[Philippine Sea]], thus contributing to the stunning defeat suffered by the Japanese in the ensuing battle.

''Harder's'' radioman, Calvin Bull, was awarded a Bronze Star medal for his role in sinking the five destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15307855/nebraskan_awarded_bronze_star_medal/|title=Nebraskan Awarded Bronze Star Medal|last=|first=|date=1945-03-26|work=Beatrice Daily Sun|access-date=2017-11-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=8|via={{Open Access}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixth War Patrol===
''Harder'', accompanied by {{USS|Hake|SS-256|3}} and {{USS|Haddo|SS-255|3}}, departed Fremantle on 5 August 1944 for her sixth and final war patrol. Assigned to the [[South China Sea]] off [[Luzon]], the wolf pack headed northward. On 21 August ''Harder'' and ''Haddo'' joined {{USS|Ray|SS-271|3}}, {{USS|Guitarro|SS-363|3}}, and {{USS|Raton|SS-270|3}} in a coordinated attack against a convoy off [[Palawan Bay]], [[Mindoro]]. The Japanese lost four passenger-cargo ''maru''s, possibly one by ''Harder''.

====Battle of Dasol Bay====
Early the next day, ''Harder'' and ''Haddo'' attacked and destroyed three coastal defense vessels off Bataan, ''Harder'' sinking frigates [[Japanese escort ship Matsuwa|''Matsuwa'']] and [[Japanese escort ship Hiburi|''Hiburi'']]; then, joined by ''Hake'' that night, they headed for [[Caiman Point]], Luzon. At dawn 23 August ''Haddo'' attacked and fatally damaged  {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Asakaze|1922|2}} off [[Cape Bolinao]]. Enemy trawlers towed the stricken destroyer to [[Dasol Bay]], and ''Haddo'', her torpedoes expended, informed ''Harder'' and ''Hake'' the following night of the attack and left the wolf-pack for replenishment at [[Biak]].
[[File:Japanese destroyer Asakaze around 1924.jpg|thumb|left|''DD-Asakaze'' around 1924]]
[[Image:USS Stewart (DD-224).jpg|thumb|left|''DD-224'' after recapture from Japanese Imperial Navy and recommissioning in the USN]]
''Harder'' and ''Hake'' remained off Dasol Bay, searching for new targets.  Before dawn 24 August they identified what they thought was a Japanese minesweeper and the three-stack [[Thailand|Siam]]ese destroyer ''[[Phra Ruang]]''. It was later found out to be Japanese destroyer [[Kaibokan CD-22]] and PB-102. The latter was built as {{USS|Stewart|DD-224}}, a [[Clemson-class destroyer]], but she was damaged while under repair at [[Surabaya]] and scuttled early in World War II. The Japanese Navy discovered the wreck, and raised, repaired, and recommissioned it into Japanese service in 1943 as '''Patrol Boat 102'''. &lt;!--+++ In a wartime diary in August of Patrol boat 102, about an anti-submarine battle, nothing was described. +++ --&gt;

As ''Hake'' closed to attack, the destroyer turned away toward Dasol Bay. ''Hake'' broke off her approach, turned northward, and sighted ''Harder'''s periscope about {{convert|600|-|700|yd|m}} dead ahead. Swinging southward, ''Hake'' then sighted CD-22 about {{convert|2000|yd|m|-2}} off her port quarter swinging toward them. To escape the charging escort, ''Hake'' started deep and rigged for [[Silent running (submarine)|silent running]]. At 07:28 she heard 15 rapid depth charges explode in the distance astern. She continued evasive action that morning, then returned to the general area of the attack shortly after noon. She swept the area at periscope depth but found only a ring of marker buoys covering a radius of one-half mile.

The vigorous depth charge attack had sunk the ''Harder'' with all hands. The Japanese report of the attack concluded that "much oil, wood chips, and cork floated in the vicinity." The United States Navy declared her lost January 2, 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dubbed "Hit 'Em Harder," she had wreaked havoc among Japanese shipping. Her record of aggressive daring exploits became almost legendary. All six of her patrols were designated successful.

''Harder'' received six [[battle star]]s and the Presidential Unit Citation for [[World War II]] service. In accordance with Navy custom, the citation was presented to the [[USS Harder (SS-568)|second ''Harder'']] upon commissioning.

Despite the losses of 9 more submarines in the fall of 1944, towards the end of the war U.S. fleet boats were actively penetrating through the Inland Sea, and the Japanese shipping losses continued, albeit at a slower rate.

''Harder's'' skipper left behind a wife and three children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15308148/picture_caption_family_of_missing/|title=(Picture caption) Family of Missing Commander|last=|first=|date=1945|work=The Monitor|access-date=2017-11-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=6|via={{Open Access}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;
SUBJECT : U.S.S. HARDER (SS257) - report of Fifth War Patrol.

...

June 9 (cont.)

:2102
::Sighted another destroyer. - They were in line of bearing and patrolling the narrows on north-south, zig zag courses. Sounded "battle stations", submerged to radar depth and commenced the attack. The nearest destroyer, now at a range of 8000 yards, was chosen as the first target and his [[angle on the bow]] was about 20 degrees port. At 4000 yards, he headed directly for us but his actions were interpreted as a routine zig. Increased submergence to periscope depth. At 3000 yards, both destroyers zigged 30 degrees to their right (with the first presenting a 30 degree port track) and the picture became "just what the doctor ordered" for the HARDER. At a range of 1000 yards on the nearest target, both destroyers were overlapping, with a 100 degree port track showing. Gyros were near zero and torpedoes set for running at 6 feet.

:2124
::Commenced firing the bow tubes. No. 1 appeared to pass just ahead of the first destroyer, No. 2 struck it near the bow, No. 3 hit just under the destroyer's bridge, and No. 4 passed astern of the near target. The sub was now swung hard right to avoid hitting the first destroyer and fire was withheld on remaining tubes until a new setup could be put into the T.D.C. for an attack on the second destroyer. About thirty seconds after turning, the second destroyer came into view just astern of what was left of the first one, then burning furiously. Just then No. 4 torpedo which had passed astern of the first target was heard and observed to hit the second target. - (No more torpedoes were needed for either.)

::Meanwhile, a heavy explosion, believed to be caused by an exploding boiler on the first destroyer, went off and the sub (then about 400 yards away) was heeled over by the concussion. At almost the same time a blinding explosion took place on the second destroyer (probably his ammunition going off) and it took a quick nose dive. When last observed, by the Commanding Officer and Executive Officer, the tail of the second destroyer was straight in the air and the first destroyer had disappeared. "Sound" now reported, "No more screws."

::The above listed pandemonium may not be in exact chronological order but is as accurate as the happenings over that eventful few minutes can be remembered.

'''''Wolfstein, The Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber’s Cave''''' is an 1850 [[chapbook]] based on [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]’s 1811 Gothic horror novel ''[[St. Irvyne;  or, The Rosicrucian]]''.[[File:Wolfstein, the Murderer Title page.jpg|thumb|Title page.]]

==Background==

The 1811 novel ''St. Irvyne, or, The Rosicrucian'' was republished by [[John Joseph Stockdale]] in 1822 following Shelley’s death. Two chapbooks were also published based on the novel. No publication date appeared on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gothicbibliograp00summ#page/n627/mode/2up Summers, Montague. ''A Gothic Bibliography.'' London: The Fortune Press, 1940, p. 561. No date of publication. Circa 1800. No author.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first chapbook version was entitled ''[[Wolfstein (Percy Bysshe Shelley chapbook)|Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit]]'' and was published and printed by John Bailey at 116, Chancery Lane in London in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein.html?id=JRoBHQAACAAJ ''Wolfstein; Or, The Mysterious Bandit.''

London: Grafton, 1939, p. 266. Block gives a publication date of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookhistory.blogspot.com/2007/01/london-1775-1800-b.html Maxted, Ian. ''The London Book Trades, 1775-1800: A Preliminary Checklist of Members.'' Folkestone, UK: Dawson, 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapbook was a condensed version of the novel in 20 pages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/search?form=A%2FT&amp;ti=Wolfstein,%20the%20murderer,%20or%20The%20secrets%20of%20a%20robber%27s%20cave.%20:%20A%20terrific%20romance.%20To%20which%20is%20added,%20The%20two%20serpents,%20an%20oriental%20apologue&amp;fs=Search Consortium of Online Public Access Catalogues (COPAC).]&lt;/ref&gt; The total length was 28 pages including the second story. Chapbooks were meant for popular consumption, serving the same function as a paperback would. The chapbook sold for sixpence.

Another more condensed twelve-page chapbook was published in 1850 by Thomas Redriffe in London entitled ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance. To which is Added, The Two Serpents, an Oriental Apologue.'' The Ossian epigraph appeared on the title page: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Printed for Thomas Redriffe, Piccadilly. The price was "Two Pence".  Printed by William Bethell, 10, Marshall-street, Liverpool. No date of publication appeared on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein_the_Murderer_Or_The_Secrets_of.html?id=OZhmngEACAAJ ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; Or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance.

Bodleian Library. University of Oxford.]&lt;/ref&gt; The story was six pages long, pages three through eight. The second story was four pages long, pages nine through twelve.

The frontispiece consisted of a drawing of Wolfstein confronted by a skeleton struck by lightning. He stands over the corpse of Serena. The drawing is a more condensed version of the 1822 frontispiece. The caption reads: "Deeper grew the gloom of the cavern, and darkness seemed to press around him. Suddenly a flash of lightning burst through the cavern, followed by thunder that appeared to convulse the universal fabric of nature; and borne on the sulphurous blast, the Prince of Terrors stood before him."

==Plot Summary==
[[File:Wolfstein, the Murderer Frontispiece.jpg|left|thumb|Frontispiece.]]The chapbook follows the plot of the first section of the novel ''St. Irvyne'' on the bandits but omits the second part featuring Frederic Nempere in Geneva. The account is radically condensed.
The name of Cavigni, leader of the bandits, is changed to Stiletto. The name of Megalena is changed to Serena. The character of Ginotti, the Rosicrucian alchemist, does not appear.

The opening scene is of a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the Swiss Alps who seeks cover from the storm. He is a distraught outcast who plans to commit suicide. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life.

Bandits then attack them. Wolfstein is accepted as a member of the bandits. He becomes used to a life of crime. But a rivalry develops between him and Stilleto over Serena. He decides to poison the chief by secretly placing a white powder in his wine. Stiletto drinks the poison and dies.

Wolfstein is subsequently elected Captain by the other bandits after the murder of Stiletto. He then is racked by dreams of the murdered Cavigni which fill him with dread and foreboding.
Days after the murder, Wolfstein seeks to seduce Serena. He observes her in prayer. She refuses his advances and pulls out a dagger. In response, Wolfstein unsheaths his sword and stabs her to death.

Thunder was heard in the cell. The Prince of Terror then appeared before him. A “strange and unnatural stench” infused the room as “the yawning gulf of hell” swallowed Wolfstein as blue flames swirled around his body.

The final paragraph concludes with a moral of the story. Plunging into despair and indulging in crime are not the ways to confront misfortune. The tenets of morality and truth should be diligently followed. Only “misery, disgrace and ruin” result when these principles are ignored.

'''Work system''' has been used loosely in many areas. This article concerns its use in understanding IT-reliant systems in organizations. A notable use of the term occurred in 1977 in the first volume of MIS Quarterly in two articles by Bostrom and Heinen (1977). Later Sumner and Ryan (1994) used it to explain problems in the adoption of CASE ([[computer-aided software engineering]]). A number of [[socio-technical systems]] researchers such as Trist and Mumford also used the term occasionally, but seemed not to define it in detail. In contrast, the work system approach defines work system carefully and uses it as a basic analytical concept.

A work system is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce products/services for internal or external customers. Typical business organizations contain work systems that procure materials from suppliers, produce products, deliver products to customers, find customers, create financial reports, hire employees, coordinate work across depa */ ERROR ERROR ERROR \* ed to processing information.
* A [[service system]] is a work system that produces services for its customers.
* A [[project]] is a work system designed to produce a product and then go out of existence.
* A [[supply chain]] is an interorganizational work system devoted to procuring materials and other inputs required to produce a firm’s products.
* An [[ecommerce]] web site can be viewed as a work system in which a buyer uses a seller’s web site to obtain product information and perform purchase transactions.
The relationship between work systems in general and the special cases implies that the same basic concepts apply to all of the special cases, which also have their own specialized vocabulary. In turn, this implies that much of the body of knowledge for the current information systems discipline can be organized around a work system core.

Specific information systems exist to support (other) work systems. Many different degrees of overlap are possible between an information system and a work system that it supports. For example, an information system might provide information for a non-overlapping work system, as happens when a commercial marketing survey provides information to a firm’s marketing managers In other cases, an information system may be an integral part of a work system, as happens in highly automated manufacturing and in ecommerce web sites. In these situations, participants in the work system are also participants in the information system, the work system cannot operate properly without the information system, and the information system has little significance outside of the work system.

== Work system framework ==

The work system approach for understanding systems includes both a static view of a current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is summarized by the work system framework, which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a work system. An easily recognized triangular representation of the work system framework has appeared in Alter (2002, 2003, 2008, 2013) and elsewhere. The work system itself consists of four elements: the processes and activities, participants, information, and technologies. Five other elements must be included in even a rudimentary understanding of a work system’s operation, context, and significance. Those elements are the products/services produced, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. Customers may also be participants in a work system, as happens when a doctor examines a patient. This framework is prescriptive enough to be useful in describing the system being studied, identifying problems and opportunities, describing possible changes, and tracing how those changes might affect other parts of the work system.

The definitions of the 9 elements of the work system framework are as follows:

'''Processes and activities''' include everything that happens within the work system. The term processes and activities is used instead of the term business process because many work systems do not contain highly structured business processes involving a prescribed sequence of steps, each of which is triggered in a pre-defined manner. Such processes are sometimes described as “artful processes” whose sequence and content “depend on the skills, experience, and judgment of the primary actors.” (Hill et al., 2006)  In effect, business process is but one of a number of different perspectives for analyzing the activities within a work system. Other perspectives with their own valuable concepts and terminology include decision-making, communication, coordination, control, and information processing.

'''Participants''' are people who perform the work. Some may use computers and IT extensively, whereas others may use little or no technology. When analyzing a work system the more encompassing role of work system participant is more important than the more limited role of technology user (whether or not particular participants happen to be technology users). In work systems that are viewed as service systems, it is especially important to identify activities in which customers are participants.

'''Information''' includes codified and non-codified information used and created as participants perform their work. Information may or may not be computerized. Data not related to the work system is not directly relevant, making the distinction between data and information secondary when describing or analyzing a work system.  Knowledge can be viewed as a special case of information.

'''Technologies''' include tools (such as cell phones, projectors, spreadsheet software, and automobiles) and techniques (such as management by objectives, optimization, and remote tracking) that work system participants use while doing their work. 

'''Products/services''' are the combination of physical things, information, and services that the work system produces for its customers' benefit and use. This may include physical products, information products, services, intangibles such as enjoyment and peace of mind, and social products such as arrangements, agreements, and organizations. The term "products/services” is used because the distinction between products and services in marketing and service science (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006) is not important for understanding work systems even though product-like vs. service-like is the basis of a series of design dimensions for characterizing and designing the things that a work system produces (Alter, 2012).

'''Customers''' are people who receive direct benefit from products/services the work system produces. Since work systems exist to produce products/services for their customers, an analysis of a work system should consider who the customers are, what they want, and how they use whatever the work system produces. Customers may include external customers who receive an enterprise's products/services and internal customers who are employed by the enterprise, such as customers of a payroll work system. Customers of a work system often are  participants in the work system (e.g., patients in a medical exam, students in an educational setting, and clients in a consulting engagement).

'''Environment''' includes the organizational, cultural, competitive, technical, and regulatory environment within which the work system operates. These factors affect system performance even though the system does not rely on them directly in order to operate. The organization’s general norms of behavior are part of its culture, whereas more specific behavioral norms and expectations about specific activities within the work system are considered part of its processes and activities.

'''Infrastructure''' includes human, informational, and technical resources that the work system relies on even though these resources exist and are managed outside of it and are shared with other work systems. Technical infrastructure includes computer networks, programming languages, and other technologies shared by other work systems and often hidden or invisible to work system participants. From an organizational viewpoint such as that expressed in Star and Bowker (2002) rather than a purely technical viewpoint, infrastructure includes human infrastructure, informational infrastructure, and technical infrastructure, all of which can be essential to a work system’s operation and therefore should be considered in any analysis of a work system.

'''Strategies''' include the strategies of the work system and of the department(s) and enterprise(s) within which the work system exists. Strategies at the department and enterprise level may help in explaining why the work system operates as it does and whether it is operating properly.

== Work system life cycle model ==

The dynamic view of a work system starts with the work system life cycle (WSLC) model, which shows how a work system may evolve through multiple iterations of four phases: operation and maintenance, initiation, development, and implementation. The names of the phases were chosen to describe both computerized and non-computerized systems, and to apply regardless of whether application software is acquired, built from scratch, or not used at all. The terms development and implementation have business-oriented meanings that are consistent with Markus and Mao’s (2004) distinction between system development and system implementation.

This model encompasses both planned and unplanned change. Planned change occurs through a full iteration encompassing the four phases, i.e., starting with an operation and maintenance phase, flowing through initiation, development, and implementation, and arriving at a new operation and maintenance phase. Unplanned change occurs through fixes, adaptations, and experimentation that can occur within any phase. The phases include the following activities:

=== Operation and maintenance ===
* Operation of the work system and monitoring of its performance
* Maintenance of the work system (which often includes at least part of information systems that support it) by identifying small flaws and eliminating or minimizing them through fixes, adaptations, or workarounds.
* On-going improvement of processes and activities through analysis, experimentation, and adaptation

=== Initiation ===
* Vision for the new or revised work system
* Operational goals
* Allocation of resources and clarification of time frames
* Economic, organizational, and technical feasibility of planned changes

=== Development ===
* Detailed requirements for the new or revised work system (including requirements for information systems that support it)
* As necessary, creation, acquisition, configuration, and modification of procedures, documentation, training material, software and hardware
* Debugging and testing of hardware, software, and documentation

=== Implementation ===
* Implementation approach and plan (pilot? phased? big bang?)
* Change management efforts about rationale and positive or negative impacts of changes
* Training on details of the new or revised information system and work system
* Conversion to the new or revised work system
* Acceptance testing

As an example of the iterative nature of a work system’s life cycle, consider the sales system in a software start-up. The first sales system is the CEO selling directly. At some point the CEO can’t do it alone, several salespeople are hired and trained, and marketing materials are produced that can be used by someone less expert than the CEO. As the firm grows, the sales system becomes regionalized and an initial version of sales tracking software is developed and used. Later, the firm changes its sales system again to accommodate needs to track and control a larger salesforce and predict sales several quarters in advance. A subsequent iteration might involve the acquisition and configuration of CRM software. The first version of the work system starts with an initiation phase. Each subsequent iteration involves deciding that the current sales system is insufficient; initiating a project that may or may not involve significant changes in software; developing the resources such as procedures, training materials, and software that are needed to support the new version of the work system; and finally, implementing the new work system.

The pictorial representation of the work system life cycle model places the four phases at the vertices of rectangle. Forward and backward arrows between each successive pair of phases indicate the planned sequence of the phases and allow the possibility of returning to a previous phase if necessary. To encompass both planned and unplanned change, each phase has an inward facing arrow to denote unanticipated opportunities and unanticipated adaptations, thereby recognizing the importance of diffusion of innovation, experimentation, adaptation, emergent change, and path dependence.

The work system life cycle model is iterative and includes both planned and unplanned change. It is fundamentally different from the frequently cited [[Systems Development Life Cycle]] (SDLC), which actually describes projects that attempt to produce software or produce changes in a work system. Current versions of the SDLC may contain iterations but they are basically iterations within a project. More important, the system in the SDLC is a basically a technical artifact that is being programmed. In contrast, the system in the WSLC is a work system that evolves over time through multiple iterations. That evolution occurs through a combination of defined projects and incremental changes resulting from small adaptations and experimentation. In contrast with control-oriented versions of the SDLC, the WSLC treats unplanned changes as part of a work system’s natural evolution.

== Work system method ==

The work system method (Alter, 2002; 2006; 2013) is a method that business professionals (and/or IT professionals) can use for understanding and analyzing a work system at whatever level of depth is appropriate for their particular concerns. It has evolved iteratively starting in around 1997. At each stage, the then current version was tested by evaluating the areas of success and the difficulties experienced by MBA and EMBA students trying to use it for a practical purpose. A version called “work-centered analysis” that was presented in a textbook has been used by a number of universities as part of the basic explanation of systems in organizations, to help students focus on business issues, and to help student teams communicate. Ramiller (2002) reports on using a version of the work system framework within a method for “animating” the idea of business process within an undergraduate class. In a research setting, Petrie (2004) used the work system framework as a basic analytical tool in a Ph.D. thesis examining 13 ecommerce web sites. Petkov and Petkova (2006) demonstrated the usefulness of the work system framework by comparing grades of students who did and did not learn about the framework before trying to interpret the same ERP case study. More recent evidence of the practical value of a work system approach is from Truex et al. (2010, 2011), which summarized results from 75 and later 300 management briefings produced by employed MBA students based on a work system analysis template. These briefings contained the kind of analysis that would be discussed in the initiation phase of the WSLC, as decisions were being made about which projects to pursue and how to proceed.

Results from analyses of real world systems by typical employed MBA and EMBA students indicate that a systems analysis method for business professionals must be much more prescriptive than [[soft systems methodology]] (Checkland, 1999).  While not a straitjacket, it must be at least somewhat procedural and must provide vocabulary and analysis concepts while at the same time encouraging the user to perform the analysis at whatever level of detail is appropriate for the task at hand. The latest version of the work system method is organized around a general problem-solving outline that includes:

* Identify the problem or opportunity
* Identify the work system that has that problem or opportunity (plus relevant constraints and other considerations)
* Use the work system framework to summarize the work system
* Gather relevant data.
* Analyze using design characteristics, measures of performance, and work system principles.
* Identify possibilities for improvement.
* Decide what to recommend
* Justify the recommendation using relevant metrics and work system principles.

In contrast to systems analysis and design methods for IT professionals who need to produce a rigorous, totally consistent definition of a computerized system, the work system method:

* encourages the user to decide how deep to go
* makes explicit use of the work system framework and work system life cycle model
* makes explicit use of work system principles.
* makes explicit use of characteristics and metrics for the work system and its elements.
* includes work system participants as part of the system (not just users of the software)
* includes codified and non-codified information
* includes IT and non-IT technologies.
* suggests that recommendations specify which work system improvements rely on IS changes, which recommended work system changes don’t rely on IS changes, and which recommended IS changes won’t affect the work system’s operational form.

==Early years==
Gibson was born in New York City, the daughter of Frank W. Gibson and Elaine Coffin Gibson. Her father was an efficiency expert, and her mother was an authorized [[Christian Science]] healer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collura|first1=Joe|title=Wynne Gibson: That Gibson Girl|journal=Films of the Golden Age|date=Summer 1999|url=http://www.filmsofthegoldenage.com/foga/1999/summer99/wynnegibson.shtml|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Wadleigh High School for Girls]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaker|first1=Everett|title=George Raft: The Films|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786493135|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi7JiuIsQbsC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22Wynne+Gibson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwn5mzipjQAhVIJCYKHaKOBjYQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Wynne%20Gibson%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At one point during her youth, she ran away from home with a touring play troupe, acting with the group in three cities before her father found her.&lt;ref name="ot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dietz|first1=Edith|title=She Can't Be Nice|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7373398/oakland_tribune|work=Oakland Tribune|date=December 30, 1934|location=California, Oakland|page=54|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=November 8, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage==
Gibson was a member of Frederick Santley's Melody Maids and Ray Raymond's Melody Charmers. She toured in the ''Ritz Girls'' show, in which she and Billie Vernon performed a sister act.&lt;ref name=ci0118/&gt; Gibson was seen in vaudeville as part of ''The Melody Charmers''. Her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] credits include ''Jarnegan'' (1928) and ''When You Smile'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=("Wynne Gibson" search results)|url=http://www.playbill.com/searchpage/search?shows=on&amp;people=on&amp;theatres=on&amp;q=Wynne+Gibson&amp;qasset=00000150-ac84-d16d-a550-ecbe94d60002|website=Playbill Vault|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955-56, she served as chair of the [[Equity Library Theatre]].&lt;ref name=gr/&gt;

==Film==
Early in her career, Gibson had a small part in a film but had no special interest in appearing before the camera.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} It was the stage that interested her and she began her stage career in chorus and was soon playing leads. She toured Europe then returned to America and tried for a dramatic part but failed and returned to musical comedy. [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] signed her when about to film ''[[Nothing But the Truth (1929 film)|Nothing But the Truth]]'' (1929), starting her success which continued in some 50 films between 1929 and 1956 although many were [[B movie]]s.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0317224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gibson had a brief marriage to a stage manager. After that, she married [[John Gallaudet]], an actor, in 1927. They divorced in 1930.&lt;ref name=ci0118/&gt; She was a long-time companion of former [[Warner Brothers]] actress [[Beverly Roberts]].&lt;ref name=gr/&gt;

==Death==
Gibson died in 1987 of a [[Thrombus|cerebral thrombosis]] in [[Laguna Niguel, California]].&lt;ref name=gr/&gt;

At a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in [[carbon]] compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres.

==Discovery and naming==
The 41st [[Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition]] (JARE) found the meteorite in late December 2000 on the [[Yamato Glacier]] at the [[Queen Fabiola Mountains]], [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Yamato nahklites: Petrography and mineralogy | journal = Antarctic Meteorite Research | date = 2003 | first = N. | last = Imae |author2=Y.

==Description==
The mass of the meteorite is {{convert|13.7|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt; It is an unbrecciated cumulus [[igneous rock]] consisting predominantly of elongated [[augite]] crystals —a [[solid solution]] in the [[pyroxene]] group.&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"/&gt; Japanese scientists from the National Institute of Polar Research reported in 2003 that the meteorite contains [[iddingsite]], which forms from the weathering of basalt in the presence of liquid water.&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"/&gt; In addition, NASA researchers reported in February 2014 that they also found carbon-rich spheres encased in multiple layers of iddingsite, as well as microtubular features emanating from iddingsite veins displaying curved, undulating shapes consistent with bio-alteration textures that have been observed in terrestrial basaltic glass.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt; However, the scientific consensus is that "morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection."&lt;ref name=morphology&gt;{{cite journal | title = Morphological behavior of inorganic precipitation systems - Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology II | journal = SPIE Proceedings | date = December 30, 1999 | first = Juan-Manuel Garcia-Ruiz | volume = Proc.

==Classification==
The Martian meteorite is an [[igneous rock]] classified as an [[achondrite]] type of the [[nakhlite]] group.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curation Office"/&gt;
