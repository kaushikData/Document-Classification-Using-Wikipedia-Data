First patented in France by [[Timoleon Maurel]], in 1842,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; '''the Arithmaurel''' was a [[mechanical calculator]] that had a very intuitive user interface, especially for multiplying and dividing numbers because the result was displayed as soon as the operands were entered.  It received a gold medal at the French national show in Paris in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k85784m.pleinepage.r=exposition+des+produits+de+l'industrie+francaise+1849.f547.langEN ''Rapport du jury central sur les produits de l'agriculture et de l'industrie exposés en 1849'', Tome II, page 542 - 548, Imprimerie Nationale, 1850] Gallica&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately its complexity and the fragility of its design prevented it from being manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?8KU54-2.5/263/150/369/363/369 Le calcul simplifié] Maurice d'Ocagne, page 269, Bibliothèque numérique du CNAM&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name came from the concatenation of [[Arithmometer]], the machine that inspired its design and of Maurel, the name of its inventor.  The heart of the machine uses one [[Leibniz wheel|Leibniz stepped cylinder]] driven by a set of differential gears.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne]] [[:fr:Maurice d'Ocagne|(fr)]], ''Le Calcul Simplifié'', Gauthier-Villars et Fils, 1894, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Timoleon Maurel patented an early version of his machine in 1842,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;(fr)[http://www.ami19.org/BrevetsFrancais/1842MaurelFRpatentFR/1842MaurelPDF.pdf 1842 patent] - Document scanned by www.ami19.org&lt;/ref&gt; he then improved its design with the help of Jean Jayet and patented it in 1846.&lt;ref name="Patent1846"&gt;(fr) [http://www.ami19.org/BrevetsFrancais/1846MaurelJayetFRpatentFR/1846Maurel-Jayet.pdf patent held by  Maurel and Jayet 1846] - Document scanned par www.ami19.org&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the design that won a gold medal at the ''Exposition nationale de Paris'' in 1849.

Winnerl, a French clockmaker, was asked to manufacture the device in 1850, but only thirty machines were built because the machine was too complex for the manufacturing capabilities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) Jean Marguin, ''Histoire des instruments et machines à calculer'', Hermann, 1994, page 130&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first four years, Winnerl was not able to build any of the 8 digit machines (a minimum for any professional usage) that had been ordered while [[Thomas de Colmar]] delivered, during the same period, two hundred 10 digit Arithmometers and fifty 16 digit ones.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.arithmometre.org/Bibliotheque/BibNumerique/CosmosJanvier1854/CosmosJanvier1854.pdf Cosmos,  Janvier 1854, page 77] Document scanned by Valéry Monnier&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noted that none of the machines that were built and none of the machines described in the patents could be used at full capacity because the capacity of the result display register was equal to the capacity of the operand register (for a multiplication, the capacity of the result register should be equal to the capacity of the operand register augmented by the capacity of the operator register).

==Description==
Following is a description of one of the two machines introduced in the 1846 patent.&lt;ref name="Patent1846"/&gt;  It has a capacity of five digits for the operator and ten digits for the operand and the result registers.

All the registers are located on the front panel, the reset mechanism is on the side.

* 10 numbered stems, arranged horizontally at the top of the front panel, can be pulled at different lengths to enter the operands with the rightmost stem representing units.
* A 10 digit display register located in the middle is used to display the results.
* 5 dials, each coupled with an input key, are used to enter the operators with the rightmost dial representing units. Turning the units key one division clockwise will add the content of the operand register to the total.  Turning the units key one division counterclockwise will subtract the content of the operand register from the current total. Turning the tens key one division clockwise will add 10 times the content of the operand register to the total etc..

'''Astrolite''' is the trade name of a family of [[explosives]], invented by chemist [[Gerald Hurst]] in the 1960s during his employment with the Atlas Powder Company. The Astrolite family consists of two compounds, Astrolite G and Astrolite A. Both are two-part liquid-state [[high explosive]] mixtures, composed of [[ammonium nitrate]] oxidizer and [[hydrazine]] rocket fuel. The explosives were extensively studied, manufactured, and used in many countries because of their advantages of high energy, excellent
performance, and wide application. They still find some use in commercial and civil blasting applications, but have mostly been superseded by cheaper and safer compounds, largely due to the expense and exceptionally poisonous nature of the [[hydrazine]] component.

== Astrolite G ==

Astrolite G, the most common type of Astrolite, is a mixture of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[hydrazine]] at a ratio of 2:1, measured in weight, forming a clear, viscous liquid approximately the consistency of motor oil. It is a relatively stable ([[secondary explosive|secondary]]) high explosive compound, requiring a [[blasting cap]] to detonate. It has a detonation velocity of approximately 8,600 m/s, twice the explosive strength of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. It has been widely referred to as the "world's most powerful non-nuclear explosive", caused largely by a comparison of Astrolite G's detonation velocity to that of first and second-generation high explosives such as [[nitroglycerine]] and [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Current-generation high explosive compounds such as [[PETN]] and [[RDX]] can feature comparable detonation velocities and [[brisance]] to Astrolite G.

== Astrolite A ==

Astrolite A, a secondary (and less common) type of Astrolite, is synthesized by the addition of finely powdered [[aluminium]] to the Astrolite G mixture. Though it has a lower detonation velocity (approximately 7,600 m/s) than Astrolite G, the addition of the  aluminium increases both its density and [[brisance]], moderately increasing its overall effectiveness.

== Persistency ==

A notable characteristic of the Astrolite family is its remarkable degree of persistency for a liquid explosive compound. Due to its low volatility, it can be dispersed in an area, be absorbed by the soil, and still retain its full explosive characteristics for a period of approximately 4 days.  This has shown to be true even when rainwater had also been absorbed by the soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17000">'''Audience analysis''' is a task that is often performed by [[technical writer]]s in a project's early stages. It consists of assessing the audience to make sure the information provided to them is at the appropriate level.  The audience is often referred to as the [[end-user]], and all communications need to be targeted towards the defined audience.  Defining an audience requires the consideration of many factors, such as age, [[culture]] and knowledge of the subject.  After considering all the known factors, a profile of the intended audience can be created, allowing writers to write in a manner that is understood by the intended audience.

==Process==
Audience analysis involves gathering and interpreting information about the recipients of [[Speech communication|oral]], [[written]], or [[visual]] communication.

There are numerous methods that a technical communicator can use to conduct the analysis.  Because the task of completing an audience analysis can be overwhelming, using a multi-pronged approach to conduct the analysis is recommended by most professors, often yielding improved accuracy and efficiency.  Michael Albers suggests that an analysis use several independent guestofaguest that work together, such as reader knowledge of the topic and reader cognitive comprehension.

Writers can also use conversation, in-depth interviews or focus groups to help them to complete an audience analysis.  Conversation as well as other qualitative research techniques will allow the communicator to consider the multiple cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts of their target audience, producing a valuable audience analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bocchi, Joseph S.  "Forming Constructs of Audience Convention, Conflict, and Conversation."  ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication.''  5 (1991):  151-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

David L. Carson of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] asserted that technical communicators most often perform their jobs with little or no knowledge about their audience.  Carson states that the analysis should include a reader's level of comprehension of the technical vocabulary and motivation, as well as reading level. Indicators of a reader's high level of motivation include high interest in the subject matter, relatively high knowledge of the content, and high personal stakes in mastering the information.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, David L.  "Audience in Technical Writing:  The Need for Greater Realism in Identifying the Fictive Reader."  ''The Technical Writing Teacher.''  7 (1979):  8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique used to conduct an audience analysis is the "bottom-up" approach.  Leon de Stadler and Sarah van der Land&lt;ref&gt;In their article "Knowing Your Audience and Audience Participation in the Field"&lt;/ref&gt; explore this type of approach in reference to a document produced by an organization that develops different kinds of interventions in the field of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] [[education]].  This particular document focused on the use of [[contraception]] and targeted the [[Black people|black]] [[youth]] of [[South Africa]].  The initial document was created by document designers in the [[United States]] who did not base their design on an extensive audience analysis. As a result, the document, which used the informal slang of black South African youth, did not effectively communicate with its target audience.  After the dissemination of the document, Van der Land used [[focus groups]] and [[interview]]s of a sample of the target audience to discover what improvements should be made.  Upon considering the audience's perspective, she found that the initial document's use of the hip-style language backfired.  The interviewees indicated that the use of the popular language was not effective because it was not used correctly or consistently throughout the document.  Additionally, to the target audience, the informal language did not fit the seriousness of the topic being discussed.  The suggested "bottom-up" approach should have incorporated the target audience during the design process instead of as an afterthought.

Marjorie Rush Hovde provides even more tactics that can be implemented in the process of an audience analysis in relation to one's organization.  She suggests talking with users during [[Customer support|phone support]] calls, interacting with users face-to-face, drawing on the writer's own experiences with the [[software]] and documentation, interacting with use-contact people within the organization, studying responses sent from users after the documentation is released, and conducting internal user-testing.  Like Michael Albers, Hovde asserts that the use of a combination of tactics proves to produce a more accurate audience analysis than using one tactic alone.&lt;ref&gt;Hovde, Marjorie Rush.  "Tactics for Building Images of Audience in Organizational Contexts:  An Ethnographic Study of Technical Communicators."  ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication.''  14 (2000):  395-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen D. Holl&lt;ref&gt;An editor for ''Restoration Ecology'', in her article "Writing for an International Audience,"&lt;/ref&gt; discusses what writers should consider when writing papers that address an international audience.  She focuses on those writers who attempt to publish studies in publications that are circulated abroad.  She suggests that these writers consider the following questions when framing their papers:  What conclusions from my study would be relevant and novel to land managers and scientists working in other ecosystems and socio-economic contexts?, What is the geographic scope of the literature I am citing?, To which ecological and socio-economic systems do my world view and results apply?, Is my study sufficiently well replicated to generalize my results?,  and Are my conclusions supported by my data and, conversely, are all my data necessary to support my conclusions?.  Although she focuses her suggestions on scientific studies, she acknowledges that "what is critical to effectively communicate the results of any study is to consider what conclusions will be of most interest to the target audience."  Holl concludes that knowing how to address an international audience is a vital skill that successful scientists, as well as technical communicators, must possess.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Karen D.  "Writing for an International Audience."  ''Restoration Ecology.''  18 (2010):  135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth of analysis==
There are often a large number of factors to consider, thus making it hard for the writer to completely assess the target audience within a reasonable amount of time.  Therefore, an attempt to reach the most accurate and effective audience analysis, in a [[time]]ly manner, is vital to the technical [[communication]] process. The depth of the audience analysis also depends of the size of the intended audience.

Because people constantly change in terms of technological exposure, the audience to be analyzed constantly changes.  As a result, the technical communicator must consider the possibility that their audience changes over time. An article in the [[European Journal of Communication]] examined the change audience research has experienced due to the growing range of information and communication technologies.  The article pointed out that there are three main challenges that drive the search for methodological rigor:  the difference between what people say they do and what they do in practice, the interpretation of the text by the reader,  and why the received meanings of television matter in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, Sonia.  "The Challenge of Changing Audiences, Or What is the Audience Researcher to do in the Age of the Internet?."  ''European Journal of Communication.''  19 (2004):  75-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  An absolutely perfect audience analysis is generally impossible to create, and it is similarly difficult to create an analysis that is relevant for a long period of time.  Revising and rewriting an audience analysis is often required in order to maintain the relevance of the analysis.

===Specific applications of audience analysis===

R. C. Goldworthy, C. B. Mayhorn and A. W. Meade, dealt with the hazard mitigation, including warning development, validation, and dissemination as an important aspect of [[product safety]] and workplace and [[consumer protection]] in their article "Warnings in Manufacturing:  Improving Hazard-Mitigation Messaging through Audience Analysis". In this study, they focused on the potential role of [[latent class analysis]] in regards to the audience analysis performed in hazard communication and [[warning message]]s. Their qualitative study involved 700 adult and adolescent participants who answered a structured questionnaire about prescription medication history, [[prescription medication]] loaning/borrowing history, and likelihood of sharing/borrowing medication. With this information, four latent classes were identified: Abstainers, Pragmatic frequent sharers, At-risk sharers, and Emergency sharers. The identification of latent classes based on behaviors of interest facilitated tailoring hazard-mitigation efforts to specific groups. Although their study is limited, in that all participants were between the ages of twelve and forty-four and were from heavily populated urban area (so the generalizability of the data to rural settings has not been generated), this study establishes that latent class analysis can play a vital role. They conclude that latent analysis is a worthwhile addition to the analytical toolbox because it allows, in this case, risk reduction and hazard-mitigation efforts to tailor interventions to a diverse target audience. For the technical writer, analyzing latent classes would enable them to better identify homogenous groups within the broader population of readers and across many variables to tailor messages to these better-specified groups.&lt;ref&gt;Goldworthy, Richard C., Christopher B. Mayhorn, and Adam W. Meade. "Warnings in Manufacturing:  Improving Hazard-Mitigation Messaging through Audience Analysis". ''Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing and Service Industries''. 20 (2010):  484-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of older adults is growing, and Gail Lippincott asserts that technical communicators have not accounted for the needs of these audiences, nor drawn from the wide range of research on aging. In her article "Gray Matters: Where are the Technical Communicator in Research and Design for Aging Audiences?", Lippincott suggests four challenges that practitioners, educators, and researchers must undertake to accommodate older adults' physical, cognitive, and emotional needs: They must refine the demographic variable of age, operationalize age to enrich current methods of audience analysis, investigate multidisciplinary sources of aging research, and participate in research on aging by offering our expertise in document design and communication strategies. Lippincott acknowledges that there is so much more research that must be done in this area, for "the body of literature on older adults and computer use is relatively small."  Lippincott provides insight into an often overlooked audience that technical communicators must learn to address.&lt;ref&gt;Lippincott, Gail.  "Gray Matters:  Where Are the Technical Communicators in Research and Design for Aging Audiences?" ''IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication.''  47 (2004):  157-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresa Lipus&lt;ref&gt;Of Trus Joist, a Weyerhaeuser Business in Boise, Idaho&lt;/ref&gt; argues that devoting company resources to produce adequate instructions for international users is both practical and ethical.  She also provides a brief overview of the consumer protection measures that leading U.S. trade partners have implemented.  She also presents the following guidelines for developing adequate instructions for international audiences:  1) define the scope of the instructions, 2) identify the audience, 3) describe the product's functions and limitations, 4) identify the constraints, and 5) use durable materials.  She offers tips for getting and keeping the attention of the audience.  These tips are 1) organize the information, 2) structure the information, and 3) design the page layout.  For aiding the comprehension of the readers, Lipus suggests that technical communicators write readable texts and design effective graphics.  In an effort to motivate compliance, she says to make the instructions relevant and credible and to improve user recall of the information by organizing the information into small meaningful groups and providing concise summaries and on-product reminders.  When presenting safety information, Lipus says to not only include the necessary safety messages but to also design effective safety messages.  Before distributing instructions, they must be evaluated.  She recommends testing the product and the accuracy of the instructions, communicating using means that reach users, and continuing to test and to inform users even after marketing. She explains that because the potential for making subtle but offensive errors is so high in international dealings, a language-sensitive native speaker from the target culture should always review the instructions before they are distributed to consumers.  Although Lipus provides information in analyzing and writing for an international audience regarding consumer protection, the strategies offered can be applied to document preparation in general.&lt;ref&gt;Lipus, Teresa. "International Consumer Protection:  Writing Adequate Instructions for Global Audiences". ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication''. 36 (2006):  75-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenni Swenson, Helen Constantinides, and Laura Gurak, in their case study, address the problem of defining medical web site credibility and identifying the gap in web design research that fails to recognize or address specific audience needs in web site design. The information they gathered assisted the researchers in identifying and fulfilling specific audience needs, describing a framework, and presenting a case study in audience-driven Web design.  The researchers used the qualitative method of conducting a survey to find the audience of the Algenix, Inc. Web site.  Algenix is a biomedical liver disease management company.  The study showed that an audience-driven design would do more to reassure the audience that personal information would not be collected without consent as well as provide clear policies of security, privacy, and data collection.  The survey informed the researchers that the audience would also like to experience a site with minimal graphics and short download times and one that is intuitive and easy to navigate.  This study illustrates how an audience analysis should not only address what the users are able to do but also what they, as the users, would prefer.&lt;ref&gt;Swenson, Jenni, Helen Constantinides, and Laura Gurak.  "Audience-driven Web Design: An Application to Medical Web Sites". ''Technical Communication''. 43 (2002): 340-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article "Real Readers, Implied Readers, and Professional Writers: Suggested Research", Charlotte Thralls, Nancy Ror, and Helen Rothschild Ewald of Iowa State University define "real readers" versus "implied readers". The real reader is a concrete reality and determines the writer's purpose and persona.  A writer who perceives an audience as real tends to conceive of readers as living persons with specific attitudes and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the writer's task is to accommodate the real reader by analyzing this reader's needs and deferring to them.  The implied reader, on the other hand, is a mental construct or role which the actual reader is invited to enter, even though the characteristics embodied in that role may not perfectly fit his or her attitudes or reactions. When the reader is implied, the writer invents and determines the audience within the text. The researchers assert that writers must appreciate the complex interplay that may take place between the real and implied representations of the reader in every document. The researchers discuss how their study was conducted for the sole purpose of developing a hypothesis for further study: Are professional writers aware of real and implied readers; does a writer's way of perceiving a reader affect contextual development; do shifts occur in writers' conceptions of readers; are writers' perceptions of readers linked to a sense of genre and explained by principles of cognitive processing?&lt;ref&gt;Thralls, Charlotte, Nancy Roundy Byler, and Helen Rothschild Ewald. "Real Readers, Implied Readers, and Professional Writers: Suggested Research". ''Journal of Business Communication''. 25 (1998): 47-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30909">'''Aviation archaeology''' is a recognized sub-discipline within archaeology and underwater archaeology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, M., 2004. Historic aircraft wrecks as archaeological sites. Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology, 28: 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an activity practiced by both enthusiasts and academics in pursuit of finding, documenting, recovering, and preserving sites important in [[aviation history]]. For the most part, these sites are aircraft wrecks and crash sites, but also include structures and facilities related to aviation. It is also known in some circles and depending on the perspective of those involved as '''aircraft archaeology''' or  '''aerospace archaeology''' and has also been described variously as '''crash hunting''', '''underwater aircraft recovery''', '''wreck chasing''', or '''wreckology''' .

== History of Aviation Archaeology and Current Issues ==
[[File:DakotaPlaneCrash-TailSection.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force [[DC-3 Dakota]] crashed on 19 January 1946.]]
The activity dates to post-[[World War II]] [[Europe]] when, after the conflict, numerous aircraft wrecks studded the countryside. Many times, memorials to those involved in the crashes were put together by individuals, families, landholders, or communities.

[[File:B17turbocharger.jpg|right|thumb|B-17 turbocharger, crash debris]]
Crash sites vary in size and content; some may have fuselages, engines, and thousands of parts and debris.  Other sites, like in civilian/commercial crashes, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) will have almost all of the aircraft and debris removed; which makes aviation archaeology more challenging. Remains of military aircraft crash sites may also be removed by various aircraft restoration groups, particularly if the aircraft was found largely intact. In general, most recent-day (since the 1980s) aircraft crashes are removed entirely, due to environmental regulations, leaving very little to indicate the existence of a wreck.

For example, military crashes in Arizona originate from numerous air bases, past and present. Because of the warm and sunny weather, much of the U.S. Army Air Forces flight training was located in the state, both during and after WWII. Numerous air bases dotted the states - creating conditions for numerous training accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircraftarchaeology.com/crash_history_in_arizona.htm Arizona Crash History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106164708/http://www.aircraftarchaeology.com/crash_history_in_arizona.htm |date=January 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Old abandoned US Army Air Corp auxiliary fields and those converted to city municipal airports provide archaeological sites to be researched and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CO/Airfields_CO_E.htm|title=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields: Colorado: Northeastern Denver area|author=|date=|website=www.airfields-freeman.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRX7rQdV?url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CO/Airfields_CO_E.htm|archivedate=23 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AircraftDebrisCloseup.jpg|right|thumb|Measure, photograph and log aircraft debris.]]

Keeping a record of a crash site, such as photographs, maps, journals, logs, and all terrain and weather recordings are essential, i.e. the [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] crash site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradowreckchasing.tripod.com/GlenwoodB17/GlenB17.html|title=Glenwood B-17|author=|date=|website=coloradowreckchasing.tripod.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191020/http://coloradowreckchasing.tripod.com/GlenwoodB17/GlenB17.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Tells Peak, California|Tells Peak, CA]], B-17 crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Sierras_B-17C_crash_site.htm|title=Crash Site of the B-17C near Tells Peak, CA|author=|date=|website=www.check-six.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927215515/http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Sierras_B-17C_crash_site.htm|archivedate=27 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AircraftPartNumber.jpg|right|thumb|B-17 crash debris.]]
The internet is an ideal media for sharing, recording, educating, and promoting aviation archaeology as a hobby, as well as research projects for local and state aviation historical groups. For identifying aircraft type and manufacturer by part numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/partmanu.htm|title=Aviation Archaeology - Part Number Prefix By Manufacturer|author=|date=|website=www.aviationarchaeology.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015042601/http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/partmanu.htm|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufacturing inspection stamps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/astamps.htm|title=Aviation Archaeology - Aircraft Inspection Stamps|author=|date=|website=www.aviationarchaeology.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315160856/http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/astamps.htm|archivedate=15 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be analysed.  From detailed [[GPS]] data &amp; maps, to researching accident reports information, numerous resources help create a complete picture of the historic event.  Accident reports, such as the official US Air Force Accident Report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texaswreckchasing.com/Reports/Military/B-36/Sterling%20City/Sterling%20City%20B-36.pdf Sterling City, TX, B-36 Accident Report]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226023144/http://www.texaswreckchasing.com/Reports/Military/B-36/Sterling%20City/Sterling%20City%20B-36.pdf |date=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Form 14 becomes the foundation of archaeology research.  From there, newspaper articles, county clerk records, sheriff &amp; coroner reports, and library records all aid an aviation archaeologist in their research.

== Protection Laws and Regulations ==

=== United States ===
Legal protection of aircraft wreck sites is highly variable. In terms of protection by aircraft ownership, the [[U.S. Navy]] retains indefinite ownership of all [[List of United States naval aircraft|Naval aircraft]], including terrestrial or submerged wreck sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq28-1.htm|title=Historic Preservation Policy Regarding US Navy Sunken Military Craft|author=|date=|website=navy.mil|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407211612/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq28-1.htm|archivedate=7 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Air Force]] has no policies regarding disturbance of vintage aircraft wreck sites, unless human remains or weaponry remain unrecovered at the site.
For [[vintage aircraft]], including vintage [[military aircraft]], that are usually considered abandoned when wrecked, the wreck site and all associated contents are subject to the protection laws of the land upon which it rests. The language of [[cultural heritage]] protection laws are not aviation specific, so all protection laws pertaining to aviation sites are based on interpretation. Most federal and state laws are, however, explicit in describing cultural resources as either ‘objects, sites, or otherwise, of historic value’&lt;ref&gt;National Historic Preservation Act 1966 Public Law 102-575 16 U.S.C. 470w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Historic Landmarks Program 36CFR65 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘military or social history’&lt;ref&gt;California public resources code Section 5020-5029.5&lt;/ref&gt; and deem the time limit as over fifty years old.
If an aircraft wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed on what is currently [[federal lands]], the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/toolboxes/documents/geocaching/36cfr2.1.pdf|title=National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1|author=|date=|website=wilderness.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000100/http://www.wilderness.net/toolboxes/documents/geocaching/36cfr2.1.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Aviation sites, for example, a vintage [[hangar]] on an airport or a wreck site on the path of a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review if they are to be disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds. In most cases, the [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] will determine whether or not an aviation site is eligible for the register.

The National Register deems aviation wreck sites as “any aircraft that has been crashed, ditched, damaged, stranded, or abandoned”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/aviation/|title=Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Historic Aviation Properties, National Register of Historic Places Bulletin|first=Jeff|last=Joeckel|date=29 November 2001|website=nps.gov|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010183839/https://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/aviation/|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It designates the protection terms for aviation history sites as well, including abandoned [[airfields]] or facilities sites, testing or experimental sites, land or water [[air terminal]]s, or [[airway beacon]]s and navigational aids.

State lands protection laws vary widely across the nation but the language describing a historical resource is the same as federal laws. Therefore, aviation properties and aircraft wrecks on [[State land]]s can be protected under various environmental, public resource, and historical property laws as outlined per state for the protection of archaeological and historic resources.
Any [[archaeological survey]], [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], or activity that disturbs wither wreck or aviation property remains can, in some cases, be permitted on federal and state lands under a permitting process through the regulating entity.
If an aircraft wreck, or the remains of any aviation property, is located on private land it is not automatically protected by any federal, state, or local law and any survey or excavation work must be permitted by the land owner.

Under the 'Sunken Military Craft Act’ (SMCA) of 2004, it is illegal to disturb, remove, or injure the wreck sites or associated contents of [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] or any submerged [[military aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-12a.htm History.Navy.mil: ''The Sunken Military Craft Act'' (US)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407211727/http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-12a.htm |date=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act identifies military craft as including any sunken military aircraft or military spacecraft that was owned or operated by a government when it sank, and includes the associated contents. Because of the U.S. Navy’s retaining of ownership of all military craft, the act applies to any U.S. Navy aircraft, even if in international or other country’s territorial waters. The act also applies to any foreign military craft in U.S. territorial waters. Persons wishing to conduct archaeological or research exploration of any submerged military aircraft can apply to the [[Naval History and Heritage Command]]’s [[Underwater Archaeology Branch]] for a permit. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard has similar policies and permitting requirements to the Navy.
The SMCA includes penalties associated with any unauthorized disturbances of sunken military craft as a fine and a liability for the reasonable costs incurred in recovery of archaeological or cultural information, storage, restoration, care, maintenance, and conservation.

As a part of federal air regulations, NTSB Part 830, protects any aircraft whose accident cause is under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntsb.gov/aviation/report.htm NTSB Part 830:  ''U.S. Accident Preservation and Reporting Regulations'' (US)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527084527/http://ntsb.gov/aviation/report.htm |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/E9-30398.pdf US Federal Registry: ''49 CFR Part 830'']&lt;/ref&gt; NTSB officials will routinely seize portions of wrecked aircraft for further analysis. Most of the time, after their study is complete, the sequestered debris is returned to the owners' representation - most often the aircraft's insurance company.  However, examples like the reconstructed wreckage of [[TWA Flight 800]] are held in perpetuity by the NTSB to education the public and future investigators on the NTSB's role in transportation safety.
 
=== United Kingdom ===
The laws in the UK cover the remains of all aircraft which have crashed during military service (land or sea) are protected by the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]]. This Act defines an offence of tampering with, damage to, moving, or unearthing the aircraft remains. Exceptions apply to those holding licences, which can be issued by the Secretary of State, authorising specific procedures to be performed.

For the wreck-chasing hobbyist there is a self-regulating body, the [[British Aviation Archaeological Council]] (BAAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk/index.htm|title=British Aviation Archaeological Council|author=|date=|website=www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124183035/http://www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk/index.htm|archivedate=24 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines ethical standards of behaviour, coordinates activities and provides a forum for discussion for its member groups. Not all active groups in the UK are members of this organisation.

== Types of Aviation Archaeology Sites ==

=== Terrestrial Sites ===
Aviation history sites on land that can be subject to archaeological survey or excavation can include airports (which can contain hangars, terminal, other facilities, etc.), crash sites, monuments, or even properties associated with important persons or events in aviation history.
Some examples of potential and current archaeological sites:

==== Aircraft Crash Sites ====
The Loon Lake B-23 Dragon crash site in Payette National Forest, Idaho is a remarkably intact example of an aircraft wreck. The crew survived and was rescued, and some avionics removed from the site, and it currently is the subject of a teaching aviation archaeology field school in various years.

==== Abandoned airfields ====
[[File:ArlingtonAuxiliaryAirfieldColoNWview.jpg|thumb|left|Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield: high view from the SW corner of the triangular runway&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoaviationarchaeology.com/Expeditions/LaJuntaAAFSatelliteFieldSurveyProject.aspx ''Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield Aerial View] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181041/http://www.coloradoaviationarchaeology.com/Expeditions/LaJuntaAAFSatelliteFieldSurveyProject.aspx |date=2011-10-06 }}, see image no. 11&lt;/ref&gt; looking WNW, [[Arlington, Colorado|Arlington, CO]], 2006]]
[[File:ArlingtionAuxiliaryAirfieldColoRunway.jpg|thumb|right|Arlington Airfield: E/W runway looking west, notice the large sections of asphalt and the vegetation changes along and on the runway, 2006]]
Abandoned airfields can yield much information of historic information about aviation and related industries.  From civilian airfields to military airfields, aviation archaeologists can find, uncover, and recover a variety of artifacts, just to name a few: aircraft parts with serial numbers, equipment parts, asphalt or runway material, variety of contamination, structures and foundations, businesses and economics, to community and cultural changes. With the closure of a military airbase, the street system and runways become local expansion of city streets and business; one example is the community conversion of [[Lowry Air Force Base]] to a local residential, commercial, and educational environment. Other bases, like the [[Arlington, Colorado#Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield|Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield]] reverted to farming and ranching.

In 1990, 1994, and 1998, archaeologists investigated, using airborne remote sensing studies and limited excavation, a vintage hangar of the [[Huffman Prairie Flying Field]] Site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The investigations were “designed to provide information needed for site management by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the [[Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park]] of the National Park Service. The geophysical and [[remote sensing]] investigations revealed magnetic, electromagnetic, and ground penetrating radar anomalies and infrared thermal images associated with the hangar structure. The archaeological excavations located an in situ wood post, posthole features, and artifacts which represent archaeological remains of the actual hangar”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA352192 "Archaeological, Geophysical, and Remote Sensing Investigations of the 1910 Wright Brothers' Hangar, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113090618/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA352192 |date=2016-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Huffman Prairie Flying Field]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Another example is [[Hamilton Army Airfield]] in [[Novato, California]]. It was in use from 1929 until 1976. It was eventually turned over to the city of Novato for development of housing. The runway is also part of tidal wetland restoration effort currently underway by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], [[California Coastal Conservancy]], and the [[San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]].

==== Abandoned missile silos and sites ====
[[California]] has [[missile]] launch sites abandoned by the [[US Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ed-thelen.org/loc-c.html|title=Missile Sites|author=|date=|website=ed-thelen.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817065752/http://ed-thelen.org/loc-c.html|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeological research includes these sites throughout the United States.  Exploring and hiking around abandoned [[Missile silo|silos]] and sites may constitute trespassing as well as being dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siloworld.net/|title=SiloWorld|first=|last=SiloMan|date=|website=www.siloworld.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006212828/http://www.siloworld.net/|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Permission from current [[land owner]]s or caretakers is imperative.  Research and formal site investigations adds to the historical record of the [[Cold War]]. One such site is the [[Minuteman Missile National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/mimi/index.htm|title=Minuteman Missile National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|author=|date=|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413042718/https://www.nps.gov/mimi/index.htm|archivedate=13 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] is a decommissioned [[Cold War]] era [[Nike Missile]] base, [[Nike Missile Site SF-88]]. In 1954, it was armed with [[Nike Ajax]] missiles. In 1958, it was converted to [[Nike Hercules]] nuclear missiles. After it was shut down in 1974, it was turned over to the [[National Park Service]], and it open for to the public regularly. [http://www.nps.gov/goga/nike-missile-site.htm]

=== Underwater crash sites ===
A [[1948 Lake Mead Boeing B-29 crash|B-29 "Superfortress" Serial No. 45-21847]] ditched in Lake Mead in 1949. This particular aircraft is listed in the National Register under Criterion C as an example of a significant type of aircraft construction and under Criterion D for it potential to yield important information.

The remains of the [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)#Wreck site exploration|USS Macon Airship]] and its associated [[F9C Sparrowhawk]]s are located at around 1500 feet in the [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]]. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) has run survey expeditions to the site, creating photomosaics to track deterioration. The wreck site is listed on the National Register.

== Underwater surveying and recovery ==
Underwater search and recovery is a complex aspect of aviation archaeology. Dive and recovery team have to do extensive research and planning before any recovery is performed. The aircraft site may be left as a memorial and not recovered. Once an aircraft has been located, an underwater survey is conducted before recovery operations begin. Many tasks are established and the research is a long process that requires the detailed review numerous and various sources of information. The complexities include a great deal of preparation, extensive training,  precise planning, and very technical equipment and coordination. Conservation has often proved very difficult&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association ''Dive Recovery Team''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908012658/http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Australian focus has been on underwater aviation archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-web/content/broken-wings-introduction Western Australian Museum ''Broken Wings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319211857/http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-web/content/broken-wings-introduction |date=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; partly as a result of the interest of the relatively large number of maritime archaeologists and shipwreck conservators in the field. This has resulted in numerous studies and reports, including some cross-fertilization or ideas, theory and techniques with practitioners in other parts of the world, with a strong emphasis on the involvement of conservators.&lt;ref&gt;http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/fallenangels/fallenangels.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704074734/http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/fallenangels/fallenangels.html |date=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Underwater aviation archaeology commenced in Australia at the wrecks of the Dornier, Catalina, and Sunderland Flying Boats destroyed by Japanese fighters at Broome in WWII. These lie, both in the intertidal zone,  and in deeper water.&lt;ref&gt;http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/treasures/broome/broome.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704074614/http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/treasures/broome/broome.html |date=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study continued in Darwin in the Northern Territory with research and fieldwork at its series of submerged PBY Catalina wrecks,&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Silvano (2001). Wings Beneath the Sea: the aviation archaeology of Catalina Flying Boats in Darwin Harbour, Northern Territory. Unpublished Master of Arts thesis, Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University), Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the study has spread to other regions in Australia, partly as a result of the Interest of Flinders University and its postgraduate student body.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ford, J., 2006. WW Aviation Archaeology in Victoria Australia. Department of Maritime Archaeology. Flinders University. Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt;  While military aircraft remain the property of their respective governments unless delegated to a third party, submerged aircraft wrecks (such as the wrecks at Broome in Western Australia), have proven to be quite difficult to protect from unauthorized recoveries and looting. Those in Broome are now protected under the provisions of the 1990 Heritage of Western Australia Act.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, M., Green, J., Jung, S. and Souter, C., 2002. The Broome Flying Boats: Papers relating to the nomination of a suite of flying boat wrecks at Broome to the Register of Heritage Places under the Heritage Of Western Australia Act 1990. Report – Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Maritime Museum, No. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a profession ==
In America, aviation archaeologists, crosstrained in other areas of study, are found in the employ of [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] (JPAC), traveling to former war zones throughout the world, to search for the remains of American servicemen and women that have been lost.  Many of these losses involve aircraft mishaps in remote and difficult to reach areas. A group of volunteers, under the banner of "[[BentProp Project|The BentProp Project]]", have pursued American military wreck sites and remains without disturbing them; their findings are forwarded to JPAC. In Australia and in some other parts of the world, where there are human remains involved,  a tendency has been for the armed forces to secure the services of forensic anthropologists and crash investigators.

Professional aviation archaeologists may also be involved in the recovery of near-complete examples of wrecked or abandoned aircraft for profit.  The clients of these professionals range from private individuals and aviation museums, to government agencies. Often these aircraft are in remote areas, which aids wreckage preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hoffman, Carl|year=2001|title=Hunting Warbirds - The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-43617-2|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''[[Glacier Girl]]'', a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] that was successfully recovered from below the [[Greenland]] ice cap, and restored to [[airworthy]] condition, and ''[[Kee Bird]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] also abandoned on the Greenland ice cap, but severely damaged by recovery efforts.

'''Blackle''' is a website powered by [[Google Custom Search]] and created by [[Heap Media]], which aims to save energy by displaying a black background and using grayish-white font color for search results.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackle.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Blackle claims having saved nearly 6 [[Kilowatt hours#Watt hour multiples and billing units|MWh]] of electrical energy up to December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackle.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a claim currently under dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techlogg.com/2010/05/black-vs-white-screen-power-consumption-24-more-monitors-tested/17|title=Black vs white screen power consumption|date=May 13, 2010|publisher=Techlogg.com|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the average American household consumes 11 MWh of electrical energy per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/electricity/esr/table5.html|title=Residential Average Monthly Bill by Census Division, and State|accessdate=April 27, 2012|publisher=EIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The concept behind Blackle is that [[computer monitors]] can be made to use less energy by displaying much darker colors. Blackle is based on a study which tested a variety of [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and [[LCD monitor]]s. There is dispute over whether there really are any energy saving effects, especially for users of LCD screens, where there is a constant [[backlight]].&lt;ref name="Roberson"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Roberson| first = Bobby| last2 = Homan| first2 = Josh| last3 = Mahaja| first3 = Gage| last4 = Nordman| first4 = Larry| last5 = Webber| first5 = Carrie| last6 = Brown| first6 = Ricardo| last7 = McWhinney| first7 = Marla| last8 = Koomey| first8 = Cainan| title = Energy Use and Power Levels in New Monitors and Personal Computers| date = June 2001| url = http://enduse.lbl.gov/Info/LBNL-48581.pdf| format = PDF| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| access-date = 2007-06-16| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090206092028/http://enduse.lbl.gov/Info/LBNL-48581.pdf| archive-date = 2009-02-06| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&amp;pgw_code=MO Monitor Energy Information] for [[Energy Star]], [[United States Department of Energy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-black-new-green.html|title=Is black the new green?|last=Weihl|first=Bill|date=August 9, 2007|work=Official Google Blog|publisher=[[Google, Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was first brought to the attention of Heap Media by a [[blog post]], which estimated that Google could save 750 [[Kilowatt hours#Watt hour multiples and billing units|megawatt hours]] a year by utilizing it for [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screens.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Search site cashes in on eco-guilt |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/search-site-cashes-in-on-ecoguilt/2007/08/01/1185647951527.html |last=Moses |first = Asher |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoiron.blogspot.com/2007/01/black-google-would-save-3000-megawatts.html Black Google Would Save 750 Megawatt-hours a Year], by ecoIron. The blog post by that inspired Blackle.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[homepage]] of Blackle provides a count of the number of watt hours claimed to have been saved by enabling this concept.

'''Bousillage''' ('''bouzillage''',&lt;ref name=McDermott &gt;McDermott, John Francis. "bousillage, bouzillage, n. m.". ''A Glossary of Mississippi Valley French, 1673-1850''. St. Louis: , 1941. 34. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; '''bousille''', '''bouzille''') is a mixture of clay and grass or other fibrous substances used as the infill (chinking) between the timbers of a half-timbered building. This material was commonly used by 18th century French colonial settlers in the historical [[New France]] region of the United States and is similar to the material [[Cob (material)|cob]] and [[adobe]]. In French ''torchis'' has the same meaning or the meaning of a loaf of this material.&lt;ref name=McDermott/&gt;

==Discussion==
''Bousillage'' in south [[Louisiana]] is a mixture of clay earth and [[Retting|retted]] [[Spanish moss]], but in the Upper Mississippi River Valley and Canada contains straw, grass or hair,&lt;ref name=McDermott/&gt; used to fill in the panels in [[poteaux-sur-sol]], poteaux-en-terre, and [[timber framing|half-timbered]] framing (called ''colombage'' in French).&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Jay Dearborn, and Nicolas Verton. ''A Creole lexicon architecture, landscape, people''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004. 32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a technique used in French Louisiana by colonists from the 18th to 19th centuries.  In France the framing was typically in-filled between the post with brick (briquette-entre-poteaux), stone and mud ([[Pierrotage]]) or bousillage.  There was no stone in south Louisiana, and bricks were not being made during early colonial times.  The colonist picked up on a technique that the Native Americans were using to build their wattle and daub structures, and that was heavy clay soil and retted Spanish moss as the binder.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Split sticks or staves, known as ''barreaux'', ''rabbits'' or ''batons''  were used as rungs between the upright post.  They were shaped to fit at an angle and hammered into place without the use of nails.

Bousillage is made by layering a ''taché'' (hole in the ground) with mud and moss and adding water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creoleproject.com/ Blokker, Laura Ewen and Heather A. Knight. "Louisiana’s Bousillage Tradition: Investigation of Past Techniques for Future Practice". 2009 Fitch Mid-Career Grant. 2011. Print. accessed April 7, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Then ''tacherons'' (barefoot men) worked the mixture into a mortar. ''Torchis'' (bousillage shaped like a bread dough loaf) are hung over the barreaux being compacted as placed one next to the other.  The finished wall would have been either [[Whitewash|lime wash]]ed or covered with lime plaster.  The plaster contains animal hair as a binder.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Vernacular Gumbo, by Edward Cazayoux and A Manual for the Environmental &amp; Climatic Responsive Restoration &amp; Renovation of Older Houses in Louisiana, by Edward Cazayoux&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty '''[[Concorde]]''' aircraft were built, six for development and 14 for commercial service.

These were
*Two prototypes
*Two pre-production aircraft
*Two development aircraft
*14 production aircraft

All but two of these aircraft are preserved.

==Prototypes==
[[File:The Concorde (2881257616).jpg|thumb| ''G-BSST'' on display at the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]].]]

The two prototype aircraft were used to expand the flight envelope of the aircraft as quickly as possible and prove that the design calculations for supersonic flight were correct.

* F-WTSS (production designation 001) was the first Concorde to fly, on 2 March 1969, and was retired on arrival at the French air museum at [[Le Bourget Airport]] on 19 October 1973, having made 397 flights covering 812 hours, of which 255 hours were at supersonic speeds. It remains in its Solar Eclipse mission livery complete with rooftop portholes.
** Concorde 001 was modified for the [[Solar eclipse of June 30, 1973|1973 solar eclipse]] mission with rooftop portholes and observation equipment. Its flight over Africa became the longest observation of a solar eclipse, lasting some 74 minutes.&lt;ref name=Vice-Motherboard-2016-03-09&gt; {{cite magazine |url= https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-concorde-and-the-longest-solar-eclipse |title= When Astronomers Chased a Total Eclipse in a Concorde |author= Chris Hatherill |date= 9 March 2016 |work= Motherboard |publisher= Vice }} &lt;/ref&gt;
* G-BSST (002) first flew on 9 April 1969 from [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]] to [[RAF Fairford]]. Its last flight was on 4 March 1976 when it flew to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] at the Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, England. It had made 438 flights (836 hours), of which 196 flights were supersonic.

==Pre-production aircraft==

Both pre-production aircraft were used to further develop the design of the aircraft. Changes to design include different wing plan form, more fuel, different engine standard, different air intake systems etc.
[[File:Concorde_101.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Concorde G-AXDN (101) in the AirSpace exhibition hall at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].]]
*Concorde G-AXDN (101) first flew on 17 December 1971 from Filton and was retired to the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]], England, where it landed on 20 August 1977, having made 269 flights (632 hours), of which 168 flights were supersonic.
*Concorde F-WTSA (102) first flew on 10 January 1973 from Toulouse. It was the fourth aircraft and the first to have the features and the shape of the future production aircraft. It was the first to fly to the United States (on 20 September 1973 to Dallas, Texas). For several years the aircraft was painted in British Airways colours on one side and Air France colours on the other. It made 314 flights (656 hours), of which 189 supersonic and was then retired to [[Orly Airport]] in Paris on 20 May 1976, where it is on display to the public.

==Development aircraft==

The production aircraft were different in many ways to the original aircraft necessitating re-examining certain areas to obtain certification. In all there were six "development" aircraft. The two prototypes (001/002), the two pre-production (101/102) and two production aircraft (201/202)

*F-WTSB (201) first flew on 6 December 1973 from Toulouse. Its last flight was on 19 April 1985 from Chateauroux to Toulouse flying a total of 909 hours. It is currently inside the Aeroscopia museum near Airbus Factory at Toulouse (France).
*[[G-BBDG]] (202) first flew on 13 December 1974 from Filton to RAF Fairford. It last flew on 24 December 1981 after a total of 1282 hours. Subsequently it was stored in a hangar on the Filton Airfield and was used as a spare parts source by BA for their Concorde fleet. It was sectioned &amp; moved by road in May/June 2004 to the Brooklands museum site in Weybridge, Surrey, where after restoration it was opened to the public in the summer of 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklandsconcorde.com/ Brooklands]&lt;/ref&gt;
**There is an unverified story amongst British Aerospace staff that the last flight of the Filton aircraft was on a contract to the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], to see if a supersonic jet of that size would be radar visible heading over [[Iceland]] and down towards the UK from the west; a test of the country's radar defences against the then-new Tupolev [[Tupolev Tu-160|Tu-160 'Blackjack']] bomber. However, the flight test logs show the final flights of G-BBDG as being test flights related to primary nozzle control (PNC) development work, which was a planned post entry in the service development area.

==British production aircraft==
British Airways had seven production aircraft in commercial service:

*'''G-BOAC''' (204) The flagship of the fleet (because of its [[BOAC]] registration) first flew on 27 February 1975 from Filton UK. It made its final flight to [[Manchester Airport]] – where a special "glass hangar" has now been built at the viewing park for its display – on 31 October 2003 after flying 22,260 hours.
*'''G-BOAA''' (206) first flew on 5 November 1975 from Filton UK. This was the aircraft that flew with the [[Red Arrows]] on 2 June 1996 to celebrate 50 years of [[Heathrow Airport]]. It last flew on 12 August 2000 as BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow after flying 22,768 hours, and it never received the modifications after the Paris crash. For its final journey it was transported to the [[National Museum of Flight]] (run by [[National Museums Scotland]]), [[East Fortune]], near Edinburgh, over land to the [[River Thames|Thames]], then by sea to [[Torness]], then over land again to the museum from 8 April to 19 April 2004.

*'''G-BOAB''' (208) first flew on 18 May 1976 from Filton. Its last flight was a positioning flight on 15 August 2000 as BA002P from New York JFK to London Heathrow after flying 22,296 hours. It remains at [[Heathrow Airport]]. It was never modified, and so never flew again after returning home following the Paris crash. G-BOAB was used by British Airways to carry out a test installation of the 'Project Rocket' interior that was later installed on the rest of the fleet, before remaining stationary for several years with its interior stripped, with boxes of magazines being used as ballast, being periodically towed to various locations around the airport. Following minor restoration works in 2015 and 2017, the aircraft is used for apprentice training by BA. G-BOAB remains at Heathrow as of 2018, and can often be sighted from aircraft moving about the airport's apron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=G-BOAB (208) British Production |url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/g-boab-208 |website=Heritage Concorde |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''G-BOAD''' (210) first flew on 25 August 1976 from Filton. Repainted with [[Singapore Airlines]] livery on the left side and British Airways livery on the right&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/210.html Aircraft 210: G-BOAD]&lt;/ref&gt; for a joint service by the two airlines between Bahrain and [[Singapore International Airport]] at Paya Lebar for three months in 1977, and from 1979 to 1981. This aircraft also set the fastest Atlantic crossing by any Concorde on 7 February 1996, taking off from New York JFK and landing in London Heathrow 2 hours, 52 minutes, and 59 seconds later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/The-Intrepid-Experience/Exhibits/Concorde.aspx Intrepid Museum Exhibits]&lt;/ref&gt; It departed from Heathrow for the final time on 10 November 2003, and flew to JFK airport in New York, from where it was then transferred (on a barge originally used to move [[Space shuttle]] external fuel tanks), to the [[Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum]], New York (USA), past the [[Statue of Liberty]] and up the [[Hudson River]]. Its engines were removed to reduce weight. Its temporary home was on a barge alongside the aircraft carrier Intrepid, pending the proposed creation of a quayside display hall; however, in December 2006, this Concorde was moved to [[Floyd Bennett Field]] in Brooklyn, where it was kept in poor conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/nyregion/07concorde.html?ref=nyregion | work=The New York Times | title=A Concorde Is Disfigured While Parked in Brooklyn | first=Patrick | last=McGeehan | date=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/latestnews.html Concorde Sst : Latest News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; G-BOAD's nose cone was knocked off by a truck at the end in June 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2008/07/14/2008-07-14_retired_concorde_suffers_damage_at_floyd.html |title = Retired Concorde suffers damage at Floyd Bennett Field |first = Rachel |last = Monahan |publisher = ''Daily News (Brooklyn) |date = 14 July 2008 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2273991/US-leaves-Concorde-gift-from-UK-to-rot-in-airfield.html|title=US leaves Concorde gift from UK to rot in airfield|first=Laura|last=Clout|publisher= ''The Telegraph''|date=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage was repaired and subsequently the aircraft was moved back to Pier 86 in Manhattan (and placed on the pier, rather than on a barge) on 20 October 2008. G-BOAD spent more time in the air than any other Concorde at 23,397 hours. G-BOAD was incorporated into the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in 2008.
*'''G-BOAE''' (212) first flew on 17 March 1977 from Filton. On 1 July 1999 it flew in formation with the [[Red Arrows]] to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament. Its last flight was to [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Bridgetown ([[Barbados]]) on 17 November 2003, with 70 members of BA staff on board. The flight, lasting less than 4 hours, reached the maximum certified height of 60,000&amp;nbsp;ft (18,300 m). It flew a total of 23,376 hours. A new exhibition was constructed to house the aircraft, east of the airport at the old Spencers Plantation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbadosconcorde.com/ ''Barbados Concorde Experience'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MOF-Concorde front WL.jpg|right|thumb|Concorde G-BOAG at the [[Museum of Flight]].]]

*'''G-BOAG''' (214) first flew on 21 April 1978 from Filton. The aircraft that flew the final Speedbird 2 service from New York on 24 October, left Heathrow for the final time on 3 November 2003. It spent a day "resting" and refuelling in New York before making its final flight on 5 November 2003 from New York JFK to [[Boeing Field]], Seattle in an unusual supersonic flight (which required special permission) over the sparsely populated part of northern Canada. It is currently displayed at Seattle's [[Museum of Flight]], alongside the first [[Boeing 707|707]] that served as [[Air Force One]] and the prototype [[Boeing 747]]. This Concorde was once used as a source of spares, before being restored using parts from Air France's F-BVFD and has flown 16,239 hours.
*'''G-BOAF''' (216) first flew on 20 April 1979 from Filton and was the last Concorde to be built. It made Concorde's final flight on Wednesday 26 November 2003. Departing from Heathrow at 11:30 [[GMT]], it made a last, brief, supersonic flight, carrying 100 BA staff, over the Bay of Biscay. It then flew a "lap of honour" above [[Bristol]], passing over [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], [[Clevedon]], [[Weston-super-Mare]], [[Bristol Airport]] and [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], before landing at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]], soon after 13:00 GMT. It was met by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], who formally accepted its handover. It has flown a total of 18,257 hours. Until 2010, the aircraft was open for public viewing at the [[Airbus UK|Airbus]] facility; since 2017 it has been the main exhibit at Filton's [[Aerospace Bristol]] museum.&lt;ref name= AB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospacebristol.org/|title= Aerospace Bristol|accessdate=24 October 2016|work=Aerospace Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of tenth-anniversary celebrations on 24 December 1985, British Airways photographed G-BOAA, G-BOAC, G-BOAF and G-BOAG [[formation flying]] for their publicity material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordesst.com/history/events/10.html|title=10th Anniversary Formation Flight 24th December 1985|accessdate=31 August 2013|work=Concorde SST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French production aircraft==
Air France also had seven production aircraft in commercial service:
*'''F-BTSC''' (203) was the Concorde lost in the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]] on 25 July 2000 killing 113 people. It was featured in the film ''[[The Concorde ... Airport '79]]''. It first flew on 31 January 1975 from Toulouse and flew for 11,989 hours.
[[File:Concorde F-BVFA (205) at Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde F-BVFA on display at Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, USA.]]
*'''F-BVFA''' (205) First flew on 27 October 1975 from Toulouse. In 1988 it flew around the world in a record breaking (at the time) 41 hours 27 minutes. It made its final flight to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s new [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (USA) on 12 June 2003 and flying 17,824 hours.
*'''F-BVFB''' (207) first flew on 6 March 1976 from Toulouse. It was sold for [[Euro|€1]] to the [[Sinsheim Auto &amp; Technik Museum]] in [[Germany]]. It flew to [[Baden Airpark|Karlsruhe-Baden–Baden Airpark]], in south west Germany on 24 June 2003. After removal of its wings and tail fin, it travelled by barge and road, to join a [[Tupolev Tu-144]] already on exhibit at Sinsheim. It has flown 14,771 hours.
*'''F-BVFC''' (209) first flew on 9 July 1976 from Toulouse. It was retired to the [[Airbus]] plant at Toulouse (France), where the French aircraft were constructed, on 27 June 2003, joining '''201''' and ending Air France's relationship with Concorde. The final flight was supersonic, and included a [[go around]] at Toulouse. It had flown 14,332 hours. Since January 2015, it is on display outside Aeroscopia museum near Airbus Toulouse factory.
*'''F-BVFD''' (211) first flew on 10 February 1977 from Toulouse. It was retired early, in 1982, having flown only 5,814 hours (final flight on 27 May 1982). Badly corroded after being stored outdoors, and damaged through use as a source of spare parts, it was broken up in 1994. It is the only Concorde scrapped before retirement.
*'''F-BTSD''' (213) first flew on 26 June 1978 from Toulouse. It was retired to the Air and Space museum at Le Bourget (France) on 14 June 2003, joining '''001''' after flying 12,974 hours. In 1996, this aircraft carried a promotional paint scheme (blue with logo) for [[Pepsi]]. The wings were kept white, and while in the Pepsi livery, it was restricted to flying at most 20 minutes at Mach 2.02 and otherwise Mach 1.7 (the plane normally requires a white livery to fly supersonic, because of the heat)&lt;ref name=Jolivet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Team of twelve authors, many Concorde engineers, including Alex Jolivet head of the team of engineers who work on conserving F-BTSD see [https://www.heritageconcorde.com/about-us about us]|title=Pepsi Blue Concorde 1996|url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/pepsi-blue-concorde-1996|website=Heritage Concorde}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is estimated to have cost Pepsi $20 million{{cn|date=December 2017}}. It flew 16 flights around the Middle East in this livery&lt;ref name=Jolivet/&gt;. The plane also holds the world record for flying around the world in both directions. Westbound in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds on 12/13 October 1992 and Eastbound in 31 hours 27 minutes and 49 seconds on 15/16 August 1995. It also was the only Concorde to land in Central America and then it set a new time record between [[Juan Santamaria International Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].
*'''F-BVFF''' (215) first flew on 26 December 1978 from Toulouse. It remains on display at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in [[Paris]], being cosmetically reassembled, after the withdrawal of the type was announced midway through refurbishment. It last flew on a charter flight to Paris Charles de Gaulle on 11 June 2000 after flying 12,421 hours

'''Consumer electronics''' or '''home electronics''' are [[Electronics|electronic]] ([[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[digital electronics|digital]]) equipments intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for [[entertainment]] ([[flatscreen]] TVs, [[DVD player]]s, [[video game]]s, [[remote control car]]s, etc.), [[communication]]s ([[telephone]]s, [[cell phone]]s, [[e-mail]]-capable [[laptop]]s, etc.), and [[home-office]] activities (e.g., [[desktop computer]]s, [[printer (computing)|printer]]s, [[paper shredder]]s, etc.). In British English, they are often called '''brown goods''' by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from "[[white goods]]" which are meant for [[housekeeping]] tasks, such as [[washing machine]]s and [[refrigerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/brown-goods|title=brown goods|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"Brown" from the [[bakelite]] and wood-veneer finishes typical on 1950s and 1960s radio and TV receivers, and in contrast to "white goods".&lt;ref name="McDermott2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Catherine|title=Design: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUTS0n69o5EC&amp;pg=PA234|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=30 October 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134361809|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large [[big box]] consumer electronics stores, such as [[Best Buy]], which sell both entertainment, communication, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. 

[[Radio broadcasting]] in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the [[Receiver (radio)|broadcast receiver]].  Later products included [[telephone]]s, [[television]]s and [[calculator]]s, then audio and video recorders and players, [[game consoles]], [[personal computer]]s and [[MP3 player]]s. In the 2010s, consumer electronics stores often sell [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[automotive electronics]] ([[car stereo]]s), [[video game console]]s, [[electronic musical instrument]]s (e.g., [[synthesizer]] keyboards), [[karaoke machine]]s, [[digital camera]]s, and video players ([[VCR]]s in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by [[DVD player]]s and [[Blu-ray disc]] players). Stores also sell [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, [[cell phone]]s, and [[smartphone]]s. As of 2016, some of the newer products sold include [[virtual reality]] [[head-mounted display]] goggles, [[smart home]] devices that [[Internet of things|connect home devices to the Internet]] (such as smartphone-controllable thermostats and lights) and [[wearable technology]] such as [[Fitbit]] digital exercise watches.

In the 2010s, most consumer electronics have become based on digital technologies, and have largely merged with the [[computer]] industry in what is increasingly referred to as the [[consumerization]] of [[information technology]]. Some consumer electronics stores, such as [[Best Buy]], have also begun selling office and baby furniture. Consumer electronics stores may be "[[bricks and mortar]]" physical retail stores, online stores, where the consumer chooses items on a website and pays online (e.g., Amazon). or a combination of both models (e.g., Best Buy has both bricks and mortar stores and an [[e-commerce]] website for ordering its products). The CEA ([[Consumer Electronics Association]]) estimated the value of 2015 consumer electronics sales at US$220 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = CEA: Industry Sales Data  | url=https://www.cta.tech/Research/Products-Services/Industry-Sales-Data.aspx  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Radio&amp;TV store 1961.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A radio and TV store in 1961.]]
For its first fifty years the [[phonograph]] turntable did not use electronics; the needle and soundhorn were purely mechanical technologies. However, in the 1920s [[radio broadcasting]] became the basis of [[mass production]] of [[radio receiver]]s. The [[vacuum tube]]s that had made radios practical were used with record players as well, to [[audio amplifier|amplify]] the sound so that it could be played through a [[loudspeaker]]. [[Television]] was soon invented, but remained insignificant in the consumer market until the 1950s. The [[transistor]], invented in 1947 by [[Bell Laboratories]], led to significant research in the field of solid-state [[semiconductor]]s in the early 1950s. The transistor's advantages revolutionized that industry along with other electronics. By 1959 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] had introduced the first [[planar transistor]] from which come the origins of [[Moore's law]].&lt;ref name="moorelaw"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Origin, ''Nature'', and Implications of Moore's Law. The Benchmark of Progress in Semiconductor Electronics|last1=Schaller|first1=Bob|date=26 September 1996|publisher=Microsoft Research|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/moore_law.html|quote=Moore viewed the 1959 innovation of the planar transistor as the origin of "Moore's Law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrated circuit]]s followed when manufacturers built circuits (usually for military purposes) on a single substrate using electrical connections between circuits within the chip itself. Bell's invention of the transistor and the development of semiconductors led to far better and cheaper consumer electronics, such as [[transistor radio]]s, televisions, and by the 1980s, affordable [[video game]] consoles and [[personal computer]]s that regular middle-class families could buy.

{{cquote|When we were patenting this [planar transistor] we recognized it was a significant change, and the patent attorney asked us if we really thought through all the ramifications of it. And we hadn't, so Noyce got a group together to see what they could come up with and right away he saw that this gave us a reason now you could run the metal up over the top without shorting out the junctions, so you could actually connect this one to the next-door neighbor or some other thing. – Gordon Moore}}

[[File:CoCo3system.jpg|thumb|A typical [[TRS-80 Color Computer#Color Computer 3 (1986–1991)|CoCo 3]] computer system, from the 1980s]]
Main consumer electronics products include [[radio receiver]]s, [[television set]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, [[digital video recorder|video recorders]], [[DVD player]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[video game console]]s, [[telephone]]s and [[mobile phone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hoovers.com/industry-facts.consumer-electronics-manufacturing.1171.html | title=Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Industry Overview | publisher=[[Hoover's]] | accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly these products have become based on digital technologies, and have largely merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to as the [[consumerization]] of [[information technology]] such as those invented by [[Apple Inc.]] and [[MIT Media Lab]].

===Trends===
[[File:Samsung LE26R41BD and Yamada DVD player 20030624.jpg|right|thumb|A modern flat panel, [[HDTV]] [[television set]]]]

One overriding characteristic of consumer electronic products is the trend of ever-falling prices. This is driven by gains in manufacturing efficiency and [[automation]], lower [[Labour (economics)|labor]] costs as manufacturing has moved to lower-wage countries, and improvements in [[semiconductor]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qualitydigest.com/inside/quality-insider-news/china-moves-automate-electronics-manufacturing.html |title=China Moves to Automate Electronics Manufacturing |author=Mike Deng|date=23 October 2012|publisher=Quality Digest|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiconductor components benefit from [[Moore's law]], an observed principle which states that, for a given price, semiconductor functionality doubles every two years.

While consumer electronics continues in its trend of [[Technological convergence|convergence]], combining elements of many products, consumers face different decisions when purchasing. There is an ever-increasing need to keep product information updated and comparable, for the consumer to make an informed choice. Style, price, specification, and performance are all relevant. There is a gradual shift towards [[e-commerce]] web-storefronts.

Many products include [[Internet connectivity]] using technologies such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[EDGE]] or [[Ethernet]]. Products not traditionally associated with computer use (such as [[Internet TV|TVs]] or [[Hi-Fi]] equipment) now provide options to connect to the Internet or to a computer using a [[home network]] to provide access to digital content.  The desire for [[High-definition television|high-definition (HD)]] content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies, such as [[WirelessHD]] or [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]], which are optimized for distribution of HD content between consumer electronic devices in a home.

===Electronic component===
{{main article|Electronic component}}
An electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect [[electrons]] or their associated fields. Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular form and are not to be confused with [[electrical element]]s, which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components.

===Software development===
{{see also|Software development}}
Consumer electronics such as personal computers use various types of software. Embedded [[software]] is used within some consumer electronics, such as [[mobile phone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601743/microsoft-announces-two-lumia-phones-always-on-cortana-and-clever-new-mobile-accessories.html | title=Microsoft announces two Lumia phones, always-on Cortana, and clever new mobile accessories | work=[[PC World]] | date=4 September 2014 | accessdate=11 September 2014 | author=Hachman, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of software may be embedded within the hardware of electronic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.oneindia.in/2008/04/13/electronics-hardware-consumption-poised-to-touch-360-bln-by-2015-1208100729.html | title=Electronics hardware consumption poised to touch *360 bln by 2015 | publisher=[[One India]] | date=13 April 2008 | accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consumer electronics include software that is used on a personal computer in conjunction with electronic devices, such as [[camcorder]]s and [[digital camera]]s, and third-party software for such devices also exists.

===Standardization===
Some consumer electronics adhere to protocols, such as [[Communications protocol|connection protocols]] "to high speed bi-directional signals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20120287942 | title=Signal Converter of Consumer Electronics Connection Protocols (US 20120287942 A1) | publisher=IFI CLAIMS Patent Services | date=15 November 2012 | accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[telecommunications]], a communications protocol is a system of digital rules for data exchange within or between computers.

==Trade shows==
The [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin]] (IFA) [[trade show]] has taken place [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] since its foundation in 1924. The event features new consumer electronics and speeches by industry pioneers.

The [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) [[trade show]] has taken place yearly in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] since its foundation in 1973. The event, which grew from having 100 exhibitors in its inaugural year to more than 3,600 exhibitors in its 2014 edition, features new consumer electronics and speeches by industry pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim|last=Hornyak|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601560/jack-wayman-founder-of-ces-trade-show-dies-at-92.html|title=Jack Wayman, founder of CES trade show, dies at 92|work=PC World|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IEEE initiatives==

[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), the world's largest professional society, has many initiatives to advance the state-of-the art of consumer electronics. IEEE has a dedicated society of thousands of professionals to promote CE, called the [[IEEE Consumer Electronics Society|Consumer Electronics Society (CESoc)]].&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Consumer Electronics Society, http://cesoc.ieee.org/&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE has multiple periodicals and international conferences to promote CE and encourage collaborative research and development in CE. The flagship conference of CESoc, called IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE), is on its 35th year.

==Retailing==
Electronics retailing is a significant part of the [[retail]] industry in many countries. In the United States, [[big-box store]] retailers include [[Best Buy]] and [[Sears]], with Best Buy being the largest consumer electronics retailer in the country.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140125/ISSUE01/301259976/why-consumer-electronics-retailers-are-the-next-record-store | title=Why consumer electronics retailers are the next record store | publisher=[[Crain's Chicago Business]] | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=11 September 2014 | author=Murphy, H.

==Service and repair==
{{see also|Electronics technician}}
Consumer electronic service can refer to the maintenance of said products. When consumer electronics have malfunctions, they may sometimes be repaired.

In 2013 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the increased popularity in listening to sound from [[Analog recording|analog]] audio devices, such as [[record player]]s, as opposed to digital sound, has sparked a noticeable increase of business for the electronic repair industry there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/08/18/Electronic-repair-industry-gets-second-wind/stories/201308180223 | title=Electronic repair industry gets second wind | work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date=18 August 2013 | accessdate=11 September 2014 | author=Todd, Deborah M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==

=== Energy consumption ===
The energy consumption of consumer electronics and their environmental impact, either from their production processes or the disposal of the devices, is increasing steadily. [[Energy Information Administration|EIA]] estimates that electronic devices and gadgets account for about 10%–15% of the energy use in American homes – largely because of their number; the average house has dozens of electronic devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/ "Heating and cooling no longer majority of US home energy use"]. EIA.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption of consumer electronics increases – in America and Europe – to about 50% of household consumption, if the term is redefined to include [[home appliances]] such as [[refrigerators]], [[Clothes dryer|dryers]], [[Washing machines|clothes washers]] and [[dishwashers]].

===Standby power===
[[Standby power]] – used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off – accounts for 5–10% of total household energy consumption, costing $100 annually to the average household in the United States.&lt;ref name="energygov2012"&gt;{{Cite web| title = 3 Easy Tips to Reduce Your Standby Power Loads| last1 = Chu| first1= John| website = Energy.gov| publisher = [[United States Department of Energy]]| date = 1 November 2012| accessdate = 10 September 2014| url = http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/3-easy-tips-reduce-your-standby-power-loads}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[United States Department of Energy]]'s [[Berkeley Lab]] found that a videocassette recorders (VCRs) consume more electricity during the course of a year in standby mode than when they are used to record or playback videos. Similar findings were obtained concerning [[set-top box|satellite boxes]], which consume almost the same amount of energy in "on" and "off" modes.&lt;ref name="energygov2009"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Please Stand By: Reduce Your Standby Power Use| last1 = Lippert| first1 = John | website = Energy.gov| publisher = [[United States Department of Energy]]| date = 17 August 2009| accessdate = 10 September 2014| url = http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/please-stand-reduce-your-standby-power-use}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study in the United Kingdom, carried out by the [[Energy Saving Trust]], found that the devices using the most power on standby mode included televisions, satellite boxes and other video and audio equipment.  The study concluded that UK households could save up to £86 per year by switching devices off instead of using standby mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/26/appliances-standby-cost-households-energy|title=Leaving appliances on standby 'can cost UK households up to £86 a year'|first=Fiona|last=Harvey|work=The Guardian|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the [[International Energy Agency]] in 2014 found that $80 billion of power is wasted globally per year due to inefficiency of electronic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-02/electronic-devices-waste-80-billion-of-power-a-year-iea-says.html|title=Electronic Devices Waste $80 Billion of Power a Year, IEA Says|first=Matthew|last=Carr|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers can reduce unwanted use of standby power by unplugging their devices, using power strips with switches, or by buying devices that are standardized for better energy management, particularly [[Energy Star]] marked products.&lt;ref name="energygov2012"/&gt;

===Electronic waste===
[[File:ewaste-pile.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Electronic waste]]: discarded electronic equipment]]

[[Electronic waste]] describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Many consumer electronics may contain toxic minerals and elements,&lt;ref name="Normal is recycling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videtteonline.com/index.php/2014/09/08/normal-is-recycling-your-out-of-date-electronics/ | title=Normal is recycling out-of-date electronics | work=Vidette Online | publisher=[[Illinois State University]] | date=8 September 2014 | accessdate=9 September 2014 | author=Moreno, Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many electronic scrap components, such as [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]], may contain contaminants such as [[lead]], [[cadmium]], [[beryllium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[dioxins]], or [[brominated flame retardant]]s. [[Electronic waste recycling]] may involve significant risk to workers and communities and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from [[landfill]]s and [[incinerator]] ashes. However, large amounts of the produced electronic waste from developed countries is exported, and handled by the [[informal sector]] in countries like India, despite the fact that exporting electronic waste to them is illegal. Strong informal sector can be a problem for the safe and clean recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2071920,00.html |title=Is India's E-Waste Problem Spiraling Out of Control? |last1=Bhowmick |first1=Nilanjana |date=23 May 2011 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse and repair'''

E-waste policy has gone through various incarnations since the 1970s, with emphases changing as the decades passed. More weight was gradually placed on the need to dispose of e-waste more carefully due to the toxic materials it may contain. There has also been recognition that various valuable metals and plastics from waste electrical equipment can be recycled for other uses. More recently the desirability of reusing whole appliances has been foregrounded in the ‘preparation for reuse’ guidelines. The policy focus is slowly moving towards a potential shift in attitudes to reuse and repair.

With turnover of small household appliances high and costs relatively low, many consumers will throw unwanted electric goods in the normal dustbin, meaning that items of potentially high reuse or recycling value go to landfills. While larger items such as washing machines are usually collected, it has been estimated that the 160,000 tonnes of EEE in regular waste collections was worth £220 million. And 23% of EEE taken to Household Waste Recycling Centres was immediately resaleable – or would be with minor repairs or refurbishment. This indicates a lack of awareness among consumers as to where and how to dispose of EEE, and of the potential value of things that are literally going in the bin.

For reuse and repair of electrical goods to increase substantially in the UK there are barriers that must be overcome. These include people’s mistrust of used equipment in terms of whether it will be functional, safe, and the stigma for some of owning second-hand goods. But the benefits of reuse could allow lower income households access to previously unaffordable technology whilst helping the environment at the same time.&lt;Cole, C., Cooper, T. and Gnanapragasam, A., 2016. Extending product lifetimes through WEEE reuse and repair: opportunities and challenges in the UK. In: Electronics Goes Green 2016+ Conference, Berlin, Germany, 7–9 September 2016&gt;

==Health impact==

Desktop monitors and laptops produce major physical health concerns for humans when bodies are forced into positions that are unhealthy and uncomfortable in order to see the screen better. From this, neck and back pains and problems increase, commonly referred to as [[repetitive strain injuries]]. Using electronics before going to bed makes it difficult for people to fall asleep, which has a negative effect on human health. Sleeping less prevents people from performing to their full potential physically and mentally and can also “increase rates of obesity and diabetes,” which are “long-term health consequences”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thewip.net/2015/07/12/health-risks-of-electronic-devices/|title=Health Risks of Electronic Devices|date=2015-07-12|website=The Women's International Perspective|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity and diabetes are more commonly seen in students and in youth because they tend to be the ones using electronics the most. “People who frequently use their thumbs to type text messages on cell phones can develop a painful affliction called [[De Quervain syndrome]] that affects their tendons on their hands. The best known disease in this category is called [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], which results from pressure on the median nerve in the wrist”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1758">[[File:Minox copystand 12in.JPG|thumb|Minox copystand 12in]]In [[photography]], a '''copy stand''' is a device used to copy images and/or text with a [[camera]]. The stand consists of a board onto which the media is placed and a tripod-mount parallel to it, usually with an adjustable height. Light is provided by bright lamps mounted on either side of the media at 45° angles. This provides uniform lighting and reduces [[specular reflection]], keeping [[glare (vision)|glare]] low.

In film cameras, copy stands are traditionally used with [[slide film]]. The fine resolution of slide film allows the images to be reproduced with high fidelity when they are projected.

==Reprography==

Copy stands can be used for [[reprography]] (that is, to copy documents). To do so, the camera is mounted, usually with a standard 1/4" tripod-mount screw, onto the stand, pointing the lens down at the base, where the document to be copied would be placed.

==Forensics==

Copy stands can be used in forensics to photograph evidence, in much the same way documents are reproduced. Evidence is brought to the lab, placed on the copy stand and recorded. Some copy stands designed for forensic use have [[ultraviolet light]] sources on them, to illuminate latent fingerprints.

==Animation==
Copy stands are sometimes recommended as a low-cost alternative to a full-featured animation stand for traditional [[cel animation]], especially when using small [[film formats]] such as [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24210">A '''cyber-physical''' (also styled '''cyberphysical''') '''system''' ('''CPS''') is a [[Mechanism_(engineering)|mechanism]] that is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms, tightly integrated with the Internet and its users. In cyber-physical systems, ''physical and software components are deeply intertwined, each operating on different spatial and [[temporal scale]]s, exhibiting multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interacting with each other in a lot of ways that change with context''.&lt;ref&gt;"US National Science Foundation, [https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2010/nsf10515/nsf10515.htm Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)]"&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of CPS include [[smart grid]], [[autonomous automobile]] systems, [[medical monitoring]], [[process control system]]s, [[robotics]] systems, and [[automatic pilot]] avionics.&lt;ref name="cpsdta"/&gt;

CPS involves [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approaches, merging theory of [[cybernetics]], [[mechatronics]], design and process science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hancu| first1 = O. | last2 = Maties| first2 = V. | last3 = Balan| first3 = R. | last4 = Stan| first4 = S. | title = Mechatronic approach for design and control of a hydraulic 3-dof parallel robot | doi =  | journal = The 18th International DAAAM Symposium, "Intelligent Manufacturing &amp; Automation: Focus on Creativity, Responsibility and Ethics of Engineers" | volume = | issue = | pages =  | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Introduction to Embedded Systems - A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach "&gt;Lee, E.A., Seshia, S.A.: ''Introduction to Embedded Systems - A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach.''

Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The process control is often referred to as [[embedded system]]s.  In embedded systems, the emphasis tends to be more on the computational elements, and less on an intense link between the computational and physical elements. CPS is also similar to the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT), sharing the same basic architecture; nevertheless, CPS presents a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rad| first1 = Ciprian-Radu | last2 = Hancu| first2 = Olimpiu | last3 = Takacs| first3 = Ioana-Alexandra | last4 = Olteanu| first4 = Gheorghe | title = Smart Monitoring of Potato Crop: A Cyber-Physical System Architecture Model in the Field of Precision Agriculture | doi =  | journal = Conference Agriculture for Life, Life for Agriculture | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 73–79 | year = 2015 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of cyber-physical systems can be found in areas as diverse as [[aerospace]], [[automotive]], [[chemical process]]es, civil infrastructure, energy, [[healthcare]], [[manufacturing]], [[transportation]], [[entertainment]], and [[Home appliance|consumer appliances]].&lt;ref name="cpsdta"&gt;Khaitan et al., "[https://www.academia.edu/23178627/Design_Techniques_and_Applications_of_Cyber_Physical_Systems_A_Survey Design Techniques and Applications of Cyber Physical Systems: A Survey]", IEEE Systems Journal, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Unlike more traditional [[embedded system]]s, a full-fledged CPS is typically designed as a [[computer network|network]] of interacting elements with physical input and output instead of as standalone devices.&lt;ref name="lee2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Edward|title=Cyber Physical Systems: Design Challenges|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-8.html|version=University of California, Berkeley Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2008-8|date=January 23, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion is closely tied to concepts of [[robotics]] and [[sensor network]]s with intelligence mechanisms proper of computational intelligence leading the pathway.  Ongoing advances in science and engineering improve the link between computational and physical elements by means of intelligent mechanisms, increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems.&lt;ref name="Alippi2014"&gt;C.Alippi: ''[https://www.springer.com/engineering/electronics/book/978-3-319-05277-9 Intelligence for Embedded Systems].'' Springer Verlag, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
This will broaden the potential of cyber-physical systems in several directions, including: intervention (e.g., [[collision avoidance]]); precision (e.g., [[robotic surgery]] and nano-level manufacturing); operation in dangerous or inaccessible environments (e.g., search and rescue, firefighting, and [[deep-sea exploration]]); coordination (e.g., [[air traffic control]], war fighting); efficiency (e.g., [[zero energy building|zero-net energy building]]s); and [[augmented intelligence|augmentation of human capabilities]] (e.g. in [[healthcare]] [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] and delivery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Mobile cyber-physical systems ==
Mobile cyber-physical systems, in which the physical system under study has inherent mobility, are a prominent subcategory of cyber-physical systems. Examples of mobile physical systems include mobile robotics and electronics transported by humans or animals. The rise in popularity of [[smartphone]]s has increased interest in the area of mobile cyber-physical systems. Smartphone platforms make ideal mobile cyber-physical systems for a number of reasons, including:

* Significant computational resources, such as processing capability, local storage
* Multiple sensory input/output devices, such as [[touch screen]]s, cameras, [[GPS chip]]s, speakers, microphone, [[light sensor]]s, [[proximity sensor]]s
* Multiple communication mechanisms, such as [[WiFi]], [[4G]], [[EDGE]], [[Bluetooth]] for interconnecting devices to either the Internet, or to other devices
* [[High-level programming language]]s that enable rapid development of mobile CPS node software, such as Java,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Virtual Machine for running Java Applications on a CPS | url = http://www.virtenio.com/en/products/virtual-machine.html | accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective C, JavaScript, [[ECMAScript]] or C#
* Readily-available application distribution mechanisms, such as [[Google Play Store]] and [[Apple App Store]]
* End-user maintenance and upkeep, including frequent re-charging of the battery

For tasks that require more resources than are locally available, one common mechanism for rapid implementation of smartphone-based mobile cyber-physical system nodes utilizes the network connectivity to link the mobile system with either a server or a cloud environment, enabling complex processing tasks that are impossible under local resource constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Examples ==
Common applications of CPS typically fall under sensor-based communication-enabled autonomous systems. For example, many wireless sensor networks monitor some aspect of the environment and relay the processed information to a central node. Other types of CPS include [[smart grid]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Karnouskos: ''[http://papers.duckdns.org/files/2011_INDIN.pdf Cyber-Physical Systems in the Smart Grid] (PDF; 79&amp;nbsp;kB).'' In:''Industrial Informatics (INDIN), 2011 9th IEEE International Conference on'', July 2011. Retrieved 20 Apr 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; autonomous automotive systems, medical monitoring, [[process control]] systems, distributed robotics, and automatic pilot avionics.

A real-world example of such a system is the Distributed Robot Garden at [[MIT]] in which a team of robots tend a garden of tomato plants. This system combines distributed sensing (each plant is equipped with a sensor node monitoring its status), navigation, [[Robotics#Manipulation|manipulation]] and [[wireless network]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://people.csail.mit.edu/nikolaus/drg/ |title=The Distributed Robotics Garden |first= |last=|work=people.csail.mit.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus on the control system aspects of CPS that pervade [[critical infrastructure]] can be found in the efforts of the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] and collaborators researching [[resilient control systems]]. This effort takes a holistic approach to next generation design, and considers the resilience aspects that are not well quantified, such as cyber security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loukas|first1=George|date = June 2015|title=Cyber-Physical Attacks A growing invisible threat|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2818550|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Butterworh-Heinemann (Elsevier)|page = 65 |isbn= 9780128012901}}&lt;/ref&gt; human interaction and complex interdependencies.

Another example is MIT's ongoing CarTel project where a fleet of taxis work by collecting [[real-time traffic information]] in the Boston area. Together with historical data, this information is then used for calculating fastest routes for a given time of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cartel.csail.mit.edu/doku.php |title=CarTel &amp;#91;MIT Cartel&amp;#93; |first= |last= |work=cartel.csail.mit.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber-physical models for future manufacturing—With the motivation a cyber-physical system, a "coupled-model" approach was developed.&lt;ref name=INDIN2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Bagheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|title=Recent Advances and Trends of Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics in Industrial Informatics|journal=IEEE Int. Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN) 2014|date=2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Behrad_Bagheri/publication/266375284_Recent_Advances_and_Trends_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_and_Big_Data_Analytics_in_Industrial_Informatics/links/542dc0100cf27e39fa948a7d?origin=publication_detail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coupled model is a [[digital twin]] of the real machine that operates in the cloud platform and simulates the health condition with an integrated knowledge from both data driven analytical algorithms as well as other available physical knowledge. The coupled model first constructs a digital image from the early design stage. System information and physical knowledge are logged during product design, based on which a simulation model is built as a reference for future analysis. Initial parameters may be statistically generalized and they can be tuned using data from testing or the manufacturing process using parameter estimation. The simulation model can be considered as a mirrored image of the real machine, which is able to continuously record and track machine condition during the later utilization stage. Finally, with ubiquitous connectivity offered by cloud computing technology, the coupled model also provides better accessibility of machine condition for factory managers in cases where physical access to actual equipment or machine data is limited. These features pave the way toward implementing [[cyber manufacturing]].&lt;ref name=MfgLetters&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Lapira|first2=Edzel|last3=Bagheri|first3=Behrad|last4=Kao|first4=Hung-an|title=Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment|journal=Manufacturing Letters|volume=1|issue=1|pages=38–41|doi=10.1016/j.mfglet.2013.09.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213846313000114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Predictive manufacturing system]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:CPS for Manufacturing.png|400px|right]]
A challenge in the development of embedded and cyber-physical systems is the large differences in the design practice between the various engineering disciplines involved, such as software and mechanical engineering. Additionally, as of today there is no "language" in terms of design practice that is common to all the involved disciplines in CPS. Today, in a marketplace where rapid innovation is assumed to be essential, engineers from all disciplines need to be able to explore system designs collaboratively, allocating responsibilities to software and physical elements, and analyzing trade-offs between them. Recent advances show that coupling disciplines by using co-simulation will allow disciplines to cooperate without enforcing new tools or design methods.&lt;ref name="ColaborativeDesignCPS"&gt;J .Fitzgerald, P.G. Larsen, M. Verhoef (Eds.): ''[https://www.springer.com/computer/communication+networks/book/978-3-642-54117-9 Collaborative Design for Embedded Systems: Co-modelling and Co-simulation].'' Springer Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-54118-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the [[MODELISAR]] project show that this approach is viable by proposing a new standard for co-simulation in the form of the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]].

Designing and deploying a cyber-physical production system can be done based on the 5C architecture (connection, conversion, cyber, cognition, and configuration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imscenter.net/cyber-physical-platform|title=IMS_CPS — IMS Center|website=www.imscenter.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Connection" level, devices can be designed to self-connect and self-sensing for its behavior.  In the "Conversion" level, data from self-connected devices and sensors are measuring the features of critical issues with self-aware capabilities, machines can use the self-aware information to self-predict its potential issues.  In the "Cyber" level, each machine is creating its own "twin" by using these instrumented features and further characterize the [[machine health]] pattern based on a "Time-Machine" methodology.  The established "twin" in the cyber space can perform self-compare for peer-to-peer performance for further synthesis.  In the "Cognition" level, the outcomes of self-assessment and self-evaluation will be presented to users based on an "infographic" meaning to show the content and context of the potential issues. In the "Configuration" level, the machine or production system can be reconfigured based on the priority and risk criteria to achieve resilient performance.&lt;ref name=cPS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Bagheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|title=A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems|journal=Manufacturing Letters|date=January 2015|volume=3|pages=18–23|doi=10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original twin model idea came from &lt;ref name=DT1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|title=Teleservice engineering in manufacturing: challenges and opportunities |journal=International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture|date=January 1998|volume=38|pages=901-910|doi=10.1016/S0890-6955(97)00135-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which a physical operation was coupled with a virtual operation by means of an intelligent reasoning agent. The detailed version of this concept is presented in &lt;ref name=DT2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|title=Analysis of machine degradation using a neural network based pattern discrimination model|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Systems|date=1993|volume=12|pages=379-387|doi=10.1016/0278-6125(93)90306-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Encompass''', the '''Enterprise Computing Association''', was the original [[computer user group]] for business customers of [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Encompass's history begins with [[DECUS]], founded in 1961, for customers of the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], which was acquired in 1998 by [[Compaq]].
The [[United States|U.S.]] Chapter incorporated as the user group Encompass U.S.

[[Hewlett-Packard]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002. Encompass continued as an HP user group, aimed at business customers of all of HP's hardware, software, and services.

The Encompass mission was to promote technical information exchange among its members and between the members and [[Hewlett-Packard]].

The Connect User Group Community, formed from the consolidation in May 2008 of Encompass, [[HP-Interex|Interex EMEA]], and [[ITUG]] is [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s largest user community representing more than 50,000 participants. See [[Connect (users group)]] for more information.

The Encompass Board at the time of the consolidation consisted of Nina Buik, Kristi Browder, Glen Kuykendall, Anthony Ioele, Steve Davidek, Dena Wright, John Maynen, Clyde Poole, and Bill Johnson.  Two former directors were credited with being instrumental in facilitating the consolidation, Chris Koppe and Jim Becker.

==Mission==
Encompass partnered with first [[Compaq]] and then [[Hewlett-Packard]] on national technical conferences (in the U.S.):
* CETS 2001 (Compaq Enterprise Technical Symposium): September 10–14, 2001, [[Anaheim, California]]
* HP-ETS 2002 (HP Enterprise Technical Symposium): October 7–11, [[St. Louis, Missouri]]
* HP World 2003: August 11–15, 2003, [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in partnership with [[HP-Interex|Interex]] as well as HP
* HP World 2004: August 16–20, 2004, [[Chicago, Illinois]], in partnership with Interex and HP
* HP Technology Forum 2005: October 17–20, 2005, [[Orlando, Florida]], in partnership with the user group [[OpenView Forum International]] as well as HP
* HP Technology Forum 2006: September 17–21, 2006, [[Houston, Texas]], in partnership with HP, [[ITUG]], and [[OpenView Forum International]]
* HP Technology Forum &amp; Expo 2007: June 17–21, 2007, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], in partnership with HP and ITUG

Encompass also had a number of Local User Groups (LUGs) throughout the U.S., and [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs) on various topics.

Encompass also ran [[webcast]]s, local seminars, and other programs.

Encompass manages the pre-conference seminar program and trade show at the HP Technology Forum &amp; Expo.

Non-U.S. Encompass organizations include:
*Encompass [[Canada]]
*Encompass [[New Zealand]]
*Encompass [[Australia]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6272">The '''exoskeletal engine''' ('''ESE''') is a concept in [[turbomachinery]] design. Current [[gas turbine]] engines have central rotating shafts and fan-discs and are constructed mostly from heavy metals. They require lubricated bearings and need extensive cooling for hot components. They are also subject to severe imbalance (or vibrations) that could wipe out the whole [[Turbine|rotor]] stage, are prone to high- and low-cycle fatigue, and subject to catastrophic failure due to disc bursts from high tensile loads, consequently requiring heavy containment devices.&lt;ref name=asipcon&gt;Chamis, Christos C. and Isaiah M. Blankson.[http://www.asipcon.com/2006/06_proceed/Posters/Poster_Chamis.pdf "Exo-Skeletal Engine – Novel Engine Concept". NASA, 2006.] Retrieved: 31 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; To address these limitations, the ESE concept turns the conventional configuration inside-out and utilizes a drum-type rotor design for the turbomachinery in which the rotor blades are attached to the inside of a rotating drum instead of radially outwards from a shaft and discs. Multiple drum rotors could be used in a [[Turbofan#Turbofan configurations|multi-spool]] design.

==Design==
Fundamentally, the ESE drum-rotor configuration typically consists of four [[concentric]] open-ended drums or shells: 
*an outer shell (engine casing) that both supports the bearings for the drum-rotor shell and constrains it,
*the drum-rotor shell that rotates within the bearings and carries the compressor- and turbine blades,
*a static [[stator]] shell that supports the guide vanes,
*a hollow static inner shell that provides a flow path through the centre of the engine.&lt;ref name=asipcon/&gt;

In the ESE design, the rotating blades are primarily in radial compression as opposed to radial tension, which means that materials that do not possess high-tensile strength, such as [[ceramic materials]], can be used for their construction. Ceramics behave well in compressive loading situations where [[Fracture|brittle fracture]] is minimized, and would provide greater operating efficiency through higher [[operating temperature]]s and lighter engine weight when compared to the metal [[alloy]]s that typically are used in turbomachinery components. The ESE design and the use of composite materials could also reduce the part count, reduce or eliminate cooling, and result in increased component life.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;Roche, Joseph M., Donald T. Palac, James E. Hunter, David E. Myers, and Christopher A. Snyder. [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050215690_2005218705.pdf "Investigation of Exoskeletal Engine Propulsion System Concept". NASA, 2005.] Retrieved: 31 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ceramics would also be a beneficial feature for [[hypersonic]] [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]] systems, where high [[stagnation temperature]]s can exceed the limits of traditional turbomachinery materials.

The cavity within the inner shell could be exploited in several different ways. In subsonic applications, venting the centre cavity with a free-stream flow could potentially contribute to a large noise reduction; while in [[supersonic]]-hypersonic applications it might be used to house a [[ramjet]] or [[scramjet]] (or other devices such as a pulse-detonation engine) as part of a turbine-based [[combined-cycle]] engine. Such an arrangement could reduce the overall length of the propulsion system and thereby reduce weight and drag significantly.&lt;ref name=asipcon/&gt;

==Summarized potential advantages==

{{colend}}

==Challenges==
One of the major challenges is in bearing design as there are no known lubricated systems that can
handle the magnitude of velocity encountered in the ESE; foil- and [[magnetic bearing]]s have been suggested as possible solutions to this problem. 
*[[Foil bearing]]s are noncontacting and ride on a thin film of air, which is generated [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamically]] by the rotational speed, to suspend and centre the shaft. Drawbacks for the foil system include the high start-up torque, the need for set-down/lift-off mechanical bearings and associated positioning hardware, and the high temperatures generated by this system.
*For the large-diameter magnetic bearing system required in the ESE, stiffness and radial growth after spin-up are problems that would be encountered. Radial growth of sufficient magnitude would result in stability problems, and a magnet pole positioning system would be required to maintain the appropriate clearances for the operation of the system. This positioning system would require high-speed sensing and positioning. A passive magnetic laminate and its mounting hardware would require high structural integrity to resist the extremely high inertial forces and would most likely drive an increase in weight.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

Although both bearing systems theoretically meet the requirements of the exoskeletal application, neither technology is currently ready for operation at practical sizes. Developments in foil bearing technology indicate it may take 20 years to achieve foil bearings for this diameter, and magnetic bearings appear to be too heavy for this application and would also face a lengthy technology
development programme.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

'''Fair &amp; Lovely''' is a [[skin lightening|skin-lightening]] cosmetic product of [[Hindustan Unilever]] introduced to the market in [[India]] in 1975. Fair &amp; Lovely is available in India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Thailand]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]] and other parts of [[Asia]] and is also exported to other parts of the world such as the [[Western world|West]], where they are sold in [[Asian supermarket]]s.

Unilever patented the brand Fair &amp; Lovely in 1971 after the patenting of [[niacinamide]], a [[melanin]] suppressor,&lt;ref&gt;Miranda A. Farage, Kenneth W. Miller, Howard I. Maibach ''Textbook of Aging Skin'' 540896554 - 2009 p.498 "In a recent work, niacinamide and glucosamine (in particular, its derivative N-acetyl glucosamine [NAG]) have been determined to be effective in reducing melanin production in culture. In vitro, glucosamine reduces production of melanin.."&lt;/ref&gt; which is the cream's main active ingredient. As of 2012 the brand occupied 80% of the fairness cream market in India, and is one of Hindustan Unilever's most successful cosmetics lines.&lt;ref&gt;Alma M. Garcia ''Contested Images: Women of Color in Popular Culture'' 2012 0759119635 p.182  "Through its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Lever Limited, Unilever patented Fair &amp; Lovely in 1971 following the patenting of niacinamide, a melanin suppressor, which is its main active ingredient. Test marketed in South India in 1975, available throughout India in 1978. Fair &amp; Lovely has become the largest-selling skin cream in India, accounting for 80 percent of the fairness cream market."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair and Lovely contains [[stearic acid]] mainly sourced from animal body fats (like [[lard]]) which contain the highest amount of stearic acid by weight compared to plant based fats.

The target [[consumer profile]] for Fair &amp; Lovely is the 18 and above age group, and the bulk of the users are in the age 21–35 category,&lt;ref&gt;Jham, Vimi ''Cases on Consumer-Centric Marketing Management'' 2013 1466643587 p.102 "The target consumer profile for Fair &amp; Lovely is in the age group of 18 and above. The bulk of the users are in the age group of 21-35 and the brand communication has always been targeted at this age group. "&lt;/ref&gt; though there is evidence that girls as young as 12–14 also use the cream.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Peng ''Global Strategy'' 0324590997 2008 p.414 "The target market for Fair &amp; Lovely is predominantly young women aged 18–35 (Srisha, 2001). Disturbingly, “there is repeated evidence that schoolgirls in the 12–14 years category widely use fairness creams" (Ninan, 2003). "&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing for the product in all countries implies whiter skin equates to beauty and self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Eagle, Stephan Dahl Marketing Ethics &amp; Society  2015 1473934028 "Advertisements in all the countries in which Fair &amp; Lovely is sold show product users getting better jobs, getting married or having a brighter future (and being noticeably happier) as a result of their lighter skin."&lt;/ref&gt; Hindustan Unilever Limited research claims that "90 percent of Indian women want to use whiteners because it is aspirational, like losing weight. A fair skin is like education, regarded as a social and economic step up."&lt;ref&gt;Aneel Karnani ''Fighting Poverty Together: Rethinking Strategies''  0230120237 2011 p.101 "Hindustan Unilever Limited, Unilever's Indian subsidiary, claims Fair &amp; Lovely is doing good by fulfilling a social need. HUL research says that “90 percent of Indian women want to use whiteners because it is aspirational, like losing weight. A fair skin is like education, regarded as a social and economic step up."&lt;/ref&gt; Following controversy, including a television advertisement in which the actor [[Saif Ali Khan]] prefers the fair-skinned [[Neha Dhupia]] over darker-skinned [[Priyanka Chopra]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidharth Balakrishna ''Case Studies in Marketing'' Pearson 2011, 8131757978 Case Study 1: Fair &amp; Lovely p.5 "... responding to an advertisement in which the actor Saif Ali Khan prefers the fair-skinned starlet Neha Dhupia over Priyanka Chopra, known for her dusky, wheatish complexion."&lt;/ref&gt; the company had to suspend television advertisements for the product in 2007.

'''Francis Barker &amp; Son''' is a [[trademark]] of  Pyser Optics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademarklondon.com/Francis-Barker/index.html Trademark a distributor of F.Baker products, supplier information]&lt;/ref&gt; a British design and manufacturing company based in Edenbridge, Kent, which provides military grade  electro-optical products, search and location equipment, educational material  and radio electronics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pyseroptics.com/ Pyser Optics company information]&lt;/ref&gt; The trademark became notable as precision equipment supplier to allied forces in [[Europe]] during [[World War I|the Great War]] and [[World War II|Second World War]]

==Origin==
Frances Barker &amp; Son was established as F. Barker in London in 1848. In that same year, the proprietor entered into partnership with Richard Groves in order to manufacture precision instruments such as portable [[sundial]]s and [[hand compass|field compasses]]. 
[[File:Francis Barker sundial.png|thumb|right|This hand-held wooden compass-sundial is unmarked, but believed to be made in London about the turn of the 19th/20th century by Francis Barker &amp; son for field use. The crystal is cracked, and the gnomon cord has been replaced with green cotton fishing line probably in the 1950s]]

==Founder==
Frances Barker  (1819–1875), the founder, was a practicing [[Christian]] and [[Freemason]] who formerly worked for James &amp; George Simms, first as a child apprentice and then as a skilled precision mechanic and engraver. He later acquired J &amp; G Simms, which traded between about 1822 and 1855 and build a reputation for finely engraved instrument [[dial (measurement)|dial]]s and [[reticle]]s. Barker used his considerable reputation as a skilled craftsman and those early [[social network]]s to establish his business.

==Successors==
Frances Barker (1845–1920), the son of the founder of the same name, was one of eleven children. He married Elizabeth Weeks, whose father was a maker of [[leather]] instrument [[case (goods)|case]]s for F. Barker instruments.

Another son of the founder, Charles, in the late 19th century added [[gold]] and [[silver]] jewellery, notably [[devotional articles]] such as wearable [[crucifix]]es.

During 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] had business interests in many electricity-related companies including ''Edison Lamp Company'', a lamp manufacturer in [[East Newark, New Jersey]]; ''[[Edison Machine Works]]'', a manufacturer of [[dynamo]]s and large [[electric motor]]s in [[Schenectady, New York]]; ''Bergmann &amp; Company'', a manufacturer of electric [[Light fixture|lighting fixtures]], [[Lightbulb sockets|sockets]], and other electric lighting devices; and ''Edison Electric Light Company'', the [[patent]]-holding company and the financial arm backed by [[J.P. Morgan]] and the [[Vanderbilt family]] for Edison's lighting experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity |url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |work=A Brief History of Con Edison |publisher=Con Edison |accessdate=February 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, [[Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.]], a company founded by J.P. Morgan and [[Anthony J. Drexel]], financed Edison's research and helped merge those companies under one corporation to form ''Edison General Electric Company'', which was incorporated in New York on April 24, 1889. The new company also acquired [[Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edison Companies |url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm |work=The Thomas Edison Papers |publisher=Rutgers University |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpmorgan"&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQs: How did the firm impact the advent of electricity? |url=http://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/jpmorgan/about/history/faq#Question_10 |publisher=J.P.

In 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of [[New Britain, Connecticut]], which merged a few years later with [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], led by [[Charles A. Coffin|Charles Coffin]]. In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company of [[Kansas City, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;''Connecticut History Makers'', by Elias Robert Stevenson, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric Company of Schenectady, New York, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], with the support of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="jpmorgan"/&gt; Both plants continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ge.com/company/history/edison.html | title=Thomas Edison &amp; GE |publisher=GE company web site |accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was incorporated in New York, with the Schenectady plant used as headquarters for many years thereafter. Around the same time, General Electric's Canadian counterpart, [[Canadian General Electric]], was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=X_P0AwAAQBAJ|page=72}}|title=Canadian-American Industry|last=Marshall|first=Herbert|last2=Southard|first2=Frank|last3=Taylor|first3=Kenneth W.|date=January 15, 1976|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|year=|isbn=9780773591363|location=|page=72|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, General Electric absorbed the National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into its lighting business. GE established its lighting division headquarters at [[Nela Park]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio]]. The lighting division has since remained in the same location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2016/12/nela_park_light_display_hower.html|title=Nela Park holiday lights, Hower House Museum display and recycle holiday lights: Home and Garden News|work=cleveland.com|access-date=March 24, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RCA and NBC===
Owen D. Young, through GE, founded the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in 1919, after purchasing the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]]. He aimed to expand international radio communications. GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, RCA co-founded the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), which built two radio broadcasting networks. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations and decided to divest itself of RCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nocable.org/timeline/nbc-history|title=Timeline: The History of NBC|website=NoCable.org|language=en|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In 1927, [[Ernst Alexanderson]] of GE made the first demonstration of his television broadcasts&lt;ref name="inventors.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blalexanderson.htm|title=Ernst Alexanderson|work=About.com Inventors}}&lt;/ref&gt; at his [[General Electric Realty Plot]] home at 1132 Adams Rd, Schenectady, New York.  On January 13, 1928, he made what was said to be the first broadcast to the public in the United States&lt;ref name="inventors.about.com"/&gt; on GE's [[W2XAD]]: the pictures were picked up on 1.5 square inch (9.7 square centimeter) screens in the homes of four GE executives. The sound was broadcast on GE's [[WGY (AM)]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Experimental television station W2XAD evolved into station [[WRGB]] which, along with WGY and WGFM (now [[WRVE]]), was owned and operated by General Electric until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3G5LDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;lpg=PT58&amp;dq=W2XAD+evolved+into+station+WRGB+operated+by+GE+until+1983#v=onepage&amp;q=W2XAD%20evolved%20into%20station%20WRGB%20operated%20by%20GE%20until%201983|title=THE STORY OF A SMALL TWIG|last=Green|first=John|date=February 5, 2018|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781387571765|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by [[Sanford Alexander Moss]], GE moved into the new field of aircraft [[turbosupercharger|turbo superchargers]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}GE introduced the first superchargers during World War I, and continued to develop them during the [[interwar period]]. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II. GE supplied 300,000 turbo superchargers for use in fighter and bomber engines. This work led the U.S. Army Air Corps to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/93760-general-electric-pioneers-jet-engine-manufacturing|title=General Electric Pioneers Jet Engine Manufacturing|last=Weber|first=Austin|date=March 28, 2017|work=Assembly Magazine|access-date=January 5, 2018|publisher=BNP Media|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the [[Whittle W.1]] [[jet engine]] that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittle |first1=Sir Frank |last2=Golley |first2=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6HcngEACAAJ |title=Jet |edition=illustrated |editor-last=Gunston |editor-first=Bill |publisher=Datum Publishing |year=2010 |pages=181–182 |isbn=978-1907472008 |accessdate=January 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GE ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M.

===Computing===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
GE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s along with [[IBM]], [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[Honeywell]], [[RCA]] and [[UNIVAC]].&lt;ref name="Guston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guston|first1=David H.|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;pg=PA272#v=onepage|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GE had a line of general purpose and special purpose computers, including the [[GE-200 series|GE 200]], [[GE-400 series|GE 400]], and [[GE-600 series|GE 600]] series general purpose computers,&lt;ref name="Guston" /&gt; the GE 4010, GE 4020, and GE 4060 [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[process control]] computers, and the [[DATANET-30]] and Datanet 355 message switching computers (DATANET-30 and 355 were also used as front end processors for GE mainframe computers). A Datanet 500 computer was designed, but never sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/sec/15518/General-Electric/|title=General Electric – Computing History|website=www.computinghistory.org.uk|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, GE started developing its [[GECOS]] (later renamed GCOS) [[operating system]], originally for [[batch processing]], but later extended to [[timesharing]] and [[transaction processing]]. Versions of GCOS are still in use today. From 1964 to 1969, GE and [[Bell Laboratories]] (which soon dropped out) joined with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to develop the [[Multics]] operating system on the [[GE 645]] mainframe computer. The project took longer than expected and was not a major commercial success, but it demonstrated concepts such as [[single level store]], [[dynamic linking]], [[hierarchical file system]], and [[Ring (computer security)|ring-oriented security]]. Active development of Multics continued until 1985.

GE got into computer manufacturing because in the 1950s they were the largest user of computers outside the [[United States federal government]],&lt;ref name="Guston" /&gt; aside from being the first business in the world to own a computer. Its major appliance manufacturing plant "[[GE Consumer &amp; Industrial|Appliance Park]]" was the first non-governmental site to host one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hiner |first=Jason |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/hiner/ges-200-million-bet-to-resurrect-it/10834 |title=GE's $200 million bet to resurrect IT |publisher=TechRepublic |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1970, GE sold its computer division to [[Honeywell]], exiting the computer manufacturing industry,&lt;ref name="Guston" /&gt; though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterwards. GE was a major provider of computer [[timesharing|time-sharing]] services, through General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS), offering online computing services that included [[GEnie]].

In 2000 when United Technologies Corp. planned to buy Honeywell, GE made a counter-offer that was approved by Honeywell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,166732,00.html |title=The Anatomy of the GE-Honeywell Disaster |last1=Elliott |first1=Michael |date=July 8, 2001 |publisher=TIME |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627050528/http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0%2C8599%2C166732%2C00.html |archive-date=June 27, 2016 |access-date=June 27, 2016 |id=GE-Honeywell-Disaster |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 2001, the [[European Union]] issued a statement that "prohibit the proposed acquisition by General Electric Co. of Honeywell Inc.".&lt;ref name="EU-GE-Honeywell"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-939_en.htm |title=The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell |date=July 3, 2001 |publisher=EU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627051108/http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0%2C8599%2C166732%2C00.html |archive-date=June 27, 2016 |access-date=June 27, 2016 |id=EU-GE-Honeywell |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given were it "would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell."&lt;ref name="EU-GE-Honeywell"/&gt;

On June 27, 2014, GE partnered with collaborative design company Quirky to announce its connected LED bulb called Link.

==Businesses==
{{main|List of assets owned by General Electric}}
The company describes itself as composed of a number of primary business units or "businesses." Each unit is itself a vast enterprise, many of which would, even as a standalone company, rank in the [[Fortune 500]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. The list of GE businesses varies over time as the result of [[acquisitions]], [[divestiture]]s and [[reorganization]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

{{as of|2018|January|}}, GE's primary business divisions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Corporate Information|url=http://www.ge.com|website=General Electric|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* GE Additive
* [[GE Aviation]]
* [[GE Capital]]
* [[GE Digital]]
* [[GE Healthcare]]
* [[GE Lighting]]
* [[GE Power]]
* [[GE Renewable Energy]]
* [[GE Transportation]]
* [[Baker Hughes|Baker Hughes, a GE Company]]
* [[Current (company)|Current, powered by GE]]
* [[GE Global Research]]

The former [[GE Home &amp; Business Solutions|GE Appliances and Lighting]] segment was dissolved in 2014 when GE's appliance division was sold to [[Haier]] for $5.4 billion. [[GE Lighting]] (consumer lighting) and the newly-created [[Current (company)|Current, powered by GE]], which deals in commercial LED, solar, EV, and energy storage, are now stand-alone businesses within the company.&lt;ref name="cnetHaier"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/its-official-ge-appliances-belongs-to-haier/ |title=It's official: GE Appliances belongs to Haier |last=THOMPSON |first=ASHLEE CLARK |date=|work=cnet |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through these businesses, GE participates in markets that include the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity (e.g. [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear]], gas and solar), [[lighting]], industrial [[automation]], [[medical imaging]] equipment, motors, [[Locomotive|railway locomotives]], aircraft jet engines, and aviation services. Through GE Commercial Finance, GE Consumer Finance, GE Equipment Services, and GE Insurance it offers a range of financial services. It has a presence in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ge.com/about-us/fact-sheet|website=General Electric|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the first wave of conglomerates (such as [[ITT Corporation]], [[Ling-Temco-Vought]], [[Tenneco]], etc.) fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, another wave (consisting of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[Tyco International|Tyco]], and others) tried and failed to emulate GE's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westinghouse RIP|url=http://www.economist.com/node/107318|website=The Economist|accessdate=April 21, 2016|date=November 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|August 2015}} GE is planning to set up a [[silicon carbide]] chip packaging R&amp;D center in coalition with [[SUNY Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Utica, New York]].

On September 14, 2015, GE announced the creation of a new unit: GE Digital, which will bring together its software and IT capabilities. The new business unit will be headed by Bill Ruh, who joined GE in 2011 from Cisco Systems and has since worked on GE's software efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = GE forms digital unit, says energy management head to retire|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/14/us-general-electric-management-idUSKCN0RE1WE20150914|newspaper = Reuters|date = September 14, 2015|access-date = October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GE has a history of some of its activities giving rise to large-scale [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]].

Retrieved November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute listed the corporation as the fourth-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with more than 4.4&amp;nbsp;million pounds per year (2,000 tons) of toxic chemicals released into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtknet.org/new/tox100/toxic100.php?database=t1&amp;detail=1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=a&amp;company1=&amp;company2=8337&amp;chemfac=fac&amp;advbasic=bas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204419/http://www.rtknet.org/new/tox100/toxic100.php?database=t1&amp;detail=1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=a&amp;company1=&amp;company2=8337&amp;chemfac=fac&amp;advbasic=bas |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=Political Economy Research Institute |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; GE has also been implicated in the creation of [[toxic waste]]. According to [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] documents, only the [[United States Government]], [[Honeywell]], and [[Chevron Corporation]] are responsible for producing more [[Superfund]] toxic waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.publicintegrity.org/superfund/report.aspx?aid=849 EPA Document Lists Firms Tied to Superfund Sites] The Center for Public Integrity {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214015455/http://projects.publicintegrity.org/superfund/report.aspx?aid=849 |date=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Robert Abrams]] filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] to compel GE to pay for the clean-up of what was claimed to be more than 100,000 tons of chemicals dumped from their plant in [[Waterford, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/21/nyregion/the-region-ge-plant-accused-of-water-pollution.html The Region; G.E. Plant Accused Of Water Pollution"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the company agreed to pay a $250&amp;nbsp;million settlement in connection with claims it polluted the [[Housatonic River]] ([[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]) and other sites with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) and other hazardous substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/1999/October/471enr.htm GE agrees to $250&amp;nbsp;million Settlement to Clean Up PCBs in Housatonic River], Department of Justice news release, October 7, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, acting on concerns that the plan proposed by GE did not "provide for adequate protection of public health and the environment," the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a unilateral administrative order for the company to "address cleanup at the GE site" in [[Rome, Georgia]], also contaminated with PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/e51aa292bac25b0b85257359003d925f/5592f5848c70b2858525731b00674e9c!OpenDocument EPA issues unilateral administrative order to General Electric Company in Rome, Georgia] United States Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

GE heavily contaminated the Hudson River with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)]] between 1947 and 1977.&lt;ref name="epa_ge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River PCBs – Background and Site Information |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm |accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water.&lt;ref name=epa_gel&gt;{{cite web|title=National Priorities List Fact Sheets: Hudson River PCBs |publisher=EPA |url=http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |accessdate=December 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201054957/http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician [[Pete Seeger]] founded the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]] and the [[Clearwater Festival]] to draw attention to the problem. In 1983, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) declared a 200-mile (320&amp;nbsp;km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a [[Superfund]] site requiring cleanup. This Superfund site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation.&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Gerry |last=Harrington |title=Movement afoot to name bridge after Pete Seeger |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2014/01/31/Movement-afoot-to-name-bridge-after-Pete-Seeger/UPI-15581391204873/ |work=[[United Press International]] |date=January 31, 2014 |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of pollution, including mercury contamination and sewage dumping, have also contributed to problems in the Hudson River watershed.&lt;ref name="AutoD3-29"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levinton |first1=J.S. |last2=Ochron |first2=S.T.P. |year=2008 |title=Temporal and geographic trends in mercury concentrations in muscle tissue in five species of hudson river, USA, fish |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |publisher= |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1691–1697 |url= |doi=10.1897/07-438.1 |pmid=18266478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nysdec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River Estuary Program: Cleaning the river: Improving water quality |author=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).

====Pollution of the Housatonic River====
From {{circa|1932}} until 1977, GE polluted the [[Housatonic River]] with PCB discharges from its plant at [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. EPA designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the Housatonic to be a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

On June 6, 2011, GE announced that it has licensed solar thermal technology from California-based eSolar for use in power plants that use both solar and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;Martin LaMonica, CNET. "[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20069472-54/ge-invests-in-esolar-for-combined-solar-gas-plants/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 GE invests in eSolar for combined solar, gas plants]." June 6, 2011. Retrieved June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2011, GE unveiled its EV Solar Carport, a [[carport]] that incorporates solar panels on its roof, with electric vehicle charging stations under its cover.&lt;ref&gt;Candace Lombardi, CNET. "[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20066460-54.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Solar power carport charges cars in Connecticut]." May 26, 2011. Retrieved May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, GE announced the launch of a program called "Ecomagination", intended, in the words of CEO Jeff Immelt, "to develop tomorrow's solutions such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells, lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger durable materials, efficient lighting, and water purification technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002669.html |title=Ecomagination: Inside GE's Power Play |publisher=Worldchanging.com |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=April 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519111651/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002669.html |archivedate=May 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement prompted an op-ed piece in ''The New York Times'' to observe that, "while General Electric's increased emphasis on [[clean technology]] will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line, Mr. Immelt's credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company's intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/opinion/nyregionopinions/12WEsullivan.html "Talking Green, Acting Dirty." ''The New York Times'' June 12, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

GE has said that it will invest $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its Ecomagination initiative. As of October 2008, the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market, ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines. In 2007, GE raised the annual revenue target for its Ecomagination initiative from $20&amp;nbsp;billion in 2010 to $25&amp;nbsp;billion following positive market response to its new product lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/1804493/ge-cleantech-sales-usd17bn |title=GE cleantech sales to top $17 billion this year |publisher=Businessgreen.com |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, GE continued to raise its investment by adding $10&amp;nbsp;billion into Ecomagination over the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;VentureBeat, Camille Ricketts.

GE Energy and [[Orion New Zealand Limited]] (Orion) have announced implementation of the first phase of a GE network management system to help improve power reliability for customers. GE's ENMAC Distribution Management System is the foundation of Orion's initiative. The system of [[smart grid]] technologies will significantly improve the network company's ability to manage big network emergencies and help it to restore power faster when outages occur.

In June 2018, GE Volunteers, an internal group of GE Employees, along with Malaysian Nature Society transplanted more than 270 plants from the Taman Tugu forest reserve so that they may be replanted in the forest trail which is under construction.

==Educational initiatives==
GE healthcare is collaborating with The [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]] and the [[Medical University of South Carolina]] to offer an integrated radiology curriculum during their respective MD Programs led by investigators of the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in micro-gravity]] study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745 Jultrasoundmet.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713124805/http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745 |date=July 13, 2010 }}, A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; GE has donated over one million dollars of Logiq E Ultrasound equipment to these two institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/ultrasound/genimg/products/logiq_e/hryfrdhosp_waynestuni.html |title=GE Healthcare-Product Features-Henry Ford Hospital and Wayne State University School of Medicine Partner with GE |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202081815/http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/ultrasound/genimg/products/logiq_e/hryfrdhosp_waynestuni.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing initiatives==

===2011–2013 content-marketing campaigns===
Between September 2011 and April 2013, GE ran a [[content marketing]] campaign dedicated to telling the stories of "innovators—people who are reshaping the world through act or invention". The initiative included 30 3-minute films from leading documentary film directors ([[Albert and David Maysles|Albert Maysles]], [[Jessica Yu]], [[Leslie Iwerks]], [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]], [[Alex Gibney]], [[Lixin Fan]], [[Gary Hustwit]] and others), and a user-generated competition that received over 600 submissions, out of which 20 finalist were chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fera|first=Rae Ann|title=GE TELLS THE STORIES OF THE WORLD'S INNOVATORS WITH "FOCUS FORWARD"|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/1682858/ge-tells-the-stories-of-the-worlds-innovators-with-focus-forward|publisher=Fast Co.Create|date=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Short Films, Big Ideas'' was launched at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in partnership with [[Morgan Spurlock|cinelan]]. Stories included breakthroughs in [[water treatment|Slingshot (water vapor distillation system)]], cancer research, energy production, pain management and food access. Each of the 30 films received world premiere screenings at a major international film festival, including the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. The winning amateur director film, ''The Cyborg Foundation'', was awarded a {{US$|100000}} prize at the 2013 at Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title=Sundance: ‘Cyborg Foundation’ Wins Focus Forward Filmmaker Competition |url=https://deadline.com/2013/01/sundance-cyborg-foundation-wins-focus-forward-filmmaker-competition-410386/ |website=Deadline.com |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GE, the campaign garnered more than 1.5 billion total media impressions, 14 million online views, and was seen in 156 countries.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Sponsorships===

In January 2017, GE signed an estimated $7 million deal with the [[Boston Celtics]] to have its corporate logo put on the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team's jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/01/25/general-electric-inks-deal-to-put-logo-on-boston-celtics-jerseys/|title=General Electric inks deal to put logo on Boston Celtics jerseys|last=Atkinson|first=Claire|date=January 26, 2017|website=New York Post|access-date=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political affiliation==
In the 1950s GE sponsored [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[General Electric Theater|TV career]] and launched him on the lecture circuit as a crusader against big government. Although it can be argued that GE frequently supported conservative policies, GE's record with designing social programs, supporting civil rights organizations, and funding minority education programs, speaks to their effort to support [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] programs and progressive causes.&lt;ref&gt;William Greider (1992) Who Will Tell The People. Simon &amp; Schuster. New York NY. p. 336. {{ISBN|0-671-68891-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable appearances in media==
In the early 1950s [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a writer for GE. A number of his novels and stories (notably ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' and ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'') refer to the fictional city of [[Ilium (Kurt Vonnegut)|Ilium]], which appears to be loosely based on Schenectady, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catscradle/summary.html|title=Cat's Cradle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilium Works is the setting for the short story "[[Deer in the Works]]".

In 1981, GE won a [[Clio award]] for its :30 Soft White Light Bulbs commercial, [[We Bring Good Things to Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtPVWXTDUQs|title=1981 – Commercial – GE/General Electric – Soft White Light Bulbs – We bring good things to life.|date=July 18, 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan "We Bring Good Things to Life" was created by [[Phil Dusenberry]] at the ad agency [[BBDO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/qa-phil-dusenberry-94660|title=Q&amp;A: Phil Dusenberry|newspaper=AdWeek|access-date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GE was the primary focus of a 1991 short subject [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary, ''Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons, and Our Environment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newday.com/films/DeadlyDeception.html |title=Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons, and Our Environment |publisher=Newday.com |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that juxtaposed GE's "We Bring Good Things To Life" commercials with the true stories of workers and neighbors whose lives have been affected by the company's activities involving [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopcorporateabuse.org/cms/page1127.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621082431/http://stopcorporateabuse.org/cms/page1127.cfm |archivedate=June 21, 2006 |title=Nuclear Weaponmakers Campaign – Corporate Accountability International – Challenging Abuse, Protecting People – Think Outside the Bottle – challenging the bottled water industry |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, GE received a National [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Award]] for Outstanding Service by a Major Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/6/prweb10849501.htm Jefferson Awards Announces Strategic Alliance with the NFL Player Engagement, Charles Fazzino and IvyConnect, While Celebrating 41 Years of Honoring Service to Others].

[[File:Brennschere, Brennzange.jpg|thumb|historical image of hair irons (top)]]
A '''hair iron''' or '''hair tong''' is a [[tool]] used to change the [[structure]] of the [[hair]] using [[heat]]. There are three general kinds: ''curling irons'', used to make the hair [[curly hair|curl]]y, ''straightening irons'', commonly called ''straighteners'' or ''flat irons'', used to [[straighten the hair]], and ''crimping irons'', used to create [[Hair crimping|crimps]] of the desired size in the hair.

Most models have [[electric heating]]; cordless curling irons or flat irons typically use [[butane]], and some flat irons use batteries that can last up to 30 minutes for straightening. Overuse of these tools can cause severe damage to hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doheny|first1=Kathleen|last2=Louise Chang (Reviewer)|title=How To Avoid Hair Damage from Blow Dryers, Flat Irons, and Curling Irons|url=http://www.webmd.com/beauty/hair-repair/how-not-to-wreck-your-hair?page=1|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of hair irons==

===Curling iron===
[[File:Curling iron unbranded.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An electric curling iron]]

'''Curling irons''', also known as '''curling tongs''', create waves or curls in hair using a variety of different methods. There are many different types of modern curling irons, which can vary by [[diameter]], material, and shape of barrel and the type of handle. The barrel's diameter can be anywhere from {{convert|.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. Smaller barrels typically create spiral curls or ringlets, and larger barrels are used to give shape and volume to a [[hairstyle]].

Curling irons are typically made of [[Teflon]], [[ceramic]], [[tourmaline]], [[metal]], or [[titanium]]. The barrel's shape can either be a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[cone (geometry)|cone]], or reverse cone, and the iron can have brush attachments or double and triple barrels.

The curling iron can also have either a spring-loaded, Marcel, or clipless handle. Spring-loaded handles are the most popular and use a [[spring (device)|spring]] to work the barrel's clamp. When using a Marcel handle, one applies his or her own pressure to the clamp. Clipless wands have no clamp, and the user simply wraps hair around a rod. Most clipless curling irons come with a [[Kevlar]] glove to avoid burns.

=== Straightening irons ===
'''Straightening irons''', '''straighteners''', or '''flat irons''' work by breaking down the positive hydrogen bonds found in the hair's cortex, which cause hair to open, bend and become curly. Once the bonds are broken, hair is prevented from holding its original, natural form, though the hydrogen bonds can re-form if exposed to moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Melissa B. |last=Read |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/32779/57571289-MIT.pdf;sequence=2 |title=Designing a Better Hair Straightener |date=June 2004 |degree=BS (Mechanical engineering) |publisher=[[MIT]] |accessdate=January 17, 2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straightening irons use mainly [[ceramic]] material for their plates. Low-end straighteners use a single layer of ceramic coating on the plates, whereas high-end straighteners use multiple layers or even 100% ceramic material. Some straightening irons are fitted with an automatic shut off feature to prevent fire accidents.

Early hair straightening systems relied on harsh chemicals that tended to damage the hair. In the 1870s, the French hairdresser [[Marcel Grateau]] introduced heated metal hair care implements such as [[hot comb]]s to straighten hair. [[Madame C.J. Walker]] used combs with wider teeth and popularized their use together with her system of chemical scalp preparation and straightening lotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/100-amazing-facts/madam-walker-the-first-black-american-woman-to-be-a-self-made-millionaire/|title=Madam Walker, the First Black American Woman to Be a Self-Made Millionaire {{!}} The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross {{!}} PBS|date=2013-11-15|work=The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mentor [[Annie Malone]] is sometimes said to have patented the hot comb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freemaninstitute.com/poro.htm|title=Annie Malone: First African American Millionairess (Educator, Entrepreneur &amp; Philanthropist)|website=The Freeman Institute|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heated metal implements slide more easily through the hair, reducing damage and dryness. Women in the 1960s sometimes used [[clothing iron]]s to straighten their hair.

In 1909 Isaac K. Shero patented the first hair straightener composed of two flat irons that are heated and pressed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country=US | number=US943321 A| status=patent| title=Hair-straightener | pubdate=| gdate=1909-12-14 | fdate=1909-03-08 | pridate       = | inventor =Isaac K.

Ceramic and electrical straighteners were introduced later, allowing adjustment of heat settings and straightener size.  A ceramic hair straightener brush was patented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Hair straightening brush|date=Nov 21, 2013|url=http://www.google.com/patents/CA2873465A1|inventor-last=GUY-RABI|inventor2-last=GUY|inventor-first=Sharon|inventor2-first=Yakov|issue=CA2873465 A1|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharon Rabi released the first straightening brush in 2015 under the DAFNI brand name.  The ceramic straightening brush has a larger surface area than a traditional flat iron.

The look is similar to the crimps left after taking out small [[braid]]s. Crimping irons come in different sizes with different sized ridges on the paddles. Larger ridges produce larger crimps in the hair and smaller ridges produce smaller crimps. Crimped hair was very popular in the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

This model is on display at the main building of the ETSIIM in Madrid, Spain]]
The ''concept'' of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the [[pulley]], [[lever]], and [[wheel]]. Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful [[tools]] and objects.

The term ''engineering'' itself has a much more recent etymology, deriving from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1325,
when an ''engine’er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') originally referred to "a constructor of military engines."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.&amp;nbsp;e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineers' Council for Professional Development definition on Encyclopædia Britannica] (Includes Britannica article on Engineering)&lt;/ref&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of [[military engineering]] (the original meaning of the word "engineering," now largely obsolete, with notable exceptions that have survived to the present day such as military engineering corps, ''e.&amp;nbsp;g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Army Corps of Engineers]]).

==Ancient Era==
The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], the [[ziggurats]] of [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Pharos of Alexandria]], the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], [[Teotihuacán]] and the cities and pyramids of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Inca]] and [[Aztec]] Empires, cities of the  [[Indus Valley Civilization]], the [[Great Wall of China]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient civil and military engineers.

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djosèr]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (a [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]-[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J. Kemp |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilisation |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=IT6CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=May 7, 2007 |pages=159 |isbn=9781134563883}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have been responsible for the first known use of [[column]]s in [[architecture]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

[[Ancient Greece]] developed machines, both in the civilian and military domains. The [[Antikythera mechanism]], the earliest known model of a [[mechanical computer]] in history, and the mechanical [[Archimedes#Discoveries and inventions|inventions]] of [[Archimedes]] are examples of early mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] or [[epicyclic gearing]], two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [[gear train]]s of the Industrial revolution and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as [[robotics]] and [[automotive engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Chinese and Roman armies employed complex military machines including the [[Ballista]] and [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[Trebuchet]] was developed.

==Middle Era==
An Alibi by the name of [[Al-Jazari]] built five machines to pump water for the kings of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Artuqid dynasty]] and their [[palace]]s. Besides over 50 ingenious mechanical devices, [[Al-Jazari]] also developed and made innovations to segmental gears, mechanical controls, [[escapement]] mechanisms, clocks, robotics, and protocols for designing and manufacturing methods.

==Renaissance Era==
The first [[steam engine]] was built in 1698 by [[mechanical engineer]] [[Thomas Savery]]. The development of this device gave rise to the [[industrial revolution]] in the coming decades, allowing for the beginnings of [[mass production]].

With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

The following images are samples from a deck of cards illustrating engineering instruments in England in 1702. They illustrate a range of engineering specializations, that would eventually become known as [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[geodesy]] and [[geomatics]], and so on.

Each card includes a caption explaining the purpose of the instrument:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern era==
The inventions of Thomas Savery and the Scottish engineer [[James Watt]] gave rise to modern [[Mechanical Engineering]]. The development of specialized machines and their maintenance tools during the industrial revolution led to the rapid growth of Mechanical Engineering both in its birthplace [[Great Britain|Britain]] and abroad.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

The discipline of [[Electrical Engineering]] was shaped by the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]] in the 19th century, the experiments of [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electric motor]] in 1872. Electrical engineering became a profession late in the 19th century. Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and USA. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of  [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[Electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of Electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other Engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

[[Chemical Engineering]], like its counterpart Mechanical Engineering, developed in the 19th century during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

Aeronautical Engineering deals with [[aircraft]] design while [[Aerospace Engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach envelope of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design.&lt;ref name="Imperial"&gt;[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/teaching/studying Imperial College London England]: ''Studying engineering at Imperial: Engineering courses are offered in five main branches of engineering: aeronautical, chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical. There are also courses in computing science, software engineering, information systems engineering, materials science and engineering, mining engineering and petroleum engineering.''&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the turn of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

The first [[PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wheeler | first = Lynde, Phelps | title = Josiah Willard Gibbs - the History of a Great Mind | publisher = Ox Bow Press | year = 1951 | isbn = 1-881987-11-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, with the rise of [[computer]] technology, the first [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] was built by [[computer engineer]] [[Alan Emtage]].

'''Hydrazoic acid''', also known as '''hydrogen azide''' or '''azoimide''',&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Azoimide |volume=3 |pages=82–83}} This also contains a detailed description of the contemporaneous production process.&lt;/ref&gt; is a compound with the chemical formula HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dictionary of Inorganic and Organometallic Compounds | publisher = Chapman &amp;amp; Hall }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a colorless, volatile, and explosive liquid at room temperature and pressure. It is a compound of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]], and is therefore a [[pnictogen hydride]]. It was first isolated in 1890 by [[Theodor Curtius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Curtius | first = Theodor | authorlink = Theodor Curtius | title = Ueber Stickstoffwasserstoffsäure (Azoimid) N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H |trans-title=On hydrazoic acid (azoimide) N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | year = 1890 | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 3023–3033 | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510006827352;view=1up;seq=919 | doi=10.1002/cber.189002302232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acid has few applications, but its [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]], the [[azide]] ion, is useful in specialized processes.

Hydrazoic acid is soluble in water.  Undiluted hydrazoic acid is dangerously explosive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furman|first=David|last2=Dubnikova|first2=Faina|last3=van Duin|first3=Adri C.

==Production==
The acid is usually formed by acidification of an azide salt like [[sodium azide]]. Normally solutions of sodium azide in water contain trace quantities of hydrazoic acid in equilibrium with the azide salt, but introduction of a stronger acid can convert the primary species in solution to hydrazoic acid.  The pure acid may be subsequently obtained by [[fractional distillation]] as an extremely explosive colorless liquid with an unpleasant smell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
:NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl  →   HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaCl

Its aqueous solution can also be prepared by treatment of [[barium azide]] solution with dilute [[sulfuric acid]], filtering the insoluble [[barium sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;L . F. Audrieth,  C. F. Gibbs Hydrogen Azide in  Aqueous and Ethereal Solution" Inorganic Syntheses 1939, vol. 1,  pp. 71-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally prepared by the reaction of aqueous [[hydrazine]] with [[nitrous acid]].

:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Other oxidizing agents, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[nitrosyl chloride]], [[trichloramine]] or [[nitric acid]], can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
In its properties hydrazoic acid shows some analogy to the halogen acids, since it forms poorly soluble (in water) lead, silver and mercury(I) salts. The metallic salts all crystallize in the anhydrous form and decompose on heating, leaving a residue of the pure metal.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It is a weak acid (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 4.75.&lt;ref name="InorgChem"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Its heavy metal salts are explosive and readily interact with the [[alkyl iodide]]s. Azides of heavier [[alkali metal]]s (excluding [[lithium]]) or [[alkaline earth metal]]s are not explosive, but decompose in a more controlled way upon heating, releasing spectroscopically-pure {{chem|N|2}} gas.&lt;ref name="wiberg"/&gt; Solutions of hydrazoic acid dissolve many metals (e.g. [[zinc]], [[iron]]) with liberation of hydrogen and formation of salts, which are called [[azide]]s (formerly also called azoimides or hydrazoates).

Dissolution in the strongest acids produces explosive salts containing the {{chem|H|2|N&amp;#x3D;N&amp;#x3D;N|+}} ion, for example:&lt;ref name="wiberg"&gt;{{cite book

The ion {{chem|H|2|N&amp;#x3D;N&amp;#x3D;N|+}} is [[isoelectronic]] to [[diazomethane]].

The decomposition of hydrazoic acid, triggered by shock, friction, spark, etc. goes as follows:

:2{{chem|HN|3}} &lt;nowiki&gt;→&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{chem|H|2}} + 3{{chem|N|2}}

==Toxicity==
Hydrazoic acid is volatile and highly toxic.  It has a pungent smell and its vapor can cause violent [[headache]]s. The compound acts as a non-cumulative poison.

==Applications==
[[2-Furonitrile]], a pharmaceutical intermediate and potential artificial sweetening agent has been prepared in good yield by treating [[furfural]] with a mixture of hydrazoic acid (HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[perchloric acid]] in the presence of magnesium perchlorate in the [[benzene]] solution at 35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P. A.

The [[all gas-phase iodine laser]] (AGIL) mixes gaseous hydrazoic acid with [[chlorine]] to produce excited [[nitrogen chloride]], which is then used to cause [[iodine]] to lase; this avoids the liquid chemistry requirements of [[COIL laser]]s.

ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 was established in 1964, following the creation of a Special Working Group under ISO/TC 97 on [[Data Link Control]] Procedures and [[Modem]] Interfaces.&lt;ref name=standing&gt;{{cite journal| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1 Standing Document N 2| year=2012| author=ISO/IEC| edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 is the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]] (KATS), located in the Republic of Korea.&lt;ref name=countries&gt;{{cite web| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee_participation.htm?commid=45072| author=ISO| accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The scope of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 is “Standardization in the field of telecommunications dealing with the exchange of information between [[Open system (computing)|open systems]] including system functions, procedures, parameters as well as the conditions for their use. The standardization encompasses protocols and services of lower layers, including [[Physical layer|physical]], [[Data link layer|data link]], [[Network layer|network]], and [[Transport layer|transport]] as well as those of upper layers including but not limited to [[Directory service|Directory]] and [[Abstract Syntax Notation One|ASN.1]].”&lt;ref name=business2013&gt;{{cite report| type=Business Plan| author=Kim, Dae Young&lt;!--| date=2012-10-02--&gt;| title=SC 6 Business plan for June 2013 – February 2014| date=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future Network has recently been added as an important work scope. A considerable part of the work is done in effective cooperation with ITU-T and other standardization bodies including IEEE 802 and Ecma International.

==Structure==
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 has three active working groups (WGs), each of which carries out specific tasks in standards development within the field of telecommunications and information exchange between systems.  The focus of each working group is described in the group’s terms of reference. Working groups can be established if new working areas arise, or disbanded if the group’s working area is no longer relevant to standardization needs. Active working groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 Telecommunications and information exchange between systems| author=ISO| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=45072| accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Refill-Ink-Kit-Black.jpg|thumb|200px|Black - Inkjet refill kit.]]
An '''inkjet refill kit''' is a set of tools and a certain amount of ink used to refill [[ink cartridge]]s.  The specific tools and the amount or type of ink depends on which cartridge the kit is designed for.  The purpose of an inkjet refill kit for consumers is that it offers a low-cost alternative to buying new cartridges.

==Contents==
Typically, a refill kit comes with a cartridge holder, bottles of ink and needles.  The exact tools that come with the kit can vary by manufacturer or by which cartridge the kit is for.  Some tools are found in all kits because they are necessary to refill, but others, like the cartridge holder or a needle to withdraw air from the cartridge, are optional.

The most common refill kits come with either:  bottles of black ink for black refill kits; or one bottle each of [[cyan]], [[magenta]] and yellow for color refill kits; or one bottle each of photo cyan, photo magenta and photo black for photo-color refill kits; or combination of all colors for combo refill kits.

==Refilling process==
{{howto|section|date=December 2011}}
The refill process typically involves the following steps:

* ''Injecting ink'': Depending on the type of cartridge being refilled, ink can either be injected through a hole on top of the cartridge, or directly into the ink chambers after the top has been popped off.  The ink can be injected directly from a bottle (with a needle tip on it) or from a needle filled with ink.  The ink must be slowly injected into the cartridge so as not to cause damage, or overfilling, or overflow to other-color ink reservoirs. (For colors, a label on the cartridge might have three ordered color-dots to indicate the corresponding three ink colors of the reservoir chambers.

: Some refill kits include a final step where a small amount of air is removed from the cartridge in order to restore the ink-fluid balance that was present inside the cartridge before the refilling.

* ''Installing and running'': Once the cartridge is filled, the top is placed back on (if necessary) and the cartridge can be reinstalled in the printer.  Extra ink flowing from the cartridge print-head can be wiped or blotted (for a few minutes).  On some cartridges, the ink has a problem getting to the bottom of the cartridge (especially the colored cartridges), it must be forced to the bottom either by suction through the jet plate or by putting pressure from the top with a syringe to purge the ink through the jet plate very gently.  It might be necessary to run the printer cleaning utilities on the refilled cartridge, in case any excess ink is left over from the refilling process.  A note to the unfamiliar: the capacity of the cartridge of some brands is much much more than the cartridge comes with when new (especially the colored ones), there may be room for 2 or 3 times the ink sold in some "kits" (this can be learned by doing an autopsy on a non-functioning cartridge, also why the ink does not reach the bottom in the case of some colored inks).  In those cases, the needle must be able to reach to within 0.375" from the bottom or closer to be sure that the ink can reach the jets and not just saturate the sponge.  The sponge can in some cases take two or more charges of ink and still not reach the bottom (jets).
* ''Print-head cleaning'':  Sometimes the ink flow might be blocked by dried ink on the ink cartridge print-head.  For color cartridges, typically one ink-color fails to flow due to dried ink.  The dried ink can be cleaned using [[isopropyl alcohol]] (50% or higher) on a swab or folded paper towel rubbed gently three or four times across the print-head.  Another method is to let the cartridge sit overnight in a shallow cup or glass of very warm clean water (not necessarily distilled water).  The water depth required is about .25 or .375";  remove and re-clean as above and try to use.

==Anti-refilling protections used by printer manufacturers==

[[Image:Wiki vb ngeresetEpson.gif|thumb|Resetting an Epson ink cartridge using a resetter tool]]

Many printer manufactures provide their cartridges with chips and/or sensors to prevent refilling. These chips can also serve as a "copy protection," so that the printer does not work with cartridges made by other manufacturers. In such cases, the refilling process must include the bypassing of those anti-refilling protections. (Refill instructions, chip resetters or autoreset chips [the latter are reset each time the printer is switched on] for different cartridge models, and other tools are available on the Internet.)

'''Time-coding of ink cartridges'''

To make more money, some manufacturers provide their ink cartridges with a time chip, so that after a certain period of time or after a certain number of printed pages the ink cartridges no longer work and/or a message appears that they are empty even if they are still almost full. So the user cannot buy several ink cartridges to store them for a longer time, but must regularly buy new ones.

'''Region-coding of printers and ink cartridges'''

For price discrimination, some printer manufacturers (e.g. Canon, Epson, HP, Lexmark, Xerox) give their printers and ink cartridges region codes - similar to DVD region codes -, so that the users can only use printers and ink cartridges from their region and cannot import cheaper ones from another region. The region can be changed several times; then, the printer is "region-locked" like an RPC-2 DVD drive and accepts only cartridges from one certain region. Sometimes the region change must be done by the manufacturer's customer service and cannot be done by the user.
&lt;br /&gt;
Xerox printers are shipped with neutral "factory" ink sticks with no region coding. Upon the installation of the first new ink stick after these factory sticks, the machine will set a region code based on the installed ink stick and will only accept ink sticks for that region from that point forward. "Officially, " only three starter ink sticks per color can be used; then, the printer will no longer accept them and will want region-coded ink sticks to be inserted, but there are workarounds for that problem.

When moving to a new region, it seems a good idea to store empty cartridges from the old region (or to re-use the region-free Xerox factory ink sticks) and to refill them with ink from the new region. However, they usually also have chips and sensors to prevent refilling (such as the "time chips" mentioned above).
	
Some manufacturers of region-coded printers also offer region-free printers specially designed for travelers, but, generally, ''the best solution seems to be to avoid region-coded printers.''

'''Integration of the print-head in the cartridge'''

Some manufacturers install the print-head not in the printer, but integrate it in the cartridge. This makes it more difficult or even illegal (because of patent laws) for other manufacturers to rebuild cartridges, and just refilling the cartridge (including cleaning the print-head and resetting or disabling chips/sensors, if necessary) is sometimes not sufficient, because one cannot print anymore once the print-head no longer works.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{original research|section|date=April 2013}}
The main benefit of using a refill kit is the claimed cost savings. Environmental benefit is also claimed, as the process reuses a cartridge that would have otherwise been thrown away after one use.

The downside to refill is the time associated with it and the unpredictability.  Refilling a cartridge can take 10–15 minutes for those unfamiliar with the process, and some may prefer buying a new cartridge to the effort it takes to refill.  Also, ink cartridges usually last for 4-5 refills, but there are those that can only be refilled one time before they are worn out.

The biggest perceived downside to refilling is the mess associated with it.  Many consumers shy away from refilling either based on past experiences or stories they have heard.  Many of the unsuccessful refill kits of the past were so-called "universal" kits, meaning they were designed for use with multiple cartridges.  Because all manufacturers use different types of ink, and because different cartridge designs require different refilling processes, these universal kits had a high failure rate.  Today these kits are harder to find, as refill kits made for specific cartridges have become more the norm, but perception that all refill kits are messy still remains.

The main reason for the decline in refill kits is the emergence of large chains of ink stores that offer a refill process.  This is similar to the evolution of the automobile oil change. Just as cars became too complex for the average driver to change oil, the new cartridges have also become too complex for the average consumer to do it by themselves.

Inkjet refill kits are available in different sizes and with different grades of ink.

Integrated Business Planning is a planning process that integrates across two or more functions in a business or government entity referred to as an enterprise to maximize
financial value.

The specific functional areas in a company as well as the industry domain associated with the company defines the specific type of IBP process. 
Examples of  IBP processes are:

* [[Sales and Operations Planning]]
* Healthcare Analytics
* Strategic Corporate Performance Management
* Planning and scheduling across multiple plants in a factory

The key requirement for IBP is that two or more functional process areas must be involved and maximizing (optimizing) of financial value should be done.

Corporate executives, business unit heads and planning managers use IBP to evaluate plans and activities based on the economic impact of each consideration.

'''Bridging Corporate Performance Management and S&amp;OP
There has been a lot of focus on Integrated Business Planning in the context of Sales and Operations Planning. Gartner ([http://www.gartner.com www.gartner.com]) refers to a 5-stage
S&amp;OP Maturity model wherein IBP is referred to as the Phased 4 &amp; 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2587021/introducing-fivestage-sales-operations-planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Integrated Business Planning however is more broader than S&amp;OP. It is an approach that combines Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) to provide incremental capabilities that neither provides individually. In so doing, IBP platforms address long-standing challenges that financial and operational professionals have struggled to overcome. The result: opportunities for step change improvements to how manufacturers plan, manage and govern their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBP Industry Week cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business-planning-not-just-marketing-hoax}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the focus is on strengthening the financial integration and reconciliation of plans, as well as increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain using ad-hoc reports and what-if scenario analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.camelot-mc.com/en/integrated-business-planning-ibp/|title=Integrated Business Planning (IBP) - Camelot - Management Consultants|website=www.camelot-mc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Integrated Business Planning requires the following capabilities to be enabled:

a) Enterprise Model
* Ability to create a demand chain model
* Ability to create a supply chain model
* Ability to create a finance chain model
b) Integrated Planning
* Ability to create a plan across multiple functions
* Ability to create predictive and collaborative plans

c) Enterprise Optimization
* Ability to create optimized plans across multiple constraints
* Ability to create financial integration across optimization

== Applications ==
IBP has been used to model and integrate the planning efforts in a number of applications, including:
* Product profitability
* [[Customer profitability]]
* [[Capital expenditures]]
* Manufacturing operations
* [[Supply chain]]
* Business processes (human and information-based)
* Business policy
* Market demand curves
* Competitive strategy
All of the above can be summarized as Enterprise Optimization use cases.

== Criticism ==
Some argue that IBP is not any different from S&amp;OP.  See article by Patrick Bower [http://www.jaguar-aps.com/pdf/IBP%20is%20a%20Hoax.pdf where he calls IBP a marketing hoax], a name developed to create confusion and sell consulting and system services.  The main proponents of IBP are in fact consulting companies.    In return to this criticism,
it has been pointed out that [http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business-planning-not-just-marketing-hoax IBP is not a marketing hoax], but an important
part of Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) system.

Another criticism is that [http://supplychaintrend.com/2015/02/28/the-rise-and-fall-of-sop/ IBP is not academically defined] and is supply chain biased in its definition. The lack of academic standard leaves room for interpretation to what IBP is, which is confusing practitioners. In a [https://supplychaintrends.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/supply-chain-trend-sop-pulse-check-2015.pdf 2015 S&amp;OP survey], 32% of participants answered that there is no difference between S&amp;OP and IBP, 20% "did not know", and 71% of participants answered that there is a need for more industry standards around S&amp;OP.

It has been called out that IBP has a lack of governance and in need of an industry group to create a unified definition. Due this lack of academic and industry standards, there has been an attempt to create an [http://supplychaintrend.com/2015/11/25/a-new-definition-for-integrated-business-planning/ open source definition for IBP]. This definition is as follows:

Integrated Business Planning (IBP): A holistic planning philosophy, where all organizational functions participate in providing executives periodically with valid, reliable information, in order to
decide how to align the enterprise around executing the plans to achieve budget, strategic intent and the envisioned future.

The '''National Tsunami Warning Center''' ('''NTWC''') is one of two [[tsunami]] warning centers that are operated by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] in the [[United States]]. It was called the '''West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center''' ('''WC/ATWC''') until October 1, 2013. The name was changed to reflect its geographical zone of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/notification/scn13-54twc_name.htm |title=Service Change Notice 13-65 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Palmer, Alaska]], the NTWC is part of an international [[tsunami warning system]] (TWS) program and serves as the operational center for TWS of all coastal regions of [[Canada]] and the United States, except [[Hawaii]], the [[Caribbean]], and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The other tsunami warning center is the [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] (PTWC) in [[Ford Island, Hawaii]], serving participating members and other nations in the [[Pacific Ocean]] area of responsibility.

==History==
Following the March 27, [[1964 Alaska earthquake]] and tsunami, the NTWC (formerly known as The Palmer Observatory) was established in 1967 in Palmer, Alaska, under the auspices of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]]. This earthquake alerted State and Federal officials that a facility was necessary to provide timely and effective tsunami warnings and [[earthquake]] information to the coastal areas of [[Alaska]]. Congress provided funds in 1965 to construct two new observatories and establish a tsunami warning system in Alaska. The first observatory constructed was at the U.S. Naval Station on [[Adak Island]] in the [[Andreanof Islands]] in the Central [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]]. The City of Palmer, in the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley|Matanuska Valley]] 42 miles northeast of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], was selected as the site for the primary observatory due to its proximity to [[bedrock]] for instrumentation and to communications facilities. Construction of the observatory installations, the task of engineering and assembling the data systems, and the hookup of the extensive telecommunications and data telemetry network was completed in the summer of 1967. With the dedication of the Palmer Observatory on September 2, 1967, the Alaska Regional Tsunami Warning System (ARTWS) became operational.

Originally, the tsunami warning responsibility for Alaska was shared by the three observatories located at Palmer, Adak and [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. Sitka, a seismological observatory since 1904, and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] were the only two [[Seismometer|seismic stations]] operating in Alaska in 1964. The responsibilities of Adak and Sitka were limited to issuing a tsunami warning for events occurring within 300 miles of their location. In later years, the responsibility to provide tsunami warning services for Alaska was transferred from the Adak and Sitka observatories to the Palmer Observatory. Sitka and Adak Observatories were eventually closed in the early 1990s, although the seismic instrumentation is still maintained.

In 1973, the Palmer Observatory was transferred to the [[National Weather Service]]'s Alaska Region and changed its name to Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (ATWC). In 1982, its area of responsibility (AOR) was enlarged to include the issuing of tsunami warnings to [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]] for potential tsunamigenic earthquakes occurring in their coastal areas. In 1996, the responsibility was again expanded to include all Pacific-wide tsunamigenic sources that could affect the California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska coasts, and the name was changed to the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WC/ATWC) to reflect those new responsibilities.  

In 2003, a new Tsunami Warning Center building was constructed in the yard of the original building.  This new facility was the first LEED certified building in the state of Alaska, and within the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]].  LEED ([[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]) certification is granted by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]], and awards environmentally sensitive construction practices.  This new facility provides upgraded power and communications capability, as well as office space for the expanded staff, assuring that the center will continue to provide quality products to the public well into the future.

Following the devastating [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami in late 2004]], the WC/ATWC expanded its scope to the [[East Coast of the United States|U.S. Atlantic coast]], and the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic coast of Canada]]. On 1 October 2013, the name was changed to the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) to reflect this expanded geographical zone of responsibility.

==Overview of operations==
To accomplish its mission of providing accurate and timely tsunami bulletins to its area-of-responsibility (AOR) – which includes Canadian coastal regions, [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]], and the ocean coasts of all U.S. States except Hawaii – the NTWC detects, locates, sizes, and analyzes earthquakes worldwide.  Earthquakes that activate the Center's alarm system initiate an earthquake and tsunami investigation which includes the following four basic steps: automatic locating and sizing the earthquake; earthquake analysis and review; sea level data analysis to verify the existence of a tsunami and to calibrate models; and disseminating information to the appropriate [[emergency management]] officials.

Tsunami bulletins are issued to state/province departments of emergency services; federal disaster preparedness agencies; National Weather Service offices; Canada's Atlantic Storm Prediction Center; [[Federal Aviation Administration]] offices; the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]; military bases; local emergency managers; [[United States Geological Survey]] offices; and many other recipients located in the U.S. and Canada. Earthquakes large enough to be felt near the coast, but below the tsunami warning/watch/advisory threshold size, prompt informational statements to the same recipients as warnings to help prevent needless [[Emergency evacuation|evacuations]].

In addition to its basic functions, the Center conducts a community preparedness program intended to increase public awareness of the tsunami hazard and improve tsunami planning at the community level.  The Center also actively pursues developmental projects which enhance tsunami warning operations.

The Center operates 24 hours every day with two [[Watchstanding|watchstanders]] on duty.  Center personnel are notified of activity by an [[Alarm device|alarm system]] which is activated by several methods:
 
* Sustained, strong [[Oscillation|oscillatory motion]] at individual seismometers.  
* Activation by multiple earthquake arrivals observed in sectors of the globe within a specified time interval. 
* Activation by a real-time seismic processing system when an earthquake exceeds a predetermined magnitude threshold for various regions throughout the world. 
* [[Deep sea|Deep ocean]] tsunami sensor detection of an event.

==Bulletins==
Depending on the seismic data [http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/?page=message_definitions (Message Definitions)], NTWC will issue the following types of bulletins:

===Warning===
A tsunami warning is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate widespread inundation is imminent, expected, or occurring. Warnings alert the public that dangerous [[Coastal flood|coastal flooding]] accompanied by powerful [[Ocean current|currents]] is possible and may continue for several hours after initial arrival.  Warnings alert emergency management officials to take action for the entire tsunami hazard zone.  Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include the evacuation of low-lying coastal areas, and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so.  Warnings may be updated, adjusted geographically, downgraded, or canceled. To provide the earliest possible alert, initial warnings are normally based only on seismic information.

===Advisory===
A tsunami advisory is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or [[Wind wave|waves]] dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent, expected, or occurring.  The threat may continue for several hours after initial arrival, but significant inundation is not expected for areas under an advisory.  Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include closing [[Beach|beaches]], evacuating [[Harbor|harbors]] and [[Marina|marinas]], and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so. Advisories are normally updated to continue the advisory, expand/contract affected areas, upgrade to a warning, or cancel the advisory.

===Watch===
A tsunami watch is issued to alert emergency management officials and the public of an event which may later impact the watch area.  The watch area may be upgraded to a warning or advisory – or canceled – based on updated information and analysis. Therefore, emergency management officials and the public should prepare to take action.  Watches are normally issued based on seismic information without confirmation that a destructive tsunami is underway.

===Information statement===
A tsunami information statement is issued to inform emergency management officials and the public that an earthquake has occurred, or that a tsunami warning, watch or advisory has been issued for another section of the ocean.  In most cases, information statements are issued to indicate there is no threat of a destructive tsunami and to prevent unnecessary evacuations as the earthquake may have been felt in coastal areas. An information statement may, in appropriate situations, caution about the possibility of destructive local tsunamis.  Information statements may be re-issued with additional information, though normally these messages are not updated.  However, a watch, advisory or warning may be issued for the area, if necessary, after analysis and/or updated information becomes available.

This definition applies to Mass News Dissemination Product Types, Tsunami Information Statements, and Tsunami Seismic Information Statements.

===Cancellation===
A final product indicating the end of the damaging tsunami threat.  A cancellation is usually issued after an evaluation of [[sea level]] data confirms that a destructive tsunami will not impact the warning, advisory, or watch area.

==Deep-ocean tsunami detection==
{{further|Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis}}

In 1995, [[NOAA]] began developing the [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]] (DART) system. By 2001, an array of six stations had been deployed in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami/Dart/dart_pb1.html Historical DART Background Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2005, as a result of the tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], plans were announced to add 32 more DART buoys to be operational by mid-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2005/s2369.htm U.S. ANNOUNCES PLAN FOR AN IMPROVED TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt;

These stations give detailed information about tsunamis while they are still far off shore. Each station consists of a [[Seabed|sea-bed]] bottom pressure recorder (at a depth of 1000–6000 m) which detects the passage of a tsunami and transmits the data to a surface [[buoy]] via acoustic modem. The surface buoy then radios the information to the NTWC via the [[GOES]] [[satellite]] system. The bottom pressure recorder lasts for two years while the surface buoy is replaced every year. The system has considerably improved the forecasting and warning of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean.

'''Neural oscillations''', or '''brainwaves''', are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural activity in the [[central nervous system]]. [[Neural tissue]] can generate [[oscillation|oscillatory activity]] in many ways, driven either by mechanisms within individual [[neurons]] or by interactions between neurons.  In individual neurons, oscillations can appear either as oscillations in [[membrane potential]] or as rhythmic patterns of [[action potentials]], which then produce oscillatory activation of [[post-synaptic potential|post-synaptic]] neurons.  At the level of [[neural ensemble]]s, synchronized activity of large numbers of neurons can give rise to [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] oscillations, which can be observed in an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]. Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns. The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons. A well-known example of macroscopic neural oscillations is [[alpha wave|alpha activity]].

Neural oscillations were observed by researchers as early as 1924 (by [[Hans Berger]]). More than 50 years later, intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons, but its functional role is still not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Llinas|first1=R. R. |title=Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective |journal=Front Cell Neurosci |volume=8 |page=320 |year=2014 |pmid=25408634 |pmc=4219458 |doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible roles of neural oscillations include [[neural binding|feature binding]], [[neural code|information transfer mechanisms]] and the [[central pattern generator|generation of rhythmic motor output]]. Over the last decades more insight has been gained, especially with advances in [[brain imaging]]. A major area of research in [[neuroscience]] involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are. Oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed at different [[levels of Organization (anatomy)|levels of organization]] and is thought to play a key role in processing neural information. Numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations; a unified interpretation, however, is still lacking.

[[File:SimulationNeuralOscillations.png|thumb|right|400px|Simulation of neural oscillations at 10 [[Hertz|Hz]]. Upper panel shows spiking of individual neurons (with each dot representing an individual [[action potential]] within the population of neurons, and the lower panel the [[local field potential]] reflecting their summed activity. Figure illustrates how synchronized patterns of action potentials may result in macroscopic oscillations that can be measured outside the scalp.]]

== Overview ==

Neural oscillations are observed throughout the central nervous system at all levels, and include [[action potential|spike trains]], [[local field potentials]] and large-scale [[oscillation]]s which can be measured by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using [[time-frequency analysis]]. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a [[neural ensemble]], also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory.&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fries P | title = A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence | journal = TICS | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 474–480 | year = 2005 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fell J, Axmacher N | title = The role of phase synchronization in memory processes | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 12 | pages = 105–118 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2979 | pmid = 21248789 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrn1650 | vauthors = Schnitzler A, Gross J | title = Normal and pathological oscillatory communication in the brain | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 285&amp;ndash;296 | year = 2005 | pmid=15803160 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural oscillations have been most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to [[pink noise]], but also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is [[alpha waves|alpha activity]] (7.5–12.5 [[Hertz|Hz]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2654794 | pmid=19300566 | volume=3 | title=Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research | date=June 2007 | vauthors=Gerrard P, Malcolm R | journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | pages=349–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be detected from the [[occipital lobe]] during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger H, Gray CM | title = Uber das Elektroenkephalogramm des Menschen | journal = Arch Psychiat Nervenkr | volume = 87 | pages = 527–570 | year = 1929 | doi = 10.1007/BF01797193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other frequency bands are: [[delta wave|delta]] (1&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[theta wave|theta]] (4&amp;ndash;8&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[beta wave|beta]] (13&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[gamma wave|low gamma]] (30&amp;ndash;70&amp;nbsp;Hz), and [[gamma wave|high gamma]] (70&amp;ndash;150&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequency bands, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity have been linked to cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dement W, Kleitman N |title=Cyclic variations in EEG during sleep and their relation to eye movements, body motility and dreaming |journal=Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol |year=1957 |volume=9 |pages=673–90 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(57)90088-3 |pmid=13480240 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as [[awareness]] and [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engel AK, Singer W |title=Temporal binding and the neural correlates of sensory awareness |year=2001 |volume=5 |pages=16–25 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01568-0 |issue=1 |pmid=11164732 |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Varela F, Lachaux JP, Rodriguez E, Martinerie J | title = The brainweb: phase synchronization and large-scale integration | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 2 | pages = 229–239 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/35067550 | pmid = 11283746 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neural oscillations in human brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, they are also observed using more invasive recording techniques such as [[single-unit recording]]s. Neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of [[action potential]]s or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called ''resonators''.&lt;ref name = "Izhikevich 2007"&gt;{{cite book | author = Izhikevich EM | title = Dynamical systems in neuroscience | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |  year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bursting]] is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for [[neural coding|information coding]] in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed in the form of [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]] (i.e. in the absence of action potentials).&lt;ref name = "Llinas 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Llinas R, Yarom Y | year = 1986 | title = Oscillatory properties of guinea-pig inferior olivary neurones and their pharmacological modulation: an in vitro study | journal = J Physiol | volume=376 | pages=163&amp;ndash;182 | pmid=3795074 | pmc=1182792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If numerous neurons spike in [[synchronization|synchrony]], they can give rise to oscillations in [[local field potentials]].

Neural oscillations are commonly studied from a mathematical framework and belong to the field of "neurodynamics", an area of research in the [[cognitive science]]s that places a strong focus upon the dynamic character of neural activity in describing [[brain]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/286819 | author = Burrow T | title = The neurodynamics of behavior. A phylobiological foreword | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 10 | pages = 271–288 | year = 1943 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers the brain a [[dynamical system]] and uses [[differential equations]] to describe how neural activity evolves over time. In particular, it aims to relate dynamic patterns of brain activity to cognitive functions such as perception and memory. In very [[abstract structure|abstract form]], neural oscillations can be analyzed [[Analytical expression|analytically]]. When studied in a more physiologically realistic setting, oscillatory activity is generally studied using [[computer simulation]]s of a [[computational neuroscience|computational model]].

The functions of neural oscillations are wide-ranging and vary for different types of oscillatory activity. Examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and the [[neural binding]] of sensory features in perception, such as the shape and color of an object. Neural oscillations also play an important role in many [[neurological disorder]]s, such as excessive synchronization during [[seizure]] activity in [[epilepsy]] or [[tremor]] in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices in [[brain–computer interface]]s, in which subjects can control an external device by changing the amplitude of particular brain rhythmics &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608085&lt;/ref&gt;.{{additional citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Physiology==
{{main|Electrophysiology}}

Oscillatory activity is observed throughout the [[central nervous system]] at all levels of organization. Three different levels have been widely recognized: the micro-scale (activity of a single neuron), the meso-scale (activity of a local group of neurons) and the macro-scale (activity of different brain regions).&lt;ref name = "Haken 1996"&gt;{{cite book | author=Haken H | title= Principles of brain functioning | year=1996 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-58967-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Current Clamp recording of Neuron.GIF|thumb|right|[[Tonic (physiology)|Tonic]] firing pattern of single neuron showing rhythmic spiking activity]]

=== Microscopic ===

Neurons generate [[action potentials]] resulting from changes in the electric membrane potential. Neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so-called spike trains. These spike trains are the basis for [[neural coding]] and information transfer in the brain. Spike trains can form all kinds of patterns, such as rhythmic spiking and [[bursting]], and often display oscillatory activity.&lt;ref name = "Wang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wang XJ | title= Neurophysiological and computational principles of cortical rhythms in cognition | year=2010 | journal=Physiol Rev | volume=90 | pages = 1195–1268 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00035.2008 | issue=3 | pmid=20664082 | pmc=2923921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations|sub-threshold fluctuations]] in membrane potential. These rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential. They can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons.

Neuronal spiking can be classified by their activity patterns. The excitability of neurons can be subdivided in Class I and II. Class I neurons can generate action potentials with arbitrarily low frequency depending on the input strength, whereas Class II neurons generate action potentials in a certain frequency band, which is relatively insensitive to changes in input strength.&lt;ref name = "Izhikevich 2007"/&gt; Class II neurons are also more prone to display sub-threshold oscillations in membrane potential.

=== Mesoscopic ===

A group of neurons can also generate oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up ([[Interference (wave propagation)|constructive interference]]). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which gives rise to large-amplitude oscillations of the [[local field potential]]. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far too small to be picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Nunez PL, Srinivasan R | title = Electric fields of the brain: The neurophysics of EEG |publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1981 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gu5qAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons in a [[neural ensemble]] rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of [[macroscopic scale|large-scale]] oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page).&lt;ref name='Wang 2010'/&gt; Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity [[endogenous]]ly through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory [[interneurons]] play an important role in producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Cardin JA, Carlen M, Meletis K, Knoblich, U, Zhang F, Deisseroth K, Tsai LH, Moore CI | title =Driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm and controls sensory responses | journal = Nature | year = 2009 | volume= 459 | issue= 7247 | pages= 663–U63 |  doi=10.1038/nature08002 | pmid=19396156| pmc = 3655711| bibcode=2009Natur.459..663C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroscopic ===

Neural oscillation can also arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural [[connectome]]. [[Propagation delay|Time delays]] play an important role here. Because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled, these connections between brain areas form [[feedback]] loops. [[Positive feedback]] loops tends to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is inversely related to the delay time. An example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the [[thalamus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] – the [[thalamocortical radiation]]s. This thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as [[recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinás R, Ribary U, Contreras D, Pedroarena C | title = The neuronal basis for consciousness | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

==Mechanisms==

=== Neuronal properties ===
{{see also|Action potential|Bursting}}

Scientists have identified some intrinsic [[neuron|neuronal properties]] that play an important role in generating membrane potential oscillations. In particular, [[voltage-gated ion channels]] are critical in the generation of action potentials. The dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well-established [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations. Using [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation analysis]], different oscillatory varieties of these neuronal models can be determined, allowing for the classification of types of neuronal responses. The oscillatory dynamics of neuronal spiking as identified in the Hodgkin–Huxley model closely agree with empirical findings. In addition to periodic spiking, [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]], i.e. [[resonance]] behavior that does not result in action potentials, may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Llinas RR | title = The Intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: A new insight into CNS function | journal = Science | volume = 242 | pages = 1654–1664 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.1126/science.3059497 | pmid = 3059497 | issue = 4886| bibcode = 1988Sci...242.1654L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinas RR, Grace AA, Yarom Y | year = 1991 | title = In vitro neurons in mammalian cortical layer 4 exhibit intrinsic oscillatory activity in the 10- to 50-Hz frequency range | journal = Proc.

Bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations, and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance neuronal resonance.&lt;ref name = 'Wang 2010'/&gt;

=== Network properties ===
{{see also| Connectome}}

Apart from intrinsic properties of neurons, [[biological neural network]] properties are also an important source of oscillatory activity. Neurons [[Neuron#Connectivity|communicate]] with one another via synapses and affect the timing of spike trains in the post-synaptic neurons. Depending on the properties of the connection, such as the coupling strength, time delay and whether coupling is [[EPSP|excitatory]] or [[IPSP|inhibitory]], the spike trains of the interacting neurons may become [[phase synchronization|synchronized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeitler M, Daffertshofer A, Gielen CC | year = 2009 | title =Asymmetry in pulse-coupled oscillators with delay | journal = Phys. Rev. E| volume = 79 | issue = 6 | p = 065203(R) | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.79.065203 | bibcode = 2009PhRvE..79f5203Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neurons are locally connected, forming small clusters that are called [[neural ensemble]]s. Certain network structures promote oscillatory activity at specific frequencies. For example, neuronal activity generated by two populations of interconnected ''inhibitory'' and ''excitatory'' cells can show spontaneous oscillations that are described by the [[Wilson-Cowan model]].

If a group of neurons engages in synchronized oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator.&lt;ref name = "Haken 1996"/&gt; Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity.&lt;ref name = "Pikovsky 2001"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pikovsky A, Rosenblum M, Kurths J | title= Synchronization: a universal concept in nonlinear sciences | year=2001 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-53352-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the [[thalamus]] and the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] (see [[Recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance|thalamocortical oscillation]]), involve time-delays due to the finite [[Action potential#Propagation|conduction velocity]] of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form [[feedback|feed-back loops]] that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form [[large scale brain networks]], whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of [[frequency domain|spectral analysis]] and [[Granger causality]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Brovelli, Steven L. Bressler and their colleagues, [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/101/26/9849.pdf 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"/&gt;

=== Neuromodulation ===
{{main| Neuromodulation (biology)}}

In addition to fast direct [[synapse|synaptic interactions]] between neurons forming a network, oscillatory activity is regulated by [[neuromodulators]] on a much slower time scale. That is, the concentration levels of certain neurotransmitters are known to regulate the amount of oscillatory activity. For instance, [[GABA]] concentration has been shown to be positively correlated with frequency of oscillations in induced stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muthukumaraswamy SD, Edden RA, Jones DK, Swettenham JB, Singh KD | title = Resting GABA concentration predicts peak gamma frequency and fMRI amplitude in response to visual stimulation in humans | journal = Proc.

These neurotransmitter systems affect the physiological state, e.g., [[wakefulness]] or [[arousal]], and have a pronounced effect on amplitude of different brain waves, such as alpha activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moruzzi G, Magoun HW | title = Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG | journal = Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 1 | pages = 455–473 | year = 1949 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(49)90219-9 | pmid = 18421835 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical description ==
{{see also| Computational neuroscience}}

Oscillations can often be described and analyzed using mathematics. Mathematicians have identified several [[dynamical systems|dynamical]] mechanisms that generate rhythmicity.  Among the most important are [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic]] (linear) oscillators, [[limit cycle]] oscillators, and delayed-[[feedback]] oscillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzsaki G, Draguhn A | title = Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5679 | year = 2004 | pages = 1926–1929 | doi =  10.1126/science.1099745 | pmid = 15218136 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1926B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harmonic oscillations appear very frequently in nature—examples are sound waves, the motion of a [[pendulum]], and vibrations of every sort. They generally arise when a physical system is perturbed by a small degree from a [[Principle of minimum energy|minimum-energy state]], and are well understood mathematically.  Noise-driven harmonic oscillators realistically simulate alpha rhythm in the waking EEG as well as slow waves and spindles in the sleep EEG. Successful EEG analysis algorithms were based on such models. Several other EEG components are better described by limit-cycle or delayed-feedback oscillations.  Limit-cycle oscillations arise from physical systems that show large deviations from [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|equilibrium]], whereas delayed-feedback oscillations arise when components of a system affect each other after significant time delays.  Limit-cycle oscillations can be complex but there are powerful mathematical tools for analyzing them; the mathematics of delayed-feedback oscillations is primitive in comparison. Linear oscillators and limit-cycle oscillators qualitatively differ in terms of how they respond to fluctuations in input.  In a linear oscillator, the frequency is more or less constant but the amplitude can vary greatly. In a limit-cycle oscillator, the amplitude tends to be more or less constant but the frequency can vary greatly.  A [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] is an example of a limit-cycle oscillation in that the frequency of beats varies widely, while each individual beat continues to pump about the same amount of blood.

[[Computational models]] adopt a variety of abstractions in order to describe complex oscillatory dynamics observed in brain activity. Many models are used in the field, each defined at a different level of abstraction and trying to model different aspects of neural systems. They range from models of the short-term behaviour of individual neurons, through models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons, to models of how behaviour can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems.

=== Single neuron model ===

{{see also| Biological neuron model}}

A model of a biological neuron is a mathematical description of the properties of nerve cells, or neurons, that is designed to accurately describe and predict its biological processes. The most successful and widely used model of neurons, the Hodgkin–Huxley model, is based on data from the [[squid giant axon]]. It is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of a neuron, in particular the generation and propagation of [[action potentials]]. The model is very accurate and detailed and [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]] received the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work.

The mathematics of the Hodgkin–Huxley model are quite complicated and several simplifications have been proposed, such as the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]] and the [[Hindmarsh–Rose model]]. Such models only capture the basic neuronal dynamics, such as rhythmic spiking and [[bursting]], but are more computationally efficient. This allows the simulation of a large number of interconnected neurons that form a [[neural network]].

=== Spiking model ===
{{see also| Neural network}}

A neural network model describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit.  These models aim to describe how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons. Local interactions between neurons can result in the synchronization of spiking activity and form the basis of oscillatory activity. In particular, models of interacting [[pyramidal cells]] and inhibitory [[interneurons]] have been shown to generate brain rhythms such as [[gamma wave|gamma activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whittington MA, Traub RD, Kopell N, Ermentrout B, Buhl EH |title=Inhibition-based rhythms: experimental and mathematical observations on network dynamics |journal= Int J Psychophysiol |volume=38 |pages=315–336 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0167-8760(00)00173-2 |pmid=11102670 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also| Wilson-Cowan model}}

Neural field models are another important tool in studying neural oscillations and are a mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity of large numbers of neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous [[neural networks]]. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the [[mean field theory|mean field approach]], an area of [[statistical physics]] that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Bressloff PC, Cowan JD (2003) Spontaneous pattern formation in primary visual cortex.

{{main|Kuramoto model}}

The [[Kuramoto model]] of coupled phase oscillators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuramoto Y | title= Chemical Oscillations, Waves, and Turbulence | year=1984 | publisher=Dover Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most abstract and fundamental models used to investigate neural oscillations and synchronization. It captures the activity of a local system (e.g., a single neuron or neural ensemble) by its circular [[phase (waves)|phase]] alone and hence ignores the amplitude of oscillations (amplitude is constant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ermentrout B | contribution = An introduction to neural oscillators | editor = F Ventriglia | title= Neural Modeling and Neural Networks | year = 1994 | pages = 79–110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions amongst these oscillators are introduced by a simple algebraic form (such as a [[trigonometric functions|sine]] function) and collectively generate a dynamical pattern at the global scale. The Kuramoto model is widely used to study oscillatory brain activity and several extensions have been proposed that increase its neurobiological plausibility, for instance by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2010.00190 | vauthors = Breakspear M, Heitmann S, Daffertshofer A | title = Generative models of cortical oscillations: Neurobiological implications of the Kuramoto model | journal = Front Hum Neurosci | volume = 4 | p = 190 | year = 2010 | pmid=21151358 |pmc=2995481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it describes how the activity of a group of interacting neurons can become synchronized and generate large-scale oscillations. Simulations using the Kuramoto model with realistic long-range cortical connectivity and time-delayed interactions reveal the emergence of slow patterned fluctuations that reproduce resting-state [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent|BOLD]] functional maps, which can be measured using [[fMRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.010 | vauthors = Cabral J, Hugues E, Sporns O, Deco G | title = Role of local network oscillations in resting-state functional connectivity | journal = NeuroImage | year = 2011 | pmid=21511044 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=130–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity patterns ==

Both single neurons and groups of neurons can generate oscillatory activity spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output. Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically in the absence of any synaptic input. Likewise, brain-wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity, so-called [[resting state fMRI|resting-state activity]]. These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output. Oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all, resulting in an additive response.

=== Ongoing activity ===

Spontaneous activity is [[brain]] activity in the absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses.  The term ''ongoing brain activity'' is used in [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form [[evoked potential]]s/[[evoked field]]s, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be [[Signal noise|noise]] if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis.  Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as [[alpha wave]]s, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a [[Gaussian noise|noise]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bistability and non-Gaussian fluctuations in spontaneous cortical activity |vauthors=Freyer F, Aquino K, Robinson PA, Ritter P, Breakspear M | year=2009 |journal=J Neurosci |volume=29 |issue=26 |pages=8512–8524 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0754-09.2009 |pmid=19571142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the [[default network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2201 |title=Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging |vauthors=Fox MD, Raichle ME |year=2007 |journal=Nat Rev Neurosci |volume=8 |pages=700&amp;ndash;711 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging |vauthors=Laufs H, Kraków K, Sterzer P, Eger E, Beyerle A, Salek-Haddadi A, Kleinschmidt A|year=2003 |journal=PNAS |volume=100 |issue=19 |pages=11053–11058 |pmid=12958209 |pmc=196925 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1831638100|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011053L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing brain activity may also have an important role in perception, as it may interact with activity related to incoming stimuli. Indeed, [[EEG]] studies suggest that visual perception is dependent on both the phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations. For instance, the amplitude and phase of alpha activity at the moment of visual stimulation predicts whether a weak stimulus will be perceived by the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathewson KE, Gratton G, Fabiani M, Beck DM, Ro T | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 29 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3963-08.2009 | title = To see or not to see: Prestimulus α phase predicts visual awareness | year = 2009 | pages = 2725–32 | pmid = 19261866 | issue = 9 | pmc = 2724892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch NA, Dubois J, VanRullen R | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 29 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.0113-09.2009 | title = The phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predicts visual perception | year = 2009 | pages = 7869–76 | pmid = 19535598 | issue = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Dijk H, Schoffelen JM, Oostenveld R, Jensen O | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 28 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.1853-07.2008 | title = Prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band predicts visual discrimination ability | year = 2008 | pages = 1816–1823 | issue = 8 | pmid = 18287498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency response ===

In response to input, a neuron or neuronal ensemble may change the frequency at which it oscillates, thus changing the [[rate coding|rate]] at which it spikes. Often, a neuron's firing rate depends on the summed activity it receives. Frequency changes are also commonly observed in central pattern generators and directly relate to the speed of motor activities, such as step frequency in walking. However, changes in ''relative'' oscillation frequency between different brain areas is not so common because the frequency of oscillatory activity is often related to the time delays between brain areas.

=== Phase resetting ===

Phase resetting occurs when input to a neuron or neuronal ensemble resets the phase of ongoing oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tass PA | title=Phase resetting in medicine and biology: stochastic modelling and data analysis | year = 2007 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=3-540-65697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to neuronal input (a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input, which is referred to as phase locking&lt;ref name="Izhikevich 2007"/&gt;) and may also occur in neuronal ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously. Phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pikovsky 2001"/&gt; because the timing of spikes can become phase locked to the activity of other neurons.

Phase resetting also permits the study of evoked activity, a term used in [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] for responses in brain activity that are directly related to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]-related activity. [[Evoked potential]]s and [[event-related potential]]s are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are [[phase (waves)|phase]]-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1066168 |title=Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses|vauthors=Makeig S, Westerfield M, Jung TP, Enghoff S, Townsend J, Courchesne E, Sejnowski TJ |year=2002 |journal=Science |volume=295 |pages=690&amp;ndash;694 |pmid=11809976 |issue=5555|bibcode=2002Sci...295..690M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mäkinen V, Tiitinen H, May P | title = Auditory event-related responses are generated independently of ongoing brain activity | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 24 | pages = 961–968 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.10.020 | pmid = 15670673 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amplitude response ===

Next to evoked activity, neural activity related to stimulus processing may result in induced activity. Induced activity refers to modulation in ongoing brain activity induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced activity is amplitude change in oscillatory activity. For instance, [[Gamma wave|gamma activity]] often increases during increased mental activity such as during object representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01299-1|title=Oscillatory gamma activity in humans and its role in object representation|vauthors=Tallon-Baudry C, Bertrand O |year=1999 |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=3 |pages=151&amp;ndash;162|issue=4 |pmid=10322469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using [[time-frequency analysis]]. Induced activity generally reflects the activity of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory activity are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural activity, for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory activity are therefore often referred to as event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization.&lt;ref name = "Pfurtscheller 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00141-8 |title=Event-related EEG/MEG synchronization and desynchronization: basic principles |author1=Pfurtscheller G | author2=da Silva FHL |year=1999 |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=110 |pages=1842&amp;ndash;1857 |pmid=10576479 |issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Asymmetric amplitude modulation ====

It has recently been proposed that even if phases are not aligned across trials, induced activity may still cause [[event-related potential]]s because ongoing brain oscillations may not be symmetric and thus amplitude modulations may result in a baseline shift that does not average out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A novel mechanism for evoked responses in the human brain|vauthors=Nikulin VV, Linkenkaer-Hansen K, Nolte G, Lemm S, Muller KR, Ilmoniemi RJ, Curio G |year=2007 |journal=Eur J Neurosci |volume=25 |pages=3146&amp;ndash;3154|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05553.x|issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asymmetric amplitude modulations of brain oscillations generate slow evoked responses|vauthors=Mazaheri A, Jensen O |year=2008 |journal=J Neurosci |volume=28 |pages=7781&amp;ndash;7787|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1631-08.2008|issue=31|pmid=18667610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model implies that slow event-related responses, such as asymmetric alpha activity, could result from asymmetric brain oscillation amplitude modulations, such as an asymmetry of the intracellular currents that propagate forward and backward down the dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Rhythmic pulsing: linking ongoing brain activity with evoked responses|vauthors=Mazaheri A, Jensen O |year=2008 |journal=Front Hum Neurosci |volume=4 |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this assumption, asymmetries in the dendritic current would cause asymmetries in oscillatory activity measured by EEG and MEG, since dendritic currents in pyramidal cells are generally thought to generate EEG and MEG signals that can be measured at the scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetoencephalography - Theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain |vauthors=Hamalainen M, Hari R, Ilmoniemi RJ, Knuutila J, Lounasmaa OV |year=1993 |journal=Rev Mod Phys |volume=65 |pages=413&amp;ndash;497 |bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Neural synchronization can be modulated by task constraints, such as [[attention]], and is thought to play a role in [[neural binding|feature binding]],&lt;ref name = "Singer 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ph.55.030193.002025 | author = Singer W | title = Synchronization of cortical activity and its putative role in information processing and learning | journal = Annu Rev Physiol | volume = 55 | pages = 349–374 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8466179}}&lt;/ref&gt; neuronal communication,&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"/&gt; and [[motor coordination]].&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"/&gt; Neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in [[neuroscience]] in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the [[neural binding]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer W, Gray CM | title = Visual feature integration and the temporal correlation hypothesis | journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 18 | pages = 555–586 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.18.030195.003011 | pmid = 7605074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person looks at a tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in [[local field potentials]] which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in [[EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping.&lt;ref name = "Singer 1993"/&gt;

=== Pacemaker ===
{{main|Cardiac pacemaker}}

Cells in the [[sinoatrial node]], located in the [[right atrium]] of the heart, spontaneously depolarize approximately 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells have the ability to generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal [[sinus rhythm]] and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the [[heart rate]]. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the [[autonomic nervous system]], which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells.

=== Central pattern generator ===
{{main|Central pattern generator}}

Synchronized firing of neurons also forms the basis of periodic motor commands for rhythmic movements. These rhythmic outputs are produced by a group of interacting neurons that form a network, called a [[central pattern generator]]. Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that—when activated—can produce rhythmic motor patterns in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. Examples are [[walking]], [[control of respiration|breathing]], and [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marder E, Bucher D | title = Central pattern generators and the control of rhythmic movements| journal = Curr Biol | volume = 11 | pages = R986–R996 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00581-4 | issue = 23 | pmid = 11728329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most evidence for central pattern generators comes from lower animals, such as the [[lamprey]], but there is also evidence for spinal central pattern generators in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitrijevic MR, Gerasimenko Y, Pinter MM | title = Evidence for a spinal central pattern generator in humans| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 860 | pages = 360–376 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09062.x | pmid=9928325| bibcode = 1998NYASA.860..360D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danner SM, Hofstoetter US, Freundl B, Binder H, Mayr W, Rattay F, Minassian K | title = Human spinal locomotor control is based on flexibly organized burst generators | journal = Brain | volume = 138 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 577–88 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25582580 | pmc = 4408427 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awu372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information processing ===
{{main|Neural coding}}

Neuronal spiking is generally considered the basis for information transfer in the brain. For such a transfer, information needs to be coded in a spiking pattern. Different types of coding schemes have been proposed, such as [[rate coding]] and [[temporal coding]]. Neural oscillations could create periodic time windows in which input spikes have larger effect on neurons, thereby providing a mechanism for decoding temporal codes.&lt;ref name = "Gupta2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta N, Singh SS, Stopfer M | title = Oscillatory integration windows in neurons | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13808 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27976720 | pmc = 5171764 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13808 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713808G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===
{{see also| Binding problem}}

Synchronization of neuronal firing may serve as a means to group spatially segregated neurons that respond to the same stimulus in order to bind these responses for further joint processing, i.e. to exploit temporal synchrony to encode relations. Purely theoretical formulations of the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis were proposed first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Milner PM | title = A model for visual shape recognition | journal = Psychol. Rev. | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 521–535 | year = 1974 | doi = 10.1037/h0037149 | pmid=4445414}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently extensive experimental evidence has been reported supporting the potential role of synchrony as a relational code.&lt;ref name = "Gray 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gray CM, König P, Engel AK, Singer W | title = Oscillatory responses in cat visual cortex exhibit inter-columnar synchronization which reflects global stimulus properties | journal = Nature | volume = 338 | pages = 334–337 | year = 1989 |doi=10.1038/338334a0 | issue=6213 | pmid = 2922061| bibcode = 1989Natur.338..334G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes implanted in the visual cortex. These experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli. The frequency of these oscillations was in the range of 40&amp;nbsp;Hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating, suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions.&lt;ref name="Gray 1989"/&gt; Similar findings were shown in parallel by the group of Eckhorn, providing further evidence for the functional role of neural synchronization in feature binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  vauthors = Eckhorn R, Bauer R, Jordan W, Brosch M, Kruse W, Munk M, Reitboeck HJ | journal = Biol Cybern | volume = 60  | issue = 2 | title = Coherent oscillations: A mechanism of feature linking in the visual cortex?

Gilles Laurent and colleagues showed that oscillatory synchronization has an important functional role in odor perception. Perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wehr M, Laurent G | title = Odour encoding by temporal sequences of firing in oscillating neural assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 384 | pages = 162–166 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1038/384162a0 | pmid = 8906790 | issue = 6605 | bibcode = 1996Natur.384..162W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These oscillations can be disrupted by [[GABA]] blocker [[picrotoxin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod K, Laurent G | title = Distinct mechanisms for synchronization and temporal patterning of odor-encoding neural assemblies  | journal = Science | volume = 274 | pages = 976–979 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5289.976 | pmid = 8875938 | issue = 5289 | bibcode = 1996Sci...274..976M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stopfer M, Bhagavan S, Smith BH, Laurent G | title = Impaired odour discrimination on desynchronization of odour-encoding neural assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | pages = 70–74 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1038/36335 | pmid = 9363891 | issue = 6655 | bibcode = 1997Natur.390...70S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to more similar responses across odors in downstream β-lobe neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod K, Bäcker A, Laurent G | title = Who reads temporal information contained across synchronized and oscillatory spike trains? | journal = Nature | volume = 395 | pages = 693–698 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1038/27201 | pmid = 9790189 | issue = 6703 | bibcode = 1998Natur.395..693M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent follow-up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for [[Kenyon cell]]s in the insect [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body]], such that incoming spikes from the [[antennal lobe]] are more effective in activating Kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle.&lt;ref name="Gupta2016" /&gt;

=== Motor coordination ===
{{main| Motor coordination}}

Oscillations have been commonly reported in the motor system. Pfurtscheller and colleagues found a reduction in [[alpha wave|alpha]] (8&amp;ndash;12&amp;nbsp;Hz) and [[Beta wave|beta]] (13&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillations in [[EEG]] activity when subjects made a movement.&lt;ref name = "Pfurtscheller 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfurtscheller G, Aranibar A | title = Event-related cortical desynchronization detected by power measurements of scalp EEG | journal = Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 42 | pages = 817–826 | year = 1977 | pmid = 67933 | issue = 6 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(77)90235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using intra-cortical recordings, similar changes in oscillatory activity were found in the motor cortex when the monkeys performed motor acts that required significant attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murthy VN, Fetz EE | title = Oscillatory activity in sensorimotor cortex of awake monkeys: Synchronization of local field potentials and relation to behavior | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 76 | pages = 3949–3967 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8985892 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanes JN, Donoghue JP| title = Oscillations in local-field potentials of the primate motor cortex during voluntary movement | journal = PNAS | volume = 90 | pages = 4470–4474 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.10.4470 | pmid = 8506287 | issue = 10 | pmc = 46533 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.4470S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, oscillations at spinal level become synchronised to beta oscillations in the motor cortex during constant muscle activation, as determined by [[Corticomuscular coherence|cortico-muscular coherence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conway, BA |author2=Halliday, DM |author3=Farmer, SF | title = Synchronization between motor cortex and spinal motoneuronal pool during the performance of a maintained motor task in man | journal = J Physiol | volume = 489 | pages = 917–924 | year = 1995 | issue = 3  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salenius S, Portin K, Kajola M | title = Cortical control of human motoneuron firing during isometric contraction  | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 77 | pages = 3401–3405 | year = 1997 | issue = 6 | pmid = 9212286  | displayauthors = etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.225bo.x | vauthors = Baker SN, Olivier E, Lemon RN | title = Coherent oscillations in monkey motor cortex and hand muscle EMG show task-dependent modulation | journal = J Physiol | volume = 501 | pages = 225–241 | year = 1997 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1159515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, muscle activity of different muscles reveals [[Intermuscular coherence|inter-muscular coherence]] at multiple distinct frequencies reflecting the underlying neural circuitry involved in [[motor coordination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boonstra TW, Danna-Dos-Santos A, Xie HB, Roerdink M, Stins JF, Breakspear M | title = Muscle networks: Connectivity analysis of EMG activity during postural control | journal = Sci Rep | volume = 5 | pages = 17830 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1038/srep17830 | pmid=26634293 | pmc=4669476| bibcode=2015NatSR...517830B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerkman JN, Daffertshofer A, Gollo LL, Breakspear M, Boonstra TW | title = Network structure of the human musculoskeletal system shapes neural interactions on multiple time scales | journal = Science Advances | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = eaat0497 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29963631 | pmc = 6021138 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.aat0497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently it was found that cortical oscillations propagate as [[travelling wave]]s across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rubino, D |author2=Robbins, KA |author3=Hatsopoulos, NG | title = Propagating waves mediate information transfer in the motor cortex  | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 9 | pages = 1549–1557 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1038/nn1802 | pmid = 17115042 | issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that motor commands in the form of travelling waves can be spatially filtered by the descending fibres to selectively control muscle force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heitmann S, Boonstra T, Gong P, Breakspear M, Ermentrout B | title = The rhythms of steady posture: Motor commands as spatially organized oscillation patterns | journal = Neurocomputing | volume = 170 | pages = 3–14 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.neucom.2015.01.088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations have shown that ongoing wave activity in cortex can elicit steady muscle force with physiological levels of EEG-EMG coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heitmann S, Boonstra T, Breakspear M | title = A dendritic mechanism for decoding traveling waves: Principles and applications to motor cortex | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e1003260 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003260 | pmid=24204220 | pmc=3814333| bibcode=2013PLSCB...9E3260H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscillatory rhythms at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz have been recorded in a brain area called the [[inferior olive]], which is associated with the cerebellum.&lt;ref name = "Llinas 1986"/&gt; These oscillations are also observed in motor output of physiological [[tremor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allum JH, Dietz V, Freund HJ| title = Neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological tremor | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 41 | pages = 557–571 | year = 1978 | pmid = 660226 | issue = 3 | doi= 10.1152/jn.1978.41.3.557}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when performing slow finger movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallbo AB, Wessberg J| title = Organization of motor output of slow finger movements in man| journal = J Physiol | volume = 469 | pages = 673–691 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8271223 | pmc = 1143894}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings may indicate that the human brain controls continuous movements intermittently. In support, it was shown that these movement discontinuities are directly correlated to oscillatory activity in a cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, which may represent a neural mechanism for the intermittent motor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross J, Timmermann J, Kujala J, Dirks M, Schmitz F, Salmelin R, Schnitzler A | title = The neural basis of intermittent motor control in humans| journal = PNAS | volume = 99 | pages = 2299–2302 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032682099 | pmid = 11854526 | issue = 4 | pmc = 122359| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.2299G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
{{main|Memory}}

Neural oscillations, in particular [[Theta rhythm|theta]] activity, are extensively linked to memory function. Theta rhythms are very strong in rodent hippocampi and entorhinal cortex during learning and memory retrieval, and they are believed to be vital to the induction of [[long-term potentiation]], a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory. [[Coupling (physics)|Coupling]] between theta and [[gamma wave|gamma]] activity is thought to be vital for memory functions, including [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Buszaki G | title = Rhythms of the brain | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nyhus E, Curran T | title = Functional role of gamma and theta oscillations in episodic memory | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1023–35 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20060015 | pmc = 2856712 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.12.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight coordination of single-neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans, as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutishauser U, Ross IB, Mamelak AN, Schuman EM | title = Human memory strength is predicted by theta-frequency phase-locking of single neurons | journal = Nature | volume = 464 | issue = 7290 | pages = 903–7 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20336071 | doi = 10.1038/nature08860 | bibcode = 2010Natur.464..903R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep and consciousness ===
{{main|Sleep}}

Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent [[consciousness]] and proceeds in cycles of [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) and [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|non-rapid eye movement]] (NREM) sleep. Sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]: for instance, stage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves (common in the awake state) to theta waves, whereas stage N3 (deep or slow-wave sleep) is characterized by the presence of delta waves. The normal order of sleep stages is N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM.

=== Development ===

Neural oscillations may play a role in neural development. For example, [[retinal waves]] are thought to have properties that define early connectivity of circuits and synapses between cells in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feller|first=Marla B|date=2009-07-06|title=Retinal waves are likely to instruct the formation of eye-specific retinogeniculate projections|journal=Neural Development|volume=4|pages=24|doi=10.1186/1749-8104-4-24|issn=1749-8104|pmc=2706239|pmid=19580682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathology ==

[[File:Writing by a Parkinson's disease patient.png|thumb|Handwriting of a person affected by [[Parkinson's disease]] showing rhythmic tremor activity in the strokes]]
[[File:Spike-waves.png|thumb|Generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges reflecting [[seizure]] activity]]

Specific types of neural oscillations may also appear in pathological situations, such as [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[epilepsy]]. These pathological oscillations often consist of an aberrant version of a normal oscillation. For example, one of the best known types is the [[spike and wave]] oscillation, which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures, and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations.

=== Tremor ===
{{main|Tremor}}

A tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic, muscle contraction and relaxation involving to-and-fro movements of one or more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as [[essential tremor]] or [[Parkinsonism|Parkinsonian]] tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McAuley JH, Marsden CD | title = Physiological and pathological tremors and rhythmic central motor control | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | year = 2000 | pages = 1545–1567 | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.8.1545 | pmid = 10908186 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epilepsy ===
{{main|Epilepsy}}

Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by [[epileptic seizure|seizures]]. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or [[Electrophysiological hypersynchronization in epilepsy|hypersynchronous neuronal activity]] in the brain.&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"&gt;V. Shusterman and W. C. Troy. From baseline to epileptiform activity: A path to synchronized rhythmicity in large-scale neural networks. Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys. 2008;77(6 Pt 1):061911&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thalamocortical dysrhythmia ===
{{main|Thalamocortical dysrhythmia}}

In thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD), normal [[Recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance|thalamocortical resonance]] is disrupted. The thalamic loss of input allows the frequency of the thalamo-cortical column to slow into the theta or delta band as identified by MEG and EEG by machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanneste S, Song JJ, De Ridder D | title = Thalamocortical dysrhythmia detected by machine learning | language = En | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1103 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29549239 | pmc = 5856824 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-02820-0 | bibcode = 2018NatCo...9.1103V }}&lt;/ref&gt; TCD can be treated with [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] methods like [[thalamotomy]].


{{clear}}

== Applications ==

=== Clinical endpoints ===
Neural oscillations are sensitive to several drugs influencing brain activity; accordingly, [[biomarker]]s based on neural oscillations are emerging as [[Clinical endpoint|secondary endpoints]] in clinical trials and in quantifying effects in pre-clinical studies. These biomarkers are often named "EEG biomarkers" or "Neurophysiological Biomarkers" and are quantified using [[Quantitative electroencephalography|Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)]]. EEG biomarkers can be extracted from the EEG using the open-source [[Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox]].

=== Brain–computer interface ===
{{main|Brain–computer interface}}

Neural oscillation has been applied as a control signal in various [[brain–computer interface]]s (BCIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Birbaumer | first=Neils | year=2006 | title=Breaking the silence: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication and motor control | journal=Psychophysiology | pmid=17076808 | volume=43 | issue=6 | pages=517–32 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2006.00456.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a non-invasive BCI interface can be created by placing electrodes on the scalp and then measuring the weak electric signals. Although individual neuron activities cannot be recovered through non-invasive BCI because the skull damps and blurs the electromagnetic signals, oscillatory activity can still be reliably detected. In particular, some forms of BCI allow users to control a device by measuring the amplitude of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands, including [[Mu wave|mu]] and [[Beta wave|beta]] rhythms.

'''O Boticário''' ({{IPA-pt|u botʃiˈkaɾju}}) is the second biggest Brazilian cosmetic company. It has 4,070 stores in [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Mexico]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[United States]], [[Paraguay]], [[Japan]], [[France]] and [[Venezuela]]. O Boticário is the largest cosmetic franchise in the world.  The main competitors of the company are [[Natura]], [[Avon Products]] and [[Grupo Silvio Santos|Jequiti]].

==History==

O Boticário was created in 1977 as a small prescription drugstore in the city of Curitiba, capital of the state of Paraná, in southern Brazil. Today the company is the world’s largest perfumery and cosmetics franchising network.

O Boticário’s industrial and administrative complex has 34.4 thousand square meters of floor space in the city of [[São José dos Pinhais]] in the [[Curitiba]] Metropolitan Area. It employs 1,300 people and creates approximately 10 thousand jobs through its franchising network. O Boticário’s first manufacturing plant was inaugurated in 1982, with just 1 thousand square meters of floor space. Then it employed 27 people who worked to manufacture about 400 thousand items a year. O Boticário’s current production exceeds 59 million units.

== Fundação O Boticário ==

In 1990, the company created the Fundação O Boticário de Proteção à Natureza (O Boticário Nature Protection Foundation), a nonprofit organization that has already sponsored 800 conservationist projects including studies, scientific research, environmental education programs and direct fauna and flora protection actions all over Brazil. The Foundation also supports the "Natural Areas Protection Program", which aims at implementing its own network of [[Private natural heritage reserve (Brazil)|private natural heritage reserves]].

The first one is the [[Salto Morato Private Natural Heritage Reserve]], which occupies a 2,340-hectare area, in [[Guaraqueçaba]], on the north coast of the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], in southern Brazil. This reservation protects a significant area of the Atlantic Rainforest, besides being provided with infrastructure for scientific research, environmental education, and outdoor recreation. In November 1999, the reservation supported by Fundação O Boticário de Proteção à Natureza was declared a Natural Heritage Site by [[UNESCO]].

==Products==
O Boticário’s product lines consist of approximately 480 items, divided into the following categories: body care, facial care, sun care, makeup, deodorizing colognes, deodorants, soaps and shampoos.

Amazonian plants such as açaí, cupuaçu, carnaúba, guaraná, cashew, and passion flower; gums extracted from algae and vegetal extracts, such as [[arnica]] and [[urucum]], are among the active ingredients present in the brand’s products.

==Controversy==
In May 2015, the company launched in Brazil a campaign titled "Toda Forma de Amor" (Every Kind of Love), made for Brazilian [[Valentine's Day]] (celebrated every June 12, the day before the Saint [[Anthony of Padua]] festivities), the campaign presented heterosexual and homosexual couples embracing and exchanging gifts of the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|URL = http://g1.globo.com/economia/midia-e-marketing/noticia/2015/05/boticario-mostra-casais-gays-em-comercial-de-dia-dos-namorados.html|título = Boticário mostra casais gays em comercial de Dia dos Namorados|data = 25 de maio de 2015|acessadoem = 3 de junho de 2015|autor = |publicado = G1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video generated huge repercussion, mainly in social networks. The commercial, uploaded on YouTube, earned more than three million views and had more than 360,000 likes, against over 180,000 dislikes (until June 6, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2015/06/1637175-anuncios-com-amor-gay-geram-guerra-de-curtidas-e-descurtidas.shtml |editor=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] |título=Anúncios com amor gay geram guerra de curtidas e descurtidas |data=3 de junho de 2015 |acessodata=5 de junho de 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among conservative sectors of society, however, the campaign had negative repercussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1259">In information systems, '''proactive information delivery''' (PID) is a paradigm of supporting users in doing their work by delivering them information related to the current working situation.
Unlike [[Information Search Process|information search process]] where the user has to initiate the search, PID tries to identify the user's current information need.

== Applications of PID ==

PID can be used for  [[Augmented learning|Just-In-Time learning]] embedded in working processes.

== Examples of systems providing PID features ==

[[Intellext Watson]] was a prominent tool illustrating the concept of lightweight PID.

== Classification of PID methods ==

Classification of PID tools is given in &lt;ref name="holzmausbernardirostanin"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Harald | last1 = Holz | first2 = Heiko | last2 = Maus | first3 = Ansgar | last3 = Bernardi | first4 = Oleg | last4 = Rostanin | title = From Lightweight, Proactive Information Delivery to Business Process-Oriented Knowledge Management | journal = Journal of Universal Knowledge Management | volume = 0 | issue = 2 | year = 2005 | pages = 101–127 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.63.8027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psion Teklogix Inc.''' was the operational business of [[Psion (computers)|Psion]].

Psion Teklogix is a global provider of solutions for [[mobile computing]] and [[wireless]] data collection. Psion Teklogix' products and services include rugged mobile hardware, secure [[wireless networks]], software, professional services and support programs.

Psion Teklogix was formed in September 2000 as a result of the merger between U.K.-based Psion Enterprise division of [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] PLC, and Canadian-based [[Teklogix]] Inc.
&lt;br /&gt;
Psion Teklogix is headquartered in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada with additional corporate offices located in Europe, the United States, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.
&lt;br /&gt;
Psion Teklogix is an [[ISO 9001:2000]] registered company, and holds a certificate of registration from the ''British Standards Institution''.

In 2012 [[Motorola Solutions]] purchased Psion Teklogix for $200million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fingas|first=Jon|title=Motorola Solutions buys Psion for $200 million|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/15/motorola-buys-psion-for-200-million/|accessdate=1 May 2015|date=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, it was announced that Motorola Solutions' enterprise business (including assets acquired in the Psion Teklogix purchase) is to be sold to [[Zebra Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roy|first=Abhirup|title=Zebra Tech to buy Motorola Solutions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/15/us-motorola-solu-zebra-tech-idUSBREA3E0NL20140415|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|Teklogix}}
[[Teklogix]] was created in 1967 by [[Rod Coutts]], a 1964 bachelor of applied science in electrical engineering,&lt;ref name = "Coutts"&gt;{{citation | url = http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=2632 | publisher = University of Waterloo | title = News release}}.&lt;/ref&gt; together with a small group of young Canadian engineers. The company grew to specialize in empowering mobile workers with wireless data transmission and real-time data management within the logistics industry.

'''The [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] Group''', founded in 1980 by David Potter, is widely credited with having created the world's first volume produced PDA with the launch of the [[Psion Organiser]] in 1984. Generally recognized as the world's first practical pocket computer, the Organiser helped evolve [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] into a major technology player.

In 2000 [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] acquired [[Teklogix]] in Canada for £240 million, and merged its business-to-business division, Psion Enterprise, with the newly acquired company. [[Teklogix]] was re-branded Psion Teklogix. This division now forms the core of Psion Plc's business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; 	

In 2002 Psion Teklogix created a new division called Psion Software. This business developed push email solutions for Symbian smartphones, Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes. This business was sold to Visto (USA) in 2003. 	

In 2004, Psion Teklogix announced its intention to dispose of the company's remaining Symbian shareholding to [[Nokia]], as they no longer regarded it as a core part of their strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Psion Teklogix and Linux==
Psion PLC had a lengthy, but distant, interest in [[Linux]] as an [[operating system]] on its electronic devices.  In 1998, it supported the Linux7K project that had been initiated by Ed Bailey at [[Red Hat]], which was to port Linux to its Series 5 personal computer.&lt;ref name = "Linux7K"&gt;

After the project transitioned again to sourceforge.net, the project's name was changed to a more general name "PsiLinux", and more recently to "OpenPsion".&lt;ref name = "OpenPsion"&gt;{{citation | url = http://linux-7110.sourceforge.net/ | title = OpenPsion | publisher = SourceForge}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project has developed Linux kernels and filesystems for the [[Psion Revo|Revo]], [[Psion Series 5|Series 5 and 5MX]], and [[Psion Series 7|Series 7 and netBook]].

In 2003–4, Psion Teklogix and its founder David Potter expressed interest in Linux as the operating system for its devices as it divested from Symbian.&lt;ref&gt;

== Psion Teklogix and the term ''Netbook'' ==

Psion registered the trademark ''NETBOOK'' in various territories, including [[European Union]] {{Community trademark|000428250}} and {{US trademark|75215401}}, which was applied for on 18 December 1996 and registered by [[USPTO]] on 21 November 2000. They used this trademark&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 Psion netbook news release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608191451/http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Psion netBook]] product (discontinued in November 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psionteklogix.com/public.aspx?s=us&amp;p=EOLProducts Psion Discontinued Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517090710/http://www.psionteklogix.com/public.aspx?s=us&amp;p=EOLProducts |date=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and more recently the NETBOOK PRO, from October 2003 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205154657/http://www.psionteklogix.com/public.aspx?s=com&amp;p=News&amp;POid=485 NETBOOK PRO announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] began the use of the term ''[[netbook]]'' in March 2008 as a generic term to describe "small laptops that are designed for wireless communication and access to the Internet", believing they were "not offering a branded line of computers here" and "see no naming conflict".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2008/03/thoughts_on_netbooks.php Paul Bergevin - VP and GM of Intel's Global Communication Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the growing use of this term, on 23 December 2008 Psion Teklogix sent cease and desist letters&lt;ref&gt;[http://jkontherun.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psion-letter.jpg Psion Cease and Desist Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326131612/http://jkontherun.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psion-letter.jpg |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to various parties including enthusiast website(s) demanding they no longer use the term "''netbook''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jkontherun.com/2008/12/23/netbook-enthusiast-web-sites-getting-c-d-using-term-netbook/ jkOnTheRun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/dec/24/psion-netbook-threats Psion threatens netbook sites over trademarks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009 [[Intel]] sued Psion Teklogix (US &amp; Canada) and [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] (UK) in the Federal Court, seeking a cancellation of the trademark and an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term "netbook", a declarative judgement regarding their use of the term, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and "such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/02/16/IntelvPsion.pdf Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Declaratory Judgment &amp; Cancellation of Federal Trademark]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/02/16/Intel_Wants_Netbook_Trademark_Canceled.htm Intel Wants 'Netbook' Trademark Canceled]&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was settled out of court, and on June 2, 2009 Psion announced that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term "Netbook" and that Psion agreed to "waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use" of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10253210-92.html Psion, Intel settle 'Netbook' trademark dispute]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar marks have been recently rejected by the [[USPTO]] citing a "likelihood of confusion" under section 2(d), including 'G NETBOOK' ({{US trademark|77527311}} rejected 31 October 2008), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]]'s 'WIND NETBOOK' ({{US trademark|77580272}}) and [[Coby Electronics Corporation|Coby Electronics]]' 'COBY NETBOOK' ({{US trademark|77590174}} rejected 13 January 2009)

'''Railway surgery''' was a branch of medical practice that flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  It concerned itself with the medical requirements of railway companies.  Depending on country, it included some or all of; [[general practice]] for railway staff, [[trauma surgery]] as a result of accidents on the railways, [[occupational health and safety]], [[medico-legal]] activities regarding compensation claims against the company, and occupational testing.

Railway surgery was especially well developed in the US with formal professional organisations and scholarly journals.  One of the reasons for this was that US railways were particularly dangerous with a high number of casualties from crashes and an even higher number of workers hurt in [[industrial accident]]s.  Another reason was that many US routes passed through areas with little or no existing medical infrastructure.  In Europe the railways were safer and infrastructure was generally already in place.  The duties of railway surgeons here was mostly concerned with investigations into accidents and the resulting claims arising from passengers.  In India the railways also faced a lack of existing medical infrastructure and, like the US, had to build it from scratch. [[Indian Railways]] to this day still maintain a network of hospitals.

By the middle of the 20th century railway surgery had lost its separate identity.  The growth of other industries and improving rail safety meant that the railways no longer stood out as a leading cause of injuries.  Likewise, industrial medicine and health and safety became a concern for all industries.  There was no longer a need for an industry-specific branch of medicine.

The primary purpose of railway surgeons was to attend the many injuries to staff and passengers on the railways.  Railway surgeons were also responsible for assessing medical claims against their companies and providing routine medical examinations of employees and applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 255–256, 270, 273&lt;/ref&gt;  Railway surgeons were keen to establish their profession as a separate discipline with unique problems.  For instance, the textbook ''Railway Surgery'', published in 1899, spends a whole chapter on the claim that crushing injuries from the heavy moving equipment on railways is of a kind not found in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Railway surgeons were generally not well paid.  While a chief surgeon or consultant surgeon might attract a good salary, the ordinary doctors working out on the lines were not well rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|US (Rutkow (2010), p. 112 (for US)|''Ind. Med. Gaz.'', '''4''', p. 58 (for India)|Aldrich (2001), p. 287 (for US)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traumatic injuries ===
[[File:Railway surgerys (1899) amputation.png|thumb|left|upright|Amputation at the shoulder from the textbook ''Railway Surgery''.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Rail crashes were common in the 19th century with many deaths and broken bones.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;  In Europe, the majority of injuries were due to collisions, hence passengers rather than employees formed the bulk of the injured.  For instance, in Britain, accidents on the line such as crushing between [[railroad car|wagons]] and being struck by trains (accidents suffered mostly by railway staff) were noted as only the third most common class of injury in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, the railways were significantly more dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Counterintuitively, this led to staff injuries being by far the greatest proportion.  For instance, in 1892 US railroads reported 28,000 injuries to workers compared to 3,200 for passengers.  The most dangerous role was [[brakeman]], whose job included coupling and uncoupling wagons.  The most frequent injury was the brakeman being crushed between wagons while carrying out this task.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  One third of all railway injuries to staff were crushed hands or fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of deaths and injuries grew rapidly as the century progressed.  In the US, the first death occurred in 1831. There were 234 deaths in 1853, the year in which there were eleven major crashes.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1890, there were 6,335 deaths and 35,362 injuries,&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1907 it had reached its peak at nearly 12,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, an early railway death was [[William Huskisson]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Liverpool]], killed during the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK as a whole, deaths and injuries grew much less dramatically than the US.  There were 338 passenger deaths and injuries in 1855 and 435 in 1863, but at the same time passenger numbers were increasing.  From about the middle of this period the ''rate'' of injury started to go down with improving safety—2.85 per million passengers in 1855 to 2.12 in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar picture of low rates pertained in other European countries such as France, Prussia, Belgium and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Many injuries required amputation.  For instance, in 1880 the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] reported 184 crushed limbs, including 85 fractures and fifteen amputations.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt;  The need to perform amputations and other surgery may be why railway surgeons were named ''surgeon'' rather than ''doctor'' or ''physician''.  While traumatic injuries were not the most frequent ailment they had to deal with (that was infectious diseases) it did distinguish them from typical [[general practitioner]]s.  Other influences may have been the comparison to [[ship's surgeon]]s in the age of sail, and the greater status and pay of surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 257, 277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First aid kit]]s and training were introduced at the instigation of Charles Dickson of the [[St. John Ambulance Canada|Canadian St. John Ambulance Association]] and backed by many railway surgeons.  One railway surgeon reported that his fatality rate following amputation more than halved after first aid was introduced.  There was some opposition to first aid through fear that it eroded the professional status of doctors and that local contract railway surgeons would lose the fees they would otherwise have accrued for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by [[World War I]] first aid kits on trains had become widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt;

As the twentieth century progressed, rail safety improved dramatically.  So much so that by 1956 the president of the Association of Surgeons of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], when asked if he saw a lot of accident cases at the company hospital, could reply "yes, I see a lot accidents from the highway" and "[t]he primary purpose of our group has all but passed out of the picture."&lt;ref&gt;Gilmer, pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;  The discipline of railway surgery had been folded into the more general discipline of [[trauma surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;Rutkow (1988), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railway spine ===
[[File:Portrait of John Eric Erichsen FRCS Wellcome L0033899.jpg|thumb|upright|John Eric Erichson]]
An important function of railway surgeons was to control the costs of claims against their companies, leading to conflict of interest regarding treatment of their patients.  For instance, the chief surgeon of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] proudly boasted that he kept claims in the region of 14–35 dollars whereas claims against another railroad were nearly 600 dollars on average.  Company medical staff were also expected to help achieve political aims with expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 266–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent claims were a big concern for railway companies.  Sometimes, these were entirely contrived "accidents" by confidence tricksters; more commonly, however, they were exaggerations of the results of a genuine accident.  In 1906, railway surgeon Willis King claimed that 96% of claimants were actually [[malingering]].&lt;ref&gt;Dembe, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  One common claim that was hotly debated&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|For instance,|Grant (1898)|Bailey (1909)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by railway surgeons was the condition known as ''[[railway spine]]''.  Over a hundred papers were published on the subject in the medical literature for the period 1866–1890.&lt;ref&gt;Dembe, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  In this condition, the patient reports cerebral symptoms such as headache or loss of memory, but there is no visible damage to the spine.  It was first described by Danish-British surgeon [[John Eric Erichsen]].  Erichsen believed the condition was [[physiological]], due to inflammation of the spinal cord.  He compared it to [[meningitis]] which had similar symptoms and a similar cause.  Others, such as [[Herbert W. Page]] (surgeon to the [[London and North Western Railway]]), argued that it was [[psychological]], or else, like [[Arthur Dean Bevan]] (1918 president of the [[American Medical Association]]), outright faked.  Railway surgeons were generally skeptical of the condition and disliked the implication that there was an injury peculiar to just railways.  British surgeon Edwin Morris described the term as "most reprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Bevan claimed to have cured one patient in ten minutes by standing him up and speaking to him forcefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Aldrich (2001), pp. 270–273|Brown, p. 423|May ''et al.'', pp. 524–526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, a number of major train crashes led to parliament passing an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|act]] which compelled rail companies to pay compensation to victims of accidents.  A large proportion of the thousands of resulting claims were for railway spine.  In a five-year period in the 1870s English railway companies paid  £2.2 million ($11 million) in claims for railway spine.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a similar law in Germany, 78% of claims in the period 1871–1879 were for back injury.  Claims for railway spine had subsided by 1900.  From 1890 there were more claims for [[psychosomatic]] conditions such as [[hysteria]] and the [[neurasthenia]] of [[George Miller Beard]] rather than physiological conditions such as railway spine.  Even Erichsen himself agreed that his original cases were actually traumatic neurasthenia.  However, medical concern remained over these emotional damage claims regarding malingering and false claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Dembe, p. 230|Brown, pp. 427–428|Armstrong, pp. 60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and safety ===
Railway companies pioneered the disciplines of [[industrial medicine]] and [[occupational safety and health]].  They were the first organisations to give physical examinations to prospective employees.  The motivation was partly to prevent fraudulent claims for pre-existing conditions, but also to improve rail safety.  The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1884 was the first to do this and had a particularly thorough examination.  They rejected 7% of applicants. [[Colour blindness]] tests were introduced for all employees in most US railway companies in the 1880s because of the need for correct signal recognition. [[Hearing test]]s were also implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt;

Colour blindness tests were a result of the 1875 [[Lagerlunda rail accident]] in Sweden.  The accident was investigated by [[Frithiof Holmgren]] who concluded that the crash was a result of colour blindness of the driver.&lt;ref&gt;Vingrys &amp; Cole, pp. 369–375&lt;/ref&gt;  Holmgren created a test for use in the transportation industry based on matching coloured [[Hank (textile)|skeins of yarn]].  However, Holmgren's test was disliked by employees and there were many complaints of unfairness.  Many companies preferred to test with lamps and flags, but this led to conflict with the railway surgeons who were concerned that non-professionals were administering medical tests.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 273–275&lt;/ref&gt;  Holmgren's identification of colour blindness as the cause of the Swedish crash has also been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Mollon ''et al.'', pp. 178–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Railway companies increasingly improved the health of their employees with preventative measures against disease.  Vaccination schemes were introduced.  Sanitation aboard trains became an issue, as did the quality of water supplies.  In the 1920s the [[Cotton Belt Railroad]] succeeded in cutting hospitalization due to [[malaria]] of its workers from 21.5% to 0.2%.  They did this with a program that included suppressing mosquito populations, preventative [[quinine]] treatment, education, and blood tests.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 279–286&lt;/ref&gt;

== World view ==
Railway surgery was particularly well developed in the US in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.  Early American railroads passed through vast, thinly populated regions with little possibility of finding local medical care.  At the same time American railways were uniquely dangerous.  Accident rates were far higher than European railways.  That, together with difficulty in retaining skilled staff and the risk of legal action by injured passengers resulted in American railway companies developing medical infrastructure and organisations to a degree that was not seen elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), pp. 2, 37, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in risk between the US and Europe was largely driven by economics.  With their higher population densities and shorter routes, European countries carried more freight per mile of track than in the US.  To be profitable, American railways needed to be built and run more cheaply.  This led to a host of safety issues.  American railways were poorly signalled compared to British railways; in the US there were no [[signal box]]es, instead signalling was largely the responsibility of staff on board trains.  Rails were laid on thin beds and badly secured leading to many derailments.  Most tracks in Europe were double tracks whereas in the US they were usually single track.  Poor control of single-track rails led to many collisions.  There was no fencing on American tracks, leading to many collisions with people and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), pp. 10–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, railway companies in other countries had railway surgeons.  In Australia and Canada railway surgeons were appointed during the construction of major lines in remote regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|For instance,|Lowe, pp. 422–423|Parker, vol. 1, p. 337}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British companies employed railway surgeons as consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|For instance, for Bond see,|''Times'' obit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, only in the US were railway surgeons employed in such large numbers and as such an organised discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;  India is perhaps the closest to the US in widespread use of railway surgeons which continues to this day, but there they never seem to have organised themselves as a discipline with professional associations until the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Madan, p. 228|''Hindu''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
[[File:Sofie Herzog in her office.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sofie Herzog]], the only female railway surgeon ever appointed in the US]]
Construction of railways in the US began in 1828, becoming significant by 1840. By 1900 the railways were the largest US industry employing over a million, far more than any other dangerous occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Many thousands of injuries occurred on these railroads throughout the 19th century.  From 1850 until World War I American railroad companies started to develop their own medical arrangements in order to retain workers, care for their passengers and injured third parties, and avoid legal action.  The earliest example of a company railroad surgeon was James P. Quinn&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1834, but the practice did not become widespread until the 1850s.  By the end of the 1850s most companies had some kind of medical service.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Aldrich (2001), p. 255, 257|Gilmer, p. 423|Daniels, p. xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal claims for compensation in the nineteenth century under [[tort]] laws were weaker than under twentieth century compensation laws.  Railroad workers (the majority of injuries) were not usually able to claim.  Nor were trespassers on railway property.  Passengers, however, were able to claim, but payments were low and few victims got anything compared to modern standards.  Nevertheless, the large number of crashes still led to a substantial number of legal actions.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 355, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

These organisations pioneered industrial medical care and predated the provision of medical care in manufacturing industries (although some mining companies did so).  Railway surgery was an important sector of the medical profession; by World War I railway organisations employed 14,000 doctors, some 10% of the US total.  Railway surgery operated outside of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) which railway surgeons were not permitted to join.  Many in the medical profession opposed company doctors altogether on the grounds of ethical conflict between the needs of the patient and the needs of the company.  The AMA also disliked the practice of doctors bidding for local contracts with the railway companies as this also introduced commercial pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Aldrich (2001), pp. 256, 264|Rutkow (2010), pp. 111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early medical arrangements on the railroads were informal.  The [[Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad]] in particular had no formal contracts as late as the 1870s.  This led to many disputes over payment.  By the 1880s, however, all railroads had more formal arrangements.  They appointed a salaried chief surgeon and the larger ones had salaried regional surgeons as well.  Local doctors were paid according to fixed fees under contract.  In the West, the lack of existing medical facilities led to employee-funded hospitals.  The first of these was set up by the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] around 1867 and modelled on the US [[Marine Hospital Service]].  It was funded by a fixed deduction from all employees, except Chinese employees, who were excluded from the service.  A different kind of arrangement was the [[Mutual organization|mutual benefit society]].  The first of these was set up by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad in 1880 following the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]].  Other railroads started to follow this model, partly because of its effect of dampening industrial strife.  By World War I about 30% (around two million) of railroad workers were members.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), pp. 257–263, 288&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1896 there were twenty-five railway hospitals run by thirteen different railway companies.  Between them they treated 165,000 patients annually.  Some of these hospitals became important [[teaching hospital]]s and generally they were all well financed and well equipped.&lt;ref&gt;Rutkow (2010), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I railway surgery began to decline as a separate discipline.  It lost its political influence in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] as industry, including the railroads, reduced their involvement in health care for their workers.&lt;ref&gt;Rutkow (2002), p. 624&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time accident risks were steadily falling.  Between 1890 and 1940 risks for passengers and workers fell by 90% and 80% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Great Britain ==
[[File:Drthomasbond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Thomas Bond (surgeon)|Thomas Bond]], railway surgeon to the [[Great Western Railway]]]]
The first inter-city railway passenger service in the world was the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], opened in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre-Brown, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1860, the UK had 10,000 miles of track and employed 180,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being the pioneer, British railways (and European railways in general) were much safer than American lines and consequently had fewer injuries, although early injury rates were still high by modern standards.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2006), pp. 2, 10, 40&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, British lines did not pass through vast, thinly populated regions.  Medical infrastructure was already well developed in the country.  Railway companies still employed surgeons.  Page at the London and North Western has already been mentioned.  Another example is [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]] who was retained as surgeon by both the [[Great Eastern Railway|Great Eastern]] and [[Great Western Railway]]s.  However, Bond's function for the railways was primarily as medico-legal consultant regarding injury claims rather than practical surgery.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' obit.&lt;/ref&gt;  He did, however, treat the injured of an overturned train on which he was himself a passenger.  Bond's last major work for the railways was investigations in connection with the [[Slough rail accident]] of 1900.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancet'' obit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bond also wrote a lengthy article on railway injuries for Heath's ''Dictionary of Practical Surgery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|''Times'' obit.|Bond, p. 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a similar picture with James O. Fletcher, surgeon to the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway|Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire]] and [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]s, who wrote the book ''Railways in Their Medical Aspects''.  Fletcher's book discusses numerous cases where he examined or treated patients post-surgery and discusses medico-legal issues at length.  However, he does not cite a single example of his own, or railway colleagues, emergency surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher (1867)&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
[[File:DRH Front.jpg|thumb|left|Divisional railway hospital, [[Golden Rock, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]]]]
Railways in India began to be built during the [[British India]] period.  The first passenger service opened between [[Mumbai]] and [[Thane]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan ''et al.'', p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  As in many parts of the US, there was no pre-existing medical infrastructure.  Medical facilities had to be entirely provided by the railways themselves.  This, along with other social needs, led to the establishment of railway "colonies" to house the railway workers and their families.  For instance, the railway colony of [[Jamalpur, Bihar|Jamalpur]] was established in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Bear, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1869, one railway surgeon and four assistants were employed at Jamalpur by the [[East Indian Railway Company]] to cover the 800 inhabitants of the colony and over 200 miles of railway line.  This section had around 200 accidents per year to deal with but that was not their only duty.  They also acted as [[general practitioner]]s for the colony, including attending at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Ind. Med. Gaz.'', '''4''', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1956, the railways had established 80 hospitals and 426 dispensaries.  Additionally, mobile railway surgeons served railway staff posted along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Madan, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;  This infrastructure of railway colonies, medical staff, and hospitals is still maintained by the railways.  A major example of a railway colony is the colony at [[Kharagpur]], West Bengal, established 1898–1900.&lt;ref&gt;Bear, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  It serves one of the largest railway workshops in India.&lt;ref&gt;Desai ''et al.'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  A major example of a railway hospital is the [[Southern Railway Headquarters Hospital, Chennai|Southern Railway Headquarters Hospital]] at [[Chennai]]. [[Southern Railway zone|Southern Railway]] also maintain divisional hospitals such as the [[Divisional Railway Hospital, Golden Rock]] as do the other zones of [[Indian Railways]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/health/health_1.jsp Indian Railways: Health Directorate: Facilities], accessed and [https://www.webcitation.org/6zTZkH4Db archived] 16 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hospital train ==
[[File:hospital car, Florida.png|thumb|A hospital car belonging to [[Plant System]] in Florida, view looking into the operating theatre]]

[[Hospital train]]s were in use early in the railway age, but usually in wartime, starting in the [[Crimean War]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Raugh, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;  For normal civilian use, they were a fairly late development in the railway surgery period.  In the US, a hospital car came into use on several railways that could be coupled to a train to transport the surgeon and staff to the scene of an incident along with all the required equipment.  It contained an [[operating theatre]] and a number of beds for patients in a [[recovery room]].  Hospital cars significantly improved the outcomes for victims.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;  These mobile hospitals were the forerunner of the US Army's [[Mobile army surgical hospital (United States)|mobile army surgical hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rutkow (2010), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Railways introduced the [[Lifeline Express]] hospital train in 1991.  Its purpose was to serve the needs of rural poor in India.  In 2007 a modernised hospital train, the New Lifeline Express replaced it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8ugDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT10 ''Pratiyogita Darpan''], p. 376, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals and organisations ==
From the 1880s onwards specific societies were formed for railway surgery.  The first of these was the Surgical Society of the Wabash, formed in 1881 and organised by the chief surgeon of the [[Wabash Railroad]].  The inaugural meeting had only twenty-two attendees with two papers presented.  This was soon followed by many other company centred organisations.  The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] organisation was the prime mover in forming the [[National Association of Railway Surgeons]] (NARS) in 1888.  The inaugural meeting had two hundred attendees and by 1891 the membership had grown to nearly a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich (2001), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;  However, NARS was short-lived, dying out in the 1920s as industrial expansion caused the railways to no longer be unique in their medical needs.  Nevertheless, there were still practising railway surgeons for some time after this.&lt;ref&gt;Rutkow (2010), pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1891, the journal ''[[Railway Age]]'' began a column on railway surgery, including the proceedings of NARS.  The editor, R. Harvey Reed, was a [[charter member]] of NARS but left to form the more exclusive [[American Academy of Railway Surgeons]].  The two organisations remained rivals until 1904 when they merged to form the [[American Association of Railway Surgeons]] (AARS).  The ''[[Railway Surgeon]]'' was launched in 1894 and took over from ''Railway Age'' as the official journal of NARS, but it also carried articles from the American Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Aldrich (2001), p. 265|Rutkow (2002), p. 624|Smith, p. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the official journal of NARS, 1894–1897; of the [[International Association of Railway Surgeons]], 1897–1904; and of the AARS, 1904–1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{NLM catalog|118756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changing names and affiliations of the ''Railway Surgeon'' across the years reflects the absorption of railway surgery into the more general occupational health and the spread of industrial medicine.  ''Railway Surgeon'' (1894–1904), became ''Railway Surgical Journal'' (1904–1921),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; became ''Surgical Journal Devoted to Traumatic and Industrial Surgery'' (1921–1929),&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|{{NLM catalog|118756}}||Smith, p. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; absorbed by ''International Journal of Medicine and Surgery'' (1923–1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{NLM catalog|13601}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Industrial Medicine'' (1932–1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{NLM catalog|414124}}&lt;/ref&gt; became ''International Journal of Industrial Medicine and Surgery'' (1935–1949), became ''''Industrial Medicine and Surgery'' (1949–1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|{{NLM catalog|414125}}|Smith, p. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; became ''IMS, Industrial Medicine and Surgery'' (1968–1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{NLM catalog|414123}}&lt;/ref&gt; became ''The International Journal of Occupational Health and Safety'' (1974–1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|{{NLM catalog|7910014}}|Smith, p. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; became ''Occupational Health and Safety'' (1976–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|{{NLM catalog|7610574}}|Smith, p. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Erichsen and "railway spine" was particularly strident in the US with NARS and its journal, the ''Railway Surgeon'' leading the attack.  So much effort was devoted to discrediting the condition as medically valid that one writer claimed the issue was the reason for existence of the association.  Prominent in NARS for speaking out against Erichsen was [[Warren Bell Outten]], chief surgeon for the Missouri Pacific Railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Brown, p. 424|Welke, p. 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the [[Association of Railway Surgeons of India]] held its first annual meeting in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|intensity ratios|Reflectance}}
In [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]] the '''reflection coefficient''' is a parameter that describes how much of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is reflected by an impedance discontinuity in the transmission medium.  It is equal to the ratio of the [[amplitude]] of the reflected wave to the incident wave, with each expressed as [[phasor]]s.  For example, it is used in [[optics]] to calculate the amount of light that is reflected from a surface with a different index of refraction, such as a glass surface, or in an electrical [[transmission line]] to calculate how much of the [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|electromagnetic wave]] is reflected by an impedance. The reflection coefficient is closely related to the ''[[transmission coefficient]]''. The [[reflectance]] of a system is also sometimes called a "reflection coefficient".

[[Image:Partial transmittance.gif|right|frame|A wave experiences partial transmittance and partial reflectance when the medium through which it travels suddenly changes.  The reflection coefficient determines the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude.]]

Different specialties have different applications for the term.

== Telecommunications ==
{{see also|Reflections of signals on conducting lines|Signal reflection}}

In [[telecommunication]]s, the reflection coefficient is the [[ratio]] of the [[complex amplitude]] of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave.  In particular, at a discontinuity in a [[transmission line]], it is the [[complex number|complex]] ratio of the [[electric field]] strength of the reflected wave (&lt;math&gt;E^-&lt;/math&gt;) to that of the incident wave (&lt;math&gt;E^+&lt;/math&gt;).  This is typically represented with a &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; (capital [[gamma]]) and can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{E^-}{E^+} &lt;/math&gt;

The reflection coefficient may also be established using other field or [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] quantities. 

The reflection coefficient of a load is determined by its impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_L\,&lt;/math&gt;(load impedance) and the impedance toward the source &lt;math&gt;Z_S\,&lt;/math&gt;(source impedance).

[[Image:Reflection Coefficient Circuit.svg|thumb|right|Simple circuit configuration showing measurement location of reflection coefficient.]]

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = {Z_L - Z_S\over Z_L + Z_S}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that a negative reflection coefficient means that the reflected wave receives a 180°, or &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, phase shift.

The [[Absolute value|magnitude]] (designated by vertical bars) of the reflection coefficient can be calculated from the [[standing wave ratio]], &lt;math&gt;SWR&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;| \Gamma | = {SWR-1 \over SWR+1}&lt;/math&gt;

The reflection coefficient is displayed graphically using a [[Smith chart]].

== Seismology ==

{{main|Reflection seismology}}
Reflection coefficient is used in feeder testing for reliability of medium.

== Optics and microwaves ==
{{main|Fresnel equations}}
In [[optics]] and electromagnetics in general, "reflection coefficient" can refer to either the amplitude reflection coefficient described here, or the [[reflectance]], depending on context. Typically, the reflectance is represented by a capital ''R'', while the amplitude reflection coefficient is represented by a lower-case ''r''.These related concepts are covered by [[Fresnel equations]] in [[Optics#Classical_optics|classical optics]].

== Acoustics ==
{{main|Acoustic wave}}
Acousticians use reflection coefficients to understand the effect of different materials on their acoustic environments.

== Types ==

=== Command-line (text) ===

In early [[operating system]]s, such as [[MS-DOS]], which employed [[command-line interface]]s (&lt;abbr&gt;CLI&lt;/abbr&gt;s), the screen display consisted of [[Character (computing)|characters]] [[Memory-mapped I/O|mapping]] directly to a [[screen buffer]] in [[Computer memory|memory]] and a [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] position. Input was by keyboard. All this information could therefore be obtained from the system either by [[hooking]] the flow of information around the system and reading the screen buffer or by using a standard hardware output socket&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the 1980s, the Research Centre for the Education of the Visually Handicapped (&lt;abbr&gt;RCEVH&lt;/abbr&gt;) at the [[University of Birmingham]] developed Screen Reader for the [[BBC Micro]] and &lt;!--abbr?--&gt;NEC Portable.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Blenkhorn, "The &lt;abbr&gt;RCEVH&lt;/abbr&gt; project on micro-computer systems and computer assisted learning", British Journal of Visual Impairment, 4/3, 101-103 (1986).

=== Graphical ===

==== Off-screen models ====

With the arrival of [[graphical user interface]]s (&lt;abbr&gt;GUI&lt;/abbr&gt;s), the situation became more complicated. A &lt;abbr&gt;GUI&lt;/abbr&gt; has characters and graphics drawn on the screen at particular positions, and therefore there is no purely textual representation of the graphical contents of the display. Screen readers were therefore forced to see employ new low-level techniques, gathering messages from the [[operating system]] and using these to build up an "off-screen model", a representation of the display in which the required text content is stored.&lt;ref&gt;According to "[ftp://service.boulder.ibm.com/sns/sr-os2/sr2doc/guitalk.txt Making the &lt;abbr&gt;GUI&lt;/abbr&gt; Talk]" (by Richard Schwerdtfeger, ''BYTE'' December 1991, p. 118-128), the first screen reader to build an off-screen model was outSPOKEN.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the operating system might send messages to draw a command button and its caption. These messages are intercepted and used to construct the off-screen model. The user can switch between controls (such as buttons) available on the screen and the captions and control contents will be read aloud and/or shown on refreshable [[Braille]] display.

Screen readers can also communicate information on menus, controls, and other visual constructs to permit blind users to interact with these constructs. However, maintaining an off-screen model is a significant technical challenge; hooking the low-level messages and maintaining an accurate model are both difficult tasks.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==== Accessibility APIs ====

Operating system and application designers have attempted to address these problems by providing ways for screen readers to access the display contents without having to maintain an off-screen model. These involve the provision of alternative and accessible representations of what is being displayed on the screen accessed through an &lt;abbr&gt;[[Application programming interface|API]]&lt;/abbr&gt;. Existing &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;s include:
* Android Accessibility Framework&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.android.com/training/accessibility/index.html Implementing Accessibility on Android].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apple Accessibility &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/Reference/AccessibilityLowlevel/index.html Apple Accessibility &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AT-SPI]]
* [[IAccessible2]]
* [[Microsoft Active Accessibility]] (&lt;abbr&gt;MSAA&lt;/abbr&gt;)
* [[Microsoft UI Automation]]
* [[Java Access Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/products/accessbridge/|title=Oracle Technology Network for Java Developers – Oracle Technology Network – Oracle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen readers can query the operating system or application for what is currently being displayed and receive updates when the display changes. For example, a screen reader can be told that the current focus is on a button and the button caption to be communicated to the user. This approach is considerably easier for the developers of screen readers, but fails when applications do not comply with the accessibility &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;: for example, [[Microsoft Word]] does not comply with the &lt;abbr&gt;MSAA&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;, so screen readers must still maintain an off-screen model for Word or find another way to access its contents.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} One approach is to use available operating system messages and application object models to supplement accessibility &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;s. The Thunder screen reader operates without an off-screen model in this way; the latest version of Thunder also includes an off-screen model.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Screen readers can be assumed to be able to access all display content that is not intrinsically inaccessible. Web browsers, word processors, icons and windows and email programs are just some of the applications used successfully by screen reader users. However, according to some users,{{Who|date=January 2015}} using a screen reader is considerably more difficult than using a GUI, and many applications have specific problems resulting from the nature of the application (e.g. animations in Macromedia Flash) or failure to comply with accessibility standards for the platform (e.g. Microsoft Word and Active Accessibility).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Self-voicing programs and applications ===

Some programs and applications have voicing technology built in alongside their primary functionality. These programs are termed [[self-voicing]] and can be a form of [[assistive technology]] if they are designed to remove the need to use a screen reader.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Cloud-based ===

Some telephone services allow users to interact with the internet remotely. For example, TeleTender can read web pages over the phone and does not require special programs or devices on the user side.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Web-based ===

A relatively new development in the field is web-based applications like Spoken-Web that act as web portals, managing content like news updates, weather, science and business articles for visually-impaired or blind computer users.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Other examples are ReadSpeaker or [[BrowseAloud]] that add [[text-to-speech]] functionality to web content.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The primary audience for such applications is those who have difficulty reading because of learning disabilities or language barriers.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Although functionality remains limited compared to equivalent desktop applications, the major benefit is to increase the accessibility of said websites when viewed on public machines where users do not have permission to install custom software, giving people greater "freedom to roam".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

With the development of [[smartphone]]s, the ability to listen to written documents (textual web content, &lt;abbr&gt;[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]&lt;/abbr&gt; documents, e-mails etc.) while driving or during a similar activity in the same way that listening to music, will benefit a much broader audience than visually-impaired people.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The best-known examples are [[Siri (software)|Siri]] for [[iOS]], and [[Google Now]] and [[Iris (software)|Iris]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. With the release of the [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Galaxy S III]], [[Samsung]] also introduced a similar [[intelligent personal assistant]] called [[S Voice]]. On the [[BlackBerry 10 operating system voice control|BlackBerry 10 operating system]], their [[BlackBerry Z30|Z30 smartphone]] also features spoken interaction features, which are similar to the other [[mobile operating system]]s.{{citation needed| date= October 2013| reason= Similarity unverified.}}

This functionality depends on the quality of the software but also on a logical structure of the text. Use of headings, punctuation, presence of alternate attributes for images, etc. is crucial for a good vocalization. Also a web site may have a nice look because of the use of appropriate two dimensional positioning with CSS but its standard linearization, for example, by suppressing any CSS and Javascript in the browser may not be comprehensible.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Customization ==

Most screen readers allow the user to select whether most [[punctuation]] is announced or silently ignored. Some screen readers can be tailored to a particular application through [[script (computing)|'''scripting''']]. One advantage of scripting is that it allows customizations to be shared among users, increasing accessibility for all. &lt;abbr&gt;[[Job Access With Speech|JAWS]]&lt;/abbr&gt; enjoys an active script-sharing community, for example.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Verbosity ===

Verbosity is a feature of screen reading software that supports vision-impaired computer users. Speech verbosity controls enable users to choose how much speech feedback they wish to hear. Specifically, verbosity settings allow users to construct a mental model of web pages displayed on their computer screen. Based on verbosity settings, a screen-reading program informs users of certain formatting changes, such as when a frame or table begins and ends, where graphics have been inserted into the text, or when a list appears in the document.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Language ===

Some screen readers can read text in more than one [[Language|language]], provided that the language of the material is encoded in its [[Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard|metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/yahoo-search-results-now-natural-language-support-7318.html|title=Yahoo! search results now with natural language support|date=March 13, 2008|author=Chris Heilmann|work=[[Yahoo! Developer Network]] Blog|accessdate=February 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125024422/http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/03/yahoo_search_re.html|archivedate=January 25, 2009|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some screen reading programs{{Which|date=January 2015}} also include language verbosity, which automatically detects verbosity settings related to speech output language. For example, if a user navigated to a website based in the United Kingdom, the text would be read with an English accent.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The company has been serving the amusement industry for 30 years, through three operating divisions: Attractions Development; Content Licensing, Production &amp; Distribution; and Technology/Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.attractionsmanagement.com/detail.cfm?pagetype=detail&amp;subject=profile&amp;codeID=887&lt;/ref&gt;

SimEx Inc. is the parent company of SimEx-Iwerks Entertainment. The company is based in Toronto, Canada with additional locations in Baltimore, Maryland; and Santa Clarita, California.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=124317&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the merger of '''SimEx Inc.''' and '''Iwerks Entertainment Inc.''' in 2002, the company traded under the name “SimEx-Iwerks Entertainment” with its Head Office in Toronto and Iwerks offices in Baltimore and Los Angeles.

SimEx origins lie with the creation by Michael Needham, Shiori Sudo and Moses Znaimer of Tour of the Universe™(1984) at the CN Tower, Toronto. Tour of the Universe was the world’s first major Simulator Attraction, which inspired many motion ride Attractions. In the 1980s SimEx and Iwerks developed their own separate visions for Motion Ride Attractions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/ccc/srch/nvgt.do?lang=eng&amp;prtl=1&amp;sbPrtl=&amp;estblmntNo=901302380000&amp;profile=cmpltPrfl&amp;profileId=1461&amp;app=sold&amp;searchNav=F&lt;/ref&gt;

Toronto based SimEx developed a series of Attraction products using innovative and patented motion systems provided by Moog Inc. of East Aurora, NY. Moog’s technology integrated novel electromechanical actuators with solid-state control systems to create a variety of attraction platforms.

In 1996, SimEx launched SimEx Virtual Voyages™, a 15-minute Attraction that follows a 3-stage storyline: Introduction (pre-show); Plot Development (story theater); and Climax (The Ride). Over 40 SimEx Virtual Voyages™ Attractions were built worldwide.

Los Angeles based Iwerks developed innovative 8/70 projection technologies for Extreme Screen™ Theaters and two-seat motion systems (TurboRide™). In 1998, Iwerks Co-founder Don Iwerks was awarded the prestigious Gordon E. Sawyer Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences in recognition of his lifetime of contribution to the science and technology of motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwerks.com/Default.asp?id=8&amp;l=1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Iwerks launched its Iwerks Extreme Screen™ Brand that became the leading Brand for 8/70 Screen Theaters. In the same year, the Iwerks 8/70 Linear Loop® projection system was recognized for its industry leading technology with an Academy Award® for Scientific and Technical Achievement.

In 2001, SimEx acquired assets from the RideFilm™ Division of Imax® Corporation and in 2002, SimEx merged with Iwerks Entertainment.

In 2003, SimEx-Iwerks designed the first full-motion 4-D seat for Universal Studio’s Shrek 4-D Attractions in Hollywood, Orlando and Osaka.

SimEx-Iwerks continues to be an innovator in digital systems, film creation, 3-D projection, 4-D special effects and as a partner provides ongoing operating and marketing support to numerous attractions.

==Iwerks Entertainment Inc.==

'''''History'''''

'''Iwerks Entertainment Inc.''' is an American [[film studio]] founded in 1985 in [[Burbank, California]], by [[Academy Award|Oscar]] winner and [[Disney Legend]] [[Don Iwerks]] and [[Stan Kinsey]], both former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] Executives. The company was named to honor Don's father, [[Ub Iwerks]], who was [[Walt Disney]]'s first business partner and co-creator of [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/3119274/mickey-mouse-ub-iwerks-cartoon/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Iwerks Entertainment became well known as a leading developer of special venues and films, and [[virtual reality]] [[theatre]]s throughout the world.

In late 1999, Iwerks Entertainment acquired the assets of McFadden Systems. In 1992, [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] approached McFadden to develop a motion simulator for ''[[Batman Adventure – The Ride]]''.&lt;ref name="Virtual Rides Take Off"&gt;{{cite news|last=Huffstutter|first=P.J.|title=Virtual Rides Take Off|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/04/business/fi-19217|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later motion systems were built for [[Star Trek: The Experience]], [[London Trocadero]].

As of Dec 2017, Iwerks Entertainment, Inc. is a dominant force in 4D and special effects film production and distribution, operates from offices in Santa Clarita CA as a subsidiary of SimEx Inc., and trades under its own name and as SimEx-Iwerks.

'''''Academy Awards'''''

Iwerks Entertainment has received two [[Academy Awards]] by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for Scientific and Technical Achievement.

The first occurred in 1998 at the [[70th Academy Awards]] show, where founder Don Iwerks was awarded the [[Gordon E. Sawyer Award]], given each year to "an individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NNDB|title=Oscar, Gordon E. Sawyer Award|url=http://www.nndb.com/honors/648/000063459/|publisher=Soylent Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fact for the Day|title=This Day in Disney History|url=http://thisdayindisneyhistory.homestead.com/mar23.html|publisher=The Walt Disney Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second occurred in 1999 at the [[71st Academy Awards]] show, where the company was awarded an [[Academy Award]] for a technical innovation called the Iwerks 8/70 Linear Loop projection system.

[[File:Master clock system.png|thumb|260px|Diagram of electric time system used around 1910 to keep time in factories, schools, and other large institutions.  The [[master clock]] ''(bottom center)'', controlled by a temperature-compensated mercury pendulum, is wired to slave clocks throughout the building.  In addition to wall clocks, it also controls time stamps that are used to stamp documents with the time, and a turret clock used in a clock tower. The "program clock" is a timer that can be programmed with punched paper tape to ring bells or turn machines on and off at preprogrammed times.]]

In [[telecommunication]] and [[horology]], a '''slave clock''' is a [[clock]] that depends for its accuracy on another clock, a [[master clock]].  Many modern clocks are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) based on a network of master [[atomic clocks]] in many countries.  For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few [[nanoseconds]] by dedicated satellite channels.  Slave clock synchronization is usually achieved by [[Phase (waves)|phase]]-locking the slave [[clock signal]] to a signal received from the master clock.  To adjust for the transit [[time]] of the signal from the master clock to the slave clock, the phase of the slave clock may be adjusted with respect to the signal from the master clock so that both clocks are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both clocks, at the output of the clocks, occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the computer era, the term referred to electrical [[clock]]s that are synchronized periodically by an electrical pulse through dedicated wiring issued by a [[master clock]] in the same building.  From the late 19th to the mid 20th centuries, electrical master/slave clock systems were widely used in public buildings and business offices, with all the clocks in the building synchronized through electric wires to a central master clock.   These older styles of slave clocks either keep time by themselves, and are periodically corrected by the master clock, or require impulses from the master clock to advance. Many slave clocks of these types remain in operation, most commonly in schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5291">In [[explosive material]]s, '''strength''' is the parameter determining the ability of the explosive to move the surrounding material. It is related to the total gas yield of the reaction, and the amount of heat produced. ''Cf.'' [[brisance]].

The strength, or ''potential'', of an explosive is the total [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that can be performed by the gas resulting from its explosion, when expanded [[adiabatic process|adiabatically]] from its original volume, until its pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure and its temperature to 15°C. The potential is therefore the total quantity of heat given off at constant volume when expressed in equivalent work units and is a measure of the strength of the explosive.

Explosive strength is measured by, for example, the [[Trauzl lead block test]].

An explosion may occur under two general conditions: the first, unconfined, as in the open air where the pressure (atmospheric) is constant; the second, confined, as in a closed chamber where the volume is constant. The same amount of heat energy is liberated in each case, but in the unconfined explosion, a certain amount is used as work energy in pushing back the surrounding air, and therefore is lost as heat. In a confined explosion, where the explosive volume is small (such as occurs in the powder chamber of a firearm), practically all the heat of explosion is conserved as useful energy. If the quantity of heat liberated at constant volume under adiabatic conditions is calculated and converted from heat units to equivalent work units, the potential or capacity for work results.

Therefore, if

:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt; represents the total quantity of heat given off by a mole of explosive of 15°C and constant pressure (atmospheric);
:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; represents the total heat given off by a mole of explosive at 15°C and constant volume; and
:''W'' represents the work energy expended in pushing back the surrounding air in an unconfined explosion and thus is not available as net theoretical heat;

Then, because of the conversion of energy to work in the constant pressure case,

:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''

from which the value of ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; may be determined. Subsequently, the potential of a mole of an explosive may be calculated. Using this value, the potential for any other weight of explosive may be determined by simple proportion.

Using the principle of the initial and final state, and heat of formation table (resulting from experimental data), the heat released at constant pressure may be readily calculated.

:''m'' ''n''
:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt; = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;fi&lt;/sub&gt; - ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;fk&lt;/sub&gt;
:1 1

&lt;!-- are there supposed to be two integral signs, or summation signs, here, for the intervals from 1 to ''m'' and from 1 to ''n''?  If so, use math markup to include them --&gt;

where:

:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;fi&lt;/sub&gt; = heat of formation of product i at constant pressure
:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;fk&lt;/sub&gt; = heat of formation of reactant k at constant pressure
:''v'' = number of moles of each product/reactants (''m'' is the number of products and ''n'' the number of reactants)

The work energy expended by the gaseous products of detonation is expressed by:

:''W'' = ''P dv''

With pressure constant and negligible initial volume, this expression reduces to:

:''W'' = ''P·V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Since heats of formation are calculated for standard atmospheric pressure (101&amp;nbsp;325 Pa, where 1 Pa = 1 N/m²) and 15°C, V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume occupied by the product gases under these conditions. At this point

:''W''/mol = (101&amp;nbsp;325 N/m²)(23.63 l/mol)(1 m³/1000 l) = 2394 N·m/mol = 2394 J/mol

and by applying the appropriate conversion factors, work can be converted to units of kilocalories.

:''W''/mol = 0.572 kcal/mol

Once the chemical reaction has been balanced, one can calculate the volume of gas produced and the work of expansion. With this completed, the calculations necessary to determine potential may be accomplished.

For TNT:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 6CO + 2.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.5N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C

for 10 mol

Then:

:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt; = 6(26.43) – 16.5 = 142.08 kcal/mol

Note: Elements in their natural state (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C, etc.) are used as the basis for heat of formation tables and are assigned a value of zero. See table 12-2.

:''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; = 142.08 + 0.572(10) = 147.8 kcal/mol

As previously stated, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; converted to equivalent work units is the potential of the explosive. (MW = Molecular Weight of Explosive)

:Potential = ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; kcal/mol × 4185 J/kcal × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g/kg × 1 mol/(mol·g)
:Potential = ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt; (4.185 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) J/(mol·kg)

For [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]],

:Potential = 147.8 (4.185 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)/227.1 = 2.72 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; J/kg

Rather than tabulate such large numbers, in the field of explosives, TNT is taken as the standard explosive, and others are assigned strengths relative to that of TNT. The potential of TNT has been calculated above to be 2.72 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; J/kg. Relative strength (RS) may be expressed as

:R.S. = Potential of Explosive/(2.72 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">[[Image:telephonoscope.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Early '''videophone-television''' concept by George du Maurier]]

A '''telephonoscope''' was an early concept of [[videophone]] and [[television]], conceptualized in the late 1870s through the 1890s.  It was mentioned in various early science fiction works such as ''[[Le Vingtième siècle. La vie électrique]]'' (''The Twentieth Century: The Electrical Life'') and other works written by [[Albert Robida]].  It was also sketched in various cartoons by [[George du Maurier]] as a fictional invention by [[Thomas Edison]] including one made on December 9, 1878 in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/Edison_Telephonoscope.htm Telephonoscope, A Cartoon of a Television/Videophone] Terramedia website;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George du Maurier (1878) ''Punch'' magazine, December 9th, 1878;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Burns: "Television: An International History", ''Distant vision (c 1880-1920)'', p. 78-84;&lt;/ref&gt;

Robida also forecast the era of television broadcasts, with concept art drawn of a televised opera performance, and of a live battlefield report.

'''The Partnership for Excellence''' (formerly the ''Ohio Partnership for Excellence'') is a [[nonprofit organization]] that administers a state-level award program for performance excellence in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. The award is based on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence], which are developed and maintained by the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/about/index.cfm Baldrige Performance Excellence Program], a program of the [https://www.nist.gov/index.html National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)].
__TOC__

==History==
The Ohio Partnership for Excellence was incorporated as a 501c(3) nonprofit organization in 1998 to provide state level Baldrige assessment services and resources for interested organizations. In 2011, it was renamed The Partnership for Excellence (TPE) to reflect regional expansion that includes the states of Indiana and West Virginia.&lt;ref name="regional expansion"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_07-28-11_Program_for_IN_&amp;_WV.htm Ohio Partnership for Excellence to Expand Programs to Indiana &amp; West Virginia], July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first award cycle was completed in 1999-2000.

In January 2008, Dr. Elaine D. Edgar was appointed to Executive Director.&lt;ref name="New Director 2008"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_01-01-08_new_director.htm Announcement of a new Executive Director for the Ohio Partnership for Excellence], January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After retirement from the role in March 2011, she was replaced by Colonel Alfred C. Faber, Jr. who was appointed to the position of President/CEO.&lt;ref name="New Director 2011"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_03-01-11_new_president-CEO.htm New OPE President / CEO Announced], March 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Baldrige Community==
*TPE is a member of the [http://www.baldrigepe.org/alliance/ Alliance for Performance Excellence] – a national network of state and local Baldrige-based awards programs.
*TPE Awards are based on the most recent Criteria for Performance Excellence – updated by the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program every two years.
*Starting in 2012, unless certain conditions are met, organizations from Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia are eligible to apply for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award only if they have been awarded TPE's ''Governor's Award of Excellence'' in the previous five years.&lt;ref name="New Eligibility Q&amp;A 2012"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Q-A_2012_Changes_to_Baldrige_Award_Eligibility.pdf Q&amp;A: 2012 Changes to Baldrige Award Eligibility], December 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eligibility Rules"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/award_application.cfm Baldrige Award Application Forms webpage], retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
TPE is a membership organization composed of interested individuals and organizations throughout Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. TPE collects annual membership dues for the January to December membership year.

==Board of Examiners==
TPE's Board of Examiners is composed of volunteer individuals who successfully complete annual training on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence]. Advisors and examiners used during the awards process are drawn from the Board of Examiners.

==Product/Service==
TPE’s main product is a feedback report to the partnering organizations that successfully complete the award process. The report contains strengths as well as opportunities for improvement (OFI) derived from both the submitted application and a site visit. This is a distinct difference from the national Baldrige Award process&lt;ref name="Baldrige Application Form"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Baldrige_Award_Application_Forms.pdf Baldrige Award Application Form], page 2&lt;/ref&gt; where only organizations with highly graded applications are granted a site visit.

TPE also provides Baldrige-related educational services such as conferences, seminars, and direct partnering with individuals and organizations.

==TPE Awards Process==
TPE provides three options for organizations wanting to improve their organizational performance:

===Advising===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to review the Criteria for Performance Excellence and assist in developing a 5-page Organizational Profile. After review of the organizational profile, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Spirit" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Partnering===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to develop a 25-page application addressing the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence at the "overall" level. After review of this application, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Pioneer" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Examining===
This is the traditional 50-page application assessment mirroring the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award's assessment cycle. Organizations participating in this option submit an ''Intent to Apply'' in October before the application due date in December each year. TPE assigns a team of 7 members from the Board of Examiners to review (independently and then by consensus) the application before a 3-day site visit is conducted. TPE then provides the organization with a list of strength and opportunities for improvement. Based on the recommendations of the examiners, TPE's Board of Trustees recognizes each organization with a Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum Award at the annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.
:*Platinum Level - Also called the ''Governor's Award for Excellence''
:*Gold Level - Also called the ''Achievement of Excellence'' Award
:*Silver Level - Also called the ''Commitment to Excellence'' Award
:*Bronze Level - Also called the ''Pledge to Excellence'' Award
:*In 2007, TPE also recognized two organizations with the ''Executive Director's Special Distinction'' award.

==Past ''Platinum Level - Governor's Award for Excellence'' Award Recipients==
Note:
*The Partnership for Excellence does not necessarily recognize an organization at the Platinum level every year. Awards may have been given at the Gold, Silver, or Bronze Levels only (not listed here).

'''''The Way Things Work''''' is a 1988 children's book by [[David Macaulay]] with technical text by [[Neil Ardley]]. It is an entertaining introduction to everyday [[machine]]s, describing machines as simple as [[lever]]s and [[gear]]s and as complicated as [[radio telescope]]s and [[automatic transmission]]s. Every page consists primarily of one or more large diagrams describing the operation of the relevant machine. These diagrams are informative but playful, in that most show the machines operated, used upon, or represented by [[woolly mammoth]]s, and are accompanied by anecdotes of the mammoths' (fictive) role in the operation. The book's concept was later developed into a short-lived animated [[The Way Things Work (TV series)|TV show]] (produced by [[Millimages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millimages.com/site/tv/prod.php?lang=en&amp;tv_id=6 |title=Television - THE WAY THINGS WORK |date=18 November 2008 |publisher=millimages.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118015449/http://www.millimages.com/site/tv/prod.php?lang=en&amp;tv_id=6 |archivedate=18 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed by [[Schlessinger Media]]), a [[Dorling Kindersley]] interactive CD-ROM, and a [[board game]]. A family "ride" involving [[animatronics]] and a [[3-D film]] based on the book was one of the original attractions at the [[San Francisco]] [[Metreon]], but closed in 2001.

==''The New Way Things Work''==
A newer version, ''The New Way Things Work'', (released on October 26, 1998,) contains additional text on the workings of computers and digital technology.  It also lacks two pages of the first edition; both of which demonstrated the working of a mechanical coin-operated parking meter.

==''The Way Things Work Now''==
A substantially revised edition, ''The Way Things Work Now'', has been published in October 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Dorling Kindersley.

{{Nihongo|'''Uniden Holdings Corporation'''|ユニデンホールディングス株式会社|Yuniden Hôrudingusu Kabushiki-gaisha}} ({{Tyo|6815}}) is a Japanese company in the [[wireless communication]] industry.

==History==
Uniden was established on February 7, 1966 by its founder Hidero Fujimoto as "Uni Electronics Corp". '''Uniden''' became a well-known brand in the 1970s by manufacturing and marketing millions of [[Citizens Band|CB]] radios, under the Uniden brand as well as many for popular private brand labels such as '''Realistic''', '''Clegg (amateur transceivers), Cobra, Craig, Fanon-Courier, Midland (only certain clone models, originals were made by Cybernet), President, Teaberry, Stalker, Super Star, Teledyne-Olson, Pearce Simpson, Regency, Robyn''' and many European brands such as '''Zodiac, Stabo''' and '''Inno-Hit.'''  Uniden also marketed CB Radios in the UK under the '''Uniden''' and '''Uniace''' brands during the late 1970s.

During the 1980s, Uniden grew to become the world's largest manufacturer of [[cordless telephone]]s in addition to television satellite equipment, mobile radios, advanced [[marine electronics]] and [[Scanner (radio)|radio scanners]] (the latter under brandname [[Bearcat (radio)|Bearcat]]).

In [[Europe]], it became successful in the telecommunications market with its introduction of 900&amp;nbsp;MHz cordless telephones.

As Uniden continued to grow and extend its international operations, Uniden Australia and Uniden New Zealand were established in 1989. The company now offers an extensive range of consumer electronic products including Digital Cordless Phones and the top selling [[XDECT]], SCR, [[WDECT]] and DSS technology Cordless phones, [[Transceiver]] Radios and Scanning Receivers, Wireless Networking Products and [[GPS]] Products. The company has just announced it will be selling [[bluetooth]] car kits, HD Set Top Boxes, Laser Pocket Projectors, HD Digital Photo Frame and Wireless Power Accessories (most of which have been withdrawn from market due to poor sales).

==Private Brand Labels==
Most cordless phones with the [[Radio Shack]] brand name are Uniden models that are sold under the Radio Shack brand. Most of the cordless phone brands sold in the world (e.g. Philips) are made by Uniden and sold under different electronic brands.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Actual Business==
Uniden's actual line of business is in research and development, manufacturing and marketing.

It produces over two million wireless products every month and manufactures one cordless phone every 3.2 seconds.

Uniden operates globally, but the main commercial activities are still situated in the [[United States]]. Production sites have been located in China, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]].  Uniden has also recently expanded its manufacturing to include [[Vietnam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8925">The '''unified theory of acceptance and use of technology''' ('''UTAUT''') is a [[technology acceptance model]] formulated by Venkatesh and others in "User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003|p= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UTAUT aims to explain user intentions to use an [[information systems|information system]] and subsequent usage behavior. The theory holds that there are four key constructs: 
1) performance expectancy, 
2) effort expectancy, 
3) [[social influence]], and 
4) facilitating conditions.

The first three are direct determinants of usage jon intention and behavior, and the fourth is a direct determinant of user behavior. Gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use are posited to moderate the impact of the four key constructs on usage intention and behavior. The theory was developed through a review and consolidation of the constructs of eight models that earlier research had employed to explain information systems usage behaviour ([[theory of reasoned action]], [[technology acceptance model]], motivational model, [[theory of planned behavior]], a combined theory of planned behavior/technology acceptance model, model of [[personal computer]] use, [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, and [[social cognitive theory]]). Subsequent validation by Venkatesh et al. (2003) of UTAUT in a longitudinal study found it to account for 70% of the variance in Behavioural Intention to Use (BI) and about 50% in actual use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh|first=Viswanath|last2=Morris|first2=Michael G.|last3=Davis|first3=Gordon B.|last4=Davis|first4=Fred D.|date=2003-01-01|title=User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward a Unified View|jstor=30036540|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=27|issue=3|pages=425–478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
* '''Koivumäki ''et al.''' applied UTAUT to study the perceptions of 243 individuals in northern [[Finland]] toward mobile services and technology and found that time spent using the devices did not affect consumer perceptions, but familiarity with the devices and user skills did have an impact.&lt;ref&gt;T. Koivimäki, A. Ristola, and M. Kesti, “The perceptions towards mobile services: An empirical analysis of the role of use facilitators,” Personal &amp; Ubiquitous Computing, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 67–75, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Eckhardt ''et al.''' applied UTAUT to study social influence of workplace referent groups (superiors, colleagues) on intention to adopt technology in 152 German companies and found significant impact of social influence from workplace referents on [[information technology]] adoption.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eckhardt, S. Laumer, and T. Weitzel, “Who influences whom? Analyzing workplace referents’ social influence on IT adoption and non-adoption,” Journal of Information Technology, vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 11–24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Curtis ''et al.''' applied UTAUT to the adoption of [[social media]] by 409 United States nonprofit organizations.  UTAUT had not been previously applied to the use of social media in [[public relations]].  They found that organizations with defined public relations departments are more likely to adopt social media technologies and use them to achieve their organizational goals.  Women considered social media to be beneficial, and men exhibited more confidence in actively utilizing social media.&lt;ref&gt;L. Curtis, C. Edwards, K. L. Fraser, S. Gudelsky, J. Holmquist, K. Thornton, and K. D. Sweetser, “Adoption of social media for public relations by nonprofit organizations,” Public Relations Review, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 90–92, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Verhoeven ''et al.''' applied UTAUT to study computer use frequency in 714 [[university]] freshmen in [[Belgium]] and found that UTAUT was also useful in explaining varying frequencies of computer use and differences in information and communication technology skills in secondary school and in the university.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Verhoeven, D. Heerwegh, and K. De Wit, “Information and communication technologies in the life of university freshmen: An analysis of change,” Computers &amp; Education, vol. 55, no. 1, pp. 53–66, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension of the theory==
* '''Lin and Anol''' postulated an extended model of UTAUT, including the influence of online [[social support]] on network information technology usage.  They surveyed 317 [[undergraduate]] students in [[Taiwan]] regarding their online social support in using [[instant messaging]] and found that social influence plays an important role in affecting online social support.&lt;ref&gt;C.-P. Lin and B. Anol, “Learning online social support: An investigation of network information technology,” CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 268–272, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sykes ''et al.''' proposed a model of acceptance with peer support (MAPS), integrating prior research on individual adoption with research on [[social networks]] in organizations. They conducted a 3-month-long study of 87 employees in one organization and found that studying social network constructs can aid in understanding new information system use.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Sykes, V. Venkatesh, and S. Gosain, “Model of acceptance with peer support: A social network perspective to understand employees’ system use,” MIS Quarterly, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 371–393, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wang, Wu, and Wang''' added two constructs (perceived playfulness and self-management of learning) to the UTAUT in their study of determinants of acceptance of mobile learning in 370 individuals in [[Taiwan]] and found that they were significant determinants of behavioral intention to use mobile learning in all respondents.&lt;ref&gt;Y.-S. Wang, M.-C. Wu, and H.-Y. Wang, “Investigating the determinants and age and gender differences in the acceptance of mobile learning,” British Journal of Educational Technology, vol. 40, no. 1., pp. 92–118, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wang and Wang''' extended the UTAUT in their study of 343 individuals in Taiwan to determine [[gender]] differences in [[mobile Internet]] acceptance.  They added three constructs – perceived playfulness, perceived value, and palm-sized computer self-efficacy to UTAUT and chose behavioral intention as a dependent variable.  They omitted use behavior, facilitating conditions, and experience.  Also, since the devices were used in a voluntary context, and they found that most adopters were ages 20–35, they omitted voluntariness and age.  Perceived value had a significant influence on adoption intention, and palm-sized computer self-efficacy played a critical role in predicting mobile Internet acceptance.  Perceived playfulness, however, did not have a strong influence on behavioral intention, but this may have been due to service or network communication quality issues during the study.&lt;ref&gt;H.-W. Wang and S.-H. Wang, “User acceptance of mobile Internet based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology: Investigating the determinants and gender differences,” Social Behavior &amp; Personality: An International Journal, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 415–426, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
* '''Bagozzi''' critiqued the model and its subsequent extensions, stating “UTAUT is a well-meaning and thoughtful presentation,” but that it presents a model with 41 [[independent variables]] for predicting intentions and at least 8 independent variables for predicting behavior,” and that it contributed to the study of technology adoption “reaching a stage of chaos.”  He proposed instead a unified theory that coheres the “many splinters of knowledge” to explain decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007|p= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Van Raaij and Schepers''' criticized the UTAUT as being less [[parsimonious]] than the previous [[Technology acceptance model|Technology Acceptance Model]] and TAM2 because its high [[coefficient of determination|''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] is only achieved when moderating key relationships with up to four variables.  They also called the grouping and labeling of items and constructs problematic because a variety of disparate items were combined to reflect a single psychometric construct.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. van Raaij, and J. J. L. Schepers, “The acceptance and use of a virtual learning environment in China,” Computers &amp; Education, vol. 50, no. 3, pp. 838–852, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WallPanelDiagram.svg|thumb|A typical wall section in [[platform framing]] {{ordered list |Cripple |Window header |Top plate / upper wall plate |Window sill |Stud |Sill plate / sole plate / bottom plate}}]]
[[File:Steel framing 5.PNG|thumb|right|Steel studs in a wall]]
A '''wall stud''' is a vertical [[Framing (construction)|framing]] member in a [[building]]'s [[wall]] of smaller cross section than a [[Post (structural)|post]]. They are a fundamental element in frame building.

==Etymology==
''Stud'' is an ancient word related to similar words in Old English, Old Norse, Middle High German, and Old Teutonic generally meaning ''prop'' or ''support''.&lt;ref name="OED" &gt;"Stud". def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other historical words with similar meaning are ''quarter''&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; and ''[[scantling]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Scantling" def. 3.a. Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; (one sense meaning a smaller timber, not necessarily the same use). ''Stick'' is a colloquial term for both framing lumber (timber) and a "timber tree"&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. The Century dictionary and cyclopedia. New York: Century Co., 1901. Print. [http://triggs.djvu.org/century-dictionary.com/] accessed 1/9/2014&lt;/ref&gt; (a tree trunk good for using as lumber (timber)). Thus the names ''"stick and platform"'', ''"stick and frame"'', ''"stick and box"'', or simply ''stick framing''. The stud height usually determines the ceiling height thus sayings like: "...These rooms were usually high in stud..."&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==Purpose==
Studs form [[Wall#Building walls|walls]] and may carry vertical [[structural load]]s or be non [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] such as in partition walls which only separate spaces. They hold in place the windows, doors, interior finish, exterior sheathing or siding,[http://www.newworldconstruction.com.au/steel-wall-and-house-stud-framing.html stud wall] insulation and utilities and help give shape to a building. Studs run from [[sill plate]] to [[wall plate]]. In modern construction studs are fastened to the plates in a way, such as using [[Tie (engineering)|ties]], to prevent the building from being lifted off the foundation by severe wind or earthquake.

==Properties==
Studs are usually slender so more studs are needed than in [[Timber framing|post and beam]] framing. Sometimes studs are long, as in [[balloon framing]] where the studs extend two stories and carry a ledger which carries joists. Balloon framing has been made illegal in new construction in many jurisdictions for fire safety reasons because the open wall cavities allow fire to quickly spread such as from a basement to an attic; the plates and platforms in [[platform framing]] providing an automatic fire stop inside the walls, and so are deemed much safer by fire safety officials. Being thinner and lighter, stick construction techniques are easier to cut and carry and is speedier than the timber framing.

In the United States and Canada, studs are traditionally made of wood, usually 2"×4" or 2"×6" [[Timber#Dimensional lumber|dimensional lumber]] and typically placed {{convert|16|in|mm|0}} from each other's center, but sometimes also at {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} or {{convert|24|in|mm}}. The wood needs to be [[Wood drying|dry]] when used or problems may occur as the studs shrink and twist as they dry out. [[Steel frame#Light steel framing|Steel]] studs are gaining popularity, especially for non load-bearing walls, and are required in some [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]].

==Other terms== 
Studs used to frame around window and door openings are given different names, including
* ''king stud'' − stud to left or right of a window or door that is continuous from the bottom plate to the top plate
* ''trimmer'' or ''jack'' − stud to the left or right of a window or door that runs from the bottom plate to the underside of a lintel or header
* ''cripple stud'' – a stud located either above or below a framed opening, that does not run the full height of the wall
* ''post'' or ''column'' − a doubled or other integral multiple of a group of studs nailed side by side. Posts in walls are used at point loads such as long spans near a wide window or sliding door, etc.

A building technique mostly associated with Lincolnshire, England, and parts of Scotland gets part of its name from the studs: ''mud and stud'' (''stud and mud''). This building method uses studs in a framework which is then totally covered with mud which resembles the building material [[Cob (material)|cob]].&lt;ref&gt;Keefe, Laurence. ''Earth building: methods and materials, repair and conservation''. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005. 14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional building method is called ''stud and plaster'' where the plaster walls are held by [[lath]] on the studs. Studs are also the namesake of a type of timber framing called [[close studding]].

==Grades==
Based on the American West Coast Lumber Inspection Bureau (WCLIB) [[Lumber#Grades and standards|grading rules]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wclib.org/R17-PDF-Online/WCLIB/pdfs/e_WCLIB_2004_RulesBook_3.pdf |title=WCLIB Grading Rules for National Grades – Framing Lumber |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is only one grade of stud: STUD. A stud is graded for vertical application and its stress requirements and allowable visual defects reflect that application. A stud is most similar to a #2 grade, which is held to a higher standard during grading. The biggest difference between the two is the frequency, placement and size of [[Knot (wood)|knots]] and overall allowable wane.

==History==
===Pre-founding===
Prior to founding Wealthsimple, Michael Katchen worked for [[1000Memories]], a Silicon Valley-based startup.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015April10CaseyQuentin" /&gt; After [[Ancestry.com]] bought 1000Memories in 2012, Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015April10CaseyQuentin" /&gt; Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for Wealthsimple.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015April10CaseyQuentin" /&gt; In 2014, he returned to Toronto to launch the company.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015April10CaseyQuentin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="castaldo"&gt;Joe Castaldo, [http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/change-agent/michael-katchen-wealthsimple/ "How Wealthsimple founder Michael Katchen is shaking up financial advice,"] ''[[Canadian Business]]'', March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Acquisition of Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc.===
In December 2015, Wealthsimple made its first acquisition with acquiring Canada's first robo-advisor service, Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015December02ChevreauJonathan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chevreau|first1=Jonathan|title=Millennial-focused Wealthsimple to buy boomer robo-adviser ShareOwner, its first acquisition|url=http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/millennial-focused-wealthsimple-takes-over-boomer-robo-adviser-shareowner|accessdate=28 March 2017|agency=Postmedia Network Inc.|issue=Personal Finance – Young Money|publisher=Financial Post|date=2 December 2015|location=Canada|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the acquisition Wealthsimple became an owner of one of Canada's 14 discount brokerages (2015) alongside other owners of discount brokerages including [[Bank of Montreal]] and [[Royal Bank of Canada]].&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015December02ChevreauJonathan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="techvibes"&gt;[http://www.techvibes.com/blog/wealthsimple-2015-12-02 "Wealthsimple Acquires Automated Investment Manager to Innovate Canadian FinTech,"] ''[[TechVibes]]'', December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of Canadian ShareOwner Investment Inc. resulted in the assets under management comprising CAD $400,000,000 across 10,000 customer accounts.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost2015December02ChevreauJonathan" /&gt;

[[File:Jupiter from Hubble (Oct. 11, 1991).jpg|300px|thumb|Wide Field and Planetary Camera view of Jupiter, 1991]]
[[File:Galaxym100a.jpg|thumb|right|WFPC image of Messier 100 (NGC 4321)]]

The '''Wide Field/Planetary Camera''' ('''WFPC''') (pronounced as wiffpick (Operators of the WFPC1 were known as "whiff-pickers")) was a [[camera]] installed on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] until December 1993.  It was one of the instruments on Hubble at launch, but its functionality was severely impaired by the defects of the main mirror optics which afflicted the telescope.  However, it produced uniquely valuable high resolution images of relatively bright astronomical objects, allowing for a number of discoveries to be made by HST even in its aberrated condition.

WFPC was proposed by [[James Westphal|James A. Westphal]], a professor of planetary science at [[Caltech]], and was designed, constructed, and managed by [[JPL]].  At the time it was proposed, 1976, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s had barely been used for astronomical imaging, though the first [[KH-11 Kennen|KH-11 KENNEN]] reconnaissance satellite equipped with CCDs for imaging was launched in December 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRO review and redaction guide|edition=2006| url=http://www.fas.org/irp/nro/declass.pdf |publisher=[[National Reconnaissance Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high sensitivity offered such promise that many astronomers strongly argued that CCDs should be considered for [[Hubble Space Telescope]] instrumentation.

This first WFPC consisted of two separate cameras, each comprising 4 800x800 pixel [[Texas Instruments]] CCDs arranged to cover a contiguous field of view.  The Wide Field camera had a 0.1 arcsecond pixel scale and was intended for the panoramic observations of faint sources at the cost of [[angular resolution]].  The Planetary Camera had a 0.043 arcsecond pixel scale and was intended for high-resolution observations.  Selection between the two cameras was done with a four-facetted pyramid that rotated by 45 degrees.&lt;ref name="CP-2244"&gt;{{cite techreport |title=The Space Telescope Observatory |number=CP-2244 |institution=NASA |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19820025420 |date=1982}}, page 28. 40 MB PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the corrective service mission ([[STS-61]] in December 1993) the WFPC was swapped out for a replacement version. The [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] improved on its predecessor and incorporated corrective optics needed to overcome the main mirror defect.  To avoid potential confusion, the WFPC is now most commonly referred to as WFPC1.

On its return to Earth, the WFPC was disassembled and parts of it were used in [[Wide Field Camera 3]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=34007&amp;fbodylongid=1926 | title = WFC3 - Wide Field Camera 3 | publisher = ESA | accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was installed in Hubble on May 14, 2009 as part of [[STS-125|Servicing Mission 4]], replacing [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2|WFPC2]].

==Specifications==
[[File:Repair-hubble-1-training.jpg|thumb|Astonauts practice replacing the WFPC on Earth in water tank to simulate working in space in 1993. That model being used is a full-scale training version of the WFPC]] 
The instrument had two different cameras within, the Wide Field and the Planetary Camera.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/about/general/instruments/wfpc1/|title=Hubble's Instruments: WFPC1 - Wide Field and Planetary Camera 1|first=|last=information@eso.org|website=www.spacetelescope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wide Field camera had a wider field of view compared to the Planetary Camera.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Replacement==
Although there was nothing known to be wrong with this instrument, the spherical aberration in HST's mirror severely limited the performance.   
WFPC was replaced by the [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] which included its own internal corrective optics.  WFPC2 was replaced by the [[Wide Field Camera 3]] in 2009.  After return to Earth, WFPC was disassembled and its parts cannibalized to make WFC3.
