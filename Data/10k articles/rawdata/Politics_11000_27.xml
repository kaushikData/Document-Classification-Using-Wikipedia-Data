      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">The '''Delhi summit on security''' took place on February 14, 2007, with the [[foreign minister]]s of [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]] meeting in [[Hyderabad House]], [[Delhi]], India to discuss [[terrorism]], [[drug trafficking]], [[reform of the United Nations]], and the security situations in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=BIGTHREE&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6358693.stm  'Big three' hold key Delhi talks] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOUSE&gt;[http://www.newkerala.com/news4.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=104097 Foreign Ministers of India, China, Russia meet to take forward strategic ties] New Kerala&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Foreign Ministry released a statement on behalf of all three governments saying, "We shared our thoughts on the political, economic and security aspects of the global situation, the present world order and recent developments in various areas of mutual concern. We agreed that co-operation rather than confrontation should govern approaches to regional and global affairs. There was coincidence of views against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and on the need to address financing of terrorism and its linkages with [[narco-trafficking]]."&lt;ref name=BIGTHREE/&gt;

[[Li Zhaoxing]] of China and [[Pranab Mukherjee]] of India negotiated over air links, visa restrictions, disputes over shared rivers, and the China-India border.&lt;ref name=BIGTHREE/&gt;

Representatives also spoke about [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|China's recent missile test]]. [[Nirupama Rao]], India's ambassador to China, said Zhaoxing "stressed that China was against the weaponization and militarization of outer space and that the test conducted, according to them, was of a purely technological and scientific nature."&lt;ref name=BIGTHREE/&gt;

Russian foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said, "As Russia's relations... with China grew deeper, India-China relations [are] normalized [and] Beijing and New Delhi manifested mounting interest in contacts with Russia in tripartite format on a wide range of matters of mutual interest."&lt;ref name=DISCUSS&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=8490&amp;size=A India, Russia and China discussing terrorism, energy and politics] Asia News&lt;/ref&gt;

C. Uday Bhaskar from the New Delhi-based Institute for Defence and Strategic Analyses said, "[e]nergy cooperation would be a big ticket item on the talks agenda."&lt;ref name=DISCUSS/&gt;

Mukherjee said, "We also agreed on the importance of the UN and that there was a need to make it more effective so that it reflects contemporary global realities."&lt;ref name=MULTIPOLAR&gt;[http://www.calcuttanews.net/story/228349 India, Russia, China for multi-polar world, discuss Iran] Calcutta News&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, said, "We discussed most burning issues of world politics and had a broad approach on many international issues."&lt;ref name=MULTIPOLAR/&gt;

After the summit representatives for China and Russia said they support India's campaign for membership in the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name=UNSC&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/feb/14un.htm China, Russia back India's UN aspirations] Rediff&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catalan-speaking world|expanded=Language}}
The '''Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua''' ({{IPA-ca|akaˈðɛmia valensiˈana ðe la ˈʎeŋɡwa|va}}, English: Valencian Language Academy), also known by the [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] '''AVL''', is an institution created on September 16, 1998, by the [[Corts Valencianes|Valencian Parliament]], which belongs to the set of official institutions that compose the [[Generalitat Valenciana]], according to the Act of Autonomy of the [[Valencian Community]].

Its primary function is to determine and set the official standards for the [[Valencian language]] as used in the [[Valencian Community]] ([[names of Catalan language|known]] in other territories as [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), and foster its use. According to its foundational law, the AVL linguistic regulations for Valencian must follow current Valencian genuine linguistic reality, respect Valencian lexicographic and literary tradition and start from the consolidated regulations based upon the [[Normes de Castelló]], a set of orthographic rules for Valencian signed in 1932.

The headquarters of the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua are in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia city]].
In addition this variety of the language follows the pattern of Pompeu Fabra standards who standardized the [[Catalan_language|Catalan]] language in Catalonia. The [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|IEC]] (Institute of Catalan Studies) standards are almost the same as the AVL (Valencian Language Academy) standards.

In United States agricultural policy, '''additional peanuts''' (or '''additionals''') refers to peanuts sold from a farm in any marketing year in excess of the amount of quota peanuts (see [[peanut poundage quota]]) sold from that farm. Additional peanuts must be exported or crushed into oil and meal. Additionals are eligible only for the lower of two price support levels available under the [[peanut price support program]]. The lower additionals loan rate is set to ensure that the [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] does not incur losses on their sale and disposal.

In setting this support level, [[USDA]] is also required to take into account the demand for peanut oil and meal, expected prices of other vegetable oils and [[protein meal]]s, and the demand for peanuts in foreign markets. Under the [[FAIR Act of 1996]], loans for additional peanuts remain available.

[[File:1527 New Hampshire Avenue, NW.JPG|thumb|American Political Science Association headquarters located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The '''American Political Science Association''' ('''APSA''') is a [[professional association]] of [[political science]] students and scholars in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1903, it publishes three [[academic journal]]s (''[[American Political Science Review]]'', ''[[Perspectives on Politics]]'', and ''[[PS Political Science &amp; Politics|PS: Political Science &amp; Politics]]''). APSA Organized Sections publish or are associated with 15 additional journals.

APSA presidents serve one-year terms: the current president is [[Kathleen Thelen]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. [[Woodrow Wilson]], who later became [[President of the United States]], was APSA president in 1909. APSA has its headquarters at 1527 [[New Hampshire Avenue]] NW in [[Washington, D.C.]], in a historic building that was the home of [[Harry Garfield]], son of President [[James A. Garfield]] and president of the association from 1921 to 1922.

APSA administers the [[Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs]], which provides conference and research space for scholars, and [[Pi Sigma Alpha]], the [[honor society]] for political science students. APSA also periodically sponsors [[seminar]]s and other events for political scientists, [[policymaker]]s, the media, and the general public.

== Conferences and Meetings ==
A key part of APSA's mission is to enable political scientists to connect an environment conducive to teaching, research, and practice in all fields of political science and to ensure support necessary for the discipline to thrive.  APSA conducts several annual conferences, which provides this environment for scholars and other professionals to network and present their work, along with other pertinent and useful resources. The APSA Annual Meeting is among the world's largest gatherings of political scientists. It occurs on [[Labor Day]] weekend each summer. The 2018 Annual Meeting is scheduled for August 30 - September 2 in Boston, MA.

The  APSA Teaching and Learning Conference is a smaller working group conference hosting cutting-edge approaches, techniques, and methodologies for the political science classroom. The conference provides a forum for scholars to share effective and innovative teaching and learning models and to discuss broad themes and values of political science education—especially the scholarship of teaching and learning.

With funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], APSA has organized political science workshops in various locations in Africa, APSA Africa Workshops.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.apsanet.org/africa/&lt;/ref&gt; The first workshop was convened in Dakar, Senegal in partnership with the West African Research Center from July 6–27, 2008. The annual residential workshops are led by a joint U.S. and African organizing team and aimed at mid-and junior-level scholars residing in Africa.  They will enhance the capacities of political scientists and their resources in East and West Africa while also providing a forum for supporting their ongoing research. Each three week workshop brings together up to 30 scholars and cover substantive issues, methodologies, and reviews of research. See also, APSA International Programs.

== Awards ==
To recognize excellence in the profession, the Association offers annual awards for:
* Dissertation Awards
* Paper and Article Awards
* Book Awards
* Career Awards
* Goodnow Award
* Teaching Award and Campus Teaching Award Recognition

In addition to the APSA awards, the APSA organized sections also present over 100 awards at every Annual Meeting to recognize important research and contributions to the profession. These awards are presented at the Association's Annual Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/awards See more on Award Descriptions and Nomination Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs ==
Through its facilities and endowed funding programs, APSA'S Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs celebrates the past by investing in the future. Opened in 2003, the centenary of APSA's establishment, the Centennial Center encourages individual research and writing in all fields of political science, facilitates collaboration among scholars working within the discipline and across the social and behavioral sciences and humanities, and promotes communication between scholars and policymakers.

The Centennial Center, its facilities, and research support programs continue to be made possible in part through the generous donations of APSA members. The Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs assists APSA members with the costs of research, including travel, interviews, access to archives, or costs for a research assistant. Funds can also be used to assist scholars in publishing their research. Grants can range in size from $500 to $10,000, depending upon the research fund. [http://www.apsanet.org/centennial See more centennial funding programs and grants.]

== Congressional Fellowship Program ==
The APSA Congressional Fellowship Program is a highly selective, nonpartisan program devoted to expanding knowledge and awareness of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Since 1953, it has brought select [[political scientists]], journalists, federal employees, health specialists, and other professionals to [[Capitol Hill]] to experience Congress at work through fellowship placements on congressional staffs.

The nine-month program begins each November with an intensive one-month introduction to Congress taught by leading experts in the field. After orientation, fellows work in placements of their choosing and also participate in ongoing seminars and enrichment programs.

Through this unique opportunity, the American Political Science Association enhances public understanding of policymaking and improves the quality of scholarship, teaching and reporting on American national politics.&lt;ref&gt;See more on the [http://www.apsanet.org/cfp Congressional Fellowship Program.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
One key component of APSA's mission is to support political science education and professional development of its practitioners. The APSA publications program attempts to fill the diverse needs of political scientists in academic and non academic settings as well as students at various stages of their education.

The '''Bali Peace Park''' Project was founded in 2003 by Australian [[Dallas Jackson-Finn]] in the lead up to the first Anniversary of the first [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali bombing]].

The Bali Peace Park Association Inc (BPPAI) based in [[Perth, Western Australia]], was incorporated in September 2008. The Association consists of survivors of the 2002 and 2005 terrorist attacks in [[Bali]], as well as their friends, relatives and supporters.

The Association is [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] and a WA Registered Charity with an aim to facilitate the development of a Peace Park and interactive [[museum]] on the ex-[[Sari Club]] site in [[Kuta]], Bali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balipeacepark.com.au/park-maintenance.html |title=Park Maintenance |publisher=Balipeacepark.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bali Peace Park Association Inc has often been incorrectly portrayed as being connected with the similarly named [[Bali Peace Park Foundation]] (no longer existing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balipeacepark.asia |title=Bali Peace Park |publisher=Balipeacepark.asia |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unauthorised proposed commercial development by Balinese businessman [[Kadek Wirinatha]] was halted by the village of Kuta heads and Balinese Government officials, a meeting was called between the Australian Consulate and the Governor. Following this, the Governor and Regent of [[Badung]] both reaffirmed their support for the development of the Peace Park and stated that no other building permits, including that of a planned [[nightclub]] would be granted.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bali-tourism-board.com/news/513-disallow-development-clubbing-place-in-ex-sari-club.html |title=Disallow Development clubbing place in Ex Sari Club |publisher=Bali-tourism-board.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213081921/http://www.bali-tourism-board.com/news/513-disallow-development-clubbing-place-in-ex-sari-club.html |archivedate=2011-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=blog.indahnesia.com |url=http://blog.indahnesia.com/entry/200909031511/bali_s_governor_says_no_against_rebuilding_sari_club.php |title=Bali's governor says no against rebuilding Sari Club - Discover Indonesia Online |publisher=blog.indahnesia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In December 2009, the Association was granted [[Deductible Gift Recipient]] status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Sherry |url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/2010/047.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType=0 |title=Press Release - Second Tax Reform Bill of 2010 Introduced into Parliament with Focus on Fairness and Integrity of the Tax System [17/03/2010&amp;#93; |publisher=Ministers.treasury.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DGR - allowing [[tax deductible]] donations) by the [[Australian Federal Government]].

On 25 February 2010, Association negotiators, representatives of the landowner and mediators/observers from the Governor’s office met in Bali to begin the official land negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/landlord-joins-talks-on-plan-for-bali-memorial-park-20100225-p64j.html |title=Terry Fitzgerald &amp;#124; Bali memorial park &amp;#124; Bali bombings |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the Project formed part of Prime Minister Rudd’s Foreign Affairs brief for his meeting with Indonesian President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] in [[Canberra]].  At the time Association representatives also met with Governor Made Mangku Pastika who was travelling with President Yudhoyono to provide an updated report on the Project’s progress.&lt;ref&gt;(XZZ) http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/bali-peace-park-to-meet-governor-in-canberra-20100309-pudr.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Bali Peace Park Association still has no contract on the land nor will they in the foreseeable future.

In 2014, serious questions were asked about if Australia were forgetting the significance of the worst ever attack and loss of Australians life since the war&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY1p-HgogSE|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Smith 2UE.

A new group has been formed, The Kuta Community Peace Park action group has been formed to address the issues and  to advise the Balinese Government on the several sites that are more suitable.
The group consists of Balinese elders and concerned citizens both Indonesian and expats who believe the [[peace park]] should be placed away from the current site and without the politics.
The current consensus within the Balinese Community that this is peace park and not a [[memorial]], perceived by the Peace Park Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7470">'''Black reconnaissance''' or BRCON is a term describing [[military]] deep penetration [[reconnaissance]] of a completely covert nature.&lt;ref&gt;Black Reconnaissance: Trust in the era of Distrust. Jacob L. Phillips. Diamond Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from normal forms of covert recon in that discovery of the action would be so disruptive to relations between two countries that the instigators would be [[plausible denial|disavowed]] if caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Seymour | last=Hersh | authorlink= Seymour Hersh| title=The Coming Wars : what the Pentagon can now do in secret | date=2005-01-24 | publisher=CondeNet | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/24/050124fa_fact | work =The New Yorker | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-29 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black reconnaissance and other forms of covert and espionage action==

Black reconnaissance is different from more common terms such as [[Covert operation|covert ops]] and other military forms of recon in that covert operations are kept secret to protect the lives of the team conducting the mission. Black recon is kept secret because discovery would lead to [[political]] ramifications, and the lives of those conducting the reconnaissance are secondary. In the case that a black recon effort is discovered, the government denies any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;They Could Not Trust the King: Nixon, Watergate, and the American People. Stanley Tretick, William Vincent Shannon. Collier Books, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; For air-related black recon the usual explanation given is equipment failure and drifting off course, while ground-based black recon is usually explained away as someone violating orders.&lt;ref&gt;Honing the Keys to the City: Refining [[United States Marine Corps|the United States Marine Corps]] Reconnaissance Force for Urban Ground Combat Operations
By Russell W. Glenn, Jamison Jo Medby, [[defense (military)|National Defense]] Research Institute (U.S.), Scott Gerwehr, Fred Gellert, Andrew O'Donnell.[[RAND Corporation]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-8330-3311-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8330-3311-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black reconnaissance is also not a form of espionage, per se. The primary objective of black reconnaissance is to perform a military task, not to engage in any form of non-military [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence gathering]]. The fact that such elements are incorporated into the reconnaissance mission is because most times, this will be the only reconnaissance allowed before a military action is taken.&lt;ref&gt;Seapower and Space: From the Dawn of the Missile Age to [[Net-centric]] Warfare.Norman Friedman, United States Naval Institute Press. Naval Institute Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-55750-897-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55750-897-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During WW 2, black reconnaissance took on a slightly different meaning, where it indicated a form of recon for a surprise attack that if discovered, meant the attack would have to be redesigned or even abandoned. Many elements incorporated into modern black reconnaissance efforts were pioneered by [[World War II|WW II]] fighters and ground recon crews.&lt;ref&gt;The Best of Luck: In [[Royal Air Force|the Royal Air Force]] 1935-1946. Dennis Conroy. Trafford Publishing, 2003.{{ISBN|1412009103}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4120-0910-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of black reconnaissance==

The earliest black reconnaissance missions were flown during [[World War II]], by all sides of the war. The fastest fighters were stripped of everything except fuel, painted matte black, and flew at night, trying to identify bombing targets, locate fleets, and the like. The [[USS Ranger (CV-4)|USS Ranger]] was fitted out with special planes just for this purpose, and used them in preparing for [[Operation Torch]] in the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;Cressman, Robert J. (2003). ''USS Ranger: The Navy's First Carrier from Keel to Mast, 1934-1946''. Washington, D.C.:Brassey's. {{ISBN|1-57488-720-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most BRCON was traditionally conducted by specially constructed spy planes of the [[United States]] against [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]], using high powered [[cameras]] to overfly Soviet airspace to locate the positions of missile silos, and by Soviet planes using MAD or FLIR gear to locate US [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. This was a back and forth effort on the part of the two superpowers and lead to the development of single-use planes such as the [[SR-71]], the SR-75, and the Soviet [[Tsybin RSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Proposed Aviation Training Strategy to Ensure Relevancy in the Objective Force|journal=Army War College|date=2002-04-05|first=Robert|last=Johnson|coauthors=|volume=24|issue=4|pages=|id= |url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/42/4254/A425404.html|accessdate=2008-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of [[Cold War|the Cold War]], most black reconnaissance is now of a ground nature, mixing standard reconnaissance objectives such as mapping terrain and identifying targets with [[HUMINT]] objectives, political assessments, and designing mission specifications to avoid ambushes.&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence, Espionage and Related Topics: An Annotated Bibliography of Serial Journal and Magazine Scholarship, 1844-1998. James D. Calder. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-29290-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-29290-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Missions of this nature were run constantly during the [[Vietnam War]], along with other elements of [[Phoenix Program|Project Phoenix]], operating out of [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], where they not only acted to scout military objectives but to identify psy-war targets.&lt;ref&gt;The End of Nowhere: American Policy Toward Laos Since 1954. Charles A. Stevenson. Beacon Press, 1972. {{ISBN|0-8070-0252-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-0252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These missions, predominantly conducted by [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group|MACV-SOG]], were carried out in many cases by soldiers who carried no manner of identification, and did not carry American weapons as a method to increase plausible deniability in the event of capture or death.&lt;ref name="Markle2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=V.H. Markle|title=Forgotten People, Forgotten Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYTQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111|date=10 June 2014|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4990-3015-0|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black reconnaissance in media==

Quite a few [[fiction]] novels have been written on the topic of black recon and its effects on the world sphere. Authors such as Richard Moran and [[John Ringo]] often incorporate both ground-based and air-based black reconnaissance concepts in their books, and movies such as the Bourne series blur the lines between "civilian" intelligence methods and "military" intelligence methods. It appears quite commonly in various [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Conspiracy Encyclopedia|Conspiracy Encyclopedia: The Encyclopedia of Conspiracy Theories]]. Thom Burnett, Richard Belfield. Collins &amp; Brown, 2005.{{ISBN|1843402874}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84340-287-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often confused with black intelligence operations from government groups like the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;They Cast No Shadows: A Collection of Essays on the Illuminati, [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist History]], and Suppressed Technologies. Brian R. Desborough. iUniverse, 2002 {{ISBN|0-595-21957-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-595-21957-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3775">The '''Brückepreis''' (Bridge prize) is an international prize given annually to a person who contributed by a life's work to better understanding between peoples (''Völkerverständigung'', [[Cultural diplomacy]]) in Europe. It is given annually, beginning in 1993, by the town of [[Görlitz]]/[[Zgorzelec]]. The {{ill|Europastadt|de}} (Town of Europe) lies in both Germany and Poland, connected by a bridge across the [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]], and not far from the [[Czech Republic]]. The bridge appears in the prize name also for building bridges among people and nations, as [[Norbert Lammert]], the president of the [[Bundestag]], expressed in his laudatio for [[Arvo Pärt]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="Lammert" /&gt; The official name is '''Internationaler Brückepreis der Europastadt Görlitz/Zgorzelec'''. The prize money is 2,500 Euro. The prize is managed by an association, Gesellschaft zur Verleihung des Internationalen Brückepreises der Europastadt Görlitz/Zgorzelec.

The '''Canadian Civil Liberties Association''' ('''CCLA'''; {{lang-fr|Association Canadienne des Libertés Civiles}}) is a nonprofit organization in Canada devoted to the defence of [[civil liberties]] and [[constitutional rights]].&lt;ref name=ClementHistSite&gt;Dominique Clement. [http://historyofrights.ca/encyclopaedia/social-movements/national-canadian-civil-liberties-association/ Case Study: Canadian Civil Liberties Association] Page accessed Feb 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CCLA was founded in 1964 in Toronto, prompted by the Ontario government's proposal of a bill that would have granted special [[Law enforcement agency powers|powers]] to the police in the face of a rise in [[organized crime]].  Its predecessor was the Association for Civil Liberties (ACL), which at its foundation had been intended to address national issues, but had become focused primarily on issues in Ontario. The ACL was led by [[Irving Himel]], and in response to the bill, he gathered human rights leaders in Toronto, including [[Pierre Berton]], [[June Callwood]],  [[Bora Laskin]], [[Mark MacGuigan]], [[Harry Arthurs]], and [[John Keiller MacKay]], and they formed the CCLA with Mackay as its honorary president.&lt;ref name=ClementHistSite/&gt;

In 1968, the CCLA won a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to study [[due process]] in Canadian lower courts and used the findings as a guide for its advocacy in the ensuing years.&lt;ref name=ClementHistSite/&gt;

The CCLA was one of the few groups in Canada that protested the 1970 invocation of the [[War Measures Act]] by then [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] in response to the [[October Crisis]] in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=ClementHistSite/&gt;

In the opinion of [[Dominique Clément]], its most enduring contribution was its influence on the drafting of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which was enacted in 1982.&lt;ref name=ClementHistSite/&gt;

===Leadership===
[[Alan Borovoy]] served as [[general counsel]] of the organization from 1968 to 2009 and under his leadership, he and the CCLA became famous throughout Canada as defenders of free speech and civil liberties. He continued as general counsel [[emeritus]] from 2009 until his death in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;Peter Edwards and Stephen Spencer Davis for the Toronto Star.

[[Nathalie Des Rosiers]] was CCLA's general counsel from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref name=uofo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/people/rosiers-nathalie |title=Nathalie Des Rosiers |work=Common Law Section |publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nathalie-des-rosiers-on-guard-for-canadians-freedoms/article559990/ |title=Nathalie Des Rosiers: On guard for Canadians' freedoms |newspaper=Globe and Mail |date=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Sukanya Pillay]] was executive director and general counsel from 2014 until 2017, and had been acting general counsel from 2013 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccla.org/press-release-sukanya-pillay-appointed-ed-and-general-counsel-ccla/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/legalfeeds/author/mallory-hendry/sukanya-pillay-resigns-as-executive-director-gc-of-ccla-7567/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3513">A '''cash offer''' refers to an offer made to purchase real estate submitted by purchasers who do not require any financing since they do not require a mortgage. The purchase is referred to as an "all-cash buyer." Such a buyer may also waive the [[Real_estate_appraisal|appraisal]], although not necessarily, since the contingency may exist to test or ensure the property’s market value.  The term “cash offer” is typically applied to contracts in which both of these contingencies do not appear. Cash offers are common in markets like Denver, Colorado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svaldi|first1=Aldo|title=Denver buyers up their game to be last bidder standing in real estate deals|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/24/denver-buyers-up-their-game-to-be-last-bidder-standing-in-real-estate-deals/|accessdate=14 April 2018|publisher=Denver Post|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Seattle, Los Angeles, and are compounded by the limited supply of homes. Board Cash Offer (also known as a BCO), a type of cash offer, is a term applied to a real estate contract in which a mortgaged buyer has waived both mortgage and appraisal contingencies by prior special arrangement with Board Private Bank, the lender who coined the term.
The pervasive use of cash offers in these markets are said to be the result of and exacerbating inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=Steve|title=Cash buyers and premium prices leave middle-class home seekers locked out|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0708-lopez-cash-sales-20150708-column.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Cash offers account for over 28% of all home sales as of 2018 according to the WSJ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kusisto|first1=Laura|last2=Rexrode|first2=Christina|title=Want That House? You’d Better Pay in Cash|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-that-house-youd-better-pay-in-cash-1512469800|accessdate=12 April 2018|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because of the absence of one or more contingencies in cash offers, they are preferred by sellers who perceive risks in delays, the execution of underwriting, or in the application of appraisal valuation models. Sellers may reject financed offers in preference to cash offers, even when net proceeds would be lower, because of these perceived risks. This problem is all the more acute for first time homebuyers who do not yet have the funds to submit for a significant downpayment let alone an all cash offer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Click|first1=Diana|title=All-cash offers crushing first-time homebuyers|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/23/all-cash-offers-crushing-first-time-homebuyers.html|website=CNBC|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Other lenders assist mortgage buyers compete against cash offers. For example, a mortgage company may provide a buyer a [[Unfunded_loan_commitments|commitment]] prior to identifying a home. This differs from a pre-approval letter, which is a formal estimate of what a buyer can afford - not an obligation. A commitment, however, does not account for the appraisal contingency, which can adversely effect the strength of a mortgage offer in competitive markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MarksJarvis|first1=Gail|title=Homebuyers who pay cash win deals as appraisals derail sales in tight Chicago market|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-appraisals-thwart-homebuying-0707-biz-20170706-story.html|accessdate=12 April 2018|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5315">The '''City Protocol''' is a new open, global, and progressive working framework for cities worldwide to assess and improve performance in environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, quality of life, and city services, by innovating and demonstrating new leadership models, new ways of engaging society, and by leveraging new [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT).

Many initiatives exist today on various indicators (quality, performance and life) and on normalization of trade. The City Protocol addresses the city under a systemic approach. Cities can usefully be described as complex systems since their components interact and co-determine their future. Thus, [[urban planning]] is limited by the very nature of their complexity. The city has a metabolism and a rich ecosystem, it’s very heterogeneous. Like any complex system, it changes over time, it evolves, it is fragile and must adapt to changes. [[Resilience (organizational)|Resilience]] is the key to also ensure continuity of services in the city at any time of crisis. Two major vectors through the development of the city, the need, its uses and functions, and chance, hazard and risk. The city should be adaptive, learning, evolving, robust, autonomous, self-repairing, and self-reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/cideu/docs/2012_cideu_bcn_city ''Transformando una ciudad en marcha''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The City Protocol has five fundamental goals:

# To facilitate and foster a new science of cities.
# To establish a cooperation framework among the city council, academia, companies, organizations and people/society.
# To lead and pave cities’ futures.
# To understand the common driving forces of urban evolution and find common game-changing solutions.
# To find innovative economical opportunities and synergies: and deliver valueadding products and services.
The City Protocol will move worldwide city thinking forward effectively and remain appealing and available to a wide range of cities and smart city communities. City Protocol will create a reflection community, a sharing space and opportunities to build complete or partly solutions to allow the emergent new generation solutions for a sustainable city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/cideu/docs/2012_cideu_bcn_city City Protocol Goals]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development Process of the City Protocol==
The City Protocol will be created through a number of stages that will span some 18 months:

* Stage 1, to July 2012: will enroll a discrete group of core Cities, Institutions, Industry, and Academia to agree the need for, and shape the City protocol Society. Kick start of Working Groups (CPWG) and areas of work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w110.bcn.cat/portal/site/Ajuntament/menuitem.0af6dcf550d619e1f747f747a2ef8a0c/?vgnextoid=121f7dd6443a8310VgnVCM10000072fea8c0RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=49ea2abc5e8aa210VgnVCM10000074fea8c0RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=formatDetall&amp;lang=en_GB Cities, companies and universities are preparing the first City Protocol document in Barcelona]. Barcelona City Hall news.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stage 2, to November 2012: will build agreements (CPA) on the principles, focus, commitment and manner by which the society will operate and the goals and outline content that it will address. The CPS will start operating under this stage.
* Stage 3, to November 2013: will establish from the core committed participants, visible initial products that the society can evidence as true and meaningful value. Once the CPS has been established, working groups (WG) will be set up. Said WG will work remotely under a periodical basis. Face to face meetings will take place to discuss and work around the CP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityprotocol.org/cityprotocol-methodology.html City Protocol Methodology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027230418/http://www.cityprotocol.org/cityprotocol-methodology.html |date=2012-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coalition for Equal Marriage''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign group created in 2012 by Conor Marron and James Lattimore, a [[same-sex couple]], to petition in support of civil marriages for gay couples.&lt;ref name="pinknews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/11/comment-why-were-building-a-coalition-for-equal-marriage/ |title=Comment: Why we're building a coalition for equal marriage | work = [[PinkNews]] |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition for Equal Marriage was created in response to the [[Coalition for Marriage]], a Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17102352 |title= Christian coalition petitions to stop gay marriage law |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; group campaigning against same-sex marriage in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="pinknews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2015}} {{cite web |url=http://www.c4em.org.uk/about-us/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429155258/http://www.c4em.org.uk/about-us/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 April 2012 |title=About Us |publisher=Coalition for Equal Marriage |accessdate=7 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition's website states the campaign started after Lattimore read a [[BBC News]] article regarding the ''Coalition for Marriage'' and seeing a comment from [[Lord Carey]] stating "The avowed intention to widen the scope of marriage as we see before us is a hostile strike, which rather than strengthening marriage, will destroy its meaning and diminish its importance drastically". Lattimore and his partner began working on the site and mimicked the look and design of the ''Coalition for Marriage'' website as a spoof, with [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] campaigns launched a day later. Signatures reached 10,000 roughly ten days afterwards&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2015}} {{cite web |url=http://www.c4em.org.uk/latest-news/how-it-all-began/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731071557/http://www.c4em.org.uk/latest-news/how-it-all-began/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=How It All Began |publisher=Coalition for Equal Marriage |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 40,000 signatures in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2015}} {{cite web |url=http://www.c4em.org.uk/ |title=Coalition For Equal Marriage |publisher=Coalition for Equal Marriage |accessdate=7 February 2013 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130102223741/http%3A//www.c4em.org.uk/# |archive-date=2 January 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secular-europe-campaign.org/2012/03/uk-coalition-for-equal-marriage/ |title=UK: Grassroots campaign 'Coalition for EQUAL Marriage' launches |publisher=Secular Europe Campaign |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signing of Nick Clegg==
Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] has signed the Coalition for Equal Marriage petition, and in an interview for ''[[The Independent]]'' Clegg was reported to have called it "a matter of ''how'', not ''whether'', equal marriage becomes legal in [[England]] and [[Wales]]."

Conor Marron, co-founder of the Coalition for Equal Marriage, released a statement thanking Nick Clegg and the [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] "who have voiced their position on the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/23/nick-clegg-warns-tories-against-backing-down-on-equal-marriage/ |title=Nick Clegg warns Tories against backing down on equal marriage |work = [[PinkNews]] |date= |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
Mike Buonaiuto created a viral advertismement on behalf of ''C4EM'' for release in late April 2012, with a teaser available before. The teaser features stills from the advert to the speech of [[David Cameron]] at the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference in 2011, when he announced "I don't support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Stephen |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/18/video-new-teaser-for-equal-marriage-ad/ |title=Video: New teaser for equal marriage ad |work = [[PinkNews]] |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2012, Buonaiuto's short film was released encouraging support for the government plans to legislate in favour of equal civil marriage rights for LGBT people. The video shows British army members returning home to their families, with one reunion turning into a marriage proposal between a same-sex couple. The argument put forth in the video and by Buonaiuto directly is that if gay and straight people can fight in the army together, then they should be able to love and get married the same. Supporting parties, gave their backing to the short film, while ''[[PinkNews]]'' advertised it directly on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/25/comment-i-hope-my-equal-marriage-film-wakes-us-all-up-to-support-changing-the-law/ |title=Comment: I hope my Equal Marriage film wakes us all up to support changing the law | work = [[PinkNews]] |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Stephen |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/25/video-coalition-for-equal-marriage-releases-beautiful-viral-campaign-film/ |title=Video: Coalition for Equal Marriage releases beautiful viral campaign film | work = [[PinkNews]] |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5703">The  '''Committee of Ten''' was a working group of educators that, in 1892, recommended the standardization of [[Secondary education in the United States|American high school]] [[curriculum]].

==Background==
In the [[United States]], by the late 1800s, a desire for educational standardization had manifested across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hertzberg |first=Hazel W.|title= Foundations. The 1892 Committee of Ten|date=Feb 1988|publisher= Social Education, v52 n2 |id=ERIC EJ365372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the nation and within communities, there were competing academic philosophies which the Committee of Ten aimed to resolve.  One philosophy favored rote memorization, whereas another favored critical thinking.  One philosophy designated American high schools as institutions that would divide students into college-bound and working-trades groups from the start; these institutions sometimes further divided students based on race or ethnic background.  Another philosophy attempted to provide standardized courses for all students.  Somewhat similarly, another philosophy promoted classic Latin/Greek studies, whereas other philosophies stressed practical studies.

==Membership of the Committee of Ten==
To resolve these issues, the [[National Education Association]] formed The 1892 Committee of Ten.  The committee was largely composed of representatives of higher education. Its subgroups, consisting of eight to ten members each, were convened by the following individuals:
*[[Charles William Eliot]], President of [[Harvard University]], Cambridge, Massachusetts '''Chairman'''
*[[William T. Harris]], Commissioner of Education, Washington, D.C.
*[[James B. Angell]], President of the [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor, Michigan
*John Tetlow, Head Master of the [[Girls’ High School (Boston, Massachusetts)|Girls’ High School]], Boston, Massachusetts
*James M. Taylor, President of [[Vassar College]], Poughkeepsie, New York
*Oscar D. Robinson, Principal of the High School, Albany, New York
*James H. Baker, President of the [[University of Colorado]], Boulder, Colorado
*[[Richard Henry Jesse]], President of the [[University of Missouri]], Columbia, Missouri
*James C. Mackenzie, Head Master of the [[Lawrenceville School]], Lawrenceville, New Jersey
*Henry C. King, Professor in [[Oberlin College]], Oberlin, Ohio

==Recommendations==
The committee provided its recommendations in a report that answered an initial set of eleven questions, and outlined important curricular knowledge within each major instructional specialty including [[Latin]], [[Greek (language)|Greek]], English, 'Other Modern Languages', [[mathematics]], and the [[science]]s ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[astronomy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfcBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3 |title=Report of the Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies: With the Reports ... - National Education Association of the United States. Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve years of education were recommended, with eight years of [[elementary education]] followed by four years of high school.  The committee was explicitly asked to address tracking, or course differentiation based upon [[postsecondary]] pursuit. The committee responded unanimously that "...every subject which is taught at all in a [[secondary school]] should be taught in the same way and to the same extent to every [[student|pupil]] so long as he pursues it, no matter what the probable destination of the pupil may be, or at what point his education is to cease." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Education Association of the United States. Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies.|title=Report of the Committee of ten on secondary school studies: with the reports of the conferences arranged by the committee.|year=1894|publisher=Pub. for the National Education Association by the American Book Co..|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to promoting equality in instruction, they stated that by unifying courses of study, school instruction and the training of new teachers could be greatly simplified.

These recommendations were generally interpreted as a call to teach English, mathematics, and [[history]] or [[civics]] to every student every [[academic year]] in [[high school]].  The recommendations also formed the basis of the practice of teaching chemistry, and physics, respectively, in ascending high school academic years.

The Committee identified the need for more highly qualified educators, and proposed that [[universities]] could enhance training by offering subject-education courses, lowering [[tuition]] and paying travel fees for classroom teachers and that [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]]s, [[principal (education)|principal]]s or other "leading teachers" could show other teachers, "... by precept and example, how to [teach] better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Education Association of the United States.

'''Conflict''' is usually found in an individualistic culture, in which competition and individual achievement is stressed over interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Grace|title=Understanding Human Development|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Boston|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''''Conflict''' can be defined as an interference between individuals or groups of people who have differing aims, values, expectations, purposes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nakayama|first=Thomas|title=Experiencing Intercultural Communication|year=2008|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|location=New York|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A model called the "Thomas-Kilmann model" was designed by two psychologists, Kenneth Thomas and Ralph Kilmann. It demonstrates how individuals choose the conflict styles when they handle conflict. Thomas-Kilmann model suggests five principles that guide individuals via the conflict process. These are competing, accommodating, avoiding, compromising, and collaborating.&lt;ref&gt;Kadir, Ashraful (2011, March 11). Five Conflict Management Styles at A Glance. Sources of Insight. Retrieved from http://sourcesofinsight.com/conflict-management-styles-at-a-glance/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managetrainlearn.com/page/conflict-resolution-model&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Competing means stand up for your own rights and defend what you believe is correct.
*  Accommodating means that you yield to other's points of view.
*  By Collaborating both sides are willing to cooperate and listen to others.
*  By Compromising both parties seek a better solution in the middle ground as one gives to another while one takes.
*  Avoiding. An unassertive, uncooperative approach whereby a solution is delayed or avoided altogether. Both sides might wait until they would find a better solution or evade the situation.

==Application==
The most widely used [[tool]] for this is a conflict style [[inventory]], typically a short [[questionnaire]] filled out by a user, with interpretation of the scores given in writing or by an instructor.  The point is not to categorize the user, but rather to give him or her a framework in which to assess responses and options. Conflict style inventories include the Thomas Kilmann

[[Image:Pilsner_Urquell_3.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Czechs prefer the grammatically incorrect „Brewed in ''Czech''“&lt;ref&gt;[https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/czechia-se-po-dvou-letech-prilis-neujala-kratsi-nazev-ignoru/r~20e13ffa7f9611e8aaa4ac1f6b220ee8/ Czechia se po dvou letech příliš neujala. Kratší název ignorují úřady i sportovci, Prazdroj to vzdal]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Czenglish''', a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of the words '''Czech''' and '''English''', stands for the [[interlanguage]] of [[English language|English]] heavily influenced by [[Czech language|Czech]] [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]] or [[syntax]] spoken by learners of [[English as a second language]].

==Characteristics==
Examples include confusing verbatim translations (such as "basic school" for ''{{lang|cs|základní škola}}'', which should be "primary school" or "elementary school"), incorrect [[word order]] in a sentence and use of inappropriate [[preposition]]s and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] because of the influence of their Czech equivalents.

Another typical aspect is the absence of definite articles (due to the lack of articles in the Czech language) and the use of "some" in place of an indefinite article. In Czenglish as well as Central European accents {{IPA|/θ/}} is often pronounced as {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[t]}} or {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} as {{IPA|[d]}}, and {{IPA|/r/}} is usually pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] as in some Scottish accents, rather than the more standard [[alveolar approximant|approximant]]. [[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced consonants]] at the end of words like "big" are pronounced unvoiced ({{IPA|[bɪk]}});  "ng" is understood as a /ng/ sequence and therefore follows the final devoicing rule (e.g. to sing merges with to sink {{IPA|[sɪŋk]}}).

==Reception==
Most elements of Czenglish only cause little confusion and are eventually understood by a native speaker. Some, however, may lead to embarrassing situations, since to a native English speaker they seem to be correct English sentences, although the Czech speaker meant to say something different. Such misunderstanding may be recognized only by considering the appropriateness of each of the possible meanings in the given context. Czechs in general tend to be openly hostile to one-another's grammar mistakes, both in English and Czech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Examples==
* A Czech girl was working in a pub in the UK when the landlord asked her if she could possibly continue to work longer hours. She replied, "Only if you get down on your knees and please me".
** The confusion here arises from the Czech word ''prosím'', which is most commonly an idiom which translates as "please", but is literally part of the verb ''prosit'' meaning "to beg".
* "The control of maintaining the purity of your cells have been identified gross deficiencies that are contrary to the principles of accommodation."
** Notice informing the inhabitants of a student dormitory that the insufficient cleanliness of their rooms is in violation of the Accommodation Contract.

The '''Democratic Rally''' ({{lang-el|Δημοκρατικός Συναγερμός (ΔΗΣΥ)}}, ''Dimokratikós Sinagermós'' ('''DISY'''); {{lang-tr|Demokratik Seferberlik}} ('''DİSİ''')), is a [[conservative]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slomp2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Slomp|title=Europe, A Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;pg=PA690|accessdate=22 August 2012|date=30 September 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39182-8|page=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christian-democratic]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slomp2011"/&gt; [[list of political parties in Cyprus|political party in Cyprus]], led by [[Averof Neofytou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://disy.org.cy/igesia.html|title=Δημοκρατικός Συναγερμός|website=disy.org.cy|language=el|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was founded on 4 July 1976 by veteran politician [[Glafkos Klerides]]. Klerides served as the president of Cyprus from 1993 until 2003.

==Overview==
DISY serves a diverse spectrum of voters, ranging from hardline nationalists and anti-communists to modern [[humanist]] liberals with post-materialist and post-modern values who advocate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Giorgos Charalambous |title=The Party Politics of the Problem |work=Resolving Cyprus |year=2015 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; DISY's platform focuses on free enterprise economic policies, lower direct taxes and higher indirect taxes, economic development, opposing government deficits, investments in infrastructure, and a practical solution to the inter-communal problem. It is the most explicitly pro-Western and pro-NATO of Cyprus's parties, and draws its support from middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white-collar employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/64.htm|title=Cyprus - Political Parties|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DISY is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Cyprus)|2014 European Parliamentary Election]] it  elected 2 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], who joined the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]].

The leaders of the Democratic Rally support practical solutions to solving the [[Cyprus problem]] and supported the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] for the re-unification of Cyprus in 2004, believing that further adjustments could be made afterwards. Following the rejection by the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] Community, four MPs (Sillouris, Prodromou, Erotokritou, Taramoundas) who had opposed the party line were expelled and a number of members willingly resigned. The expelled MPs formed a party called European Democracy. In 2005 [[European Democracy (Cyprus)|European Democracy]] merged with [[New Horizons (Cyprus)|New Horizons]] and created [[European Party (Cyprus)|European Party]]. Former party president [[Yiannakis Matsis]] headed a splinter coalition called [[For Europe (Cyprus)|For Europe]] in the European Parliamentary Election. Matsis gained a seat in the European parliament, also joining the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP group]] (while still remaining a member of DISY).

==Election results==

In the [[Cypriot legislative election, 2006|legislative elections of 21 May 2006]], the party won 30.52% of the popular vote and 18 out of 56 available seats, and in the [[Cypriot legislative election, 2011|legislative elections of 22 May 2011]], the party won 34.27% of the popular vote and 20 out of 56 available seats. The party's candidate, [[Nicos Anastasiades]], won the [[Cypriot presidential election, 2013|2013 presidential elections]], ended the five years rule of the [[Progressive Party of Working People]] (AKEL). In the [[Cypriot legislative election, 2016|legislative elections of 2016]], the party won 30.68%, taking 18 seats in the parliament and remaining the party with the largest representation.

The ecclesia is represented by the small blue box in the top center of the image. This diagram is based on Aristotle's ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]''.]]
[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|thumb|The ekklesia in Athens convened on a hill called the [[Pnyx]]]]
The '''ecclesia''' or '''ekklesia''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|ἐκκλησία}}}}) was the principal assembly of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] of ancient [[Athens (polis)|Athens]]. It was the popular assembly, open to all male citizens as soon as they qualified for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;In the fourth century, this would have been after 2 years of military service, i.e. at 20 years of age rather than 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 594 BCE, [[Solon]] allowed all Athenian citizens to participate, regardless of class, even the [[thetes]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The assembly was responsible for declaring war, military strategy and electing the [[strategos|strategoi]] and other officials. It was responsible for nominating and electing magistrates, thus indirectly electing the members of the [[Areopagus]]. It had the final say on legislation and the right to call magistrates to account after their year of office. A typical meeting of the Assembly probably contained around 6000 people, out of a total citizen population of 30 000–60 000. It would have been difficult, however, for non-wealthy people outside the urban center of Athens to attend until payments for attendance were introduced in 390s. It originally met once every month, but later it met three or four times per month. The agenda for the ekklesia was established by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]], the popular council. Votes were taken by a show of hands,counting of stones and voting using broken pottery.

A quorum of 6,000 members was required sometimes to do business. The ecclesia elected by lot annually the Boule or council. Some of their power under [[Solon]] was delegated to the Court by [[Pericles]] in his reforms.

In ancient Greece an [[ekklesiasterion]] was a building specifically built for the purpose of holding the supreme meetings of the ecclesia. Like many other cities Athens did not have an ekklesiasterion. Instead, the regular meetings of the assembly were held on the [[Pnyx]] and two annual meetings took place in the [[Theater of Dionysus]]. Around 300 BC all the meetings of the ekklesia were moved to the theater. The meetings of the assembly could attract large audiences: 6,000 citizens might have attended in Athens during the fifth century BC.{{sfn|Hansen|Fischer-Hansen|1994|p=51–53}}

A police force of 300 [[Scythians|Scythian]] slaves carried red ochre-stained ropes to induce the citizens who loitered in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|agora of Athens]] to attend the meetings of the assembly. Anyone with red-stained clothes who was not in the meeting was liable to a penalty.{{sfn|Osborne|2008|p=206}}{{sfn|Moore|1975|p=279}}

As early as the 1930s, Barcelona "had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid".&lt;ref name="josepsunyol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ham, Anthony p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, when [[Francisco Franco]] started the ''[[Coup d'état]]'' against the democratic [[Second Spanish Republic]], the president of Barcelona, [[Josep Sunyol]], member of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] and Deputy to [[Cortes Generales|The Cortes]], was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops&lt;ref name="McNeillp261"&gt;McNeill, Donald (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfiyEutRtmQC&amp;pg=PA61 ''Urban change and the European left: tales from the new Barcelona''] p.61&lt;/ref&gt; (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).&lt;ref name="josepsunyol"&gt;Burns, Jimmy, 'Don Patricio O’Connell: An Irishman and the Politics of Spanish Football' in "[http://www.irishargentine.org/0803.pdf Irish Migration Studies in Latin America]" 6:1 (March 2008), p. 44.

During the dictatorships of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and of Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto ''Més que un club'' (''English: More than a club'') because of its alleged connection to [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] as well as to [[progressivism|progressive]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; During Franco's regime, however, Barcelona was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.com/actualidad/articulo/franco-recibio-medallas-barca/daspor/20031109dasdai_6/Tes|title=Franco recibió dos medallas del Barça |publisher=Diario AS|language=Spanish |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between senior Real Madrid representatives and the Francoist regime were undeniable;&lt;ref name="McNeillp261"/&gt; for most of the Catalans, Real Madrid was regarded as "[[the establishment]] club", despite the fact that presidents of both clubs like [[Josep Sunyol]] and [[Rafael Sánchez Guerra]], suffered at the hands of Franco's supporters in the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="josepsunyol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.es/version_papel/LETRAS/21841/El_deporte_en_la_guerra_civil|title=El deporte en la guerra civil |publisher=''EL CULTURAL''|language=Spanish |date= |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200906/20090630/200906305111.html |title=Rafael Sánchez Guerra |publisher=''elpueblodeceuta.es'' |language=Spanish |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720140340/http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200906/20090630/200906305111.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image for both clubs was further affected by the creation of [[Ultras]] groups, some of which became [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]]. In 1980, Ultras Sur was founded as a far-right-leaning Real Madrid ultras group, followed in 1981 by the foundation of the initially left-leaning and later on far-right, Barcelona ultras group [[Boixos Nois]].

In Catalonia, forces of all the political spectrum are overwhelmingly in favour of Barcelona. Nevertheless, the support of the blaugrana club goes far beyond from that region, earning its best results among young people, sustainers of a federal structure of Spain and citizens with [[left-wing]] ideology, in contrast with Real Madrid fans which politically tend to adopt [[right-wing]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/noticias/20090720/53749146392/la-izquierda-es-cule-y-la-derecha-merengue-segun-el-cis-madrid-fc-barcelona-barsa-real-madrid-espany.html|title=La izquierda es culé y la derecha, merengue, según el CIS|publisher=LaVanguardia.com|language=Spanish |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2003/02/28/deportes/1046386805_850215.html|title=¿Del Madrid o del Barça?|publisher=elpais.com|language=Spanish |date=23 February 2003|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1943 Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals===
On 13 June 1943, Real Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 at home in the second leg of a semi-final of the [[Copa del Rey|Copa del Generalísimo]], the Copa del Rey having been renamed in honour of [[General Franco]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph 20111209"&gt;{{cite news|title=Real Madrid v Barcelona: six of the best 'El Clásicos'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/la-liga/8946213/Real-Madrid-v-Barcelona-six-of-the-best-El-Clasicos.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=9 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first leg, played at Barcelona's [[Camp de Les Corts|Les Corts]] stadium in [[Catalonia]], had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,&lt;ref name="p67"/&gt; with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. A campaign began in Madrid. Barcelona player Josep Valle recalled: "The press officer at the DND and ABC newspaper wrote all sorts of scurrilous lies, really terrible things, winding up the Madrid fans like never before". Former Real Madrid goalkeeper [[Eduardo Teus]], who admitted that Madrid had "above all played hard", wrote in a newspaper: "the ground itself made Madrid concede two of the three goals, goals that were totally unfair".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA68 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 68. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. Real Madrid released a statement after the match which former club president (1985–1995) [[Ramón Mendoza]] explained, "The message got through that those fans who wanted to could go to El Club bar on Calle de la Victoria where Madrid's social center was. There, they were given a whistle. Others had whistles handed to them with their tickets." The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker [[Mariano Gonzalvo]] said of the incident, "Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins." Barcelona goalkeeper [[Lluis Miró]] rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As [[Francisco Calvet]] told the story, "They were shouting: ''Reds! Separatists!''... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA70 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 70. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a "completely normal tackle". Madrid's [[José Llopis Corona]] recalled, "At which point, they got a bit demoralized," while Mur countered, "at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'." Madrid scored in minutes 31', 33', 35', 39', 43' and 44', as well as two goals ruled out for offside, made it 8–0. Basilo de la Morena had been caught out by the speed of the goals. In that atmosphere and with a referee who wanted to avoid any complications, it was humanly impossible to play... If the azulgranas had played badly, really badly, the scoreboard would still not have reached that astronomical figure. The point is that they did not play at all." Both clubs were fined 2,500 pesetas by the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] and, although Barcelona appealed, it made no difference. Piñeyro resigned in protest, complaining of "a campaign that the press has run against Barcelona for a week and which culminated in the shameful day at Chamartín".&lt;ref name="Spaaij 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spaaij |first=Ramn |title=Understanding football hooliganism: a comparison of six Western European football clubs |year=2006 |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-5629-445-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC&amp;pg=284 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The match report in the newspaper ''La Prensa'' described Barcelona's only goal as a "reminder that there was a team there who knew how to play football and that if they did not do so that afternoon, it was not exactly their fault".&lt;ref name="p72"&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Another newspaper called the scoreline "as absurd as it was abnormal".&lt;ref name="p67"/&gt; According to football writer [[Sid Lowe]], "There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims."&lt;ref name="p67"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA67 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 67. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the game, said, "There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA77 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 77.

===Di Stéfano transfer===
[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'s controversial 1953 transfer to Real Madrid instead of Barcelona intensified the rivalry.]]

The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for [[Club Deportivo Los Millonarios|Los Millionarios]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], during a players' strike in his native [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="di Stefano"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28204560 |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; Alfredo Di Stefano: Did General Franco halt Barcelona transfer?|publisher=BBC News |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Real Madrid and Barcelona attempted to sign him and, due to confusion that emerged from Di Stéfano moving to Millonarios from [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] following the strike, both clubs claimed to own his registration.&lt;ref name="di Stefano" /&gt; After intervention from [[FIFA]] representative Muñoz Calero, it was decided that both Barcelona and Real Madrid had to share the player in alternate seasons. Barcelona's humiliated president was forced to resign by the Barcelona board, with the interim board cancelling Di Stéfano's contract.&lt;ref name="di Stefano" /&gt; This ended the long struggle for Di Stéfano, as he moved definitively to Real Madrid.&lt;ref name="di Stefano" /&gt;

Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the initial five [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions Cup]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alfredo di Stéfano was one of football's greatest trailblazers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/07/alfredo-di-stefano-real-madrid|accessdate=12 October 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the [[UEFA|European]] stage when they met twice at the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], Real Madrid winning in 1960 and Barcelona winning in 1961.

===Luís Figo Transfer===
[[File:Luis Figo-2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Luís Figo]]'s transfer from Barcelona to Real Madrid in 2000 resulted in a hate campaign by some of his former club's fans.]]

In 2000, Real Madrid's then-presidential candidate, [[Florentino Pérez]], offered Barcelona's vice-captain [[Luís Figo]] $2.4 million to sign an agreement binding him to Madrid if he won the elections. If the player broke the deal, he would have to pay Pérez $30 million in compensation. When his agent confirmed the deal, Figo denied everything, insisting, "I'll stay at Barcelona whether Pérez wins or loses." He accused the presidential candidate of "lying" and "fantasizing". He told Barcelona teammates [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]] and [[Pep Guardiola]] he was not leaving and they conveyed the message to the Barcelona squad.&lt;ref name="p344"&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, ''[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]'' ran an interview in which he said, "I want to send a message of calm to Barcelona's fans, for whom I always have and always will feel great affection. I want to assure them that Luís Figo will, with absolute certainty, be at the Camp Nou on the 24th to start the new season... I’ve not signed a pre-contract with a presidential candidate at Real Madrid. No. I'm not so mad as to do a thing like that."&lt;ref name="p344"/&gt;

The only way Barcelona could prevent Figo's transfer to Real Madrid was to pay the penalty clause, $30 million. That would have effectively meant paying the fifth highest transfer fee in history to sign their own player. Barcelona's new president, [[Joan Gaspart]], called the media and told them, "Today, Figo gave me the impression that he wanted to do two things: get richer and stay at Barça." Only one of them happened. The following day, 24 July, Figo was presented in Madrid and handed his new shirt by Alfredo Di Stéfano. His buyout clause was set at $180 million. Gaspart later admitted, "Figo's move destroyed us."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=2l6zHv_reuUC&amp;pg=PA345 Sid Lowe: Fear and loathing in La Liga.. Barcelona vs Real Madrid]" p. 345, 346. Random House. 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Barcelona in a Real Madrid shirt, banners with "Judas", "Scum" and "Mercenary" were hung around the stadium. Thousands of fake 10,000 peseta notes had been printed and emblazoned with his image, were among the missiles of oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters, even a couple of mobile phones were thrown at him.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; In his third season with Real Madrid, the 2002 Clásico at Camp Nou produced one of the defining images of the rivalry. Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout; missiles of coins, a knife, a whisky bottle, were raining down from the stands, mostly from areas populated by the [[Boixos Nois]] where he had been taking a corner. Among the debris was a pig's head.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid. p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3038589/Barcelona-are-braced-for-a-stiff-penalty.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Barcelona are braced for a stiff penalty|date=27 November 2002|location=London|first=Tony|last=Jefferies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last three decades, the rivalry has been augmented by the modern Spanish tradition of the ''Pasillo'', where one team is given the guard of honor by the other team, once the former clinches the La Liga trophy before El Clásico takes place. This has happened in three occasions. First, during El Clásico that took place on 30 April 1988, where Real Madrid won the championship on the previous round. Then, three years later, when Barcelona won the championship two rounds before El Clásico on 8 June 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Deportes |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/376322/0/clasico/pasillo/historia/www.20minutos.es |title=(Spanish) |publisher=20minutos.es |date= |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last pasillo, and most recent, took place on 7 May 2008, and this time Real Madrid had won the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futfanatico.com/2011/12/05/real-madrid-v-barcelona-glance-pasillos/ |title=Real Madrid v.

While El Clásico is regarded as one of the fiercest rivalries in world football, there have been rare moments when fans have shown praise for a player on the opposing team.

The rivalry intensified in 2011 where, due to the [[2011 Copa del Rey Final|final of the Copa Del Rey]] and the meeting of the two in the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], Barcelona and Real Madrid were scheduled to meet each other four times in 18 days. Several accusations of unsportsmanlike behaviour from both teams and a war of words erupted throughout the fixtures which included four red cards.

As seen below, [[Football records in Spain#Most successful clubs overall (official titles, 1903–present)|Barcelona leads Real Madrid 93–89]] in terms of official overall trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Copa Eva Duarte (Defunct) is not listed as an official title by the UEFA, but it is [http://www.rfef.es/noticias/supercopa/conoce-antecedentes-supercopa considered as such by the RFEF], as it is the direct predecessor of the Supercopa de España&lt;/ref&gt; While the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is recognised as the predecessor to the UEFA Cup, it was not organised by [[UEFA]]. Consequently, UEFA does not consider clubs' records in the Fairs Cup to be part of their [[UEFA#Competitions|European record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/index.html |title=UEFA Europa League: History: New format provides fresh impetus |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[FIFA]] does view the competition as a major honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=1903416/index.html |title=Classic Football: Clubs: FC Barcelona |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=31083/index.html |title=Classic Football: Clubs: AS Roma |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11629">Electors must be on the [[electoral register]] in order to vote in elections and [[referendums]] in the UK. [[Electoral registration officer]]s within [[local authorities]] have a duty to compile and maintain accurate electoral registers. 

Registration was introduced for all constituencies as a result of the [[Reform Act 1832]], which took effect for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1832|election of the same year]]. Since 1832, only those registered to vote can do so, and the government invariably runs nonpartisan [[get out the vote]] campaigns for each election to expand the franchise as much as possible.

==Current procedure==
To register to vote a person must be 16 years old or over (but they cannot vote in some elections until they are 18) and resident (usually live) in the UK. In addition, a person must be a British, Irish or [[European Union]] citizen, or a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizen who has leave to remain in the UK or who does not require such leave.

A person can register at any time of the year. To register, electors should have a fixed address. If an elector wishes to register to vote, but has no fixed address, they may be able to register to vote by completing a declaration of local connection form. This would allow them to register at a place where they are likely to spend a substantial amount of their time.

Regulation 23 of the [[Representation of the People Regulations 2001]] states that the electoral registration officer has the power to require information needed for the purpose of maintaining the electoral register. Any person that fails to give information is liable on summary conviction to a fine.

A person can [[anonymous elector|register anonymously]] if their safety (or the safety of someone in their household) would be at risk if their name and address appeared on the electoral register. Documentary evidence of a court order or an attestation from an authorised person is required.&lt;ref name="electoralcommission.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/162573/Part-2-Registration-framework.pdf |format=PDF |title=Guidance for Electoral Registration Officers : Part 2 – The registration framework |website=Electoralcommission.org.uk |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual Electoral Registration===
{{main|Individual Electoral Registration}}
‘Individual Electoral Registration’ (IER) was introduced by the [[UK government]] through the [[Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013]] with the first IER applications being made in England and Wales from 10 June 2014 and in Scotland from 19 September 2014 (the delay in Scotland was due to the Scottish Independence Referendum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/162576/Part-3-The-transition-to-IER-in-2014-15.pdf |format=PDF |title=Guidance for Electoral Registration Officers : Part 3 - 2016 canvass |website=Electoralcommission.org.uk |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the ‘head of household’ was responsible for registering everyone who lived at the address, but now every individual is responsible for their own voter registration. The new system also means that people are now able to register online. Anyone newly registering under the new system will need to register themselves individually by filling out a paper or online form.&lt;ref name="electoralcommission.org.uk"/&gt;

In order to register under IER electors are required to provide their date of birth and national insurance number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote|title=Register to vote|website=Gov.uk=|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this helps to make registering to vote more secure and reduces the risk of fraud.

==History==
===Before 1832===
Before 1832, the only form of [[voter registration]] in the United Kingdom was in the [[Scottish counties]]. This consisted of a meeting of potential electors called to determine who was eligible to vote. As the electorate for these seats was extremely small—in 1788, it ranged between 16 electors for [[Clackmannanshire]] and 187 for [[Fife]]—meetings were an important part of the political process; often, elections were determined by registering or disqualifying electors. In the rest of Britain and Ireland, people who claimed to be qualified voters simply presented themselves at the [[husting]]s to vote. If a candidate who lost thought his defeat was due to ineligible voters, he could ask for a ''scrutiny'', which would turn out to be an expensive and lengthy process in large constituencies.

In England [[Land value tax|land tax]] lists were sometimes used as substitutes for a register. However, not all qualified voters paid land tax, and eligibility was at the discretion of the returning officer as to who was permitted to vote. The [[high sheriff]] of the county, or the mayor of a [[borough]], would often abuse their authority as ''ex officio'' returning officers for partisan purposes. A losing candidate could petition the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] if he suspected that the returning officer had abused their power.

In 1788, Parliament attempted to introduce voter registration. The scheme failed—registering only one hundred voters in [[Lancashire]]—and was abandoned after a year. Parliament attempted again in 1832, when [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] introduced legislation that would shift the focus of eligibility to the registration process.

===Registration process from 1832===
In 1832 the [[Overseer of the poor|overseers of the poor]] in each [[parish]], who at that time compiled information relevant to electoral qualifications in order to collect local taxes, were given the additional task of compiling the [[electoral roll|electoral register]]. The new Act of Parliament required that on 20 June in each year in the counties, the overseers publish a notice calling on prospective voters to make a claim and prove their eligibility to vote. Once an elector had done so, he would be re-listed every time unless his circumstances or eligibility changed. In July, the overseers in the counties would compile a draft register for elections to be held in the coming year. If any elector's eligibility was challenged, the objection was recorded and the elector was given notice to appeal. The list of objections was published during the first two weeks of September.

In the [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|boroughs]], the rate-book—which the overseers already compiled—provided a natural basis for the electoral register. An elector who had paid his rates up to the start of the registration period did not need to make a claim, unless there had been a change of address or qualification. By 20 July the assessors and collectors of taxes had to report to the overseers the names of those who were in arrears with payment of their rates. The overseers then compiled a draft electoral register of all those they considered as being qualified to vote. Separate lists of people qualified to vote by virtue of their status as freemen of the borough were prepared by the [[Town Clerk]]. The combined lists of all prospective voters were published by the last day of July. Anyone else who claimed to be qualified to vote or who objected was required to give notice to the overseers.

From this point onwards the process for finalising the electoral register was the same for all areas. [[Barrister]]s (who became known, collectively, as '''revising barristers''') were appointed by senior judges to hold courts which sat from mid-September to the end of October, to revise the lists of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2 &amp; 3 Will. IV, c. 45: An Act to amend the Representation of the People in England and Wales (7 June 1832), s. 49 et seq. In: The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ..., vol 72, p 154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq0uAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=books.google.co.uk|publisher=His Majesty's Statute and Law Printers, 1832|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These barristers reviewed statements from the officials who had drawn up the lists, from claimants, and from objectors in order to produce the final list of qualified electors. The procedure involved strict compliance with the law and even minor clerical errors could invalidate a claim. A well-qualified person could be put to the time and trouble of defending his vote, even against a worthless objection, because if he did not appear his claim was automatically rejected. This system was difficult and expensive to operate. It encouraged the development of party organisation, as legally qualified agents were needed to defend the claims of party supporters and challenge the eligibility of those supporting opponents. The office of revising barrister was abolished in 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fraser, Sir Hugh |url=https://archive.org/stream/representationof00frasrich/representationof00frasrich_djvu.txt |title=The Representation of the People Act, 1918 with explanatory notes |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the duties were entrusted to the electoral registration officer.

The dates on which electoral registers came into force were changed from time to time and sometimes varied across different parts of the country: in England and Wales, registers came into force on 1 November between 1832 and 1842, and 1 January between 1844 and 1915. The 1832 system broke down during the First World War: registers were not revised after 1915, and with many voters serving in the armed forces or relocating in order to take up war work, the registers became very outdated.

The passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], which introduced suffrage for men aged 21 and enfranchised some women from the age of 30, gave the opportunity for revising the process of electoral registration. Responsibility for preparing electoral registers was taken away from the overseers of the poor and given to local authorities. Suffrage was also expanded—or restricted—by following Representation Acts:
*[[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]], expanding the suffrage to all adults over 21
*[[Representation of the People Act 1969]], expanding the suffrage to all adults over 18
*[[Representation of the People Act 1983]], restricting the right to vote from prisoners
*[[Representation of the People Act 1985]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1989|1989]], allowing expatriates to vote in the last constituency they lived in for a period of 5 (1985), 20 (1989), and, currently, 15 years ([[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000|PPERA [2000]]]) after leaving.
*[[Representation of the People Act 2000]], removing restrictions on [[postal voting]] and allowing psychiatric patients to use hospitals as registration addresses.

The '''{{lang|de|FE-Schrift}}'''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Schrift für Kfz-Kennzeichen. Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''{{lang|de|Fälschungserschwerende Schrift}}''' ('''forgery-impeding typeface''') is a [[typeface]] introduced for use on [[license plate]]s. Its monospaced letters and numbers are slightly disproportionate to prevent easy modification and to improve machine readability. It has been developed in Germany where it has been mandatory since November 2000.&lt;ref name="stvzo"&gt;[http://www.stvzo.de/stvzo/fzv/anlage_4.htm {{lang|de|StVO, FZV – Anlage 4}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation "FE" is derived from the compound German adjective "{{lang|de|'''f'''älschungs'''e'''rschwerend}}" combining the noun "{{lang|de|Fälschung}}" (falsification) and the verb "{{lang|de|erschweren}}" (to hinder). "{{lang|de|Schrift}}" means [[font]] in German. Other countries have later introduced the same or a derived typeface for license plates taking advantage of the proven design for the FE-Schrift.

== Development ==
The motivation for the creation of the typeface was spun in the late 1970s in the light of [[Red Army Faction]] [[terrorism]] when it was discovered that with the then-standard font for vehicle registration plates—the [[DIN 1451]] font—it was particularly easy to modify letters by applying a small amount of black paint or tape. For example, it was easy to change a "P" to an "R" or "B", a "3" to an "8", or an "L" or "F" to an "E". Modifications to FE-font plates are somewhat more difficult, as they also require the use of white paint, which is easily distinguished at a distance from the [[retroreflective]] white background of the plate, in particular at night.

The original design for the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} typeface was created by [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]] who was working for the {{lang|de|Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen}} (Federal Highway Research Institute of Germany) at the time. The typeface was slightly modified according to the results of tests that lasted from 1978 to 1980 at the University of Giessen (Department of Physiology and Cybernetic Psychology).&lt;ref name="fsd"&gt;http://www.fsd.it/usefuldesign/german_plates_font.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the DIN typeface was using a [[proportional font]], the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} is a [[monospaced font]] (with different spacing for letters and numbers) for improved machine readability. Faked {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} letters (e.g., "P" to "R") appear conspicuously disproportionate.

Another motivation for the new typeface came from a spike in the theft rate of license plates in the early 1970s. And despite the requirement to hinder falsification, the scope document did list that point only in the second place. The first priority was a requirement for readability by humans and machines as the decade was the same that saw the development of other typefaces for [[optical character recognition]], namely [[OCR-A]] and [[OCR-B]]. The RAF terrorism however allowed to fund a project over a couple of years — running from the functional scope document being created in 1977 to the final decision of 1982 to not introduce the design on license plates. It ended up in the drawer.&lt;ref name=benjamintiven&gt;{{cite web |url=https://de.scribd.com/document/190327472/Falschungserschwerende-Schrift |title=Fälschungserschwerende Schrift |work=[[Scribd]] |author=Benjamin Tiven |date=2014-08-23 }} / also in the [http://www.servinglibrary.org/journal/3/falschungserschwerende-schrift servinglibrary] / and the layout in the [https://issuu.com/noorasharafi/docs/vis301_fa13_sharafi_noora_43406 fall issue of the magazin]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final publication in German law for the usage on license plates includes three variants – normal script ({{lang|de|Mittelschrift}}) with 75&amp;nbsp;mm high and 47.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide letters and 44.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide digits ({{convert|75|x|47.5|x|44.5|mm|in|frac=16|disp=out}}), narrow script ({{lang|de|Engschrift}}) with 75&amp;nbsp;mm high and 40.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide letters and 38.5&amp;nbsp;wide digits ({{convert|75|x|40.5|x|38.5|mm|in|frac=16|disp=out}}) and a small script ({{lang|de|verkleinerte Mittelschrift}}) with 49&amp;nbsp;mm high and 31&amp;nbsp;mm wide letters and 29&amp;nbsp;mm wide digits ({{convert|59|x|31|x|29|mm|in|frac=16|disp=out}}).&lt;ref name="stvzo" /&gt; The legal typeface includes [[diaeresis (diacritic)|umlaut vowels]] as these occur in German county codes at the start of the license plate number.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow font allows nine characters to be put on a standard Euro license plate&lt;!-- if the blue strip and the required spaces between the parts would be omitted then one could fit 14 narrow script characters on the standard plate size of 510&amp;nbsp;mm width --&gt; — shorter numbers are supposed to be printed with larger spaces between characters as to fill the available space on the plate.

The German law defines the font in "Anlage 4" (appendix 4) of the "Fahrzeugzulassungsverordnung" (vehicle admission ordinance).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fzv_2011/BJNR013900011.html&lt;/ref&gt; In section 2.1 it shows three names for it as "fälschungserschwerende Schrift", "FE-Schrift" and „Schrift für Kfz-Kennzeichen“ (font for license plates) with the latter to be used for requesting templates from the "Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen" (Federal Highway Research Institute / BASt). Digital variants have never been published by them but there exist third party digitilizations for free download, for example the font "Euro Plate".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.andyhoppe.com/design/fonts/euro-plate-font/&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss foundry [[Lineto]] has published an extended script that covers the full range of Latin letters inspired by the FE Schrift under the names FE Mittelschrift and FE Engschrift.&lt;ref&gt;https://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Headline+Fonts/FE/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption process ==
When the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} was finished in 1980 the pressure for its adoption had lessened already. Its distribution was furthered by another event being the introduction of the [[Vehicle registration plates of Europe|Euro license plate]]. With the fall of the [[iron curtain]] there was again a spike in the theft rate of license plates, including cars being stolen and moved to Eastern Europe. Again there was a motivation to prevent that with new regulations on license plates. In the new process the officials found the FE-Schrift which was fully developed and a perfect match for the [[automatic number-plate recognition]] technology that had developed to a usable state at the time.&lt;ref name=benjamintiven /&gt;

Some of the federal states in the eastern part of Germany introduced the new design during 1994 in anticipation of the national resolution.&lt;ref name=kennzeichen-guide&gt;http://www.kennzeichen-guide.de/schilder/GeschichteD.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1995 it was introduced nationwide by a federal law that came to include the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} as well as it had been in the planning since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?jumpTo=bgbl195s0008.pdf|title=Einunddzwanzigste Verordnung zur Änderung straßenverkehrsrechtlicher Vorschriften (21. ÄndVstVR)|date=1995-01-06|work=Bundesgesetzblatt Jahrgang 1995 Teil&amp;nbsp;I Nr.1|quote=Einführung des Euro-Kennzeichens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in legislation matches with the first [[Schengen zone]] to lift borders during 1995. With the extension of the Schengen zone in 1998 the new license plate design found EU-wide acceptance (even for non-Schengen countries) thereby lifting the older requirement of adding an extra [[international license plate code|country code plate]] on the car when roaming to other countries which constitutes an advantage to citizens. Shortly later the option to be issued an old (non-Euro) license plate design were dropped on 1 November 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?jumpTo=bgbl100s1090.pdf|title=Zweiunddreißigste Verordnung zur Änderung straßenverkehrsrechtlicher Vorschriften (32. ÄndVstVR)|date=2000-07-20|work=Bundesgesetzblatt Jahrgang 2000 Teil I Nr.34|pages=1093|quote=Artikel 13 (e) [..] Euro-Kennzeichen [..] spätestens ab dem 1. November 2000 [..] anzuwenden, die [..] mit einem neuen Kennzeichen ausgerüstet werden. Kennzeichen [..] in der vor diesem Termin geltenden Fassung [..] gelten weiter. [..] (f) Die Übergangsvorschrift §60 Abs. 1b (Einführung des Euro-Kennzeichens) wird aufgehoben.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the legislation dropped the older typeface for license plates alongside. The {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} is mandatory in Germany since that time although older license plates continue to be valid. There is an exception for historic cars to get a new license plate in the DIN typeface, and the {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}} armed forces continue to generally issue their plates in the DIN typeface.

[[File:Flag_of_Mercosur.svg|thumb|The Mercosur emblem represents the Crux constellation (Southern Cross)]]
Other countries have begun to introduce a forgery-impeding script as well, either taking over the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} or using a derivative variant. Taking over the original design, including the Euro license plate format, is generally cost effective&lt;ref name="cuba2013"/&gt; – while in many countries the car license plates are produced by the state it is not the case in Germany. In Germany the car owner has to pay for a new license plate which gets a license stamp to be valid on the road (the round stamp is placed between county code and the local registration code). In the vicinity of the [[vehicle registration]] offices several small shops compete to press a license plate on the spot – their printing machines are highly standardized and the German license plate design is tailored to allow for cheap production in high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlIZfIcQKg |title=Maschinen und Werkzeuge zur Herstellung von gepägten Kfz-Kennzeichen |publisher=Autoschilder Sievers |date=2014-05-10 |language=de }}&lt;br/&gt; / dubbed as {{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_UXLhMYR3o|title=Machines and tools for the assembly of automobile number plates |publisher=Autoschilder Sievers |date=2014-05-12 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically in Europe some countries started to adopt the style of [[Vehicle registration plates of the European Union|registration plates of the European Union]] even before becoming full members. The main difference is that EU registrations plates may bear a [[circle of stars]] as present in the [[Flag of Europe]]. The usage of stars is however completely optional and even after becoming a full member. The license plates may not need to be changed to be valid but new license plates may be issued with that hint to the EU membership.

In October 2014 the members of the [[Mercosur]] South American trade bloc agreed to introduce a common design for license plates. The size of the license plates is similar to the EU license plates but only 40&amp;nbsp;cm wide on a regular basis. The design uses the narrow script "Engschrift" FE-Schrift design to show the registration code with 7 elements. The FE-Schrift was found to perform better against alteration and falsification in comparison to the Brasilian [[Mandatory (typeface)|Mandatory]] script as shown in a test at the [[Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial|INTI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inti.gob.ar/sabercomo/sc114/inti8.php|title=Nueva patente para los vehículos del Mercosur|work=Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial (Buenos Aires)|date=August 2015|issue=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design also includes a blue strip above the registration code with the Mercosur emblem in the left upper corner, the national flag of the member state in the right upper corner, and the country name printed in the center. It was agreed to introduce the Mercosur design by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14stskFu1Ik&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.mercopress.com/2014/10/09/mercosur-finally-agrees-unified-number-plates-for-new-cars-beginning-2016&lt;/ref&gt; The actual introduction was delayed until 2018.

The early adoption in Africa is based on proposals against falsified and stolen license plates made by the German [[Utsch AG]], which had also developed the retroflective plates for Germany, and which was able to deliver the embossing machines for plates with FE-Schrift as they were already in mass production for the national market in 1994/95. In South Africa the empty license plates had been delivered with a special certification mark from the beginning, which would tell if a plate is authorized for embossing by licensed plate makers (today the certification mark contains a [[QR code]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://mybroadband.co.za/news/motoring/176749-number-plates-in-south-africa-what-you-can-and-cant-do.html&lt;/ref&gt; In other regions the car owner will get a third "license plate mark" being a sticker for the front window that can not be removed non-destructively and where the sticker does also contain all the license plate information (some of latest variants even integrate an RFID chip containing the information).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2014-04/autokennzeichen-rfid|title=Schlaue Schilder|work=Die Zeit|date=2014-04-04|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
{{section refimprove|date=April 2018}}
* On Euro-style license plates with the country code in a blue section on the left:
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|Germany]] – introduced in 1995 on Euro license plates only, these are mandatory since 2000
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] – in 2009 the new Euro-style license plate design was introduced along with the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} typeface. The new design (dropping the national crest from the old Euro-style license plates as it was used since 1998) is more similar to the Euro license plate.
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Malta|Malta]] – since 2004, the Euro-style license plate design was introduced in 1995 without the FE-Scrift
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Cyprus|Cyprus]] – since 3 June 2013
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (country)|Georgia]] – since 3 June 2013
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Latvia|Latvia]] - only for tractors and tractor trailers. On car, car trailer and motorcycle plates they use [[DIN 1451]].&lt;ref&gt;http://avto-nomer.ru/newforum/index.php?app=forums&amp;module=forums&amp;controller=topic&amp;id=9152&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Vehicle registration plates of Cuba|Cuba]] resolved a law on a new license plate scheme in 2013 which opted for the Euro license plate format and the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}}. The reasoning is to lower the cost while increasing the quality of the plates with the change to be completed by May 2016.&lt;ref name="cuba2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cubaheute.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/kuba-modernisiert-seine-kfz-kennzeichen/ |title=Kuba modernisiert seine Kfz-Kennzeichen |date=2013-05-22 |author=Marcel Kunzmann |publisher=Cuba Heute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tablica KR - Kranj.jpg|thumb|Euro license plate in Slovenia with a similar typeface using some FE-Schrift characteristics]]
Some countries allow the {{lang|de|FE-Schrift}} as an alternative to the standard typeface especially in combination with a Euro-style license plate. Some license plates in [[Vehicle registration plates of Ghana|Ghana]] have been issued using an FE-Schrift style. In [[Vehicle registration plates of Australia#V Plates Personalised Plates|Australia personalized plates]] may be issued with an FE-Schrift using a special design of vanity plates.

Some countries have developed a typeface for license plates with similar features: [[Vehicle registration plates of Albania|Albania]] since 2002, [[Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (country)|Georgia]] since 2014, [[Vehicle registration plates of Guinea|Guinea]], [[Vehicle registration plates of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Slovenia|Slovenia]] (2004–2008),

'''Fair trade''' is a foundation whose stated goal is to help producers in [[developing country|developing countries]] achieve better trading conditions. Members of the movement advocate the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved social and [[environmental law|environmental standards]]. The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products which are typically exported from developing countries to [[developed country|developed countries]], but also consumed in domestic markets (e.g. Brazil, India and Bangladesh) most notably [[handicrafts]], [[Economics of coffee|coffee]], [[Cocoa bean#Production|cocoa]], wine, sugar, fresh fruit, [[chocolate]], flowers and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Brough | first = David | url = http://ca.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idCAL213911220080110 | title = Briton finds ethical jewellery good as gold | newspaper = Reuters | place = [[North America|NA]] | date = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Moseley | first = WG | year = 2008 | title = Fair Trade Wine: North Africa's Post Apartheid Vineyards and the YouTube Global Economy| journal = Globalizations | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–304 | doi=10.1080/14747730802057753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement seeks to promote greater equity in international trading partnerships through dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect. It promotes [[sustainable development]] by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =WFTO | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1082&amp;Itemid=334&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade is grounded in three core beliefs; first, producers have the power to express unity with consumers. Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fair Trade from the Ground Up|last = Linton|first = April|publisher = University of Washington Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-295-99172-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of ''fair trade'' developed by [[FINE]], an informal association of four international fair trade networks: [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA). Specifically, fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, [[raising awareness|awareness raising]], and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = What | publisher = European fair trade association | url = http://www.european-fair-trade-association.org/efta/Doc/What.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several recognized fair trade certifiers, including [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (formerly called FLO, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), IMO, [[Make Trade Fair]] and Eco-Social. Additionally, [[Fair Trade USA]], formerly a licensing agency for the Fairtrade International label, broke from the system and is implementing its own fair trade labelling scheme, which has resulted in controversy due to its inclusion of independent smallholders and estates for all crops. In 2008, Fairtrade International certified approximately (€3.4B) of products.&lt;ref name="FLO2008"&gt;{{Citation | title = Facts &amp; figures | publisher = Fair trade | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/facts_and_figures.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = WTO | url = http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/its2006_e/its06_general_overview_e.pdf |format=PDF |title= General overview | year = 2006 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Trade Organization]] publishes annual figures on the world trade of goods and services.

The fair trade movement is popular in the UK, where there are 500 Fairtrade towns, 118 universities, over 6,000 churches, and over 4,000 UK schools registered in the Fairtrade Schools Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Paull | first = J | year = 2011 | contribution-url = http://orgprints.org/19527/1/Paull2011FairtradeISOFAR.pdf | contribution = The Fairtrade movement: Six lessons for the organics sector | title = Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of the International Society of Organic Agriculture Research | place = Namyangju, Korea | pages = 317–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, over 1.2 million farmers and workers in more than 60 countries participated in Fairtrade International's fair trade system, which included €65 million in fairtrade premium paid to producers for use developing their communities.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"&gt;{{Citation | title = Annual report | publisher = Fair trade | format = PDF | year = 2009 | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/2011-12_AnnualReport_web_version_small_FairtradeInternational.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fairtrade International, nearly six out of ten consumers have seen the Fairtrade mark and almost nine in ten of them trust it.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"/&gt;

Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade was actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–73|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = P. | last2 = Whetstone | first2 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Half a Cheer for Fair Trade | url = | journal = Economic Affairs | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2007.00727.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carimentrand|first1= A.|last2= Ballet|first2= J. |year=2010|title= When Fair Trade increases unfairness: The case of quinoa from Bolivia|url= http://ethique.perso.sfr.fr/Working%20paper%20FREE-Cahier%20FREE%20n%B05-2010.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"&gt;Working paper FREE-Cahier FREE n°5-2010; Doppler, F., &amp; Cabañas, A.A.

Some suppliers use relationships started in a fair trade system to autonomously springboard into direct sales relationships they negotiate themselves, whereas other direct trade systems are supplier-initiated for social responsibility reasons similar to a fair trade system.

There are a large number of fair trade and ethical marketing organizations employing different [[marketing strategies]].{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient [[volume of trade]] to affect the developing world.{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade [[coffee]] brands.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for [[community development]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bowes | first = John | year = 2010 | title = The Fair Trade Revolution | place = London | publisher = Pluto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed |date=December 2014}} The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Pages needed | date = December 2014}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Renard | first1 = MC | first2 = VP | last2 = Grovas | year = 2007 | chapter = 9.

Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers.

The marketing system for fair trade and non-fair trade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a "virtual company", paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, IA and A Crane, "Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies". ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 45: 79–92, 2003. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country, fair trade is marketed only by fair trade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by fair trade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | &amp; Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Riedel | Lopez | Widdows | Manji | 2005}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}

To become certified fair trade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;{{Citation | title = FLO-Cert | url = http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | archivedate = 2009-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with producers, cooperatives, importers and packers profiting by evading them.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, LT 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utting, K 2009, p 139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Valkila| last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

== Effect on growers ==
Fair trade is benefiting farmers in developing countries, whether that be considerably or just a little. The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon, therefore, there are diverse motives for understanding group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

[[File:Young women soil testing.jpg|thumb|Three young Nicaraguan women demonstrate to visiting US buyers and consumers the use of organic soil testing methods.|alt=Teaching organic soil testing in Nicaragua.]]

A study of coffee growers in [Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one is in charge of the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, "Why did you join?" differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fair Trade Awareness and Engagement: A Coffee Farmer's Perspective|last = Fergus|first = Andrew|date = 2014|journal = Journal of the Center of Business Ethics, Bentley University|doi = 10.1111/basr.12037|pmid = |last2 = Gray |volume=119 |issue = 3|pages=359–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their [[cooperatives]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As far as farmers' satisfaction with the fair trade system, the growers want consumers to know that fair trade has provided important support to their families and their cooperative. Overall, farmers are satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some farmers, such as the Mazaronquiari group from CAC Pangoa, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Social premium ===
A component of trade is the social premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where and how it is spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Producers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Farmers' organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocafé, has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 50 Reasons to Buy Fair Trade|last = Litvinoff|first = Miles|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7453-2584-2|location = |pages = |last2 = Madeley|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting fair trade ==
Most of the fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are some of the largest:
* The [[FLO International]] (Fairtrade International), created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fair trade Certification Mark]] in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labeling|labeled Fair trade]]. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT" /&gt; Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | contribution = Generic standards | contribution-url = http://www.fairtrade.net/generic_standards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fair Trade USA&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/ | place = US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment. Founded in 1998, Fair Trade USA currently partners with around 800 brands, as well as 1.3 million farmers and workers across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2014 | title = General media kit | publisher = Fair trade | place = US | format = PDF | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/sites/default/files/General%20Media%20Kit%202014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global Goods Partners]] (GGP), a fair-trade nonprofit organization, founded in 2005, which provides support and U.S. market access to women-led cooperatives in the developing world. 
* [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (formerly the International Fair Trade Association) is a global association created in 1989 of fair trade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national, and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).
* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS!), created in 1994, is the umbrella network of 15 national [[worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over Europe.
* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European [[alternative trading organization]]s which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.

In 1998, the first four federations listed above joined together as [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.
* Additional certifiers include IMO (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels), Eco-Social and Fair Trade USA.
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by FI to join FTF.

Student groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products.&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/universities/ |title=Universities &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA, the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/|title=Fair Trade Campaigns|website=fairtradecampaigns.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org" /&gt; and Fair Trade Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/schools/ |title=Schools &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the Fair Trade movement:

== History ==
{{Main article|History of fair trade}}
The first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade [[supply chain]]s in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = History | url = http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | publisher = IFAT | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215142239/http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | archivedate = 2006-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Unisg | title = Oikos foundation | url = http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | archivedate = 2006-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solidarity trade ===
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|Fair trade goods sold in worldshops]]
The current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archivedate = October 22, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065406/http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 |title= Where did it all begin?| accessdate = 24 June 2009 | date = 7 June 2009|publisher= WFTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1965 saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "Helping-by-Selling", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = One Village | place = Charlbury, UK |url= http://onevillage.org/fairtrade-history.htm |title = Fair trade history | last = Scott | first = Roy | date=2003-03-07 |accessdate= 2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, the oversized newsprint publication, the [[Whole Earth Catalog]], was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in US and Canada, but also in Central and South America.

In 1969, the first [[worldshop]] opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes, and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===
In the early 1980s, [[Alternative Trading Organizations]] faced major challenges: the novelty of some fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in [[commodity]] prices. Many of them came to believe it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C.

=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===
[[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at [[:File:Oldftlogos2.jpg]] for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0743-0167(02)00051-7 | last = Renard | first = M-C | year= 2003| title = Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions | url = |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=19 | pages =87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade certification initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]], and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labeling Initiatives") – led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/tasks.html | title = Main Tasks | work = Fair trade | accessdate = 27 January 2009 | year=2006 | publisher = FLO International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, FLO launched for the first time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, [[Football (ball)|footballs]], etc.

With the rise of ethical labeling, consumers are able to take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as "moral economies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of labeling give consumers the feeling of "doing the right thing" with a simple purchase.

These labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is excessively burdensome and expensive. Northern consumers are able to just make a simple choice without these burdens and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alternative production and consumption relations?: fair trade, the state, and cooperatives in the global South|journal = Journal of Contemporary African Studies|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 0258-9001|pages = 1–17|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/02589001.2012.752958|first = Michelle|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
Consumers of fair trade products usually make the intentional choice to purchase fair trade goods based on attitude, moral norms, perceived behavioral control, and social norms. It is useful to include of measure of moral norms to improve the predictive power of intentions to buy fair trade over the basic predictors, like attitude and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

University students have significantly increased their consumption of fair trade products over the last several decades. Women college students have a more favorable attitude than men toward buying fair trade products and they feel more morally obligated to do so. Women are also reported to have stronger intentions to buy fair trade products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Differences in Psychosocial Determinants of University Students' Intentions to Buy Fair Trade Products|last = Valois|first = Pierre|date = 16 May 2014|journal = Journal of Consumer Policy|doi = 10.1007/s10603-014-9262-4|pmid = |last2 = de Leeuw|last3 = Morin|last4 = Schmidt |volume=37 |issue = 4|pages=485–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to the intentions to buy fair trade products, gender had no direct effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Producers organize and strive for fair trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or simply because they want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with [[organic farming]] than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Product certification ==
{{Main article|Fair trade certification}}
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labeling system, see [[Fairtrade certification]]''
[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|200px|International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]
Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.

Fairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.

The Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.

There is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word "producer" in many different senses, often in the same specification document. Sometimes it refers to farmers, sometimes to the primary cooperatives they belong to, to the secondary cooperatives that the primary cooperatives belong to, or to the tertiary cooperatives that the secondary cooperatives may belong to&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

== WFTO Fair Trade Organization membership ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade product certification system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products in the case of FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/the-fairtrade-marks.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): The Fairtrade Marks |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fairtrade-sourcing-programs.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the same round logo alongside the word '''FAIRTRADE''' in black and underneath the program title in '''&lt;span style="color:turquoise"&gt;turquoise&lt;/span&gt;'''.

== Alternative trading organizations ==
{{Main article|Alternative trading organization}}
[[File:Cafedirectcoffeeshop.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cafedirect]] coffee shop on [[Regent Street]] in central London.]]

An alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming "to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets".&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25"&gt;European Fair Trade Association (1998). Fair Trade Yearbook: Towards 2000. p.23 &amp; 25&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative trading organizations have Fair Trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], and combine their marketing with awareness-raising and campaigning.

Alternative trading organizations are often, but not always, based in political and religious groups, though their secular purpose precludes sectarian identification and evangelical activity. Philosophically, the grassroots political-action agenda of these organizations associates them with progressive political causes active since the 1960s: foremost, a belief in [[collective action]] and commitment to moral principles based on social, economic and [[trade justice]].

According to EFTA, the defining characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect – partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade "humanizes" the trade process – making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work.&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25" /&gt; Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, [[Equal Exchange]] and SERRV International in the US and [[Equal Exchange Trading]], [[Traidcraft]], Oxfam Trading, [[Twin Trading]] and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.

== Universities ==
The concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the [[United Kingdom]], where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A Fair Trade University is one that develops all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]], David Barnhill, started a push to become the first Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups—faculty, staff, support staff, and students—to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh also offers many courses in many different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to [[Peru]] to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the [[Earth Charter]] and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses make fair trade the center of the class.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sustainability in Higher Education|last = Feldman|first = James|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-262-01949-1|location = |pages = 241–248|last2 = Barnhill|jstor = j.ctt9qf6bw.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010, the [[University of California, San Diego]] became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego understood the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a "feel good" movement. The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea can make a real difference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Worldshops ==
{{Main article|Worldshop}}
[[File:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|[[Oxfam#Shops|Oxfam shop]] on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]]]
Worldshops or fair trade shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational fair trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns. Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks. Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Worldshops' aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeaday.com/|title=fairtradeday.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a different fair trade item is featured each day.

== World wide ==
Every year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over $500 million USD. In the case of coffee, sales grow nearly 50% per year in certain countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raynolds | first1 = Laura T | first2 = Douglas | last2 = Murray | first3 = Peter Leigh | last3 = Taylor | title = Fair Trade Coffee: Building Producers Capacity Via Global Networks | journal = Journal of International Development | year = 2004 | pages = 1109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 16,000 tons of Fairtrade coffee was purchased by consumers in 17 countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; "Fair trade coffee is currently produced in 24 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia".&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; The 165 FLO associations in Latin America and Caribbean are located in 14 countries and together export over 85% of the world's Fair Trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; There is a North/South divide of fair trade products with producers in the South and consumers in the North. Discrepancies in the perspectives of these southern producers and northern consumers are often the source of ethical dilemmas such as how the purchasing power of consumers may or may not promote the development of southern countries.&lt;ref name="Moore, Geoff 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Moore | first = Geoff | title = The Fair Trade Movement: Parameters, Issues and Future Research | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 53 | issue = 1/2 | year = 2004 | pages = 73–86 | doi=10.1023/b:busi.0000039400.57827.c3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst the continuous growth, "[p]urchasing patterns of fairtrade products have remained strong despite the global economic downturn.

=== Africa ===
Africa's exports come from the places such as South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. These exports are valued at $24 million USD.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009"&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., and Siphelo Unathi Ngcwangu. "Fair Trade Rooibos Tea: Connecting South African Producers and American Consumer Markets." Geoforum (2009): 74-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years of 2004 and 2006 Africa quickly expanded their number of FLO certified producer groups, rising from 78 to 171; nearly half of which reside in Kenya, following closely behind are Tanzania and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; The FLO products Africa is known for are tea, cocoa, flowers and wine.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; In Africa there are smallholder cooperatives and plantations which produce Fair Trade certified tea.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; Cocoa-producing countries in West Africa often form cooperatives that produce [[fair trade cocoa]] such as [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; West African countries without strong fair trade industries are subject to deterioration in cocoa quality as they compete with other countries for a profit. These countries include [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Studies in the early 2000s show that the income, education and health of coffee producers involved with Fair Trade in Latin America were improved, versus producers who were not participating.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011"&gt;Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie, and Eric J. Arnould. "Alternative Trade Organization and Subjective Quality of Life: The Case of Latin American Coffee Producers." Journal of Macromarketing (2011): 276-290. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru and Guatemala, having the biggest population of coffee producers, make use of some of the most substantial land for coffee production in Latin America and do so by taking part in Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011" /&gt; Countries in Latin America are also large exporters of [[fair trade bananas]]. The [[Dominican Republic]] is the largest producer of fair trade bananas, followed by [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]]. Producers in the Dominican Republic have set up associations rather than cooperatives so that individual farmers can each own their own land but meet regularly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fundación Solidaridad was created in [[Chile]] to increase the earnings and social participation of handicraft producers. These goods are marketed locally in Chile and internationally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Fair trade handicraft and jewellery production has also shown a significant uplift over recent years, aided by North American and European online retailers developing direct relationships to import and sell the products online. The sale of fair trade handicrafts online has been of particular importance in aiding the development of female artisans in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|title=mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The Asia Fair Trade Forum aims to increase the competency of fair trade organizations in Asia so they can be more competitive in the global market. Garment factories in Asian countries including [[China]], [[Burma]], and [[Bangladesh]] consistently receive charges of human rights violations, including the use of child labour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; These violations conflict with the principles outlined by fair trade certifiers. In [[India]], Trade Alternative Reform Action (Tara) Projects formed in the 1970s have worked to increase production capacity, quality standards, and entrance into markets for home-based craftsmen that were previously unattainable due to their lower caste identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
The Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand (FTAANZ) is a member-based organization that supports two systems of fair trade. The first is the Australia and New Zealand member of FLO International, which unites Fairtrade producer and labelling initiatives across Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The second, is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), of over 450 worldwide members, to which FTAANZ is one. Fairtrade (one word) refers to FLO certified commodity and associated products. Fair trade (two words) encompasses the wider Fair Trade movement, including the Fairtrade commodities and other artisan craft products.

==Commodities ==
Fair trade commodities are goods that have been exchanged from where they were grown or made to where they are purchased, and have been certified by a fair trade certification organization, such as [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. Such organizations are typically overseen by Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International sets international fair trade standards and supports fair trade producers and cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/about_us.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the fair trade market revolves around food products such as coffee, tea, cocoa, honey, and bananas.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000"&gt;Raynolds, Laura. "Re-embedding Global Agriculture: The International Organic and Fair Trade Movements." Agriculture and Human Values 17.3 (2000): 297-309.

It has been suggested by Shima Baradaran of Brigham Young University that fair trade techniques could be productively applied to products which might involve [[child labor]].&lt;ref name="Fair Trade and Child Labor"&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Stephanie H. |last2=Barclay|title=Fair Trade and Child Labor|journal=Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Forthcoming|date=April 26, 2011|ssrn=1823546|accessdate=|author=Shima Baradaran|quote=fair trade should be considered as a proven alternative to current strategies to eliminate child labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fair trade represents only .01% of the food and beverage industry in the United States, it is growing rapidly and may become a significant portion of the national food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., Douglas L. Murray, and John Wilkinson. Fair Trade: The Challenges of Transforming Globalization. London: Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coffee ===
{{Main article|Fair trade coffee}}
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Coffee is the most well-established fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade coffee is ''[[Coffea arabica]],'' a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put on the quality of the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestlé use fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/94|journal = Social Problems|date = 2012-02-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 94–116|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1525/sp.2012.59.1.94|first = Daniel|last = Jaffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards have been outlined by FLO and are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups, buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships, buyers must pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or when the market price is higher, they must pay the market price, and finally, buyers must also pay a social premium of 20 cents per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee $1.40 per pound; the price increases to $1.70 per pound if the coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
The largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Starbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations. Several competitors, including Nestlé, followed suit.&lt;ref name="Jaffee, Daniel 2012 pp. 94-116"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel: "Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement." Social Problems, Vol. 59, No. 1 (February 2012), pp. 94-116&lt;/ref&gt; Large corporations that sell non-fair trade coffee take 55% of what consumers pay for coffee while only 10% goes to the producers. Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fastest expanding fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. Even the incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely fair prices for their commodity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ransom, David. The No-nonsense Guide to Fair Trade. Oxford: New Internationalist Publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsustainable farming practices can harm plantation owners and laborers. Unsustainable practices such as using chemicals and unshaded growing are risky. Small growers who put themselves at economic risk by not having diverse farming practices could lose money and resources due to fluctuating coffee prices, pest problems, or policy shifts.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999"&gt;Rice, Robert A (1999). "A Place Unbecoming: The Coffee Farm of Northern Latin America." Geographical Review: 89(4): 554-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/notsofairtrade|accessdate=3 July 2014|title=Agriculture in Ethiopia and Uganda: Not so fair trade|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
As coffee becomes one of the most important export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and [[Coffea]] trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999" /&gt;

Fair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;DeCarlo, Jacqueline. Fair Trade: A Beginner's Guide. Oxford, England: Oneworld, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer attitudes ====
Consumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelsmacker | first1 = De | last2 = Patrick | first2 = | last3 = Driesen | first3 = Liesbeth | last4 = Rayp | first4 = Glenn | year = 2005| title = Do Consumers Care about Ethics?

[[Safeway Inc.]] began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel.

=== Cocoa ===
Many countries that export [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] rely on cocoa as their single export crop. In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008"&gt;Willer, Helga; Yussefi-Menzler, Minou und Sorensen, Neil, (Hrsg.) (2008) "The World of Organic Agriculture – Statistics and Emerging Trends 2008." IFOAM, Bonn and FiBL, Frick&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Locations ====
Cocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is an organic and regulated by an [[Internal control]] system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008" /&gt; Côte d'Ivoire exports over a third of the world's cocoa beans.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007"&gt;Brown, Michael Barratt. "'Fair Trade' with Africa." Review of African Political Economy 34.112 (2007): 267-77&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world's cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcocoafoundation.org/our-work/where-we-work/ |title=Where We Work |publisher=World Cocoa Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labour ====
One suggestion for the reason that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007" /&gt; Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012"&gt;Houston, Holly, and Terry Wyer. "Why Sustainable Cocoa Farming Matters for Rural Development." Center for Strategic and International Studies, 6 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | url = | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891–915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlan | first1 = Amanda | year = 2008 | title = Making or Marketing a Difference? An Anthropological Examination of the Marketing of Fair Trade Cocoa from Ghana | url = | journal = Research in Economic Anthropology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 171–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Marketing ====
The marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays the cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It puts the balance of power in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008" /&gt;

Consumers often aren't willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
Smallholding farmers not only frequently lack access to markets, they lack access to resources that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012" /&gt; One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.

==== Harkin-Engel Protocol ====
The [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement that was created to end some of the world's worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry. It was first negotiated by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel after watching a documentary that showed the cocoa industry's widespread issue of child slavery and trafficking. The parties involved agreed to a six-article plan:

# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan—The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit "significant resources" to address the problem.
# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups—By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor.
# Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO—By 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor.
# Memorandum of cooperation—By 1 May 2002, Establish a joint action program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Establish a monitor and compliance with the standards.
# Establish a joint foundation—By 1 July 2002, industry will form a foundation to oversee efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. It will perform field projects and be a clearinghouse on best practices.
# Building toward credible standards—By 1 July 2005, the industry will develop and implement industry-wide standards of public certification that cocoa has been grown without any of the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/documents-manager/english/54-harkin-engel-protocol/file |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208022828/http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/documents-manager/english/54-harkin-engel-protocol/file |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textiles ===
Fair trade [[textile]]s are primarily made from fair trade cotton. By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="Farmers' self-determination"&gt;Singh Anup Kumar. in E+Z / D+C [http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/fairtrade-improving-cotton-farmers-lot-africa-and-india] February, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
India, Pakistan and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010"&gt;Bassett, Thomas J. "Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa." Geoforum, 2010. 41(1): 44-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998"&gt;Littrell, M. A., and M. A. Dickson. "Fair Trade Performance in a Competitive Market." Clothing and Textiles Research Journal 16.4 (1998): 176-89&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Labour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and [[child labor]] is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000"&gt;Grimes, Kimberly M., and B. Lynne Milgram. Artisans and Cooperatives: Developing Alternative Trade for the Global Economy. Tucson: University of Arizona, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000" /&gt; For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, [[World Fair Trade Organization]]s require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998" /&gt;

However, making cotton and textiles fair trade does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010" /&gt;

Textiles and garments are intricate and require one individual operator, in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Forced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of [[sweatshop]] labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using [[forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati, Jagdish.

=== Seafood ===
With increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the [[seafood]] industry prompted new efforts. In 2014, [[Fair Trade USA]] created its Capture Fisheries Program that led to the first instance of Fair Trade fish being sold globally in 2015. The program "requires fishermen to source and trade according to standards that protect fundamental human rights, prevent forced and child labor, establish safe working conditions, regulate work hours and benefits, and enable responsible resource management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Responsibility in the Global Seafood Industry|url=https://www.fishwise.org/images/white_papers/Social_Responsibility_in_the_Global_Seafood_Industry.pdf|website=FishWise|publisher=FishWise|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large companies and commodities ===
Large transnational companies have begun to use fair trade commodities in their products. In April 2000, [[Starbucks]] began offering fair trade coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of fair trade coffee over the next 18 months. This would account for a quarter of the fair trade coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks' total coffee purchases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; The company maintains that increasing its fair trade purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macdonald | first1 = Kate | year = 2007 | title = Globalising Justice within Coffee Supply Chains? Fair Trade, Starbucks and the Transformation of Supply Chain Governance | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 793–812 | doi=10.1080/01436590701336663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade activists have made gains with other companies: [[Sara Lee Corporation]] in 2002 and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (the maker of [[Folgers]]) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of fair trade coffee. [[Nestlé]], the world's biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of fair trade coffee in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In 2006, [[The Hershey Company]] acquired [[Dagoba Chocolate|Dagoba]], an organic and fair trade chocolate brand.

Much contention surrounds the issue of fair trade products becoming a part of large companies. Starbucks is still only 3% fair trade – enough to appease consumers, but not enough to make a real difference to small farmers, according to some activists. The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Luxury commodities ===

There have been efforts to introduce fair trade practices to the [[luxury goods]] industry, particularly for gold and diamonds.

==== Diamonds and sourcing ====

In parallel to efforts to commoditize diamonds, some industry players have launched campaigns to introduce benefits to mining centers in the developing world. Rapaport Fair Trade was established with the goal "to provide ethical education for jewelry suppliers, buyers, first time or seasoned diamond buyers, social activists, students, and anyone interested in jewelry, trends, and ethical luxury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapaportfairtrade.com/What-is-RapFT/About.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Rapaport Fair Trade |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's founder, [[Martin Rapaport]], as well as [[Kimberley Process]] initiators Ian Smillie and [[Global Witness]], are among several industry insiders and observers who have called for greater checks and certification programs among many other programs that would ensure protection for miners and producers in developing countries. Smillie and Global Witness have since withdrawn support for the Kimberley Process. Other concerns in the diamond industry include working conditions in diamond cutting centers as well as the use of child labor. Both of these concerns come up when considering issues in Surat, India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/02/rough_cut Rough Cut] Foreign Policy, 2 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gold ====
Brilliant Earth has committed itself to using fair-trade-certified gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Couple-s-ringing-endorsement-of-ethical-jewelry-3217614.php Couple's ringing endorsement of ethical jewelry] SFGate&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the United Kingdom's Fairtrade Foundation became the first NGO to begin certifying gold under the fair trade rubric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/fairtrade-gold |title=Fairtrade Gold &amp;#124; Shaping Sustainable Markets |publisher=Shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography or Sex industry ===
The concept of fair trade also influence the [[porn]] industry. Feminist columnists in several publication have written articles toward a pornography industry with mutual consent and no exploiting labor condition to actors and actresses. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/ethical-porn-474913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ethical-porn/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also academic discourse about these facets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.888251|title = Fair-trade porn + niche markets + feminist audience|journal = Porn Studies|volume = 1|pages = 189–192|year = 2014|last1 = Mondin|first1 = Alessandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0966735010384332|title = Fair Trade Sex: Reflections on God, Sex, and Economics|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 194–207|year = 2010|last1 = Cooper|first1 = Thia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
[[File:Faitrade display.jpg|thumb|Display of Fairtrade products at the [[Derbyshire County Council]] head office]]
In 1994, the [[European Commission]] prepared the "Memo on alternative trade" in which it declared its support for strengthening Fair Trade in the South and North and its intention to establish an EC Working Group on Fair Trade. Furthermore, the same year, the [[European Parliament]] adopted the "Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade" (OJ C 44, 14 February 1994), a resolution voicing its support for fair trade. In 1996, the [[Economic and Social Committee]] adopted an "Opinion on the European 'Fair Trade' marking movement". A year later, in 1997, the document was followed by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament, calling on the [[European Commission]] to support Fair Trade banana operators. The same year, the European Commission published a survey on "Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas", concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.&lt;ref name="FINE2006"&gt;FINE (2006). Business Unusual. Brussels: Fair Trade Advocacy Office&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the European Parliament adopted the "Resolution on Fair Trade" (OJ C 226/73, 20 July 1998), which was followed by the Commission in 1999 that adopted the "Communication from the Commission to the Council on 'Fair Trade'" COM(1999) 619 final, 29 November 1999. In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea. Furthermore, that year, the [[Cotonou Agreement]] made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23(g) and in the Compendium. The [[European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC]] also suggested promoting Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In 2001 and 2002, several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the 2001 Green Paper on [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] and the 2002 Communication on Trade and Development.

In 2004, the [[European Union]] adopted the "Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty – A proposal for an EU Action Plan", with a specific reference to the Fair Trade movement which has "been setting the trend for a more socio-economically responsible trade." (COM(2004)0089). In 2005, in the European Commission communication "Policy Coherence for Development – Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals", (COM(2005) 134 final, 12 April 2005), fair trade is mentioned as "a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development".&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt;

On July 6, 2006, the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on fair trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the Fair Trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on Fair Trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under fair trade to protect it from abuse and calling for greater support to Fair Trade (EP resolution "Fair Trade and development", 6 July 2006). "This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing," said [[European Green Party|Green]] MEP [[Frithjof Schmidt]] during the plenary debate. [[Peter Mandelson]], EU Commissioner for External Trade, responded that the resolution will be well received at the [[European Commission]]. "Fair Trade makes the consumers think and therefore it is even more valuable. We need to develop a coherent policy framework and this resolution will help us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade-advocacy.org/ftao-publications/press-releases/press-release-2006/157-european-parliament-supports-fair-trade|title=European Parliament supports Fair Trade|website=www.fairtrade-advocacy.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In 2005, French [[French National Assembly|parliament]] member [[Antoine Herth]] issued the report "40 proposals to sustain the development of Fair Trade". The report was followed the same year by a law, proposing to establish a commission to recognize fair trade Organisations (article 60 of law no. 2005-882, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2 August 2005).&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In parallel to the legislativents, also in 2006, the French chapter of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (AFNOR) adopted a reference document on Fair Trade after five years of discussion.

=== Italy ===
In 2006, Italian lawmakers started debating how to introduce a law on fair trade in [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]]. A consultation process involving a wide range of stakeholders was launched in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214105/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common definition of fair trade was most notably developed. However, its adoption is still pending as the efforts were stalled by the [[2008 Italian political crisis]].

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] was sued in 2007 by coffee supplier [[Douwe Egberts]] for explicitly requiring its coffee suppliers to meet fair trade criteria, most notably the payment of a minimum price and a development premium to producer cooperatives. Douwe Egberts, which sells a number of coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria, believed the requirements were discriminatory. After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the province of Groningen prevailed in a well-publicized judgement. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: "it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their purchasing policy to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution is made in the fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee".&lt;ref&gt;Max Havelaar Foundation (2007). [85.82.218.199/fileadmin/Bruger_filer/Dokument_database/IKAvaerktoej/EU_siden/Max_Havalaar.pdf Dutch Province of Groningen wins summary brought by Doug Egberts and can continue specifying fair trade coffee]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Main article|Fair trade debate}}
{{Criticism section|date=February 2013}}
While there have been studies claiming fair trade as beneficial and efficient,&lt;ref name="Bacon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bacon|first=Christopher|title=Confronting the Coffee Crisis: Can Fair Trade, Organic, and Specialty Coffees Reduce Small-Scale Farmer Vulnerability in Northern Nicaragua?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X04002062|accessdate=31 December 2012|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.10.002|volume=33|issue=3|journal=World Development|pages=497–511|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; other studies have been less favourable; showing limitations to fair trade benefits. Sometimes the criticism is intrinsic to fair trade, sometimes efficiency depends on the broader context such as the lack of government help or volatile prices in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Utting-chamorro|first=Karla|title=Does fair trade make a difference?

=== Ethical basis===
Studies have shown a significant number of consumers were content to pay higher prices for fair trade products, in the belief that this helps the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchising.com/news/20080612_costa_coffee_hosts_national_foundation_day_to_enco.html |title=Costa Coffee Hosts National 'Foundation Day' To Encourage Ethical Coffee Consumption |publisher=Franchising.com |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Niemi|first= N. |year=2010|title=Empowering Coffee Traders?

Furthermore, research has cited the implementation of certain Fairtrade standards as a cause for greater inequalities in markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"/&gt;

=== What occurs with the money? ===

==== Little money may reach the developing countries ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much extra retailers charge for fair trade goods, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers, in spite of l unfair trading legislation. In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing on less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valkila | first1 = J. | last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P. | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

==== Less money reaches farmers ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C.E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures&lt;ref name="Labelling"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International |title=Annual Report 2009–2010 |year= 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |url= http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; are that 40% of the money reaching the [[developing world]] is spent on 'business and production' which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65–69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on developing world market information systems is given at [http://www.sim2g.org/ sim2.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). "Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee". ''Journal of Business Research'' 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua – Sustainable development or a poverty trap? ''Ecological Economics'' 68 3018–25; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====
A 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"/&gt;

=== Inefficient marketing system ===
One reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. [[Brink Lindsey]] calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134810/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===

==== Overproduction argument ====
Critics argue that fair trade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fair trade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality. Economists&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Brink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) 'Half a Cheer for Fair Trade', Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harford, T: "The Undercover Economist.", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Markets, poverty, and Fair Trade | author = Sam Bowman | date = 11 March 2011 | url = http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-and-economy/markets,-poverty,-and-fair-trade/ | publisher = [[Adam Smith Institute]] | accessdate = 2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = The Economist | date = Dec 7, 2006 | url = http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380592 | title = Voting with your trolley }}&lt;/ref&gt; state that, if this is indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.{{refneeded|date=October 2017}}

=== Other ethical issues ===

==== Secrecy ====
Under EU law ([[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Directive 2005/29/EC]] on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' [[Peter Griffiths (economist)| 	
Peter Griffiths]] (2011)&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.

==== Unethical selling techniques ====
[[Philip Booth (economist)|Philip Booth]] says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437&lt;/ref&gt; There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=807 |title=IDS Bookshop – Item details |publisher=Ntd.co.uk |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way?

=== Failure to monitor standards ===
There are complaints that the standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes making them work several months more for little return.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utting-Chamorro | first1 = K | year = 2005 | title = Does Fairtrade make a difference?

Adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor, and enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is weak. Notably by Christian Jacquiau&lt;ref name="Hamel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 |title=Fair trade firm accused of foul play I |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations&lt;ref name="Hamel" /&gt; There are many complaints of poor enforcement problems: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.

It reported that "The FT was also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received an organic, Fair Trade or other certifications despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html | newspaper =FT | place = Americas | title = The bitter cost of 'fair trade' coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade justice and fair trade ===
Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for allegedly focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger effect on disadvantaged producers' lives. French author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Boris | first = Jean-Pierre | year = 2005 | title = Commerce inéquitable | publisher = Hachette Littératures | place = Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political objections ===
There have been largely political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. [[state monopoly|government monopoly]]) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.{{Sfn | Jacquiau | 2006}}{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flood Ladies''' were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic [[1966 flood of the Arno]] as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

==History==
Following the devastating flooding that damaged and destroyed cultural treasures of Florence, Italy in 1966, while those losses can never be replaced, the generosity of some of Italy’s most significant women artists of the 20th century as well as distinguished painters and sculptors from around the world brought donations of hundreds of notable creative works to the city.

In 2014 the City of Florence opened the "Museum of the 1900s" to showcase these works.

The story of the Flood Ladies was chronicled in the 2014 book "When the World Answered. Florence, Women Artists and the 1966 Flood" and the 2015 PBS documentary of the same name.

'''Friends of South Asia''' (FOSA) is a California, United States based social and political activist organization. Founded jointly in 2001 by Americans of Pakistani and Indian origins, the group describes its mission as "achieve a peaceful, prosperous, and hate-free South Asia...work[ing] through people-to-people contacts, dialog, and other non-violent, non-exclusionary means.".&lt;ref name="fosa-homepage"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Friends of South Asia | work=Friends of South Asia (FOSA) | url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/ | accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOSA activism has touched upon issues inside South Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Ashfaque Swapan | title=South Asian Community Rallies to Provide Earthquake Relief | date=October 14, 2005 | publisher=India West | url=http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=f9fd4fb90534cb3a08f233b8f5b8bab2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peacenews"&gt;{{Cite news| author=AH Cemendtaur| title=Learning the ropes of peace activism | date=May 2003 | publisher=Peace News | url=http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2450/245017.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as outside South Asia such as those relating to Israel and United States policy in Cuba and Venezuela among others.&lt;ref name="pulsemedia.org"&gt;[http://pulsemedia.org/2010/05/09/boycott-israel-amitav-ghosh-the-dan-david-prize/ Boycott Israel?

==History==
FOSA was founded in December 2001 by a group of nine [[Pakistani American]]s and [[Indian American]]s, concerned that "the place we call home was full of war cries and that South Asia was on the brink of a war."&lt;ref name="peacenews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle-gathering"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Raj Jayadev | title=Indian-Pakistani peace gathering | date=January 6, 2002 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/01/06/MN122501.DTL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members organized candlelight vigils&lt;ref name="asianweek-vigils"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Suzanne Lee | title=Bay Area South Asians Kick-off Monthly Global Peace Vigils | date=February 1, 2002 | publisher=AsianWeek | url=http://www.asianweek.com/2002_02_01/bay_southasian.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and letter-writing campaigns &lt;ref name="chronicle-relatives"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Ryan Kim |author2=Matthew B.

FOSA registered as a tax-exempt non-profit charitable entity in Arts, Culture and Humanities category with United States’ Internal Revenue Services. Its non-profit status remains revoked by United States’ Internal Revenue Services, as of November 2013, because FOSA has failed to file required annual reports and certifications under United States laws for three consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6LGxZhY5Y?url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/45-0529949/friends-south-asia.aspx Friends of South Asia] Guidestar Non-profit Company Reports, United States (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions and activities==
Friends of South Asia was described by ''[[Metro Santa Cruz]]'' in April 2006 as "a hodgepodge of mostly secular-leaning South Asian Hindus and Muslims—university students, Silicon Valley engineers moonlighting as activists, etc.—who regularly organize local vigils, poetry readings, films and speaker events relating to South Asian issues."&lt;ref name="metrosc-mathew"&gt;{{Cite news| title=The Terrorists Are Here!

===Bangladesh garment worker rights===
Friends of South Asia organized and participated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiawest.com/news/11311-protestors-demand-gap-sign-bangladesh-worker-safety-accord.html#AXrE5HQPBbfeBzp6.99 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121143756/http://www.indiawest.com/news/11311-protestors-demand-gap-sign-bangladesh-worker-safety-accord.html#AXrE5HQPBbfeBzp6.99 |archivedate=2013-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in protests against Walmart and Gap for buying clothes in Bangladesh. They claimed it is always a race to the bottom in garment industry: they give the contract to whoever produces the goods most cheaply, that vendors will be certain to take out their share, leaving very little for wages and improving workplace safety.

===Campaign against FDI, for agrarian livelihood rights in India===
Friends of South Asia has actively participated in a campaign to block foreign direct investment projects in India, and in support of traditional way of life and agrarian livelihoods. For example, activists of FOSA participated and co-authored a report on [[POSCO India]], by forming a so-called Mining Zone Peoples’ Solidarity Group. This activism targeted to stop the $12 billion foreign direct investment by the South Korean company in the Indian state of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. The co-authors of this report included others such as [[Biju Mathew]] and Balmurli Natrajan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miningzone.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Iron-and-Steal.pdf Iron and Steal: The Posco-India Story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanhati.com/articles/3634/ Sanhati] Anti-Posco Letters and Media Releases (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, FOSA independently, as well as the front organization Mining Zone Peoples’ Solidarity Group, co-signed and submitted a letter to the Prime Minister of India asking that the POSCO project be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aidindia.org/main/index.php?option=com_facileforms&amp;Itemid=464 Letter to the Prime Minister of India] It is time to consign the Posco project to the scrap heap&lt;/ref&gt;

===California Hindu textbook controversy===
Friends of South Asia was a prominent participant in the [[Californian Hindu textbook controversy]],&lt;ref name="metroactive-textbook"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Vrinda Normand | title=Battling the Past: Indian parents and scholars go to war over how Hindu history is taught in California schools | date=February 1, 2006 | publisher=Metroactive | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.01.06/hindus-0605.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fosa-textbook"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Speak Out Against the Hindutva Assault on California's History Textbooks | work=Friends of South Asia (FOSA) | url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/textbook/ | accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it joined a number of other groups in petitioning [[California]]'s Curriculum Commission to reject allegedly revisionist edits to California's textbook curriculum on Hinduism and India, as suggested by two American Hindu organizations.

FOSA has an informal organizational structure, and a number of members have served as spokespeople. In 2006, during the textbook controversy, graduate student Anupama Mandavilli was a primary spokesperson.&lt;ref name="harvardcrimson-letter"&gt;{{Cite news| title=After Letter, Prof Gets Hate E-mail | date=March 14, 2006 | publisher=The Harvard Crimson | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle-groupslose"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Charles Burress | title=Hindu groups lose fight to change textbooks / But decision by state Board of Education is supported by some Hindu Americans | date=March 10, 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/10/BAGVSHK6JK63.DTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="argus-denied"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Jonathan Jones | title=Hindu group's motion to block texts denied | date=April 26, 2006 | publisher=Fremont Argus | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_3752496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Group members have often collaborated with or co-sponsored events with other [[California]] South Asian American anti-[[Communalism (South Asia)|communal]] organizations like EKTA&lt;ref name="beyond-border-pr"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Beyond Borders: Joint Indo-Pak Fundraiser for Earthquake Relief | work=Friends of South Asia (FOSA) | url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/events/SAquake/BeyondBordersPressRelease.html | accessdate=2006-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Coalition against Communalism]].&lt;ref name="fosa-cac-textbook-position-faq"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Controversial Modifications to California's History Textbooks: FOSA/CAC's Position on the Issue | work=Friends of South Asia (FOSA) and the Coalition Against Communalism (CAC) | url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/textbook/FOSA_CAC_Position.html | accessdate=2006-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemnation of Indo-U.S. civil nuclear deal===
The group advocates against what they term "militarism in India, Pakistan, and the United States." According to a 2006 statement, "We express our deepest disappointment with the recently concluded visit of George Bush to India and Pakistan, and unequivocally condemn the [[Indo-U.S. civilian nuclear agreement|Indo-US nuke deal]]...The United States' imperial designs in its war on Afghanistan and Iraq and the submission of the Indian and Pakistani governments to go along, is not lost on their people who came out in thousands in both countries to protest against Bush and his agenda."&lt;ref name="dailytimes"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Bush’s visit disappoints South Asian group  | date=March 9, 2006 | publisher=Daily Times | url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C03%5C09%5Cstory_9-3-2006_pg7_52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemnation of Israel===
Friends of South Asia endorsed and sponsored speeches and signed letters denouncing Israel as a colonial occupier of Palestine. In 2010, it criticized novelist [[Amitav Ghosh]] for accepting the [[Dan David Prize]] from the President of Israel.&lt;ref name="pulsemedia.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inminds.com/article.php?id=10382 Groups: Amitav Ghosh, don't accept Dan David prize] In Minds, May 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it endorsed a letter declaring Israel as a colonial occupier of Palestine.&lt;ref name="answercoalition.org"/&gt;

===Condemnation of United States policy in Cuba and Venezuela===
Friends of South Asia has endorsed letters, protests and rally calling United States' policy in Venezuela and Cuba as hostile, the current governments in Venezuela and Cuba as progressive.&lt;ref name="answercoalition.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=2352 Goldstone Report on Gaza] Endorsement List, September 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary events===
The group holds an annual literary event in August, celebrating the [[Independence Day (India)|Indian]] and [[Independence Day (Pakistan)|Pakistani]] Independence days with readings in Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Kannada, Gujarati, and English. Topics have included "South Asian Writings on War and Terrorism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/events/litevening05/ |title=Friends of South Asia's Second Annual Literary Evening |author=Friends of South Asia |year=2005 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Revisiting Changing Homelands,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/events/litevening05/ |title=Friends of South Asia's Fourth Annual Literary Evening and Joint Celebration of Indian and Pakistani Independence Days |author=Friends of South Asia |year=2006 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Language of Food."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/events/litevening05/ |title=Friends of South Asia's Sixth Annual Literary Evening and Joint Celebration of the 63rd Anniversary of India and Pakistan's Independence |author=Friends of South Asia |year=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and criticism==

===Corruption allegations against Benazir Bhutto===
Former Pakistani Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] spoke at [[Stanford University]] in October 2001.&lt;ref name="stanford-review-bhutto"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Justin Diener | title=Stanford Students Meet the First Female Prime Minister of Pakistan | date=October 24, 2001 | publisher=Stanford Review | url=http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXVII/Issue_2/News/news2.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Stanford Report'', "a handful of protesters who called themselves 'concerned Pakistani students' and 'friends of South Asia' held signs promoting peace and passed out fliers detailing corruption charges against Bhutto -- charges she disputed during her talk."&lt;ref name="stanford-report-bhutto"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Meredith Alexander | title=Benazir Bhutto, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, expresses support for war effort | date=October 19, 2001 | publisher=Stanford Report | url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2001/october24/bhutto-1024.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berkeley-journalism-bhutto"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Mary Nicole Nazzaro | title=Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto Visits Stanford University | publisher=UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism Asia Pacific Project | url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/asiaproject/nazzaro.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosponsorship of event with PAA===
On May 15, 2005, FOSA organized a San Francisco march for peace in support of the 2005 India-Pakistan peace march, with the help of seven local co-sponsors, including the Pakistan American Alliance (PAA).&lt;ref name="fosa-peacemarch-2003"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Ind-Pak Peace Solidarity March in San Francisco | work=Friends of South Asia (FOSA) | url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/events/indpakpeace/ | accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week after the event, an anonymous online critic of the [[Association for India's Development]] pointed out that the Pakistan American Alliance's website included an image of a man holding a placard reading "Allah will destroy the terrorist state of India"&lt;ref name="aidindiainfo-antiindians"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Allah will destroy the terrorist state of India | work=AID (Association for India's Development) Documents Repository | url=http://www.geocities.com/aid_india_info/AID_DOC.html#anti_Indians | accessdate=2006-04-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207103130/http://www.geocities.com/aid_india_info/AID_DOC.html|archivedate=2006-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aidindiainfo-paa-pdf"&gt;{{Cite web | title=PAA co-sponsors Kashmiris rally in New York | work=AID (Association for India's Development) Documents Repository | url=http://www.geocities.com/aid_india_info/doc22.pdf | accessdate=2006-04-25 | format=PDF | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/aid_india_info/doc22.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:07:41 | archivedate=2009-10-25 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at an October 2004 rally in New York City co-organized by the New York chapter of PAA.&lt;ref name="paa-newyork"&gt;{{Cite web| title=PAA co-sponsors Kashmiris rally in New York | work=Pakistan American Alliance | url=http://www.pakalliance.org/html/ny_protest.html | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOSA responded by deleting references to the Pakistan American Alliance from their website, and issuing an update stating that they were disturbed by the photo and had been unaware of PAA's politics, which were contrary to their own.&lt;ref name="fosa-paa"&gt;{{Cite web| title=

===Metroactive===
In 2006, Mihir Meghani, president of the [[Hindu American Foundation]] was quoted in [[Silicon Valley]] newspaper ''[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metroactive]]'' saying that "It's pretty well known that they're [FOSA] tied with the Communist Party in India...It's really a ploy to break down and dissemble [sic] Hinduism." ''Metroactive'' also reported on an anonymous email received by FOSA, in which the sender threatened to "slaughter" members, singling out those who "use Hindu names and backstab Hindus."&lt;ref name="metroactive-textbook"/&gt;

===Controversy about speakers===
Speakers hosted by Friends of South Asia have been subject of controversy.
;Biju Mathew and Stanford University
In 2006, FOSA invited Professor Biju Mathew ([[Rider University]]) to speak at [[Stanford University]] about labor organizing among New York City taxi drivers, globalization, and the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name="fosa-mathew"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Biju Mathew in the San Francisco Bay Area  | work=Friends of South Asia (FOSA) | url=http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/events/bijumathew/ | accessdate=2006-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Stanford Daily]]'' student newspaper ran an article critical of the planned event, based on an anonymous email claiming that there were simultaneous "Islamist and Communist sympathies within the organization."&lt;ref name="metrosc-mathew"/&gt; The anonymous correspondent also claimed that Mathew, a co-founder of the Forum of Indian Leftists&lt;ref name="newspress-taxi"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Taxi!

;Ghulam Nabi Fai and Kashmiri American Council
In 2003, FOSA invited and organized a forum speech that included [[Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai]] of Kashmiri American Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countercurrents.org/kashmir-raman280803.htm A Progressive Discussion Forum On Kashmir]&lt;/ref&gt; Fai was arrested by United States' FBI in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/July/11-nsd-937.html Two charged with conspiring to act as unregistered agents of Pakistani Government] US Department of Justice (July 19, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/07/doj-pakistan-isi-fara DOJ charges Pakistani American with Conspiracy] Mother Jones (July 20, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. court documents, Fai served as the director of the Kashmiri American Council, an NGO that held itself out to be run by Kashmiris, financed by Americans, and dedicated to raising the level of knowledge in the United States about the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. Contrary to public representations, Fai's Kashmiri American Council was secretly funded with millions of dollars by officials employed by the government of Pakistan, including the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), for several decades. Fai pleaded guilty in December 2011, and was sentenced to prison in 2012, for the crime of conspiracy to defraud the US by concealing transfer of funding from Government of Pakistan for his illegal lobbying efforts on Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-nsd-406.html Virginia Man Sentenced to 24 Months for Scheme to Conceal Pakistan Government Funding for His U.S. Lobbying Efforts] United States Department of Justice (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that FOSA knew of Fai's Pakistan government's funding and connection, when it invited him as a key speaker in 2003.

===Allegations of subversion===
According to a 2007 article by V Sundaram, the book ''NGOs, Subversive Activists and Foreign Funds- Anti-Nation Industry'' contains articles describing how FOSA and eight other groups are allegedly engaged in "anti-national activities" directed toward India, which are collectively labeled "Instruments of Hate and Fratricide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstodaynet.com/2007sud/mar07/230307.htm |title=NGOs, subversive activists and foreign funds - III  |first=V |last=Sundaram |date=March 2007 |work=News Today |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327130107/http://www.newstodaynet.com/2007sud/mar07/230307.htm |archivedate=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2010-07-22  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Games of the New Emerging Forces''' ('''GANEFO''') were the games set up by [[Indonesia]] as a counter to the [[Olympic Games]].  Established for the athletes of the so-called "emerging nations" (mainly newly independent [[socialist]] states), GANEFO was the name given both to the games held in [[Jakarta]] in 1963 and the 36-member sporting federation established the same year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Emerging Forces|last=Modelski|first=George|publisher=Australian National University, Research School of Pacific Studies|year=1963|isbn=|location=Canberra|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second GANEFO scheduled for [[Cairo]] in 1967 was cancelled and GANEFO had only one subsequent event, an "Asian GANEFO" held in [[Phnom Penh]] in 1966.

== Sports and politics at GANEFO ==
[[Indonesia]] established GANEFO in the aftermath of IOC censure for the politically charged 4th edition of [[1962 Asian Games|Asian Games in 1962]] in [[Jakarta]] which Indonesia hosted and for which [[Chinese Taipei|Taiwan]] and [[Israel]] were refused entry cards. The IOC's eventual reaction was to indefinitely suspend Indonesia from the IOC. Indonesia had “thrown down a challenge to all international amateur sports organizations, which cannot very well be ignored,” in the words of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]]. This was the first time the IOC suspended one of its members, although Indonesia was readmitted in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/24926/files/?ln=en|title=The Olympic Movement’s Response to the Challenge of Emerging Nationalism in Sport: An Historical Reconsideration of GANEFO|last=Field|first=Russell|publisher=University of Manitoba|year=2011|isbn=|location=Winnipeg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten countries (Cambodia, China, Guinea, Indonesia, Iraq, Mali, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the USSR) announced plans to form GANEFO in April 1963, and 36 countries signed on as members in November 1963.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; GANEFO made it clear in its constitution that [[politics]] and [[sport]] were intertwined; this ran against the doctrine of the [[International Olympic Committee]], which strove to separate politics from sport. Indonesian president [[Sukarno]] responded that the IOC was itself political because it did not have the [[China|People's Republic of China]] or [[North Vietnam]] as members; the IOC was simply "a tool of the imperialists and colonialists."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the IOC decreed that the athletes attending GANEFO would be ineligible to participate in the Olympic Games.

[[Sukarno]] would later form, with Chinese support, a ''Conference of New Emerging Forces, or'' [[CONEFO]] (''Conference of New Emerging Forces).''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://megamercusuar.blogspot.ca/2012/02/conefo-conference-of-new-emerging.html|title=Fakta Sejarah: CONEFO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participating nations in 1st GANEFO===
The first edition of GANEFO was held in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] on 10 to 22 November 1963. Athletes from 46 nations dispatched about 2,700 athletes and 7 nations sent staff and officials. In total, 51 nations participated in the Games from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America such as [[Afghanistan]], [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Burmese Way to Socialism|Burma]], [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–70)|Cambodia]], [[Chile]], [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]], [[Cuba]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[North Korea|DPR Korea]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], [[Guinea]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]], [[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], Palestine (then divided to [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian West Bank]] and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian Gaza Strip]]), [[China|People's Republic of China]], the [[History of the Philippines (1946–65)|Philippines]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Mali|Republic of Mali]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Senegal]], [[Somalia]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Soviet Union]], [[North Vietnam]], the [[United Arab Republic]], [[Uruguay]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and 1 other nation. Unlike the Olympics, there was also a team representing "Arab Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |HrG3joA9QMI|GANEFO opening ceremony footage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No country, however, was represented officially by its national Olympics committee, for fear of IOC reprisals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, the [[Soviet Union]], in a show of solidarity, sent athletes to the first GANEFO, but in order not to jeopardize their position in the IOC, the Soviet athletes were not of Olympic caliber. Japan let their athletes of non-Olympic caliber attend the first GANEFO to take account of the host nation's position of [[1964 Summer Olympics]].

The second edition of GANEFO had been planned to be held in [[Cairo]], [[the United Arab Republic]] in 1967, but this was canceled due to political considerations.

The second GANEFO was held in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in November 25 – December 6, 1966.

=== Participating Nations in 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO) ===
About 2,000 athletes participated in the 2nd edition of GANEFO from 17 nations ([[Cambodia]], [[Ceylon]], [[People's Republic of China|China PR]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Japan]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korea]], [[Laos]], [[Lebanon]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Singapore]], [[Syria]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Yemen]]). The games were opened by Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]], the prime minister of Cambodia.

The second GANEFO was restricted to Asia, except [[Guinea]] which participated in the qualifying tournament in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]] in August 1–11, 1965. Consequently, only 17 Asian countries participated in the second tournament in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in November 25 – December 6, 1966 which was named '1st [[Asian GANEFO]]'.

===Medal table at 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO)===
In the second edition of GANEFO, [[People's Republic of China|China PR]] was the highest ranking nation with 108 gold medals, [[North Korea]] the second, and the host nation, [[Cambodia]], the third.

==2nd Asian GANEFO==
In September 1967 was announced a second Asian GANEFO to be held in [[Beijing]], [[China]], in 1970, but later Beijing dropped the plans to host the Games, which were then awarded to [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]].  But the Games never occurred and the GANEFO organisation collapsed.

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is the oldest voter-based [[political party]] in the world and the oldest existing [[Political parties of the United States|political party in the United States]], tracing its heritage back to the [[Anti-Federalism|anti-Federalists]] and the Jeffersonian [[Democratic-Republican Party]] of the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats|last=Witcover|first=Jules|year=2003|chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Micklethwait|authorlink=John Micklethwait|author2=Wooldridge, Adrian|title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America|year=2004|page=15}} "The country possesses the world's oldest written constitution (1787); the Democratic Party has a good claim to being the world's oldest political party".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Janda|author2=Jeffrey M. Berry|author3=Jerry Goldman|title=The Challenge of Democracy: American Government in Global Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_lC8k3SELMC&amp;pg=PA276|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins. Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers. The party was a proponent for slave-owners across the country, urban workers and caucasian immigrants.

From 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents to four terms of office for twenty-two years]], namely [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916).

Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s–1920s).

[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829–1837)]]
Starting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]] and the "stunner" of [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[United States presidential election, 1892|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]]).

With two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945–1953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963–1969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961–1963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[United States presidential election, 1976|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977–1981), [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] and [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993–2001) and [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009–2017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively. The [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]] and [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]] elections were other two [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|presidential elections in which Democrats won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College]] (the Democrats candidates were [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and Grover Cleveland). Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that "the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore Caplow|author2=Howard M. Bahr|author3=Bruce A. Chadwick|author4=John Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&amp;pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337}} They add: "The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation: 1820-28 ==
The modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Robert V. Remini, ''Martin Van Buren and the Making of the Democratic Party'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
==Jacksonian ascendancy: 1829-40==

=== Presidency of Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) ===

{{main|Jacksonian democracy}}
[[File:The modern balaam and his ass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|1837 cartoon shows the Democratic Party as donkey]]
The spirit of [[Jacksonian democracy]] animated the party from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the [[Second Party System]], with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] the main opposition. After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816–1824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828–1832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Norton explains: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 "[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual – the artisan and the ordinary farmer – by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the [[veto]] more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined [[freedom of religion]] by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.&lt;ref&gt;John Ashworth, ''"Agrarians" &amp; "Aristocrats": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837–1846'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: &lt;blockquote&gt;Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Towers, "Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic." ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469–75, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored—and Whigs opposed—expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican–American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. Both Democrats and Whigs were divided on the issue of slavery. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Earle (2004), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2006), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788–1850'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837–1841) ===
[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.

== Presidencies of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler (1841–1845) ==
The Panic of 1837 led to Van Buren and the Democrats' drop in popularity. The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.

== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845–1849) ==
Foreign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815–1848'' (2007) pp. 705–706.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: &lt;blockquote&gt;Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The party reorganized===
The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) was created in [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848]] at the convention that nominated General [[Lewis Cass]], who lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic Party, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor. 
== Presidencies of Zachary Taylor (1849–1850) and  Millard Fillmore (1850–1853) ==
Thanks to the timely death of President Taylor, Democrats in Congress passed the [[Compromise of 1850]] designed to avoid civil war by putting the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852]] and [[James Buchanan]] in [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005) ch. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The disastrous Presidencies of Franklin Pierce (1853–57) and  James Buchanan (1857–61) ==
The eight years during which Franklin Pierce and  James Buchanan held the presidency are considered the second greatest disaster to befall the United States and historians rank the two as our nations worst presidents. 

Pierce was so bad, he lost his party's nomination for a second term, and by the time Buchanan left office, the United States had literally fallen apart. 

=== Young America ===
Yonatan Eyal (2007) argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of a new faction of young Democrats called "[[Young America movement|Young America]]". Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. They sought independence from European standards of [[high culture]] and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and [[exceptionalism]] of [[American literature|America's own literary tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828–1861'', (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In economic policy, Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure with railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes and harbors. They endorsed the "[[market revolution]]" and promoted [[capitalism]]. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that [[internal improvements]] were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to [[free trade]], while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue. They supported the [[Independent Treasury]] (the Jacksonian alternative to the Second Bank of the United States) not as a scheme to quash the special privilege of the Whiggish monied elite, but as a device to spread prosperity to all [[Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828–1861,'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown of the Second Party System (1854–1859) ===
Sectional confrontations escalated during the 1850s, the Democratic Party split between [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]] grew deeper. The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:
:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Roy F. Nichols, "Franklin Pierce," ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1934) {{cite book|author=reprinted in Nancy Capace, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of New Hampshire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyCVd_nCYl8C&amp;pg=PA268|year=2001|pages=268–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, over vehement opposition, the main Democratic leader in the Senate, Stephen Douglas of Illinois, pushed through the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. It established that settlers in [[Kansas Territory]] could vote to decide to allow or not allow slavery. Thousands of men moved in from North and South with the goal of voting slavery down or up and [[Bleeding Kansas|their violence]] shook the nation. A major re-alignment took place among voters and politicians, with new issues, new parties and new leaders. The Whig Party dissolved entirely.&lt;ref name="William E. Gienapp 1987"&gt;William E. Gienapp, ''The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852–1856'' (1987) explores statistically the flow of voters between parties in the 1850s.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North and South pull apart ===
The crisis for the Democratic Party came in the late 1850s as Democrats increasingly rejected national policies demanded by the Southern Democrats. The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Todd Landis. ''Northern Men with Southern Loyalties: The Democratic Party and the Sectional Crisis'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] formed in 1854 on the basis of refusing to tolerate the expansion of slavery into the territories, many northern Democrats (especially [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]] from 1848) joined it. The Republicans in 1854 now had a majority in most, but not all of the Northern states and it had practically no support South of the Mason–Dixon line. The formation of the new short-lived [[Know-Nothing Party]] allowed the Democrats to win the presidential election of 1856.&lt;ref name="William E. Gienapp 1987"/&gt; Buchanan, a Northern "[[Doughfaces#The 1850s|Doughface]]" (his base of support was in the pro-slavery South), split the party on the issue of slavery in Kansas when he attempted to pass a federal slave code as demanded by the South. Most Democrats in the North rallied to Senator Douglas, who preached "[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|Popular Sovereignty]]" and believed that a Federal slave code would be undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;Roy F. Nichols. ''The Disruption of American Democracy: A History of the Political Crisis That Led Up To The Civil War'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party was unable to compete with the Republican Party, which controlled nearly all northern states by 1860, bringing a solid majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. The Republicans claimed that the Northern Democrats, including Doughfaces such as Pierce and Buchanan, as well as advocates of popular sovereignty such as Stephen A. Douglas and [[Lewis Cass]], were all accomplices to [[Slave Power]]. The Republicans argued that slaveholders (all of them Democrats) had seized control of the federal government and were blocking the progress of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Richards. ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780–1860'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DEM1860.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|To vote for [[Stephen A. Douglas]] in Virginia, a man deposited the ticket issued by the party in the official ballot box]]
In [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]], the Democrats were unable to stop the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]], even as they feared his election would lead to civil war. The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President Buchanan along Northern and Southern lines: factions of the party provided two separate candidacies for President in the election of 1860, in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Fuller, ed., ''The Election of 1860 Reconsidered'' (2012) [http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781612776224  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[United States presidential election, 1860#Constitutional (Southern) Democratic|Southern Democratic]] delegates followed the lead of the [[Fire-Eaters]] by walking out of the [[1860 Democratic National Conventions|Democratic National Convention]] at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]'s Institute Hall in April 1860 and were later joined by those who, once again led by the Fire-Eaters, left the [[1860 Democratic National Convention#Baltimore convention|Baltimore Convention]] the following June when the convention rejected a resolution supporting extending slavery into territories whose voters did not want it. The Southern Democrats nominated the pro-slavery incumbent Vice President, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky, for President and General [[Joseph Lane]], former governor of Oregon, for Vice President.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;David M. Potter. ''The Impending Crisis, 1848–1861'' (1976). ch. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States presidential election, 1860#National (Northern) Democratic|Northern Democrats]] proceeded to nominate Douglas of Illinois for President and former Governor of Georgia [[Herschel Vespasian Johnson]] for Vice President, while some southern Democrats joined the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], backing its nominees (who had both been prominent Whig leaders), former Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee for President and the politician [[Edward Everett]] of Massachusetts for Vice President. This fracturing of the Democrats left them powerless. Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States. Douglas campaigned across the country calling for unity and came in second in the popular vote, but carried only Missouri and New Jersey. Breckinridge carried 11 [[slave states]], coming in second in the Electoral vote, but third in the popular vote.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Presidency of Abraham Lincoln (1861–1865) ==
=== Civil War ===
During the [[Union (American Civil War)|Civil War]], Northern Democrats divided into two factions: the [[War Democrats]], who supported the military policies of President Lincoln; and the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]], who strongly opposed them. No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime. Consequently, the Democratic Party halted all operations during the life of the Confederacy (1861–1865).&lt;ref name="Jennifer L. Weber 2006"&gt;Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Partisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]].&lt;ref name="Jennifer L. Weber 2006"/&gt; The Democratic Party did well in the [[United States House elections, 1862|1862 congressional elections]], but in [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864]] it nominated General [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] (a War Democrat) on a peace platform and lost badly because many War Democrats bolted to [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] candidate Abraham Lincoln. Many former Democrats became Republicans, especially soldiers such as generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[John A. Logan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Waugh, ''Reelecting Lincoln: The Battle for the 1864 Presidency'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency of Andrew Johnson (1865–1869) ==
[[File:Democraticjackass.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Nast]]'s January 1870 depiction of the Democratic donkey]]
In the [[United States House election, 1866|1866 elections]], the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]] won two-thirds majorities in Congress and took control of national affairs. The large Republican majorities made Congressional Democrats helpless, though they unanimously opposed the Radicals' [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction policies]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick W. Riddleberger, ''1866: The Critical Year Revisited'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that the old issues were holding it back, the Democrats tried a "[[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]]" that downplayed the War and stressed such issues as corruption and [[white supremacy]], the latter of which it wholeheartedly supported. 

[[Andrew Johnson|President Johnson]], elected on the fusion Union Party ticket, rejoined the Democratic party, but to no avail. He would be the last Democratic incumbent for nearly a century to lose his party's nomination ([[Harry S Truman]] lost the 1952 New Hampshire primary before withdrawing from the race) for another term.

== Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant (1869–1877) ==
War hero [[Ulysses S. Grant]] led the Republicans to [[Landslide victory|landslides]] in [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868]] and [[United States presidential election, 1872|1872]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gambill, ''Conservative Ordeal: Northern Democrats and Reconstruction, 1865–1868'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a major economic depression hit the United States with the [[Panic of 1873]], the Democratic party made major gains across the country, took full control of the South, and took control of Congress.

== "Presidency-elect" of of Samuel J. Tilden (1876–77) ==
[[Samuel J. Tilden]], the Democratic nominee in 1876, was elected President by decent margin. However some partisan Republicans would not have it, alleging that there was voting fraud and the suppression of the black vote was widespread. Enough electoral votes were disputed by Partisan Republicans to deny Tilden the presidency . The [[Compromise of 1877]] put Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the White House in exchange for removing federal troops that were propping up the three remaining Republican governments in the South. Attention increasingly turned to economic issues, especially the gold standard and the protective tariff.

== Bearded obscurities: the Presidencies of Hayes (1877–81), Garfield (1881), and Arthur (1881–85) ==
The Democrats lost consecutive presidential elections from 1860 through 1880 ([[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]] was in dispute) and did not win the presidency until [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884]]. The party was weakened by its record of opposition to the war, but nevertheless benefited from [[White Southerners]]' resentment of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. The [[Panic of 1873|nationwide depression of 1873]] allowed the Democrats to retake control of the House in the [[United States House election, 1874|1874 Democratic landslide]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Redeemers]] gave the Democrats control of every Southern state (by the [[Compromise of 1877]]), but the [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement of blacks]] took place (1880–1900). From 1880 to 1960, the "[[Solid South]]" voted Democratic in presidential elections (except 1928). After 1900, a victory in a Democratic primary was "[[tantamount to election]]" because the Republican Party was so weak in the South.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Cleveland, Harrison, Cleveland (1885-97)==
After being out of office since 1869, the Democrats made a comeback, winning the popular vote in three elections straight. 
=== the first Presidency of Grover Cleveland (1885–89) ===
Although Republicans continued to control the White House until 1884, the Democrats remained competitive (especially in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and lower [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]) and controlled the House of Representatives for most of that period. In the election of [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884]], [[Grover Cleveland]], the reforming Democratic Governor of New York, won the Presidency, a feat he repeated in [[United States presidential election, 1892|1892]], having lost in the election of [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:1893polittooncleveland.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Typewriters were new in 1893 and this Gillam cartoon from ''Puck'' shows that [[Grover Cleveland]] can not get the Democratic "machine" to work as the keys (key politicians) will not respond to his efforts]]
Cleveland was the leader of the [[Bourbon Democrats]]. They represented business interests, supported banking and railroad goals, promoted ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism, opposed [[American imperialism|imperialism]] and U.S. overseas expansion, opposed the annexation of [[Hawaii]], fought for the [[gold standard]] and opposed [[Bimetallism]]. They strongly supported reform movements such as [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Civil Service Reform]] and opposed corruption of city bosses, leading the fight against the [[Tweed Ring]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The leading Bourbons included [[Samuel J. Tilden]], [[David B. Hill|David Bennett Hill]] and [[William C. Whitney]] of New York, [[Arthur P. Gorman|Arthur Pue Gorman]] of Maryland, [[Thomas F. Bayard]] of Delaware, [[Henry M. Mathews]] and [[William Lyne Wilson|William L. Wilson]] of West Virginia, [[John Griffin Carlisle]] of Kentucky, [[William Freeman Vilas|William F. Vilas]] of Wisconsin, [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]] of Nebraska, [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John M. Palmer]] of Illinois, [[Horace Boies]] of Iowa, [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar]] of Mississippi and railroad builder [[James J. Hill]] of Minnesota. A prominent intellectual was [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name=Addkison&gt;Addkison-Simmons, D. (2010). Henry Mason Mathews. ''e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia''. Retrieved December 11, 2012, from [http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1582 "Henry Mason Mathews"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidency of Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) ===
Despite losing the popular vote Harrison won a narrow victory in 1888, while not completely incompetent, Harrison's policies made him unpopular.   The Democrats made the high  [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 a major campaign issue, and seized control of Congress in the 1890 elections. Harrison was easily defeated for reelection in 1892 by former President Cleveland.

=== A great depression: the second Presidency of Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) ===
The Bourbons were in power when the [[Panic of 1893]] hit and they took the blame. A fierce struggle inside the party ensued, with catastrophic losses for both the Bourbon and agrarian factions in 1894, leading to the showdown in 1896. Just before the 1894 election, President Cleveland was warned by an advisor:
:We are on the eve of very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Lynde Stetson to Cleveland, October 7, 1894 in Allan Nevins, ed. ''Letters of Grover Cleveland, 1850–1908'' (1933) p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

The warning was appropriate, for the Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. However, Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies.

==The rise and fall and rise and fall of William Jennings Bryan==
The opposition Democrats were close to controlling two thirds of the vote at the [[1896 Democratic National Convention|1896 national convention]], which they needed to nominate their own candidate. However, they were not united and had no national leader, as Illinois Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]] had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], ''The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888–96'' (1971) pp. 229–30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a young (35 years old) upstart, Congressman [[William Jennings Bryan]] made the magnificent "cross of gold" speech,which brought the crowd at the convention to it's feet and got him the nomination. he would lose the election, but he would be renominated and lose again in 1900 and a third time in 1908. He would dominate the party for two decades.


=== Free silver movement ===
[[File:William-Jennings-Bryan-speaking-c1896.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[William Jennings Bryan]] at age 36 was the youngest candidate, October 1896]]
[[Grover Cleveland]] led the party faction of conservative, pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, but as the [[Panic of 1893|depression of 1893]] deepened his enemies multiplied. At the [[1896 Democratic National Convention|1896 convention]], the silverite-agrarian faction repudiated the President and nominated the crusading orator [[William Jennings Bryan]] on a platform of [[Free Silver|free coinage of silver]]. The idea was that minting silver coins would flood the economy with cash and end the depression. Cleveland supporters formed the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]] (Gold Democrats), which attracted politicians and intellectuals (including [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]) who refused to vote Republican.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley L. Jones, ''The Presidential Election of 1896'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan, an overnight sensation because of his "[[Cross of Gold]]" speech, waged a new-style crusade against the supporters of the gold standard. Criss-crossing the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Eastern United States|East]] by special train – he was the first candidate since 1860 to go on the road – he gave over 500 speeches to audiences in the millions. In St. Louis he gave 36 speeches to workingmen's audiences across the city, all in one day. Most Democratic newspapers were hostile toward Bryan, but he seized control of the media by making the news every day as he hurled thunderbolts against Eastern monied interests.&lt;ref name="free online edition"&gt;Richard J. Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict 1888–1896'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XpCgCNZwpvoC free online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural folk in the South and Midwest were ecstatic, showing an enthusiasm never before seen, but ethnic Democrats (especially [[German American|Germans]] and [[Irish American|Irish]]) were alarmed and frightened by Bryan. The middle classes, businessmen, newspaper editors, factory workers, railroad workers and prosperous farmers generally rejected Bryan's crusade. Republican [[William McKinley]] promised a return to prosperity based on the gold standard, support for industry, railroads and banks and pluralism that would enable every group to move ahead.&lt;ref name="free online edition"/&gt;

Although Bryan lost the [[United States presidential election, 1896|election]] in a landslide, he did win the hearts and minds of a majority of Democrats, as shown by his renomination in 1900 and 1908. As late as 1924, the Democrats put his brother [[Charles W. Bryan]] on their national ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, ''A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The victory of the Republican Party in the election of 1896 marked the start of the "[[Progressive Era]]", which lasted from 1896 to 1932, in which the Republican Party usually was dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis L. Gould, ''America in the Progressive Era, 1890–1914'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the wilderness again:the Presidencies of McKinley (1897–1901), Theodore Roosevelt (1901–09) and  Taft (1909-13) ==
The 1896 election marked a political realignment in which the Republican Party controlled the presidency for 28 of 36 years. The Republicans dominated most of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and Midwest and half the [[Western United States|West]]. Bryan, with a base in the South and [[Great Plains|Plains states]], was strong enough to get the nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900]] (losing to [[William McKinley]]) and [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]] (losing to [[William Howard Taft]]). [[Theodore Roosevelt]] dominated the first decade of the century and to the annoyance of Democrats "stole" the trust issue by [[United States antitrust law|crusading against trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hal Williams, ''Realigning America: McKinley, Bryan, and the Remarkable Election of 1896'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

With Bryan taking a breather and [[Teddy Roosevelt]] the most popular president since Grant, the conservatives who controlled the [[1904 Democratic National Convention|convention in 1904]], basically gave up in advance and nominated an unknown nonentity named [[Alton B. Parker]] before succumbing to [[United States presidential election, 1904| Roosevelt's landslide]].  

Religious divisions were sharply drawn.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"&gt;Kleppner (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], Scandinavian [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and other [[Pietism|pietists]] in the North were closely linked to the Republican Party. In sharp contrast, [[liturgical]] groups, especially the [[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from [[pietistic moralism]], especially [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Both parties cut across the class structure, with the Democrats gaining more support from the lower classes and Republicans more support from the upper classes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Cultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became matters of contention because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50 percent of voters were pietistic Protestants (Methodists, Scandinavian Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]]) who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"/&gt;

Liturgical churches ([[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], German Lutherans and Episcopalians) comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of the morality business. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decade, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry Republicans.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"/&gt;

=== 1908: "Yet another farewell tour"  ===
With the wildly popular President Roosevelt sticking to his promise to step down after seven and a half years, and his chosen successor, War Secretary [[William Howard Taft]] somewhat popular as well, A desperate party gave Bryan the nomination for a third time. He lost yet again. 

The Democratic Party benefited from the Taft-Roosevelt Republican split during Taft's term, electing the first Democratic President and fully Democratic Congress in 20 years.

== Presidency of Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921) ==
Taking advantage of a deep split in the Republican Party, the Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected the intellectual reformer [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]] and [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]].&lt;ref&gt;Brett Flehinger, ''The 1912 Election and the Power of Progressivism: A Brief History with Documents'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson successfully led Congress to a series of progressive laws, including a [[Underwood Tariff|reduced tariff]], stronger [[Clayton Anti-Trust Act|antitrust laws]], new programs for farmers, hours-and-pay benefits for railroad workers and the outlawing of [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor]] (which was reversed by the Supreme Court).&lt;ref name="John Milton Cooper 2009"&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson: A Biography'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson tolerated the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] of the [[United States federal civil service|federal Civil Service]] by Southern cabinet members. Furthermore, bipartisan [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments for prohibition]] and [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|women's suffrage]] were passed in his second term. In effect, Wilson laid to rest the issues of tariffs, money and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years.&lt;ref name="John Milton Cooper 2009"/&gt;

Wilson oversaw the U.S. role in [[World War I]] and helped write the [[Versailles Treaty]], which included the [[League of Nations]]. However, in 1919 Wilson's political skills faltered and suddenly everything turned sour. The Senate rejected Versailles and the League, a nationwide wave of violent, unsuccessful strikes and race riots caused unrest and Wilson's health collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats lost by a huge landslide in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], doing especially poorly in the cities, where the German-Americans deserted the ticket; and the Irish Catholics, who dominated the party apparatus, sat on their hands.

== The roaring '20s. The presidencies of Warren G. Harding (1921–1923),Coolidge (1923-29) and Hoover (1929-33) ==
Although they recovered considerable ground in the Congressional elections of 1922, the entire decade saw the Democrats as a helpless minority in Congress and as a weak force in most Northern states.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas B. Craig, ''After Wilson: The Struggle for the Democratic Party, 1920–1934'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Klanbake" and Al Smith (1924-28) ===
At the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]], a resolution denouncing the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was introduced by forces allied with [[Al Smith]] and [[Oscar W. Underwood]] in order to embarrass the front-runner, [[William Gibbs McAdoo]]. After much debate, the resolution failed by a single vote. The KKK faded away soon after, but the deep split in the party over cultural issues, especially prohibition, facilitated Republican landslides in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]] and [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Murray, ''The 103rd Ballot: Democrats and Disaster in Madison Square Garden'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al Smith did build a strong Catholic base in the big cities in 1928 and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s election as Governor of New York that year brought a new leader to center stage.&lt;ref&gt;
Jerome M. Clubb and Howard W. Allen, "The Cities and the Election of 1928: Partisan Realignment?," ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 74, No. 4 (Apr., 1969), pp. 1205–20 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1856757 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic Hegemony (1930-53) ==
The Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.

=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945) ===
[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933–1945)]]
The [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of "Relief, Recovery, and Reform", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed "[[New Deal|The New Deal]]" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: "liberal" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while "conservative" meant an opponent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The 1933 programs, called "the First New Deal" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called "The [[Second New Deal]]". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Roosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, [[Catholics]] and [[Jew]]s) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
===the Second term===
After a triumphant re-election in [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
===the party===
Under Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves "conservatives".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===World war II===
With a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called "recession" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.
=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945–1953) ===
[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge.
==== the fracturing of the Roosevelt Coalition ====
Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the "Liberal coalition" or "Liberal-Labor coalition" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).&lt;ref&gt;

On the right, the Republicans blasted Truman's domestic policies. "Had Enough?" was the winning slogan as Republicans recaptured Congress in 1946 for the first time since 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McNeese, ''The Cold War and Postwar America 1946–1963'' (2010) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
====the "great comeback"====
Many party leaders were ready to dump Truman in 1948, but after General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] rejected their invitation they lacked an alternative. Truman counterattacked, pushing [[J. Strom Thurmond]] and his [[Dixiecrats]] out, as well as taking advantage of the splits inside the Republican Party and was thus [[United States presidential election, 1948|reelected in a stunning surprise]]. However, all of Truman's [[Fair Deal]] proposals, such as [[universal health care]], were defeated by the Southern Democrats in Congress. His seizure of the steel industry was [[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer|reversed by the Supreme Court]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==== Foreign policy ====
On the far-left, former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[United States presidential election, 1948|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[détente]] with the [[Soviet Union–United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions. Wallace fared poorly and helped turn the anti-communist vote toward Truman.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Divine, "The Cold War and the Election of 1948," ''Journal of American History'' Vol. 59, No. 1 (Jun., 1972), pp. 90–110 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1888388 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

By cooperating with internationalist Republicans, Truman succeeded in defeating [[United States non-interventionism|isolationists]] on the right and supporters of softer lines on the Soviet Union on the left to establish a [[Cold War]] program that lasted until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946–1948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against "Korea, Communism and Corruption". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Adlai Stevenson 1952 campaign poster.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] warns against a return of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] policies of [[Herbert Hoover]], 1952 campaign poster]]
In Congress, the powerful duo of House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Most Southern Congressmen were [[conservative Democrats]] and they usually worked with conservative Republicans. The result was a conservative coalition that blocked practically all liberal domestic legislation from 1937 to the 1970s, except for a brief spell 1964–1965, when Johnson neutralized its power. The counterbalance to the conservative coalition was the [[Democratic Study Group]], which led the charge to liberalize the institutions of Congress and eventually pass a great deal of the Kennedy–Johnson program.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961) ==
Although the Republicans gain brief control of Congress in 1952, the Democrats were back in control in 1954. House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] worked closely with President Eisenhower, so the partisanship was at the lowest intensity in the 20th century.

== Presidency of John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) ==
[[File:Kennedy bros.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|President [[John F. Kennedy]] with his brothers, [[Attorney General]] and later [[New York (state)|New York]] Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]]]
The election of [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]] over then-Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] re-energized the party. His youth, vigor and intelligence caught the popular imagination. New programs like the [[Peace Corps]] harnessed idealism. In terms of legislation, Kennedy was stalemated by the conservative coalition.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Though Kennedy's term in office lasted only about a thousand days, he tried to hold back communist gains after the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] in Cuba and the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] and sent 16,000 soldiers to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to advise the hard-pressed [[South Vietnam]]ese army. He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Kennedy also pushed for [[civil rights]] and [[racial integration]], one example being Kennedy assigning federal marshals to protect the [[Freedom Riders]] in the South. His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J. Daley]], the last of the Democratic machines faded away. [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy was assassinated]] on November 22, 1963 in [[Dallas, Texas]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–1969) ==
Then-Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was sworn in as the new President. Johnson, heir to the New Deal ideals, broke the conservative coalition in Congress and passed a remarkable number of laws, known as the [[Great Society]]. Johnson succeeded in passing major [[civil rights]] laws that restarted racial integration in the South. At the same time, Johnson escalated the [[Vietnam War]], leading to an inner conflict inside the Democratic Party that shattered the party in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|elections of 1968]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Lbj2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|President [[Lyndon Johnson]] foresaw the end of the [[Solid South]] when he signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]]]
The Democratic Party platform of the 1960s was largely formed by the ideals of President Johnson's "[[Great Society]]" The New Deal coalition began to fracture as more Democratic leaders voiced support for civil rights, upsetting the party's traditional base of  [[Southern Democrats]] and Catholics in [[Northern United States|Northern]] cities. After Harry Truman's platform gave strong support to civil rights and anti-[[Racial segregation|segregation]] laws during the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]], many Southern Democratic delegates decided to split from the party and formed the "[[Dixiecrats]]", led by [[South Carolina]] governor [[Strom Thurmond]] (who as Senator would later join the Republican Party). However, few other Democrats left the party.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On the other hand, [[African Americans]], who had traditionally given strong support to the Republican Party since its inception as the "anti-slavery party", continued to shift to the Democratic Party, largely due to the advocacy of and support for civil rights by such prominent Democrats as [[Hubert Humphrey]] and former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]; and to a lesser extent economic opportunities offered by the New Deal relief programs. Although Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] carried half the South in [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]] and Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] also carried five Southern states in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] carried all of the South except Virginia and there was no long-term realignment until [[Ronald Reagan]]'s sweeping victories in the South in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] and [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The party's dramatic reversal on civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The act was passed in both House and Senate by a Republican majority. Many of the Democrats, mostly Southern Democrats opposed the act. Meanwhile, the Republicans led again by [[Richard Nixon]] were beginning to implement their new economic policies which aimed to resist federal encroachment on the states, while appealing to conservative and moderate in the rapidly growing cities and suburbs of the South.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The year 1968 marked a major crisis for the party. In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened. Four days later, Senator [[Robert Kennedy]], brother of the late President, entered the race.&lt;ref name="Palermo 2001"&gt;Palermo (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson stunned the nation on March 31 when he withdrew from the race and four weeks later his Vice President [[Hubert H. Humphrey]], entered the race, though he did not run in any primary. Kennedy and McCarthy traded primary victories while Humphrey gathered the support of labor unions and the big-city bosses. Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night. Even as Kennedy won California, Humphrey had already amassed 1,000 of the 1,312 delegate votes needed for the nomination, while Kennedy had about 700).&lt;ref name="Palermo 2001"/&gt;

During the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], while police and the National Guard violently confronted anti-war protesters on the streets and parks of Chicago, the Democrats nominated Humphrey. Meanwhile, Alabama's Democratic governor [[George C. Wallace]] launched a third-party campaign and at one point was running second to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress. The party was now so deeply split that it would not again win a majority of the popular vote for president until [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], when Jimmy Carter won the popular vote in 1976 with 50.1%.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The degree to which the Southern Democrats had abandoned the party became evident in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]] when the electoral votes of every former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] state except [[Texas]] went to either Republican Richard Nixon or independent Wallace. Humphrey's electoral votes came mainly from the Northern states, marking a dramatic reversal from the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 election]] 20 years earlier, when the losing Republican electoral votes were concentrated in the same states.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Presidency of Richard Nixon (1969–1974) ==
Following the 1968 debacle, the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission]] proposed and the party adopted far-reaching changes in how national convention delegates were selected. More power over the presidential nominee selection accrued to the rank and file and presidential primaries became significantly more important. In [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], the Democrats nominated Senator [[George McGovern]] (SD) as the presidential candidate on a platform which advocated, among other things, immediate U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam (with his anti-war slogan "Come Home, America!") and a [[guaranteed minimum income]] for all Americans. McGovern's forces at the national convention ousted Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] and the entire Chicago delegation, replacing them with insurgents led by [[Jesse Jackson]]. After it became known that McGovern's running mate [[Thomas Eagleton]] had received electric shock therapy, McGovern said he supported Eagleton "1000%", but he was soon forced to drop him and find a new running mate.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. White, ''The Making of the President 1972'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous top names turned him down, but McGovern finally selected [[Sargent Shriver]], a Kennedy in-law who was close to Mayor Daley. On July 14, 1972, McGovern appointed his campaign manager, [[Jean Westwood (politician)|Jean Westwood]], as the first woman chair of the Democratic National Committee. McGovern was defeated in a landslide by incumbent Richard Nixon, winning only Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment: The McGovern Insurgency and the Identity Crisis of the Democratic Party'' (University Press of Kansas, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency of Gerald Ford (1974–1977) ==
The sordid [[Watergate scandal]] soon destroyed the Nixon Presidency, giving the Democrats a flicker of hope. With [[Gerald Ford]]'s pardon of Nixon soon after his resignation in 1974, the Democrats used the "corruption" issue to make major gains in the off-year elections. In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], mistrust of the administration, complicated by a combination of economic recession and inflation, sometimes called "[[stagflation]]", led to Ford's defeat by [[Jimmy Carter]], a former Governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Carter won as a little-known outsider by promising honesty in Washington, a message that played well to voters as he swept the South and won narrowly.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Witcover, ''Marathon: The pursuit of the presidency, 1972–1976'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency of Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) ==
[[File:Jimmy Carter.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|President [[Jimmy Carter]] was elected in 1976 and defeated in 1980]]
Carter had served as a naval officer, a farmer, a state senator and a one-term governor. His only experience with federal politics was when he chaired the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial elections in 1974. Some of Carter's major accomplishments consisted of the creation of a national energy policy and the consolidation of governmental agencies, resulting in two new cabinet departments, the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education]]. Carter also successfully deregulated the trucking, airline, rail, finance, communications and oil industries (thus backtracking on the New Deal approach to regulation of the economy), bolstered the [[social security]] system and appointed record numbers of women and minorities to significant government and judicial posts. He also enacted strong legislation on environmental protection through the expansion of the [[National Park Service]] in [[Alaska]], creating 103 million acres (417,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of park land.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Fink, and Hugh Davis Graham, eds. ''The Carter presidency: Policy choices in the post-New Deal era'' (University Press of Kansas, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign affairs, Carter's accomplishments consisted of the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the establishment of [[China–United States relations|full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China]] and the negotiation of the [[SALT II]] Treaty. In addition, he championed [[human rights]] throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.&lt;ref name="John Dumbrell 1995"&gt;John Dumbrell, ''The Carter presidency: A re-evaluation'' (Manchester University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with all of these successes, Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system as he had promised in his campaign and inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the [[Iranian hostage crisis|Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days]] and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], Carter defeated Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to gain renomination, but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.&lt;ref name="John Dumbrell 1995"/&gt; After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.&lt;ref&gt;David Farber, ''Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) ==
=== 1980s: battling Reaganism ===
[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Representative [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas "Tip" O'Neill]] was Speaker of the House (1977–1987) and was the highest ranking Democrat in Washington, D.C. during most of Reagan's term]]
Democrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]]. The "[[Reagan Democrat]]s" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] and for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]], producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's [[social conservatism]] on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] or [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.&lt;ref name="Stanley B. Greenberg 1996"&gt;Stanley B. Greenberg, ''Middle Class Dreams: Politics and Power of the New American Majority'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stan Greenberg]], a Democratic pollster, analyzed white ethnic voters – largely unionized auto workers – in suburban [[Macomb County, Michigan]], just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.&lt;ref name="Stanley B. Greenberg 1996"/&gt;

The failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365–90&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South becomes Republican ===
For nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as "outside agitators".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[United States presidential election, 1948|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as "States' Rights Democratic Party".

With the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: "We have lost the South for a generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Believing themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80–90 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics. The Republican Party's [[Southern strategy]] further alienated black voters from the party.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70–30% among White Southerners, who comprised 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90–9 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency of George H. W. Bush (1989–1993) ==
=== Opposition to Gulf War ===
The Democrats included a strong element that came of age in opposition to the Vietnam War and remained hostile toward American military interventions. On August 1, 1990, [[Iraq]], led by [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] [[Kuwait]]. President Bush formed an international coalition and secured United Nations approval to expel Iraq. Congress on January 12, 1991 authorized by a narrow margin the use of military force against Iraq, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The vote in the House was 250–183 and in the Senate 52–47. In the Senate, 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats voted yes to war, while 45 Democrats and two Republicans voted no. In the House, 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted yes and 179 Democrats, three Republicans and one Independent voted no.&lt;ref&gt;Dilip Hiro, ''Desert Shield to Desert Storm: The Second Gulf War'' (2003) p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gulf War]], a military operation known as "[[Desert Storm]]", was short and successful, but Hussein was allowed to remain in power. The Arab countries (and Japan) repaid all the American military costs.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Presidency of Bill Clinton (1993–2001) ==
[[File:Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|During [[Bill Clinton]]'s presidency, the Democratic Party moved ideologically toward the center]]
In the 1990s, the Democratic Party revived itself, in part by moving to the right on economic policy.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

However, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

In the 1990s the Clinton Administration continued the free market, or [[neoliberal]], reforms which began under the Reagan Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Springer|editor1-first=Simon|editor2-last=Birch|editor2-first=Kean|editor3-last=MacLeavy|editor3-first=Julie|date=2016 |title=The Handbook of Neoliberalism|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Handbook-of-Neoliberalism/Springer-Birch-MacLeavy/p/book/9781138844001|location=|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 144]|isbn=978-1138844001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Karagiannis, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, Swapan Sen (eds).

:Free-market ideas were embraced by Democrats almost as much as by Republicans. Jimmy Carter initiated the big push toward deregulation, generally with the support of his party in Congress. Bill Clinton presided over the growth of the loosely supervised shadow financial system and the repeal of Depression-era restrictions on commercial banks.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Mallaby. ''The New York Times''. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/books/review/age-of-greed-by-jeff-madrick-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateema3 "Why We Deregulated the Banks"]. July 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] also posits that both parties shifted to free markets in the 1970s:
:In the United States, both of the dominant parties have shifted toward free-market capitalism. Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA416#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the DLC attempted to move the Democratic agenda to the right (to a more centrist position), prominent Democrats from both the centrist and conservative factions (such as [[Terry McAuliffe]]) assumed leadership of the party and its direction. Some liberals and progressives felt alienated by the Democratic Party, which they felt had become unconcerned with the interests of the common people and left-wing issues in general. Some Democrats challenged the validity of such critiques, citing the Democratic role in pushing for progressive reforms.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Election of 2000 ===
{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}
During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.

Gore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from politics for years, though by 2005 he was making speeches critical of Bush's foreign policy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Despite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55–45 Republican edge into a 50–50 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Presidency of George W. Bush (2001–2009) ==
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], the nation's focus was changed to issues of [[national security]]. All but one Democrat (Representative [[Barbara Lee]]) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. House leader [[Richard Gephardt]] and Senate leader [[Thomas Daschle]] pushed Democrats to vote for the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. The Democrats were split over entering Iraq in 2003 and increasingly expressed concerns about both the justification and progress of the [[War on Terror|War on Terrorism]] as well as the domestic effects, including threats to [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]] from the Patriot Act. Senator [[Russ Feingold]] was the only Senator to vote against the act.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;It was renewed in 2006 by a vote of 280–138 in the House (with Democrats breaking 66 for and 124 against) and 89-10 in the Senate (with Democrats splitting 33 in favor and 9 against). "House approves Patriot Act renewal," CNN News, March 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nancy Pelosi.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Nancy Pelosi]] of California was the first woman to serve as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]]]]
In the wake of the financial fraud scandal of the [[Enron Corporation]] and other corporations, Congressional Democrats pushed for a legal overhaul of business accounting with the intention of preventing further [[Accounting scandals|accounting fraud]]. This led to the bipartisan [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002. With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated) in the Senate. While Democrats gained governorships in [[New Mexico]] (where [[Bill Richardson]] was elected), [[Arizona]] ([[Janet Napolitano]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Jennifer Granholm]]) and [[Wyoming]] ([[Dave Freudenthal]]). Other Democrats lost governorships in [[South Carolina]] ([[Jim Hodges]]), [[Alabama]] ([[Don Siegelman]]) and—for the first time in more than a century—Georgia ([[Roy Barnes]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The election led to another round of soul searching about the party's narrowing base. Democrats had further losses 2003, when a voter recall unseated the unpopular Democratic governor of California [[Gray Davis]] and replaced him with Republican [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. By the end of 2003, the four most populous states had Republican governors: California, Texas, New York and Florida.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Election of 2004 ===
{{main|United States presidential election, 2004|John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004}}
The 2004 campaign started as early as December 2002, when Gore announced he would not run again in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]. [[Howard Dean]], former Governor of Vermont, an opponent of the war and a critic of the Democratic establishment, was the front-runner leading into the Democratic [[primary elections|primaries]]. Dean had immense [[grassroots]] support, especially from the left-wing of the party. Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]], a more centrist figure with heavy support from the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], was nominated because he was seen as more "electable" than Dean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahajan|first=Rahul|publisher=[[Common Dreams NewsCenter]]|date=January 28, 2004|title=Kerry vs. Dean; New Hampshire vs. Iraq|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0128-13.htm|accessdate=October 12, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019032848/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0128-13.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As layoffs of American workers occurred in various industries due to [[outsourcing]], some Democrats (including Dean and senatorial candidate [[Erskine Bowles]] of [[North Carolina]]) began to refine their positions on free trade and some even questioned their past support for it. By 2004, the failure of George W. Bush's administration to find [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction in Iraq]], mounting combat casualties and fatalities in the ongoing [[Iraq War]], as well as the lack of any end point for the War on Terror were frequently debated issues in the election. That year, Democrats generally campaigned on surmounting the [[jobless recovery]], solving the Iraq crisis and fighting terrorism more efficiently.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the end, Kerry lost both the popular vote (by 3 million out of over 120 million votes cast) and the Electoral College. Republicans also gained four seats in the Senate (leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, their fewest since the 1920s) and three seats in the House of Representatives. Also for the first time since 1952, the Democratic leader of the Senate lost re-election. In the end, there were 3,660 Democratic [[State legislature (United States)|state legislators]] across the nation to the Republicans' 3,557. Democrats gained governorships in Louisiana, New Hampshire and Montana. However, they lost the governorship of Missouri and a legislative majority in Georgia – which had long been a Democratic stronghold. Senate pickups for the Democrats included [[Ken Salazar]] in Colorado and [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] keynote speaker [[Barack Obama]] in Illinois.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

There were many reasons for the defeat and after the election most analysts concluded that Kerry was a poor campaigner.&lt;ref name=future&gt;[[Evan Thomas|Thomas, Evan]], [[Eleanor Clift|Clift, Eleanor]], Staff of [[Newsweek]] (2005).''Election 2004: How Bush Won and What You Can Expect in the Future''.

Kerry was unable to reconcile his initial support of the [[Iraq War]] with his opposition to the war in 2004 or manage the deep split in the Democratic Party between those who favored and opposed the war.&lt;ref name=future/&gt;

Republicans ran thousands of television commercials to argue that Kerry had flip-flopped on Iraq. When Kerry's home state of Massachusetts legalized [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|same-sex marriage]], the issue split liberal and conservative Democrats and independents (Kerry publicly stated throughout his campaign that he opposed same-sex marriage, but favored civil unions). Republicans exploited the same-sex marriage issue by promoting ballot initiatives in 11 states that brought conservatives to the polls in large numbers: all 11 initiatives passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wenner|first=Jann S.|title=Why Bush Won|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=November 17, 2004|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/search?q=why+bush+won&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|accessdate=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flaws in vote-counting systems may also have played a role in Kerry's defeat (see [[2004 United States election voting controversies]]). Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] of California and several Democratic U.S. Representatives (including [[John Conyers]] of Michigan) raised the issue of voting irregularities in Ohio when the 109th Congress first convened, but they were defeated 267–31 by the House and 74-1 by the Senate. Other factors included a healthy job market, a rising stock market, strong home sales and low unemployment.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

After the 2004 election, prominent Democrats began to rethink the party's direction and a variety of strategies for moving forward were voiced. Some Democrats proposed moving towards the right to regain seats in the House and Senate and possibly win the Presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|election of 2008]], while others demanded that the party move more to the left and become a stronger opposition party. One topic of discussion was the party's policies surrounding [[reproductive rights]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Rethinking the party's position on gun control became a matter of discussion, brought up by [[Howard Dean]], [[Bill Richardson]], [[Brian Schweitzer]] and other Democrats who had won governorships in states where [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights were important to many voters. In ''[[What's the Matter with Kansas?]],'' commentator [[Thomas Frank]] wrote that the Democrats needed to return to campaigning on economic populism.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Howard Dean and the fifty-state strategy (2005–2007) ===
These debates were reflected in the 2005 campaign for Chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]], which [[Howard Dean]] won over the objections of many party insiders. Dean sought to move the Democratic strategy away from the establishment and bolster support for the party's state organizations, even in [[Red states and blue states|red states]] (the [[fifty-state strategy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050204073722/http://www.blogforamerica.com/archives/005851.html "Interview with Howard Dean"]. ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]''. January 23, 2005. [[American Broadcasting Company|American Broadcasting Company (ABC)]]. Retrieved on October 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[109th Congress]] convened, [[Harry Reid]], the new [[Senate Minority Leader]], tried to convince the Democratic Senators to vote more as a bloc on important issues and he forced the Republicans to abandon their push for [[Social Security debate in the United States|privatization of Social Security]]. In 2005, the Democrats retained their governorships in [[Virginia]] and [[New Jersey]], electing [[Tim Kaine]] and [[Jon Corzine]], respectively. However, the party lost the mayoral race in [[New York City]], a Democratic stronghold, for the fourth straight time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

With scandals involving lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]] as well as [[Duke Cunningham]], [[Tom DeLay]], [[Mark Foley scandal|Mark Foley]] and [[Bob Taft]], the Democrats used the slogan "[[2006 Republican party scandals|Culture of corruption]]" against the Republicans during the 2006 campaign. Negative public opinion on the [[Iraq War]], widespread dissatisfaction over the ballooning federal deficit and the inept handling of the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster dragged down President Bush's job approval ratings.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As a result of the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party became the majority party in the House of Representatives and its caucus in the United States Senate constituted a majority when the [[110th Congress]] convened in 2007. The Democrats had spent twelve successive years as the minority party in the House before the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats also went from controlling a minority of governorships to a majority. The number of seats held by party members likewise increased in various state legislatures, giving the Democrats control of a plurality of them nationwide. No Democratic incumbent was defeated and no Democratic-held open seat was lost in either the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, or with regards to any governorship.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Democratic Party's electoral success has been attributed by some to running conservative-leaning Democrats against at-risk Republican incumbents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hook|first=Janet|title=A right kind of Democrat|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 26, 2006}} See also: {{cite news|last=Dewan|first=Shaila|author2=Kornblut, Anne E.|title=In Key House Races, Democrats Run to the Right|work=The New York Times|date=October 30, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/us/politics/30dems.html|accessdate=November 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim that running more populists and progressive candidates has been the source of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner|first=Robin|title=Incoming Democrats Put Populism Before Ideology|work=The New York Times|date=November 12, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/us/politics/12class.html?ex=1320987600&amp;en=fd6f17e5fd44b9ad&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=April 24, 2007}} {{cite news|last=Burt|first=Nick|author2=Bleifuss, Joel|title=Progressive Caucus Rising|work=[[In These Times]]|date=November 8, 2006|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2914/|accessdate=February 15, 2007}} {{cite news|last=Bacon Jr.|first=Perry|author2=Cox, Ana Marie|author3=Tumulty, Karen|title=5 Myths About the Midterm Elections|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=November 16, 2006|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1560212,00.html|accessdate=February 11, 2007}} {{cite news|last=Bazinet|first=Kenneth R.|title=Hil's no dump Dean fan|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 19, 2006|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/472767p-397816c.html|accessdate=February 11, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006190641/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/472767p-397816c.html|archivedate=October 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corruption named as key issue by voters in exit polls|publisher=CNN|date=November 8, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/07/election.exitpolls/|accessdate=January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 Democratic caucus leadership elections, Democrats chose Representative [[Steny Hoyer]] of Maryland for [[House Majority Leader]] and nominated Representative [[Nancy Pelosi]] of California for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]]. Senate Democrats chose [[Harry Reid]] of Nevada for [[United States Senate Majority Leader]].

=== 2008 presidential election ===
The [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primaries]] left two candidates in close competition: Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]] and New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]. Both had won more support within a major American political party than any previous African American or female candidate. Before official ratification at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], Obama emerged as the party's presumptive nominee. With President [[George W. Bush]] of the Republican Party ineligible for a third term and the Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] not pursuing his party's nomination, Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona more quickly emerged as the GOP nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes Johnson and Dan Balz, ''The Battle for America 2008: The Story of an Extraordinary Election'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 general election]], polls showed a close race between Obama and John McCain. However, Obama maintained a small but widening lead over McCain in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|liquidity crisis of September 2008]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On November 4, Obama defeated McCain by a significant margin in the Electoral College and the party also made further gains in the Senate and House, adding to its 2006 gains.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

{{main|Presidency of Barack Obama}}
[[File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|upright|On November 4, 2008, [[Barack Obama]] was elected as the first African American President of the United States]]
On January 20, 2009, Obama was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] as the 44th president of the United States in a ceremony attended by nearly 2 million people, the largest congregation of spectators ever to witness the inauguration of a new President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012103884.html|work=The Washington Post|title=D.C.'s Inauguration Head Count: 1.8 Million|first1=Michael E.|last1=Ruane|first2=Aaron C.|last2=Davis|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day in Washington, D.C., Republican House of Representative leaders met in an "invitation only" meeting for four hours to discuss the future of the Republican Party under the Obama administration. During the meeting, they agreed to bring Congress to a standstill regardless of how much it would hurt the American economy by pledging to obstruct and block President Obama on all legislation.

One of the first acts by the Obama administration after assuming control was an order signed by [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Rahm Emanuel]] that suspended all pending federal regulations proposed by outgoing President [[George W. Bush]] so that they could be reviewed. This was comparable to prior moves by the Bush administration upon assuming control from [[Bill Clinton]], who in his final 20 days in office issued 12 [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Obama halts all regulations pending review|date=January 20, 2009|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28758810/|accessdate=February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first week, Obama also established a policy of producing a weekly Saturday morning video address available on [[Whitehouse.gov]] and YouTube, much like those released during his transition period. The policy is likened to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[fireside chats]] and George W. Bush's weekly radio addresses.

President Obama signed into law the following significant legislation during his first 100 days in the [[White House]]: [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]], Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009 and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Also during his first 100 days, the Obama administration reversed the following significant George W. Bush administration policies: supporting the [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]], relaxing enforcement of cannabis laws and lifting the 7½-year ban on federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]]. Obama also issued [[Executive Order 13492]], ordering the closure of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], although it has remained open throughout his presidency. He also lifted some travel and money restrictions to the island, ended the [[Mexico City Policy]] and signed an order requiring the [[Army Field Manual]] to be used as guide for terror interrogations, which banned [[torture]] and other coercive techniques, such as [[waterboarding]].

Obama also announced stricter guidelines regarding [[lobbying in the United States|lobbyists]] in an effort to raise the ethical standards of the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today|title=Obama freezing pay of top staff; signs ethics rules|date=January 21, 2009|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/01/61712448/1|accessdate=February 1, 2009|first=Mark|last=Memmott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new policy bans aides from attempting to influence the administration for at least two years if they leave his staff. It also bans aides on staff from working on matters they have previously lobbied on, or to approach agencies that they targeted while on staff.

During the beginning of Obama Presidency emerged the [[Tea Party movement]], a [[conservative]] movement that began to heavily influence the Republican Party within the United States, shifting the GOP further right-wing and partisan in their ideology. On February 18, 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25074581-2703,00.html|title=Obama launches Afghanistan surge|agency=The Australian|date=February 19, 2009|first=Amanda|last=Hodge}} {{link note|note=If you receive a 403 "forbidden" error using the previous link, try [https://web.archive.org/web/20110820122329/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/obama-launches-afghanistan-surge/story-e6frg6t6-1111118893671 "Obama launches Afghanistan surge"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement followed the recommendation of several experts including Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] that additional troops be deployed to the strife-torn South Asian country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gates: More Troops For Afghanistan|agency=The New York Post|date=January 27, 2009|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01272009/news/nationalnews/gates__more_troops_for_afghanistan_152275.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, 2009, Obama addressed [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] at [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]] and outlined an exit strategy for the [[Iraq War]].

Obama signed two [[presidential memorandum]] concerning energy independence, ordering the [[Department of Transportation]] to establish higher fuel efficiency standards before 2011 models are released and allowing states to raise their emissions standards above the national standard. Due to the [[Late 2000s recession|economic crisis]], the President enacted a pay freeze for senior White House staff making more than $100,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=MSNBC|title=Obama's first day: Pay freeze, lobbying rules|date=January 21, 2009|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28767687|accessdate=February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action affected approximately 120 staffers and added up to about a $443,000 savings for the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2009/01/_thanks_to_dan_froomkins.html|title=Adding Up the White House Pay Freeze|accessdate=February 1, 2009|date=January 22, 2009|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|work=The Washington Post|author=Kravitz, Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 2009, in a meeting with the [[New Democrat Coalition]], Obama told them that he was a "[[New Democrat]]", "pro-growth Democrat", "supports free and fair trade" and "very concerned about a return to protectionism".&lt;ref name="Obama: 'I am a New Democrat'"&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2009/03/obama-i-am-a-new-democrat-019862#ixzz3o9jykSUe "Obama: 'I am a New Democrat'"].&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2009, President Obama [[Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Sonia Sotomayor]] for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. Sotomayor was confirmed by the Senate becoming the highest ranking government official of Puerto Rican heritage ever. On July 1, 2009, President Obama signed into law the [[Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010]]. On July 7, 2009, [[Al Franken]] was sworn into the Senate, thus Senate Democrats obtained the 60 vote threshold to overcome the [[Senate filibuster]].

On October 28, 2009, Obama signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010]], which included in it the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], which expanded federal hate crime laws to include [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and disability.  On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5–4 decision in the case of ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' that the First Amendment prohibited the government from restricting [[Independent expenditure|independent political expenditures]] by a [[nonprofit corporation]]. On February 4, 2010, Republican [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] of Massachusetts was sworn into the Senate, thus ending Senate Democrats 60 vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law his signature legislation of his presidency, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]], which represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the [[Health care in the United States|U.S. healthcare system]] since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965. On May 10, 2010, President Obama [[Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Elena Kagan]] for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and Elena Kagan was confirmed by the Senate on August 5, 2010 by a 63–37 vote. Kagan was sworn in by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] on August 7, 2010.

On 19 August 2010, the [[4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division]] was the last American combat brigade to withdraw from Iraq. In a speech at the [[Oval Office]] on {{Nowrap|31 August 2010}}, Obama declared: "[T]he American combat mission in Iraq has ended.

On November 2, 2010 during [[United States elections, 2010|the 2010 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party had a net loss of six seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House. Control of the House of Representatives switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. The Democrats lost a net of six state governorships and a net 680 seats in state legislatures. The Democrats lost control of seven state Senate legislatures and 13 state Houses. This was the worst performance of the Democratic Party in a national election since the [[United States elections, 1946|1946 elections]]. The [[Blue Dog Coalition]] numbers in the House were reduced from 54 members in 2008 to 26 members in 2011 and were half of the Democratic defeats during the election. This was the first United States national election in which [[Super PACs]] were used by Democrats and Republicans. Many commentators contribute the electoral success of the Republican Party in 2010 to the conservative Super PACs' campaign spending, Tea Party movement, backlash against President Obama, failure to mobilize the Obama coalition to get out and vote and the failure of President Obama to enact many of his progressive and liberal campaign promises.

On December 1, 2010, Obama announced at the [[U.S. Military Academy]] in West Point that the U.S. would send 30,000 more troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=December 5, 2009|title=How Obama Came to Plan for 'Surge' in Afghanistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/asia/06reconstruct.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-war organizations in the U.S. responded quickly and cities throughout the U.S. saw protests on 2 December.&lt;ref name="Fight Back!

During the lameduck session of the 111th United States Congress, President Obama signed into law the following significant legislation: [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010]], [[Shark Conservation Act of 2010]] and the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act|FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010]]. On December 18, 2010, the [[Arab Spring]] began. On 22 December 2010, the U.S. Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of [[New START]] by a vote of 71 to 26 on the resolution of ratification.

On February 23, 2011, [[United States Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] announced the United States federal government would no longer defend the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] within federal courts. In response to the [[First Libyan Civil War]], [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] joined with [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.N. Ambassador]] [[Susan Rice]] and Office of Multilateral and Human Rights Director [[Samantha Power]] led the hawkish diplomatic team within the [[Obama administration]] that helped convince President Obama in favor airstrikes against Libyan government. On March 19, 2011, the United States began [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]].

[[US domestic reactions to the 2011 military intervention in Libya|United States domestic reaction to the 2011 military intervention in Libya]] were mixed in the Democratic Party. Opponents to the 2011 military intervention in Libya within the Democratic Party include Rep. [[Dennis Kucinich]], Sen. [[Jim Webb]], Rep. [[Raul Grijalva]], Rep. [[Mike Honda]], Rep. [[Lynn Woolsey]] and Rep. [[Barbara Lee]]. The [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC), an organization of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] Democrats, said that the United States should conclude its campaign against Libyan air defenses as soon as possible. Support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya within the Democratic Party include President [[Bill Clinton]], Sen. [[Carl Levin]], Sen. [[Dick Durbin]], Sen. [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]], Sen. [[John Kerry]], [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader of the House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Legal Adviser of the Department of State]] [[Harold Hongju Koh]] and [[Ed Schultz]].

On April 5, 2011, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] announced that [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] was President Obama's choice to succeed [[Tim Kaine]] as the 52nd Chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. On May 26, 2011, President Obama signed the [[Patriot Act|PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011]], which was strongly criticized by some in the Democratic Party as violation of civil liberties and a continuation of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. House Democrats largely opposed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, while Senate Democrats were slightly in favor of it.

On October 21, 2011, President Obama signed into law three of the following [[United States free trade agreements]]: [[Free trade agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Korea]], [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement]] and the [[United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement]]. In the House of Representatives, Democratic Representatives largely opposed these agreements, while Senate Democrats were split on the agreements. This was a continuation of President Bill Clinton's policy of support for [[free trade agreements]].

When asked by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] about his views on [[same-sex marriage]] on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on May 5, 2012, Biden stated he supported same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="Stein0506"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Sam|title=Joe Biden Tells 'Meet The Press' He's 'Comfortable' With Marriage Equality|work=The Huffington Post|date=May 6, 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/06/vice-president-biden-gay-marriage_n_1489235.html|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2012, a day after [[North Carolina]] voters approved [[North Carolina Amendment 1|Amendment 1]], President Obama became the first sitting United States President to come out in favor of same-sex marriage.

The 2012 Democratic Party platform for Obama's reelection ran over 26,000 words and included his position on numerous national issues. On security issues, it pledges "unshakable commitment to [[Israel]]'s security", says the party will try to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It calls for a strong military, but argues that in the current fiscal environment, tough budgetary decisions must include defense spending. On controversial social issues it supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage and says the party is "strongly committed to enacting comprehensive immigration reform". On the economic side the platform calls for extending the tax cuts for families earning under $250,000 and promises not to raise their taxes. It praises the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] ("Obamacare", but does not use that term). It "adamantly oppose any efforts to privatize [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]". On the rules of politics it attacks the recent Supreme Court decision ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' that allows much greater political spending. It demands  "immediate action to curb the influence of lobbyists and special interests on our political institutions".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/101962.pdf "Moving America Forward 2012 Democratic National Platform"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense budget negotiations in the divided [[112th Congress]], wherein Democrats resolved to fight Republican demands for decreased spending and no tax hikes, threatened to [[government shutdown|shut down the government]] in April 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government shutdown averted: Congress agrees to budget deal, stopgap funding|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/reid-says-impasse-based-on-abortion-funding-boehner-denies-it/2011/04/08/AFO40U1C_story.html|accessdate=July 14, 2012|work=The Washington Post|date=April 8, 2011|author1=Kane, Paul|author2=Rucker, Philip|author3=Farenthold, David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later spurred fears that the United States would [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|default on its debt]]. Continuing tight budgets were felt at the state level, where [[public-sector trade union|public-sector unions]], a key Democratic constituency, battled Republican efforts to limit their [[collective bargaining]] powers in order to save money and reduce union power. This led to [[2011 United States public employee protests|sustained protests]] by public-sector employees and walkouts by sympathetic Democratic legislators in states like [[2011 Wisconsin protests|Wisconsin]] and Ohio. The 2011 "[[Occupy movement]]". a campaign on the left for more accountable economic leadership, failed to have the impact on Democratic Party leadership and policy that the Tea Party movement had on the Republicans.  ts leadership proved ineffective and the Occupy movement fizzled out. However, echoes could be found in the presidential nomination campaign of Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] in 2015–2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger L. Ray|title=Progressive Conversations: Essays on Matters of Social Justice for Critical Thinkers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkyPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|year=2016|publisher=Wipf and Stock|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservatives criticized the president for "passive" responses to crises such as the [[2009 Iranian protests]] and the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]. Additionally, liberal and Democratic activists objected to Obama's decisions to send reinforcements to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], resume military trials of terror suspects at [[Guantanamo Bay]] and to help enforce a [[2011 military intervention in Libya|no-fly zone]] over [[Libya]] during that country's [[2011 Libyan civil war|civil war]]. However, the demands of anti-war advocates were heeded when Obama followed through on a campaign promise to [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|withdraw combat troops]] from Iraq.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]] was characterized by very high spending, especially on negative television ads in about ten critical states. Despite a weak economic recovery and high unemployment, the Obama campaign successfully mobilized its coalition of youth, blacks, Hispanics and women. The campaign carried all the same states as in 2008 except two, Indiana and North Carolina. The election continued the pattern whereby Democrats won more votes in all presidential elections after 1988, except for 2004. Obama and the Democrats lost control of the Senate in the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]], losing nine seats in that body and 13 in the GOP House.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

National polling from 2013 to the summer of 2015 showed [[Hillary Clinton]] with an overwhelming commanding lead over all of her potential primary opponents. Her main challenger was [[Independent politician#Congress|independent]] Vermont Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], whose rallies grew larger and larger as he attracted overwhelming majorities among Democrats under age 40. The sharp divide between the two candidates was the establishment versus the political outsider, with Clinton being the establishment candidate and Sanders the outsider. Clinton received the endorsements from an overwhelming majority of office holders. Clinton's core base voters during the primary was women, African Americans, Latino Americans, LGBTs, moderates and older voters, while Sanders' core base included younger voters under age 40, men and progressives.

====== Ideological differences ======
{{further|Political positions of the Democratic Party presidential primary candidates, 2016}}
The ideological differences between the two candidates represented the ideological divide within the Democratic Party as a whole. Clinton, who cast herself as a moderate and a progressive, is ideologically more of a [[Centrism|centrist]], representing the [[Third Way]], [[New Democrat]] wing of the Democratic Party, as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] did. Bernie Sanders, who remained an independent in the Senate throughout the primaries (despite running for President as a Democrat), is a self described [[democratic socialist]], and is ideologically more of a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Social democracy|social-democrat]] representing the progressive/populist wing of the Democratic Party, which includes politicians such as [[Elizabeth Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Lizza.

During the primaries, Sanders attacked Clinton for her ties to Wall Street and her previous support of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Keystone Pipeline]], the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] and the [[Iraq War]], while Clinton attacked Sanders for voting against the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]], the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]], the [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]] and the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McGill.

===== Justice Democrats =====
{{main|Justice Democrats}}
On January 23, 2017, [[Justice Democrats]], [[political action committee]], was created by [[Cenk Uygur]] of ''[[The Young Turks]]'', [[Kyle Kulinski]] of ''Secular Talk'', Saikat Chakrabarti and [[Zack Exley]] (both former leadership from the former [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign]]). The organization, formed as a result of the 2016 United States presidential election, has a stated goal of reforming the Democratic Party by running "a unified campaign to replace every corporate-backed member of Congress and rebuild the [Democratic] party from scratch" starting in the [[United States elections, 2018|2018 Congressional midterms]].&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://justicedemocrats.com/platform/|title=Platform|publisher=Justice Democrats|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mic.com article"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/166390/cenk-ugyur-bernie-sanders-staffers-team-up-to-take-over-the-democratic-party#.4hZHTtpWf|title=Cenk Uygur, Bernie Sanders staffers team up to take over the Democratic Party|last=Mic|newspaper=Mic|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The money will be spent to conduct extensive research, reporting and polling in [[Rust Belt]] states that once formed a [[Blue wall (politics)|Blue Wall]], but which voted for President Donald Trump in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/democratic-party-voters-reconnect-233666 "Democratic Party rethink gets $20 million injection"].&lt;/ref&gt; Many progressives have criticized this as a desperate measure for the so-called establishment wing of the party to retain leadership.

===== Onward Together =====
{{main|Onward Together}}
On May 15, 2017, [[Onward Together]], a [[501(c)(4) organization|political action organization]] was launched by [[Hillary Clinton]] to fundraise for liberal organizations, such as Swing Left, [[Indivisible movement|Indivisible]], [[Color of Change]], [[Emerge America]], and Run for Something,.&lt;ref name="politicopalmerhillaryclinton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Anna|title=Hillary Clinton launches new political group: 'Onward Together'|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/hillary-clinton-launches-new-political-group-onward-together-progressive/|accessdate=May 17, 2017|publisher=Politico|date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election was characterized primarily as being between the two candidates for the chairmanship, [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for [[Minnesota's 5th congressional district]] [[Keith Ellison]] and 26th [[United States Secretary of Labor]] [[Tom Perez]]. On February 25, 2017, Perez won the Democratic National Committee chairmanship and named Keith Ellison as Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee, a newly created position. The Obama administration pushed for Tom Perez to run against Keith Ellison, and President Obama personally called DNC members to encourage them to vote for Perez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-keith-ellison-dnc_us_585460a1e4b0b3ddfd8cd1b5 "Obama All But Endorses Tom Perez Against Keith Ellison For DNC Chair"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillheat.com/articles/2017/02/26/ex-president-barack-obama-orchestrated-tom-perez-dnc-chair-victory "Ex-President Barack Obama Orchestrated Tom Perez DNC Chair Victory"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language Rights Support Program''' (LRSP) is a non-profit organisation whose objectives are "to promote awareness of [[language rights]] through public education; to offer access to alternative dispute resolution processes to settle disputes out of court; to support litigation that helps to advance and clarify constitutional language rights when test cases are involved and dispute resolution efforts have not resolved matters." &lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Website ''[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/lo-ol/pgm/pubs/padl-lrsp/101-eng.cfm Language Rights Support Program]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the abolition of the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada]] in 2006, the Language Rights Support Program was created in 2008, receiving an annual budget of $1.5 million from the Government of Canada.

The LRSP works to promote constitutional language rights in Canada and offers financial aid to individuals, groups and non-profit organizations who belong to [[official bilingualism in Canada|official language]] communities in Canada and who feel their constitutional language rights have been breached.

Financial aid can be awarded for [[alternative dispute resolution]] such as mediation, negotiation and arbitration or it can be awarded for litigation. To receive financial aid, applicants must fulfill the criteria set forth by the LRSP, most importantly having a case that involves constitutional language rights.

{{Paris Peace Conference sidebox}}

The '''Lausanne Conference''' was a 1932 meeting of representatives from [[Great Britain]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], and [[France]] that resulted in an agreement to suspend [[World War I reparations]] payments imposed on the defeated countries by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Held from June 16 to July 9, 1932, it was named for its location in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]].

A [[Hoover Moratorium|moratorium]] had been placed on the war reparations payments in 1931 and a year later the delegates to the Lausanne Conference realized that the deepening world financial crisis in the [[Great Depression]] made it nearly impossible for Germany to resume its payments. However, Britain and France and other Allies had borrowed heavily to fight the war, and in particular, France and Belgium were struggling after having had their infrastructure severely damaged by the fighting and by the deliberate destruction and plundering from retreating German forces as the war drew to a close. Therefore, the delegates came to an informal understanding that the permanent elimination of Germany's debt and war reparations would be subject to reaching an agreement with the United States concerning their outstanding war debts.

In December 1932, the [[U.S. Congress]] rejected the Allied war debt reduction plan, which technically meant that the war reparations and debt reverted to the debt reduction previously granted Germany by the 1929 [[Young Plan]]. However, the system had collapsed, and Germany made no further payments. By 1933, Germany had made World War I reparations of only one-eighth of the sum required under the Treaty of Versailles.

The '''Liberal Party of South Africa''' was a [[South Africa]]n political party from 1953 to 1968.

==Founding ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
The party was founded on 9 May 1953 at a meeting of the South African Liberal Association in [[Cape Town]].{{sfn|Paton|1968}} Essentially it grew out of a belief that the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] was unable to achieve any real liberal progress in South Africa. Its establishment occurred during the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis|"Coloured Vote" Constitutional Crisis]] of the 1950s, and the division of the [[Torch Commando]] on the matter of mixed membership.

Founding members of the party included (original positions in the party given):
*[[Margaret Ballinger]] (South African MP) &amp;ndash; President of party&lt;ref name="paton-ctr"&gt;http://paton.ukzn.ac.za/Collections/liberal.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alan Paton]] (novelist) &amp;ndash; Vice-President&lt;ref name="paton-ctr" /&gt;
*[[Leo Marquard]] &amp;ndash; Vice President&lt;ref name="paton-ctr" /&gt;
*Dr Oscar Wolheim &amp;ndash; Chairman&lt;ref name="paton-ctr" /&gt;
*[[Leslie Rubin]] (South African Senator) &amp;ndash; Vice-Chairman&lt;ref name="Guardian2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paton-ctr" /&gt;
*[[Peter Brown (South African politician)|Peter Brown]] &amp;ndash; National Chairman
*[[H. Selby Msimang]]
*[[Leo Kuper]]&lt;ref name="Waters2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cdlib" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge" /&gt;
*[[Hilda Kuper]]&lt;ref name="cdlib" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge" /&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Liberal veldtog.jpg|thumbnail|Workers posters in [[Sea Point]] during the 1959 provincial election campaign]]
For the first half of its life the Liberal Party was comparatively conservative, and saw its task primarily in terms of changing the minds of the white electorate. It leaned towards a qualified franchise.

This changed in 1959–1960. The [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]], formed in 1959, occupied the political ground that the Liberal Party had occupied up till then. In 1960 the [[Sharpeville massacre]] and consequent [[State of emergency|State of Emergency]], during which several Liberal party members were detained, changed the outlook of the party. Another factor was the use of simultaneous translation equipment at party congresses, which enabled black rural members to speak uninhibitedly for the first time.

In the 1960s, therefore, the Liberal Party stood unequivocally for a democratic nonracial South Africa, with "one man, one vote" as its franchise policy.

The Liberal Party also supported liberal candidates in the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]] elections, and helped its rural members and others, especially in Natal, to resist the [[ethnic cleansing]] brought about by the implementation of [[apartheid]]. This led to the banning of several party members and leaders.  One member of the Liberal Party, [[Eddie Daniels (political activist)|Eddie Daniels]], spent fifteen years on [[Robben Island]] during [[Nelson Mandela]]'s time there.

==Contact==
The newspaper ''Contact'' was closely tied to the Liberal Party, although officially it was a separate publication. The link is described by Callan as follows:
{{quote|"Nevertheless, ''Contact'' has become so invariably associated in the public mind with the Liberal Party that it now seems merely academic to insist on its independent status."{{sfn|Paton|1968}} }}
It may, however, be more accurate to tie the paper to [[Patrick Duncan (anti-apartheid activist)|Patrick Duncan]] than the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Driver|2000|p=35}}

==End ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
The party was in direct conflict with the South African government from the outset. This was due largely to the party's opposition to [[apartheid]] and criticism of the erosion of human rights by laws allowing detention without trial and arbitrary suppression of political opposition. Many of its members were placed under [[ban (law)|bans]] and persecuted by the South African government, which accused the party of furthering the aims of [[Communism]].

In 1968 the South African government passed the so-called [[Prohibition of Improper Interference Act]], which banned parties from having a multiracial membership. The Liberal Party was therefore forced to choose between disbanding or going underground, and in 1968 chose to disband.&lt;ref name="paton-ctr"/&gt; The final meeting was held in The Guildhall, Durban.

{{for|the concept of staying proceedings, when a law suit is pending elsewhere|Lis alibi pendens}}
In [[law of the United States|United States law]], a '''''lis pendens''''' is a written notice that a lawsuit has been filed concerning real estate, involving either the title to the property or a claimed ownership interest in it. The notice is usually filed in the county land records office. Recording a ''lis pendens'' against a piece of property alerts a potential purchaser or lender that the property’s title is in question, which makes the property less attractive to a buyer or lender. Once the notice is filed, the legal title of anyone who nevertheless purchases the land or property described in the notice is subject to the ultimate decision of the lawsuit.

''Lis pendens'' is Latin for "suit pending".&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 950 (8th ed.), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This may refer to any pending lawsuit or to a specific situation with a public notice of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] that has been recorded in the same location where the [[title (property)|title]] of [[real property]] has been recorded. This notice secures a [[plaintiff]]'s claim on the property so that a sale, [[mortgage]], or [[encumbrance]] of the property will not diminish plaintiff's rights to the property, should the plaintiff prevail in its case. In some jurisdictions, when the notice is properly recorded, ''lis pendens'' is considered [[constructive notice]] to other litigants or other unrecorded or subordinate [[lienholders]].

The recording office will record a ''lis pendens'' upon request of anyone who claims to be entitled to do so (e.g. because he has filed a lawsuit). If someone else with an interest in the property (e.g. the owner) believes the ''lis pendens'' is not proper, he can then file suit to have it expunged.

Some states' ''lis pendens'' statutes require the filer of the notice, in the event of a challenge to the notice, to establish that it has [[probable cause]] or a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its case in the underlying lawsuit. Other states do not have such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''McAteer v. Lauterbach'', 908 A.2d 1168, 1170 (D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Under the common law, the mere existence of a lawsuit potentially affecting the title to real property had the legal effect of putting the entire world on constructive notice of the suit;&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''First Maryland Financial Services Corp. v. District-Realty Title Insurance Corp.'', 548 A.2d 787, 791 (D.C. 1988); ''Malcolm v. Superior Court (Green)'', 29 Cal.3d 518, 523 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; anyone acquiring an interest in real property which was the subject of a pending suit took that interest subject to the litigants' rights as they might be eventually determined, no matter how much later.&lt;ref&gt;''District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency v. Dowdey'', 618 A.2d 153, 161 fn. 14 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, nothing relating to the ownership of the subject matter of the suit could be definitively changed while the suit was pending.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Lewis v. Jordan Investments, Inc.'', 725 A.2d 495, 500 (D.C. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Without publication of the existence of a lawsuit, innocent buyers might discover the existence of a lawsuit too late.

The harsh effect of this rule, and its effect on innocent purchasers, led many jurisdictions to enact ''lis pendens'' statutes requiring a written notice, usually recorded in the land records where the real estate is located, for the notice provisions of the rule to be effective. Typically, a separate recorded instrument is required by statute if the lawsuit in question affects title to real property.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Calif. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 405–405.61; D.C. Code § 42-1207 (formerly § 45-906.1), enacted 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; If the statutory requirements are met, the world is put on "constructive notice" of the existence of the suit, and any person acquiring an interest later does so subject to the outcome of the suit.

== Effect ==
''Lis pendens'' is taken as constructive notice of the pending lawsuit,&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Weil &amp; I.A. Brown, Jr., California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial ¶ 15:1.&lt;/ref&gt; and it serves to place a cloud on the title of the property in question until the suit is resolved and the notice released or the ''lis pendens'' is expunged. Careful buyers will be unwilling to purchase land subject to a ''lis pendens'' or will only purchase the land at a discount, prudent lenders will not lend money against the security of the land, and title insurance companies will not insure the title to such land: title is taken subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. Because so much real property is purchased with borrowed money, this usually keeps the owner from selling the property. It also may keep the owner from borrowing money secured by the property (such as to pay the costs of defending the suit).

It is important to note that the presence of a ''lis pendens'' does ''not'' prevent or necessarily invalidate a transfer of the property,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''1st Atlantic Guaranty Corp. v. Tillerson'', 916 A.2d 153, 157 (D.C. 2007); see also ''Morrison v. Shuster'', 1 Mackey 190, 200, 1881 U.S.App.Lexis 2702 (1881).&lt;/ref&gt; although it makes such a transfer subject to the outcome of the litigation. Thus, the owner is not prevented from selling the land for (non-borrowed) cash, pledging it as security for a speculative loan, or giving it away, all subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. However, once the ''lis pendens'' is recorded, the recipient (a "purchaser" or "grantee ''pendente lite''")&lt;ref&gt;''1st Atl. Guar. Corp. v. Tillerson'', 916 A.2d 153, 157, quoting Powell on Real Property § 82A.01 [1] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; would be deemed to have notice of the litigation and might lose their title to the property if the plaintiff's suit prevails.

While it is generally thought of in connection with real property (land, buildings, and the like), the doctrine of ''lis pendens'' also applies to personal property.&lt;ref&gt;''Weightman v. Washington Critic Co.'', 4 App. D.C. 136 (1894).&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, ''lis pendens'' statutes only apply to real property, so the common-law doctrine probably still applies to personal property.

'''Margaret Craig McNamara''' (August 22, 1915 – February 3, 1981) was the founder of the nonprofit children's literacy organization [[Reading is Fundamental]] and the wife of the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert S. McNamara]].

==Life and work==
McNamara was born on August 22, 1915 in [[Spokane, Washington]], but she grew up in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmmf-grants.org/margaret-mcnamara-story.html Margaret McNamara Memorial Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

McNamara attended [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she met [[Robert McNamara]], whom she would marry on August 13, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-mcnamara-secretary-of-defense-excoriated-for-his-part-in-leading-america-into-the-vietnam-war-1734442.html Robert McNamara: Secretary of Defense excoriated for his part in leading America into the Vietnam War], a July 7, 2009, obituary from ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband's appointment by President [[John F. Kennedy]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] led to their move to [[Washington, D.C.]]. Her experiences while tutoring three children in the District led to the formation of [[Reading is Fundamental]] (RIF), a nonprofit children's literacy organization dedicated to making reading a fun and beneficial part of everyday life. It is the largest literacy program in the country.

On January 16, 1981, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] awarded McNamara the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom|Medal of Freedom]] for her work with RIF. She died of [[cancer]] eighteen days later, at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/04/obituaries/margaret-mcnamara-65-is-dead-began-children-s-reading-program.html Margaret Craig McNamara, 65, is Dead; Began Children's Reading Program], a February 4, 1981, obituary from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time1981"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954682,00.html Deaths], a February 16, 1981, article from [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

{{main|Reading Is Fundamental}}
After many early organizational meeting with other educators in the District, McNamara secured a $150,000 grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to support pilot activities in the District of Columbia. Following the success RIF had in Washington, the Ford Foundation increased RIF's grant to $285,000 in August 1968, enabling RIF to launch ten model programs across the country. From these early beginnings, RIF evolved into a national motivating force for literacy. At the time of McNamara's death in 1981, RIF had provided "more than 3 million poor children with 37 million books."&lt;ref name="time1981"/&gt;

Today, through its contract with the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] and with private funds, RIF provides 16 million free books for children to choose and keep each year. RIF programs operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} RIF is also affiliated with programs in Argentina and the United Kingdom. It achieves high visibility through [[public service announcements]] on [[children's television]] programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Margaret McNamara Education Grants===
The Margaret McNamara Memorial Fund was established in 1981 to honor Margaret McNamara and her commitment to the well-being of women and children in developing countries. Grants are provided annually to support the university education of women from developing countries who are committed to improving the lives of women and children. Grant recipients study in diverse fields, such as agriculture, architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, education, forestry, journalism, nursing, nutrition, pediatrics, public administration, public health, social sciences, and social work. In 2015, the organization was rebranded as Margaret McNamara Education Grants ([http://www.mmeg.org MMEG)].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmeg.org&lt;/ref&gt; Grants are awarded to women studying at accredited universities in the USA, Canada, select universities in Latin America and in South Africa.

'''''Mirth &amp; Girth''''' is a portrait painting by [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC) student David K. Nelson, Jr., depicting the recently deceased, popular African-American mayor of [[Chicago]], [[Harold Washington]] wearing only a bra, [[G-string]], garter belt and stockings.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD4093DE240&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Controversial painting reported damaged |author1=Hanania, Mark  |author2=Padgett, Tim  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 14, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief showing at a May 11, 1988 private student exhibition in the Art Institute, angry African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]], including Ald. [[Allan Streeter]],  Ald. [[Bobby Rush]] and Ald. [[Dorothy Tillman]],  arrived with [[Chicago Police Department]] officers and confiscated the painting, triggering a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and race relations crisis and a civil lawsuit.

[[Freedom of speech|Free-speech]] advocates condemned the seizure of the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington and should have been taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the [[Richard J. Daley Plaza]], while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.

At some point between when the painting was confiscated and when it was returned, a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|adj=on}} gash was made on the canvas. Nelson filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. He and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) settled with the city for $95,000 (1994; {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in compensation for the damaged painting after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] upheld the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|lower court's]] decision.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Harold Washington, the subject of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]]. After the death of [[Richard J. Daley]] in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, prevailing over [[Bernard Epton]] in a racially polarizing general election.&lt;ref name=levinsohn&gt;{{cite book |title=Harold Washington: A Political Biography |last=Hamlish Levinsohn |first=Florence |year=1983 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Chicago |pages=265–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first four-year term was characterized by the [[Council Wars]], a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in [[Chicago City Council|City Council]].&lt;ref name="rivlin_209-210"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly of a heart attack in his office.&lt;ref name="merriner_19871206"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36D9B94393A81&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=City's 'Beirut' image fires up outside press on mayor vote |last=Merriner |first=Jim |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 6, 1987 |accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis_19871126"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF68F31FB93F51A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Mayor's death stuns city&amp;nbsp;— black leader, 65, on verge of a dream |author=Davis, Robert.

=== Creation of painting ===
Shortly after Washington's death, Nelson (who is white)&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D6153EF930A25756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |title=Chicago aldermen and police seize portrait that blacks deem offensive |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |author=Schmidt, William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'', a "full-length frontal portrait of a portly grim-faced Harold Washington clad in a white bra and G-string, garter belt, and stockings".&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt; The painting was approximately {{convert|4|ft|cm|0}} tall by {{convert|3|ft|cm|0}} wide.&lt;ref name="brenson_19880529"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA1F38F93AA15756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A savage painting raises troubling questions |author=Brenson, Michael |date=May 29, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the portrait, Washington is holding a pencil in his right hand. His aide, Alton Miller, initially mistook Washington's slumping over his desk as an attempt to pick up a pencil that had fallen onto the floor.&lt;ref name="dubin_29"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 29 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rivlin_403"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis_19880513_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBFF29B67B3&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art School in Political Crossfire |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Davis, Robert |accessdate=2008-04-22 |date=May 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the piece is presumably derived from [[Girth &amp; Mirth]], an organization for [[Chub (gay culture)|overweight gay men]].&lt;ref name="dubin_32"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 32 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Nelson stated that he had painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' over the course of one night, standing in his underwear. He said that he had painted it in response to how the city populace revered Washington shortly after his death. Nelson stated, "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned [[Jesus Christ]], looking down on the Chicago skyline.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD3D90C4278&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art Institute surrenders&amp;nbsp;— Will bar controversial painting of Washington |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=January 27, 1988 |author1=Hanania, Ray  |author2=Cronin, Barry  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D9163AF934A25751C0A96F948260 |title=The Editorial Notebook; Chicago Seeks a Winning Coalition |author=Wycliff, Don |work=The New York Times |date=February 17, 1989 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;[http://www.projectposner.org/case/1994/16F3d145 Nelson v.

The caricature was not Nelson's first. He had drawn a portrait of his mother as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' for Mother's Day. Nelson had also drawn a caricature of his father as the model depicted on boxes of [[Cream of Wheat]].  Nelson explained, "(t)his kind of irreverence and iconoclasm runs through all my artwork". In an April Fools' Day edition of a ''[[Weekly World News]]'' parody produced by Nelson, he illustrated SAIC president Edward Jones as an infant in the arms of a bare-breasted [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DF07B02FACEB&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Schlesinger, Toni |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 22, 1998 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |title=The mayoral painter's 15 minutes of fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display and confiscation ==

=== Initial display ===
On May 11, 1988, ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' was displayed at a private exhibition in one of the school's main interior hallways. The painting was part of a set of six that Nelson was displaying in a judged three-day student fellowship exhibition held to showcase upcoming graduates. Another of his works was a self-portrait titled "I'm Sensitive, and I Love All Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting. Shortly thereafter, the school began to receive angry phone calls about the painting.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Soon after the exhibit opened, word of the controversy reached the [[Chicago City Council]], which was in session. Alderman [[Bobby Rush]] (then of the 2nd ward)&lt;ref name="siewers_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD390636B54&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author1=Siewers, Alf  |author2=Hanania, Ray  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-02 |title=Controversial painting leads to brush with law}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately put together a resolution that would cut off the city's contribution to the Art Institute unless it apologized for displaying the painting. In part, the resolution read "Whereas, the artist David Nelson obviously exhibits some type of demented and pathological mental capacities&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Another resolution was written that asked the Art Institute to remove the painting immediately. After passing both items, a group of aldermen left to deliver the resolutions to the Art Institute.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Nelson returned to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it leaning against the wall for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt;

=== Confiscation ===
Aldermen [[Edward Jones (Illinois politician)|Edward Jones]] (20th) and [[William C. Henry]] (24th) were the first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed he had a gun, and then with Jones removed the now-hung painting from the wall and placed it on the floor, facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, [[Allan Streeter]] (17th), [[Dorothy Tillman]] (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting to the office of the school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} gash,&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514" /&gt; and it had been wrapped in brown paper.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Alderman Tillman threatened to burn the painting in President Jones' office, but a [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) lieutenant present with the aldermen, Lt. Raymond Patterson, advised against this. Instead, another unnamed alderman called CPD [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Leroy Martin. Martin telephoned Patterson in Jones' office and ordered Patterson to take the painting into police custody, telling Jones that the painting amounted to "incitement to riot". Patterson overrode this direct order, citing his own powers as the lieutenant on the scene and hung up on Martin. A CPD sergeant accompanied Rush, Streeter and Tillman to a waiting police car with the wrapped painting in hand. Parts of the incident were later broadcast on television.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4261ADA2A3328&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Paying the bill for a tantrum |author=Chicago Tribune Editorial Board |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 1994 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimmins_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEB5A2DBA8BD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Student's painting causes stir |author1=Crimmins, Jerry  |author2=Davis, Robert  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was marked by a volatile shouting match between the aldermen and students, and met with condemnation from free-speech advocates. As the aldermen escorted the painting to the police vehicle, a mass of students outside of the Art Institute jeered them, naming the aldermen "commies", "fascists", "[[brownshirt]]s" and "[[Philistinism|philistines]]".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; Seventeen bomb threats were recorded at the school after the controversy erupted.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;

== Responses ==

=== African-American community ===
Shortly after the incident, a black alderman told reporters that he believed the painting was the work of a Jewish artist. Nelson replied through a ''Chicago Tribune'' story that he "is not Jewish".&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; The remark was made in part because racial tensions had already been elevated a week earlier after the firing of [[Steve Cokely]], a mayoral aide, by African-American mayor and Harold Washington's successor [[Eugene Sawyer]]. Cokely had accused Jews of "engaging in an international conspiracy for world control". His firing caused a rift in segments of the black community, leading some to believe that Sawyer was also involved in the same conspiracy.&lt;ref name="lipinski_19880506"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE8B553106E6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sawyer fires Cokeley as aide&amp;nbsp;— somber mayor asks city to look beyond controversy |date=May 6, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=[[Ann Marie Lipinski]] and Baquet, Dean.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article published on May 13, 1988, Alderman Streeter reiterated his stance regarding the removal of the painting, saying that he would have "gone to jail to get that painting down", calling it "an insult to a great man and an affront to blacks".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"/&gt; On May 16, 1988, Streeter appeared on [[WTTW|the local public television station]] news program ''[[Chicago Tonight]]''.

The school noted that 236 of its 1,312 undergraduate students were minorities, a higher percentage than comparable private professional art schools.&lt;ref name="huntley_19880526"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD7A89CA87C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title='Racial parity' urged at Art Institute school |author=Huntley, Steve |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 26, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 1994, during a rally to raise money for the defendants' mounting legal bills, [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]] supported the three aldermen's right to seize the painting, calling it "an act of righteous indignation". Farrakhan referred to Washington as "a father figure for black people", and described the painting and subsequent lawsuit "a total disrespect for our feelings and our community".&lt;ref name="mcwhirter_19941213"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4259BB0E51944&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Farrakhan supports 3 in art flap |date=February 13, 1994 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=McWhirter, Cameron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 1988, representatives from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) picked up the painting and returned it to Nelson. Jay Miller, another representative for the ACLU, described the incident as "vigilante stuff", noting that the action "was done in the name of one of the great civil libertarians of our time. Harold Washington had a 100&amp;nbsp;percent voting record in Congress and in the state Legislature on issues of civil liberties and civil rights."&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; In 1984 Washington had supported the civil rights of sculptor John Sefick after Sefick had created a satirical statue of Washington.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; By comparison, former mayor [[Michael Bilandic]] had ordered a Sefick statue satirizing his handling of Chicago's crippling [[Chicago Blizzard of 1979|Blizzard of 1979]] covered by a blanket, a decision that was later overturned in federal court.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880502"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE6EE0F3AE64&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sculptor carves governor's likeness with a barb |author=Kendall, Peter |date=May 2, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the SAIC protested on [[Columbus Drive (Chicago)|Columbus Drive]] the next day, holding signs that asked drivers to "honk for free speech". Student leaders began to consult attorneys to file a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. Other groups of students planned a "[[Human Be-In|be-in]]" at the [[Richard J. Daley Center|Richard J. Daley Plaza]], but it was canceled after the students learned other groups might cause a confrontation.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880515"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DED1DD99B969&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art Institute graduation turns out to be the picture of calm |date=May 15, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |author1=Kendall, Peter  |author2=Hunt, Maria  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students felt that the school had been a victim of racial politics, and that the incident would be used to censor the Art Institute.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513" /&gt;

On ''Chicago Tonight'', Daniel Polsby, a law professor at [[Northwestern University]], cited federal statutes violated during the confiscation of the portrait. He then faulted Marshall Field's reluctance to defend the First Amendment, further comparing the seizure of ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' to then-Arkansas governor [[Orval Faubus]]' refusal to abide by the First Amendment and allow minorities to enroll in [[Little Rock Central High School]]. According to Polsby, Faubus' rationale at the time was to preserve a delicate civil rights situation. Polsby called the aldermen's action "crushingly ironic and terribly sad".&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Reactions within the SAIC ===
At the SAIC, students' characterizations of the painting ranged from political caricature, to "whimsy", to a commercial success. One student noted that Nelson was "known nationally now, which is every artist's dream". Another student noted that "(a)rtists have to be responsible for what they make, and this guy is not being responsible". In a meeting with 100&amp;nbsp;students after the incident, Anthony Jones, then-president of the SAIC, assured the students that he stood behind their First Amendment rights. Regarding the painting, Jones said that the painting was in poor taste and should not have been displayed.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513" /&gt;

Members of the Art Institute Board met the day after the incident and agreed not to display ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
Members of the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, which included leaders from mainline Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations from the city, issued a statement that expressed "moral dismay" over the painting. They further added that the display of the painting showed "a lack of sensitivity which we could have expected from those who were responsible for its showing".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513" /&gt;

As for the painting's critical reception, one local art reviewer mentioned that "the only thing [the SAIC] might have felt sheepish about was not having a staff that in four years could instill in Nelson a better grasp of figure painting".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; In a newspaper interview, Nelson responded that the criticism was "the one thing that did make me kind of angry. I don't think the painting was poorly executed, though it wasn't my favorite painting."&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; In his book ''Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions'', Stephen C. Dubin suggested that the painting represented a symbolic castration of Washington, reflecting more "traditional" reactions to African-Americans in positions of power.&lt;ref name="dubin_36"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 36 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson gave only a few interviews before leaving Chicago for the suburbs, and then [[Graceland]] to avoid the press.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; On the advice of his friends, Nelson stayed away from his graduation ceremony on May 14, 1988.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880515" /&gt; He turned down a $15,000 (1988, $22,000 in 2008) offer for the painting, calling it a "grossly inflated" price. He also turned down a separate opportunity to appear on [[Phil Donahue]]'s syndicated talk show, saying that he never watched the show and was genuinely uninterested in the offer.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Other than the interview with WLUP, Nelson's views were expressed by Harvey Grossman, the legal director for the ACLU. Through Grossman, Nelson said he would not press for the returning of the painting, as it had fulfilled its purpose of "drawing attention to his '[[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]' work".&lt;ref name="davis_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBF1E8DADB6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Politics takes its place in the world of art |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author=Davis, Robert and [[Ann Marie Lipinski]].

== ''Nelson v. Streeter'' ==
On June 23, 1988, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Nelson against the three aldermen who were seen on television handling the painting.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE207421D41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Pitt, Leon |date=June 24, 1988 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |title=Suit hits seizure of Washington painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed the removal of the painting violated Nelson's First Amendment right to freedom of expression, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] right to protection from unreasonable seizures, and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]] right against being deprived of property without a hearing. The ACLU sought $100,000 (1988, {{Inflation|US|100000|1988|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to compensate Nelson for damage to the painting, and to "punish" the aldermen and police for their actions.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

Ald. Robert Shaw (9th) called the suit "a slap in the face to the black community". Rush questioned the motive of the suit, as himself, Tillman and Streeter all were supporters of Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] (17th), a political rival of mayor Eugene Sawyer. Rush specifically called the suit "frivolous" and "impetuous", openly questioning whether the ACLU had filed the suit to enhance fundraising activities or for other political reasons.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

The City of Chicago refused in February 1990 to pay mounting legal costs for the aldermen. The aldermen argued that they were performing their official duties "in protecting the security of the city during the turmoil created by the exhibit" when they removed the painting. The city contended that the aldermen had taken the action as individuals.&lt;ref name="strong_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF82825B81D1A52&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen ask city: Pay our art flap costs |author=Strong, James |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson refused a $10,000 (1990, {{Inflation|US|10000|1990|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) settlement at the time.&lt;ref name="hanania_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB372CC0FC12A41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen sued in art tiff want city to pay lawyer |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author=Hanania, Ray |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, U.S. District Judge George Lindberg dismissed the City of Chicago from the lawsuit, but ruled that Superintendent Martin must go to trial and that the three aldermen violated Nelson's civil rights. Lindberg supported the recommendations regarding that issue [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate Judge]] Elaine Bucklo's had made in March&amp;nbsp;1992. Tillman's lawyer, James Chapman, recommended to Tillman that an immediate appeal be filed in federal court.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19920811"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FFEE336AB06BEAD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Judge rules for artist in '88 case |date=August 11, 1992 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |author=O'Connor, Matt.

{{Quote box
| quote  = So we must ask whether in 1988 the law was clear that local government officials may not go onto private property without invitation (the aldermen had not been invited to the exhibition of student work), seize a painting that they do not like because it vilifies a public official with whom they had been associated, and wrap it in brown paper and remove it so that no one can see it. To ask the question is pretty much to answer it. As Chief Justice Warren said in another case involving an effort to suppress public criticism of a mayor of Chicago, "This is a simple case."

}}

=== Appellate court ===
In the appeal, decided February 1, 1994, judges [[Richard Posner]], [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], and [[Michael Stephen Kanne]] affirmed Lindberg's earlier decision. Writing for the court, Posner rejected claims of official immunity and said city officials had no right to enter private property and take "offensive" paintings off its walls.&lt;ref name="ncac"&gt;[http://www.ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm Nelson v. Streeter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515225219/http://ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm |date=2008-05-15 }}, [[Case citation#Lower federal courts|16 F.3d 145]] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the argument that removing paintings from walls was an official duty.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;

Posner also rejected the argument that the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, and that there was no mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

The appellate court also faulted the district judge for allowing "more than a year and a half elapsed before the filing and disposition of the motions for summary judgment". Posner noted in his opinion that "the governing principles are clear, the facts have been explored exhaustively, and the defendants should be aware that efforts to mount a last-ditch, no-holds-barred defense may simply increase their liability for the plaintiff's attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988." He then affirmed the district court's decision.&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

=== Settlement and aftermath ===
On September 20, 1994, the city and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against the city and Superintendent LeRoy Martin.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB421DDDCC02773&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=City settles suit over Washington painting |date=September 21, 1994 |accessdate=2008-02-10 |author1=Lehmann, Daniel J.  |author2=Golab, Art  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the city of Chicago agreed to pay Nelson and the ACLU $95,000 (1994, {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for damage to the painting and to issue police procedures about what materials protected by the First Amendment may be seized.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; Left unresolved were the hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees owed to lawyers defending Tillman, Rush and Streeter; by September 1994, $200,000 (1994, {{Inflation|US|200000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in fees were owed by Tillman alone.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19940921" /&gt; Earlier in the year, the City Council's Finance Committee voted against paying for the aldermen's legal fees.

Grossman stated that the relatively small settlement showed that Nelson had proceeded with the lawsuit "on a matter of principle". Tillman, however, called the settlement a "great victory", saying, "we didn't admit to anything, all the charges were dropped, we're not paying anything (in damages), and we preserve our rights to pursue efforts to have our legal fees paid". At the time the lawsuit was settled, Nelson did not issue any statements.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that he was employed as an advertising artist at an undisclosed firm; he continued to paint in his free time.&lt;ref name= oconnor_19940921&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB42617116B777C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Suit ended on picture of Washington |author=O'Connor, Matt |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 21, 1994 |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1994, the painting had not been sold, exhibited, or repaired after the incident.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21912">In [[Cooperative game|cooperative game theory]] and [[social choice theory]], the '''Nakamura number''' measures the degree of rationality
of preference aggregation rules (collective decision rules), such as voting rules.
It is an indicator of the extent to which an aggregation rule can yield well-defined choices.
*If the number of alternatives (candidates; options) to choose from is less than this number, then the rule in question will identify "best" alternatives without any problem.
In contrast,
*if the number of alternatives is greater than or equal to this number, the rule will fail to identify "best" alternatives for some pattern of voting (i.e., for some '''profile''' ([[tuple]]) of individual preferences), because a [[voting paradox]] will arise (a ''cycle'' generated such as alternative &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; socially preferred to alternative &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;).
The larger the Nakamura number a rule has, the greater the number of alternatives the rule can rationally deal with.
For example, since (except in the case of four individuals (voters)) the Nakamura number of majority rule is three,
the rule can deal with up to two alternatives rationally (without causing a paradox).
The number is named after Kenjiro Nakamura (1947–1979), a Japanese game theorist who proved the above fact
that the rationality of collective choice critically depends on the number of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Mitsuo|year=1981|title=Game theory and social choice: Selected papers of Kenjiro Nakamura|publisher=Keiso Shuppan}} Nakamura received Doctor's degree in Social Engineering in 1975 from Tokyo Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
To introduce a precise definition of the Nakamura number, we give an example of a "game" (underlying the rule in question)
to which a Nakamura number will be assigned.
Suppose the set of individuals consists of individuals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
Behind majority rule is the following collection of ("decisive") ''coalitions'' (subsets of individuals) having at least three members:
: { {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,5}, {1,3,4}, {1,3,5}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,4}, {2,3,5}, {2,4,5}, {3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,5}, {1,2,4,5}, {1,3,4,5}, {2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4,5} }
A Nakamura number can be assigned to such collections, which we call ''simple games''.
More precisely, a '''[[Cooperative game#Properties for Simple games|simple game]]''' is just an arbitrary collection of coalitions;
the coalitions belonging to the collection are said to be ''winning''; the others ''losing''.
If all the (at least three, in the example above) members of a winning coalition prefer alternative x to alternative y,
then the society (of five individuals, in the example above) will adopt the same ranking (''social preference'').

The '''Nakamura number''' of a simple game is defined as the minimum number of winning coalitions with empty [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]].
(By intersecting this number of winning coalitions, one can sometimes obtain an empty set.
But by intersecting less than this number, one can never obtain an empty set.)
The Nakamura number of the simple game above is three, for example, 
since the intersection of any two winning coalitions contains at least one individual
but the intersection of the following three winning coalitions is empty: &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{4,5,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Nakamura's theorem''' (1979&lt;ref name = nakamura79&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Nakamura | first1 = K.| title = The vetoers in a simple game with ordinal preferences| journal = International Journal of Game Theory| volume = 8| pages = 55–61| year = 1979| doi = 10.1007/BF01763051}}&lt;/ref&gt;) gives the following necessary (also sufficient if the set of alternatives is finite) condition for a simple game to have a nonempty "core" (the set of socially "best" alternatives) for all profiles of individual preferences:
the number of alternatives is less than the Nakamura number of the simple game.
Here, the '''core''' of a simple game with respect to the profile of preferences is the set of all alternatives &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; 
such that there is no alternative &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
that every individual in a winning coalition prefers to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the set of ''maximal'' elements of the social preference.
For the majority game example above, the theorem implies that the core will be empty (no alternative will be deemed "best") for some profile,
if there are three or more alternatives.

Variants of Nakamura's theorem exist that provide a condition for the core to be nonempty 
(i) for all profiles of ''acyclic'' preferences;
(ii) for all profiles of ''transitive'' preferences; and 
(iii) for all profiles of ''linear orders''.
There is a different kind of variant (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011&lt;ref name=kumabe-m10geb /&gt;),
which dispenses with ''acyclicity'', the weak requirement of rationality.
The variant gives a condition for the core to be nonempty for all profiles of preferences that have ''maximal elements''.

For ''ranking'' alternatives, there is a very well known result called "[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]" in social choice theory, 
which points out the difficulty for a group of individuals in ranking three or more alternatives.
For ''choosing'' from a set of alternatives (instead of ''ranking'' them), Nakamura's theorem is more relevant.{{#tag:ref | 
Nakamura's ''original'' theorem is directly relevant to the class of ''simple'' preference aggregation rules,
the rules completely described by their family of decisive (winning) coalitions.
(Given an aggregation rule, a coalition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is ''decisive'' if whenever
every individual in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; prefers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then so does the society.)
Austen-Smith and Banks (1999),&lt;ref name=austensmith-b99&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Austen-Smith | first1 = David | last2 = Banks | first2 = Jeffrey S. | title = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxXDn3nPxIAC&amp;q=%22nakamura+number%22 Positive political theory I: Collective preference] | year = 1999 | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor  | isbn = 978-0-472-08721-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
a textbook on social choice theory that emphasizes the role of the Nakamura number,
extends the Nakamura number to the wider (and empirically important) class of ''neutral''
(i.e., the labeling of alternatives does not matter) and
''monotonic'' (if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is socially preferred to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then increasing the support for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; 
preserves this social preference) aggregation rules (Theorem 3.3), and obtain a theorem (Theorem 3.4) similar to Nakamua's.}}
An interesting question is how large the Nakamura number can be.
It has been shown that for a (finite or) algorithmically computable simple game that has no veto player 
(an individual that belongs to every winning coalition)
to have a Nakamura number greater than three, the game has to be ''non-strong''.&lt;ref name= kumabe-m08scw&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kumabe | first1 = M. | last2 = Mihara | first2 = H. R. | title = The Nakamura numbers for computable simple games| journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 621 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s00355-008-0300-5 | url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/3684.htm| arxiv = 1107.0439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that there is a ''losing'' (i.e., not winning) coalition whose complement is also losing.
This in turn implies that nonemptyness of the core is assured for a set of three or more alternatives
only if the core may contain several alternatives that cannot be strictly ranked.{{#tag:ref | 
There exist monotonic, proper, strong simple games without a veto player
that have an infinite Nakamura number.  A nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] is an example, which can be used to
define an aggregation rule (social welfare function) satisfying Arrow's conditions 
if there are infinitely many individuals.&lt;ref name = kirman-s72&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kirman | first1 = A.| last2 = Sondermann | first2 = D.| title = Arrow's theorem, many agents, and invisible dictators| journal = Journal of Economic Theory| volume = 5| pages = 267| year = 1972| doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A serious drawback of nonprincipal ultrafilters for this purpose is that they are not algorithmically computable.}}

==Framework==
Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be a (finite or infinite) nonempty set of ''individuals''.
The subsets of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are called '''coalitions'''.
A '''simple game''' (voting game) is a collection &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of coalitions.
(Equivalently, it is a coalitional game that assigns either 1 or 0 to each coalition.)
We assume that &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty and does not contain an empty set.
The coalitions belonging to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; are ''winning''; the others are ''losing''.
A simple game &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is '''monotonic''' if &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;
imply &lt;math&gt;T \in W&lt;/math&gt;.  
It is '''proper''' if &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \notin W&lt;/math&gt;.
It is '''strong''' if &lt;math&gt;S \notin W&lt;/math&gt; imples&lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \in W&lt;/math&gt;.
A '''veto player''' (vetoer) is an individual that belongs to all winning coalitions.
A simple game is '''nonweak''' if it has no veto player.
It is '''finite''' if there is a finite set (called a ''carrier'') &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all coalitions &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, 
we have &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;S\cap T \in W&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a (finite or infinite) set of ''alternatives'', whose [[cardinal number]] (the number of elements) 
&lt;math&gt;\# X&lt;/math&gt; is at least two.
A (strict) '''preference''' is an ''asymmetric'' relation &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:
if &lt;math&gt;x \succ y&lt;/math&gt; (read "&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is preferred to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;"), 
then &lt;math&gt;y\not \succ x&lt;/math&gt;.
We say that a preference &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; is ''acyclic'' (does not contain ''cycles'') if 
for any finite number of alternatives &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_m&lt;/math&gt;, 
whenever &lt;math&gt;x_1 \succ x_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2 \succ x_3&lt;/math&gt;,…, &lt;math&gt;x_{m-1} \succ x_m&lt;/math&gt;,
we have &lt;math&gt;x_m \not\succ x_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that acyclic relations are asymmetric, hence preferences.

A '''profile''' is a list &lt;math&gt;p=(\succ_i^p)_{i \in N}&lt;/math&gt; of individual preferences &lt;math&gt;\succ_i^p&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;x \succ_i^p y&lt;/math&gt; means that individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; prefers alternative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; at profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''simple game with ordinal preferences'' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(W, p)&lt;/math&gt; consisting
of a simple game &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and a profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
Given &lt;math&gt;(W, p)&lt;/math&gt;, a ''dominance'' (social preference) relation &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_W&lt;/math&gt; is defined 
on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x \succ^p_W y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a winning coalition &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying &lt;math&gt;x \succ_i^p y&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
The '''core''' &lt;math&gt;C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(W, p)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of alternatives undominated by &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_W&lt;/math&gt;
(the set of maximal elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_W&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;x \in C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is no &lt;math&gt;y\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y \succ^p_W x&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition and examples ==
The '''Nakamura number''' &lt;math&gt;\nu(W)&lt;/math&gt; of a simple game &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the size (cardinal number)
of the smallest collection of winning coalitions with empty intersection:&lt;ref&gt;The minimum element of the following set exists
 since every nonempty set of [[ordinal numbers]] has a least element.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(W)=\min\{\# W': W'\subseteq W;  \cap W'=\emptyset \}&lt;/math&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;\cap W = \cap_{S \in W} S = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; (no veto player);&lt;ref name = nakamura79 /&gt; 
otherwise, &lt;math&gt;\nu(W)= +\infty&lt;/math&gt; (greater than any cardinal number).

it is easy to prove that if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a simple game without a veto player, then &lt;math&gt;2\le \nu(W)\le \# N&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Examples''' for finitely many individuals (&lt;math&gt;N=\{1, \ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;) (see Austen-Smith and Banks (1999), Lemma 3.2&lt;ref name=austensmith-b99 /&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a simple game that is monotonic and proper.
*If &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is strong and without a veto player, then &lt;math&gt;\nu(W)=3&lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the majority game (i.e., a coalition is winning if and only if it consists of more than half of individuals), then &lt;math&gt;\nu(W)=3&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n\ne 4&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\nu(W)=4&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n=4&lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-rule (i.e., a coalition is winning if and only if it consists of at least &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; individuals) with &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;q&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\nu(W)=[n/(n-q)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest integer greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Examples''' for at most countably many individuals (&lt;math&gt;N=\{1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;).
Kumabe and Mihara (2008) comprehensively study the restrictions that various properties 
(monotonicity, properness, strongness, nonweakness, and finiteness) for simple games 
impose on their Nakamura number (the Table "Possible Nakamura Numbers" below summarizes the results).  
In particular, they show that an algorithmically computable simple
game &lt;ref&gt;See [[Rice's theorem#An analogue of Rice.27s theorem for recursive sets|a section for Rice's theorem]]
for the definition of a computable simple game.  In particular, all finite games are computable.&lt;/ref&gt;
without a veto player has a Nakamura number greater than 3 only if it is proper and nonstrong.&lt;ref name= kumabe-m08scw /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Possible Nakamura Numbers&lt;ref&gt;Possible Nakamura numbers for computable simple games
are given in each entry, assuming that an empty coalition is losing.
The sixteen types are defined in terms of the four properties: monotonicity, properness, strongness, and nonweakness (lack of a veto player). 
For example, the row corresponding to type 1110 indicates that among the monotonic (1), proper (1), strong (1), 
weak (0, because not nonweak) computable simple games, finite ones have a Nakamura number 
equal to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and infinite ones do not exist.
The row corresponding to type 1101 indicates that any &lt;math&gt;k\ge 3&lt;/math&gt; (and no &lt;math&gt;k&lt; 3&lt;/math&gt;)
is the Nakamura number of some finite (alternatively, infinite) simple game of this type.
Observe that among nonweak simple games, only types 1101 and 0101 attain a Nakamura number greater than 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nakamura's theorem for acyclic preferences ==

'''Nakamura's theorem''' (Nakamura, 1979, Theorems 2.3 and 2.5&lt;ref name = nakamura79 /&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a simple game.  Then the core &lt;math&gt;C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of acyclic preferences if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite and &lt;math&gt;\# X &lt; \nu(W)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remarks'''

*Nakamura's theorem is often cited in the following form, without reference to the core (e.g., Austen-Smith and Banks, 1999, Theorem 3.2&lt;ref name=austensmith-b99 /&gt;): The dominance relation &lt;math&gt;\succ_W^p&lt;/math&gt; is acyclic for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of acyclic preferences if and only if &lt;math&gt;\# B&lt; \nu(W)&lt;/math&gt; for all finite &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; (Nakamura 1979, Theorem 3.1&lt;ref name = nakamura79 /&gt;).
*The statement of the theorem remains valid if we replace "for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of ''acyclic'' preferences" by "for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of ''negatively transitive'' preferences" or by "for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of ''linearly ordered'' (i.e., transitive and total) preferences".{{#tag:ref | The "if" direction is obvious while the "only if" direction is stronger than the statement of the theorem given above
(the proof is essentially the same).
These results are often stated in terms of ''weak'' preferences (e.g, Austen-Smith and Banks, 1999, Theorem 3.2&lt;ref name=austensmith-b99 /&gt;).
Define the weak preference &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x \succeq y \iff y\not\succ x&lt;/math&gt;.  
Then &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; is asymmetric iff &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt; is complete;  &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; is negatively transitive iff &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt; is transitive.
&lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; is ''total'' if &lt;math&gt;x\ne y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\succ y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\succ x&lt;/math&gt;.}}

*The theorem can be extended to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;-simple games.  Here, the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; of coalitions is an arbitrary [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of subsets of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, such as the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]] sets.  A &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;-''simple game'' is a subcollection of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.  Profiles are suitably restricted to measurable ones: a profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is ''measurable'' if for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\{i: x\succ_i^p y\} \in \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=kumabe-m10geb /&gt;

== A variant of Nakamura's theorem for preferences that may contain cycles ==
In this section, we discard the usual assumption of acyclic preferences.
Instead, we restrict preferences to those having a maximal element on a given ''agenda'' (''opportunity set'' that a group of individuals are confronted with), 
a subset of some underlying set of alternatives.
(This weak restriction on preferences might be of some interest from the viewpoint of [[behavioral economics]].)
Accordingly, it is appropriate to think of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as an ''agenda'' here.
An alternative &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is a ''maximal'' element with respect to &lt;math&gt;\succ_i^p&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., &lt;math&gt;\succ_i^p&lt;/math&gt; has a maximal element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) if there is no &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y\succ_i^p x&lt;/math&gt;.  If a preference is acyclic over the underlying set of alternatives, then it has a maximal element on every ''finite'' subset &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

We introduce a strengthening of the core before stating the variant of Nakamura's theorem.
An alternative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be in the core &lt;math&gt;C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; even if there is a winning coalition of individuals &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that are "dissatisfied" with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; 
(i.e., each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; prefers some &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).
The following solution excludes such an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=kumabe-m10geb /&gt;
:An alternative &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is in the '''core''' &lt;math&gt;C^+(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; '''without majority dissatisfaction''' if there is no winning coalition &lt;math&gt;S\in W&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;i \in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''non-maximal'' (there exists some &lt;math&gt;y_i \in X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;y_i \succ_i^p x&lt;/math&gt;).
It is easy to prove that &lt;math&gt;C^+(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the set of maximal elements of each individual and is included in the union of such sets.
Moreover, for each profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;C^+(W,p) \subseteq C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''A variant of Nakamura's theorem''' (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011, Theorem 2&lt;ref name=kumabe-m10geb&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kumabe | first1 = M.| last2 = Mihara | first2 = H. R.| title = Preference aggregation theory without acyclicity: the core without majority dissatisfaction| journal = Games and Economic Behavior| volume = 72| pages = 187–201| year = 2011| doi = 10.1016/j.geb.2010.06.008| url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/23918/2/MPRA_paper_23918.pdf| arxiv = 1107.0431}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a simple game.  Then the following three statements are equivalent:
#&lt;math&gt;\# X &lt; \nu(W)&lt;/math&gt;;
#the core &lt;math&gt;C^+(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; without majority dissatisfaction is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences that have a maximal element;
#the core &lt;math&gt;C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences that have a maximal element.

'''Remarks'''

*Unlike Nakamura's original theorem, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; being finite is ''not a necessary condition'' for &lt;math&gt;C^+(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C(W,p)&lt;/math&gt; to be nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.  Even if an agenda &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has infinitely many alternatives, there is an element in the cores for appropriate profiles, as long as the inequality &lt;math&gt;\# X &lt; \nu(W)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied.
*The statement of the theorem remains valid if we replace "for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences that have a maximal element" in statements 2 and 3 by "for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences that have ''exactly one'' maximal element" or "for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of ''linearly ordered'' preferences that have a maximal element" (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011, Proposition 1).
*Like Nakamura's theorem for acyclic preferences, this theorem can be extended to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;-simple games.  The theorem can be extended even further  (1 and 2 are equivalent; they imply 3) to ''collections'' &lt;math&gt;W' \subseteq \mathcal{B}'&lt;/math&gt; ''of winning sets'' by extending the notion of the Nakamura number.{{#tag:ref | The framework distinguishes the algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; of ''coalitions'' from the larger collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}'&lt;/math&gt; of the sets of individuals to which winning/losing status can be assigned.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the algebra of [[recursive sets]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}'&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of [[recursively enumerable set]]s (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011, Section 4.2).}}

The '''New Teacher Center''' (NTC) is a national [[non-profit]] organization in the U.S. dedicated to strengthening the practice of beginning [[teacher]]s. The NTC conducts research, develops and administers [[teacher induction|induction]] and [[mentoring]] programs for new teachers and school administrators, and consults with organizations, educational leaders, and policymakers throughout the [[United States]] on issues related to new educator support.

Founded in 1998, the NTC was based at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]] until 2007. It is now located in downtown [[Santa Cruz, California]] It grew as an organization out of the Santa Cruz New Teacher Project, established in 1988, as a systematic, mentor-based teacher induction model.

NTC founder and executive director [[Ellen Moir]] was a 2005 recipient of the [[Harold W. McGraw Prize in Education]].[http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/prize/about_history.shtml]

The [[Government of Chile|Chilean government]] has a long-standing history of using '''political violence''' against its own citizens. Violence has been used by the government against its people under three different styles of government: parliamentary, presidential and military rule. While Chile has remained stable in the long run, the country has been subjected to intense periods of state sponsored violence.&lt;ref name=Frazier&gt;

==Parliamentary Era==

===Background===
The Parliamentary Era of the Chilean government began soon after the [[Chilean Civil War of 1891]], which was fought between Congress, supported by the Chilean Navy and President Balmaceda, supported by the Chilean Army.&lt;ref name=Collier&gt;

  |year=2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war broke out due to President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]]’s large amount of borrowing for public works initiatives right before a large economic recession hit. After the recession, fearing that the President would not take appropriate action, the congress censured his cabinet and refused to pass his appropriations bill. As retaliation, the president vowed to pass the previous year’s budget and congress found him in violation of the constitution. Congress than took over the navy and the northern customs house that controlled a majority of the countries revenue. Realizing that he couldn’t win President Balmaceda took refuge in the Argentine embassy and committed suicide on September 18, 1891, which was the day his term was set to expire. After congress won the civil war, they set up a parliamentary type government where the congress had considerable power over the president.&lt;ref name=Rector&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occurrences===
While the Civil War of 1891 was not during the Parliamentary Era, it is because it led to the creation of the Parliamentary style of government that warrants its inclusion in this section.

For the most part the Civil War was a normal conflict that would not be labeled an act of political violence. Congress, with the support of the Navy and the Help of General Emil Körner had a larger military force than that of the President, who was supported by the Army.&lt;ref name=Galdames&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Galdames|first=Luis
  |title=A History of Chile
  |location=New York|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell
  |year=1964
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army had notable success with the sinking of the ship [[Chilean frigate Blanco Encalada (1875)|Blanco Encalada]], but the Navy had the upper hand and after landing in Quintero in late August 1891 with over 9,000 men, took control after victories in both Concón and La Placilla.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt; The conflict that does fall under the guidelines of political violence is the Lo Cañas Massacre.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt; A group of young men from wealthy families were meeting in Lo Cañas to create a guerrilla band in opposition to President Balmaceda, while meeting the group was unexpectedly attacked by Army troops. Most of the young men were killed when they were attacked; the surviving men were subjected to brutal treatment.&lt;ref name=Galdames/&gt; “The wounded were bayoneted and sabred to death and their bodies were mutilated and burned.”&lt;ref name=Proquest&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/94894451?accountid=11243]{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were taken prisoner were marched to a nearby town, but were turned back to the camp for unknown reasons. One prisoner, Don Carlos Walker Martinez was tied to a tree and tortured by being repeatedly cut with a sword and when the Army could not extract any information they broke both of his legs. Remaining silent, the troops poured a flammable liquid on him and set him on fire; he died an hour later. Other members of the guerrilla band had their abdomens cut open and their organs strung on the trees, their eyes and tongues cut out, and their ears and noses cut off.&lt;ref name=Proquest/&gt;

==Presidential Era==

===Background===
The Presidential Era began in 1925 after years of political turmoil. In Early 1925 President [[Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez]] put all of his efforts in reforming the constitution by creating the “Grand Consultative Commission.”&lt;ref name=Galdames/&gt; Their reforms included: the creation of a stronger executive, denying the chamber and senate the power to depose ministries, giving the chamber power to bring accusations against the ministers and president in front of the senate, lengthening the presidential term to six years, creating election by direct vote and separating church and state.&lt;ref name=Galdames/&gt; These reforms marked the end of the Parliamentary style of government and the beginning of the Presidential system.

===Occurrences===
One of the main cases of political violence in the Presidential Era is the Nitrate Massacre in June 1925. Rising tensions between the nitrate workers, the government and the nitrate companies, due to unfair wages and work conditions, led to various strikes. In June 1925 the police interrupted a nitrate labor meeting in Alto San Alto, the day before a general strike was to be held. After an altercation two policemen were killed. The nitrate workers fled to different camps, La Coruña being the primary meeting place. Three different accounts exist as to what started the massacre. Military reports state, workers formed under the direction of Carlos Garrido, an anarchist, who under the direction from the Workers’ Federation, called on the nitrate workers to fight. Another account claims the conflict came after the wife of a miner was beaten by a store manager and in retaliation the husband stabbed the manager. Leftist political parties claim the government incited the conflict by allowing the nitrate workers to buy as much alcohol as they wished. Then, after the start of the strike, prohibiting the sale of alcohol lead the drunken workers to fire shots at a store manager. Whatever account is true, certainty rests in the account of the government’s reaction. A  telegram from General Antonio de la Guarda to President Alessandri explains that when the government sent in regiments of cannons and machine guns to subdue the miners, the nitrate workers threw sticks of dynamite at the army. The army then bombarded the miners who eventually surrendered, but only after fifty-nine of their fellow workers were killed. In the following weeks the military rounded up nitrate workers from several camps and nearby towns, shooting some on sight, while imprisoning hundreds more who were then subjected to military justice.&lt;ref name=Frazier/&gt;

Another source of political violence of this era stems from the [[Pisagua Prison Camp]]. While Pisagua was officially a prison, in 1943 it was employed as a detention center for Axis nationals, from 1947-48 it was used as a concentration camp for communists and homosexual men, and in 1956 it was used as a prison camp for political and labor leaders.&lt;ref name=Frazier/&gt; While Pisagua is infamous for the mass execution in 1973 under Pinochet (see the Military Era section below), during the Presidential Era it gained notoriety for the period between 1947 and 1948. In the fall of 1947, the government gathered and sent over 600 people to Pisagua, including members of the Communist Party, striking coal miners and their families, homosexual men and those in opposition to President [[Gabriel González Videla]]. Due to the lack of housing facilities, food, and inability to provide adequate health care, a number of labor and political leaders, as well as children died from male nourishment and deficient medical care. Future Chilean leader [[Augusto Pinochet]] was a guard at Pisagua during this time, who later stated that his time there molded him and he lauded the institution for having the discipline the nation needed that the military could provide.&lt;ref name=Frazier/&gt;

==Military Era==

===Background===
The Military Era was born out of the 1973 coup to overthrow President [[Salvador Allende]], constructed which was constructed by Commander-in-Chief Augusto Pinochet. Even before Allende’s election to the Presidency, many forces were working against him. Most notably the [[United States]], who, through the work of former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and his “[[40 Committee]],” tried to stop Allende, a [[Marxism|Marxist]], from being elected president. [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration then cut aid to Chile from $592 million under the previous president to a mere $22 million, paving the way for economic turmoil.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Hugh
  |title=Pinochet, the Politics of Torture
  |location=New York|publisher=New York University Press
  |year=2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further assisting Pinoche’s ascension to power was an incident surrounding then Commander-in-Chief [[Carlos Prats]]. Prats resigned in late August 1973, after he aimed his gun at a woman in a crowd, which incited a riot outside his house. With Prats’ resignation, Augusto Pinochet was named Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;

On the morning of September 11, 1973, the military coup occurred. Under Pinochet’s direction the military took over the nation’s radio stations, announcing to the Chilean people that they were taking control of the country and offering Allende the opportunity to surrender and a plane. Refusing, Allende went to the National Palace where he delivered his final address to the Chilean people at 9:30AM. Shortly thereafter the military bombed the National Palace and the former president was found dead due to a gunshot wound. It is still not known if it was self-inflicted or not. Pinochet quickly rose to power, denouncing all politicians as self-serving and promoting the military as the true patriots of Chile.&lt;ref name=Rector/&gt;

===Occurrences===
Immediately following the coup, the military government under Pinochet imposed a curfew, enforced by the military patrolling the streets with sub-machine guns. Soon after, they started sweeping the poorest sections of Chile, detaining people just to intimidate them. The government also gathered political enemies and sympathizers of Allende’s government and sending them to detention centers. Through the course of his rule, approximately 3,000 people “disappeared.”&lt;ref name=Rector/&gt;

The two most notable uses of violence under Pinochet’s rule were through his creation of the National Intelligence Service ([[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional]], DINA) and his use of detention centers, especially Pisagua. After the coup in September 1973, Pinochet created the National Intelligence Service, also known as DINA. One of their primary goals was to eliminate Chilean citizens who were speaking out while in exile, specifically targeting former party and labor leaders. In 1974, DINA carried out a mission to execute the former Commander-in-Chief, Carlos Prats. While in Buenos Aires, a bomb attached to the bottom of Prats’ car went off, killing both him and his wife. Then in 1975, DINA attempted to assassinate the Christian Democratic Leader, [[Bernardo Leighton]]. He was shot while in Rome, but recovered from his injury. The last notable case occurred in 1976 when DINA assassinated [[Orlando Letelier]], the former Chilean Ambassador to the United States by attaching a bomb to his car while he was in Washington, D.C. The assassination of former Ambassador Letelier triggered an investigation by [[United States Justice Department]], who were able to prove that the assassination was orchestrated by DINA and conducted by both DINA operatives and Cuban exiles. With the world focused on the actions of DINA, Pinochet dissolved the agency, only to create another agency in its place shortly after.&lt;ref name=Rector/&gt;

The violent actions that the government sanctioned within Chilean borders were greater than the political violence carried out by Pinochet abroad through the National Intelligence Agency. After the coup, the military rounded up individuals and families who were thought to be in opposition to the Pinochet government and brought them to the detention center in Pisagua. There, citizens were subjected to summary trials, executions and torture to extract any information they had on opposition efforts. “The military’s methods of torture included systematic beatings, electric shock, burning, the use of various hanging positions and forced postures, immersion, and mock executions.”&lt;ref name=Frazier/&gt; In total 600 people never left the detention center, having been either executed or sentenced to life terms.&lt;ref name=Frazier/&gt;

Dr. [[Sheila Cassidy]] was a notable example of torture condoned by the Chilean government, and shows the brutality that was inflicted on so many people. Dr. Cassidy, a British surgeon and the daughter of an Air Vice Marshal in the Royal Air Force was arrested by DINA agents after she treated [[Nelson Gutiérrez]], of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Revolutionary Left Movement]], for a leg wound caused by a bullet. After withstanding the first round of torture, she lied to her captors, refusing to give up information on Gutiérrez or the members of the Catholic Church that brought her to him. After bringing her to various locations across town that she had given them, she saw men approaching and pleaded for help, prompting the DINA agents to put her through another round of torture, except this time more intense. Dr. Cassidy was stripped naked and tied down to a metal bed frame; the agents then inserted an electrode into her and had another electrode that was used on the rest of her body. Dr. Cassidy states in her book, “From the first moment it was different. The pain was appalling…Unable to cry out and with my hands nearly paralyzed I could call for relief only through the upward movement of my finger and this they ignored, filling me with a desperation the like of which I have never known.”&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;

{{Computer security}}

'''Portable Document Format security''' is concerned with the protection of information and property from theft, corruption, and attack.  Its main purpose it to make sure information is productive and accessible to its intended users.   

== History ==
From its early stages of development in the 1990s,  PDF started including security features. Over the years, several threats have been clearly identified including the following:

* In 2000, a conceptual weakness was identified with the ability of Adobe reader to run malicious scripts related to a particular link. This attack used the XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
attack technique. 

* In 2001, ''Outlook PDFWorm'' (Trend Micro, 2000) was identified and spread through PDF documents as Microsoft Outlook email attachments. It appeared as a game running a malicious code imbedded in the document.&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus "Peachy"], 15 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2003, the W32 Yourde virus that exploited a vulnerability in Acrobat 5.0.5 was discovered . A corrupted PDF document exploited a vulnerability in the JavaScript parsing engine to lead Acrobat into using plug-ins folders.

* Early PDF document security relied on a weak 40 bit encryption with methods to crack it readily available online. As a result, Adobe added a 128 bit encryption in May 2006 for better protection.  Later in december 2006, another critical XSS attack through PDF documents was discovered.

* On March 30, 2010, an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable is identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks and vulnerabilities ==
Adobe  Reader and Acrobat products are supported by a large and complex code including several proprietary extensions. This apparent flexibility translates into a broad attack surface that is difficult for Adobe and anti-malware vendors to defend. For example, most PDF related tools allow their users to copy or print without paying attention to password or protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html |title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker |author= Jeremy Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vulnerabilities are quite common in Adobe Reader's long history with Adobe Systems providing appropriate solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most PDF security concerns arise around the use of the full version of Adobe Acrobat whereas PDF documents are only the object of security analysis that is restricted to attacks and vulnerabilities. 

Like HTML files, PDF files are also vulnerable. Here, vulnerability of a PDF document means its susceptibility to flaw,  attackers access to the flaw, and their capability to exploit the flaw.  Later, Adobe introduced a function that allows the original author to audit file usage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/332208.html New features and issues addressed in the Acrobat 7.0.5 Update (Acrobat and Adobe Reader for Windows and Mac OS)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document is not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed.

=== Exploits ===
{{see also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}

The PDF standard allowing related documents to be imbedded with JavaScript is indeed a vulnerability that can be prevented by disabling the script execution and inhibit such exploits. This action is far more helpful than any support from compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson - SecurityNow Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 2013, [[FireEye]], a cybersecurity company, discovered that attackers use a remote code execution exploit called [[Zero-day (computing)|Zero-day]] exploit that bypasses the sandbox anti-exploitation and works against the Adobe Reader 9, 10 and 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027946/researchers-zero-day-pdf-exploit-affects-adobe-reader-11-earlier-versions.html |title=Researchers: Zero-day PDF exploit affects Adobe Reader 11, earlier versions |publisher=[[PCWolrd]] |author= Lucian Constantin   |date=February 13, 2013   |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027946/researchers-zero-day-pdf-exploit-affects-adobe-reader-11-earlier-versions.html |title=Researchers: Zero-day PDF exploit affects Adobe Reader 11, earlier versions |publisher=[[PCWolrd]] |author= Lucian Constantin   |date=February 14, 2013   |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example effort to reduce exploitation, Adobe Systems has implemented auto-update features, developed the Adobe Reader protected mode, a secure sandbox for displaying PDF documents and restricting external malware calls. In addition, Return-oriented programming (ROP) and stolen digital certificates have played significant roles in recent [[Exploit (computer security)|exploits]].

Updating Adobe Reader or Acrobat to the latest version, enabling auto-update, disabling Javascript or simply considering alternative PDF readers.Finally, educating users about the risks of attacks from PDF documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdf-security/recommendations/ |title=PDFlib - PDF Security - Security Recommendations |quote=AES-256 according to PDF 1.7 Adobe Extension Level 3 (Acrobat 9) should be avoided because it contains a weakness in the password checking algorithm.  |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solutions ==
Over time, [[Adobe Systems]] has provided solutions to deal with new vulnerabilities as soon as they were discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/acrobat/axi/pdfs/reader-acrobat-xi-security.pdf  |title=PDF security reaches new levels with Adobe Reader XI and Adobe Acrobat XI  |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the company publishes security bulletins in their ''Security bulletins and advisories'' page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/|title=Security Bulletins and Advisories|work=adobe.com|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robust means of [[information rights management]] like [[Adobe LiveCycle]] [[Adobe LiveCycle#LiveCycle Rights Management ES4 | Rights Management]] and Locklizard PDF DRM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/locklizard-develops-zero-footprint-solution-for/ |title=LockLizard Develops Zero Footprint Solution for PDF Security }}&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the commercial solutions offered on the market. They restrict document access and also reliably enforce [[File system permissions | permissions]] better than standard security handlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DRM ===
PDF documents are also subject to the application of  [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6337781.stm |title=Q&amp;A: What is DRM? |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/   |title=PDF DRM Security – 10 things you should know |publisher= Locklizard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of DRM  is to prevent the unauthorized use and control access to corporate documents, limit copying, editing and printing.  The application of Enterprise digital rights management technology to control access to corporate documents in PDF format is also quite common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2006/121806techupdate.html|title="DRM vs. ERM: Battle to Control Data", Network World|accessdate=2008-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303235632/http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2006/121806techupdate.html|archivedate=2008-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology also known as IRM ([[Information Rights Management]]), integrates with [[content management]] system software and is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use of private and confidential documents.

=== Encryption ===
PDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. The PDF Reference defines both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, both making use of a complex system of [[RC4]] and [[MD5]]. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF. The PDF Reference has technical details for an end-user overview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/help_security?BP=&amp;LOC=en_US |title=Create Adobe PDF Online - Security Settings Help |publisher=Createpdf.adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223033059/http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/help_security?BP=&amp;LOC=en_US |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Watermarking and others ===
Adobe Systems recommends that any PDF application concerned with security, implements a combination of application sandboxing, data execution protection including non-executable memory, address space layout randomization, and stack cookies as defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_watermarking/  |title=PDF Watermarking Securiy: Add PDF Watermark with PDF Document Watermarking Creator Software   |publisher=Locklizard  |quote=   |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Watermarking is often used for enforcing copyright on PDF files and  help provide evidence in legal situations rather than as a restriction. A standard pdf watermark works  well for PDF distribution because its of its consistent appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_watermarking/   |title=Add PDF Watermark with PDF Document Watermarking Creator Software  |publisher= Locklizard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of applications (ex. Google Chrome) provides secure internal viewing that protects content against malicious [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]. This technique is called [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec96/full_papers/goldberg/goldberg.pdf |title=A Secure Environment for Untrusted Helper Applications (Confining the Wily Hacker)|author1=Ian Goldberg |author2=David Wagner |author3=Randi Thomas |author4=Eric Brewer  |last-author-amp=yes |work=Proceedings of the Sixth USENIX UNIX Security Symposium|year=1996|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geier |first=Eric |url=http://www.techhive.com/article/247416/how_to_keep_your_pc_safe_with_sandboxing.html |title=How to Keep Your PC Safe With Sandboxing |publisher=TechHive |date=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/conf/2001-Freenix-Sandbox/html/sandbox32final.pdf |title=Sandboxing Applications|year=2001|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1085">'''Positive environmentalism''' is a term used to refer to a pro-technology, pro-"progress" view of protecting the world's environment. The term came into usage in UK politics after it was used on BBC News by Alex Singleton, Director-General of the [[Globalisation Institute]].

According to [[Alex Singleton]]: "There are fundamentally two approaches to environmental action - there is the negative environmentalism, full of doom and gloom, which thinks that improving the environment has to be through restricting foreign holidays, stopping economic growth, limiting trade, or curbing GDP. And then there is the positive environmentalism, which recognises the importance of technology, innovation and economic development, and practical measures by individuals".[https://archive.is/20060509130501/http://www.globalisationinstitute.org/blog/environment/happy-earth-day-20060422656/]

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''Progressive Party''' ({{lang-af|Progressiewe Party}}) was a liberal party in South Africa which, during apartheid, was considered the left wing of the all-white parliament. The party represented the legal opposition to apartheid within South Africa's white minority. It opposed the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]'s policies of [[apartheid]], and championed the Rule of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/360189.stm|title=BBC News - Africa - Democratic Party return from the wilderness|author=|date=|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 13 years its only member of [[Parliament of South Africa|parliament]] was [[Helen Suzman]].&lt;ref&gt;In No Uncertain Terms - A South African Memoir, Helen Suzman, Alfred A Knopf, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]] in 1975, and then [[Progressive Federal Party (South Africa)|Progressive Federal Party]] in 1977. The modern [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] considers the party to be its earliest predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.timeslive.co.za/hartley/2009/11/14/helen-zille-on-the-pfp-and-the-da-full-text/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002112032/http://blogs.timeslive.co.za/hartley/2009/11/14/helen-zille-on-the-pfp-and-the-da-full-text/ |archivedate=2 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Progressive Party of South Africa is not to be confused with the much earlier [[Progressive Party (Cape Colony)|Progressive Party]] of the [[Cape Colony]], which was founded on very different, pro-imperialist policies and which became the "Union Party" in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Arts/Departemente1/geskiedenis/docs/Irritating%20pebble.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

The Progressive Party was formed by members who had left the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] following the United Party Union Congress held in [[Bloemfontein]] starting on 11 August 1959. The delegates at the Party Congress passed policy resolutions about the political rights the party wished to give to Natives. The Progressives found these resolutions unacceptable.

A Progressive Group of MPs led by Dr [[Bernard Friedman]], began to organize a new party. The first meeting of the Group took place at the home of [[Helen Suzman]], MP for the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] seat of [[Houghton Estate|Houghton]]. This meeting took place on 23–24 August 1959.

The Progressive Party began its founding Congress on 13 November 1959, in [[Johannesburg]].

[[Jan Steytler]], a former Cape leader of the United Party, was elected the first leader of the new Party.

At the session of Parliament in 1960, the Progressive Party had twelve MPs. Eleven had been first elected for the United Party and one (a Native Representative Member) defected from the [[Liberal Party of South Africa]]. By the end of that Parliament in 1961, the group had been reduced to ten as a result of the abolition of the Native Representative seats at the end of 1960 and the resignation of one MP in January 1961.

==Electoral history==

At the General Election, held on 18 October 1961, the Progressive Party performed relatively well for a new party, putting up a credible performance against the United Party in many of the seats it contested, especially in the Transvaal and Natal. However, the electoral system worked to the party's disadvantage, and although it came very close in Parktown, [[Helen Suzman]] in Houghton was the only Progressive Party candidate to actually be elected. It would be thirteen years before she again had party colleagues in Parliament. In that time Mrs Suzman was re-elected in 1966 and 1970. In those years, she singlehandedly did the work of an entire opposition party and would become a well known figure both inside South Africa and abroad.

Following the disappointing result of the election, support for the party amongst white voters had dropped substantially by 1966, and focus instead shifted towards attracting coloured votes. The Progressive Party won two seats representing coloured voters on the Cape Provincial Council in 1965. The National Party responded by extending the term of the four national coloured representative members, and ultimately abolished coloured electoral representation by 1970, thus preventing the party from winning those seats. Despite gains in some white constituencies, Mrs Suzman once again became its only MP or MPC.

[[Jan Steytler]] continued as party leader until December 1970, but being outside Parliament he was far less visible than the member for Houghton. [[Harry Lawrence]], a former Minister and the most senior of the MPs who had left the United Party in 1959, became temporary leader. In February 1971 [[Colin Eglin]] from Cape Town was elected party leader.

At the next General Election, on 24 April 1974, the Progressive Party made a major advance. In addition to Mrs Suzman, re-elected for Houghton, five other members won seats including Colin Eglin. A seventh member of the caucus was elected at a by-election soon after. Three members also won seats on the Transvaal and Cape Provincial Councils. This brought the party out of the political wilderness and set it on the path towards becoming the official opposition.

==Merger with Reform Party==
A group of reformists broke away from the left wing of the United Party in February 1975. Four MPs led by [[Harry Schwarz]], formed the [[Reform Party (South Africa)|Reform Party]]. The Reform Party merged with the Progressive Party to form the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]], following Congresses held in Johannesburg on 25 and 26 July 1975.

Subsequently the PRP merged with another breakaway group from the United Party, which was in sharp decline in the mid 1970s, to become the [[Progressive Federal Party]] in 1977.

'''Protracted social conflict''' is a [[technical term]] in a [[theory]] developed by [[Edward Azar]]. It generally refers to conflicts described by other researchers as ''protracted'' or ''intractable'', i.e. as complex, severe, commonly enduring, and often violent.

When a group's identity is threatened or frustrated, intractable conflict is almost inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 307. (Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. ''Journal of Peace Research'' 38(3), 307–26.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Protracted social conflict'' as Edward Azar termed it, denotes hostile interactions between communal groups that are based in deep-seated racial, ethnic, religious and cultural hatreds, and that persist over long periods of time with sporadic outbreaks of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of protracted social conflict==
Protracted social conflict is a theory developed by Edward Azar. The term refers to conflict situations characterized by the prolonged and often violent struggle by communal groups for such basic needs as security, recognition, acceptance, fair access to political institutions, and economic participation.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The communal groups may experience deep-seated cleavages based upon racial, religious, cultural or ethnic lines. These cleavages are characterized by continuing hostility with sporadic outbreaks of violence; and caused by the frustration of human needs for security, recognition, and distributive justice.

Such identity-driven rifts are the result of an underlying fear of extinction that often grows within vulnerable ethnic groups who live with the memories or fear of persecution and massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Haddad 2002: 317&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic divisions and perceived threats often result in the domination of the state machinery by a single group or coalition of elites who deny access to basic human needs for the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preconditions to violent conflict==
Azar argued that the denial of basic human needs to a large portion of the population initiated instances of protracted social violence. Four preconditions are isolated by Azar as the predominant sources of protracted social conflict: communal content, deprivation of human needs, governance and the State's role, and international linkages.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal content===
This element, which contributes to the initial creation of protracted social conflict, consists of the fact that people involved in protracted social conflicts create their own identity groups. Azar notes, "that it is the relationship between identity groups and the states, which is at the core of the problem." He also cited the "disarticulation between the state and society as a whole" as a source of violence within a society.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham85"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

This precondition also involves the reliance that many people have on their social groups; because governments in areas that experience protracted social conflict are often unable, incapable or unwilling to provide basic human necessities to the population, individuals turn to their social groups for stability. The resultant disconnection of society and the state can be linked to the colonial legacy, which, "artificially imposed European ideas of territorial statehood onto a multitude of communal groups."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This results in the domination of certain identity groups over others. The dominant group isolates itself from the needs of other groups, leading to an even bigger separation between groups even within an ethnicity. To overcome this division of society, national identity must be stressed over individual group identity.

===Deprivation of human needs===
To alleviate the "underdevelopments" Azar holds responsible for protracted social violence, and in turn overcome the conflict resulting from underdevelopment, Azar points to the needs of security, development, political access and identity in terms of cultural and religious expression.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; Azar refers to these needs as non-negotiable; therefore, if these needs are not met, people will inevitably want a structural change to take place. Such a need for structural change is likely to result in a violent conflict.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham85"/&gt;

This in turn emphasizes Azar's theory that the "deprivation of human needs is the underlying source of protracted social conflict" where conflict is emphasized by the collective grievances of a group of people.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; To overcome this deprivation of human needs to entire groups of people, the government must offer security on a multiplicity of levels to all of the constituent population.

===Governance and the State's role===
With government being "endowed with the authority to govern and use force where necessary to regulate society, to protect citizens, and to provide collective goods,"&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; the government plays a leading role in the satisfaction or lack of satisfaction of minority and identity groups.

Azar states that protracted social conflicts can be characterized by "incompetent, parochial, fragile, and authoritarian governments that fail to satisfy basic human needs."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that governments, expected to be unbiased and impartial, tend to be dominated by the leading identity groups or those groups that have been able to monopolize power within a country or [[territorial entity]]. This creates a "crisis of legitimacy"&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"/&gt; in the governance of these countries. The structure of the government needs to be changed so that all citizens are equally cared for and equally represented without bias or corruption.

===International linkages===
This involves the "political–economic relations of economic dependency within the international economic system, and the network of political-military linkages constituting regional and global patterns of clientage and cross-border interest."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"/&gt;

Weaker states, like those often involved in protracted social conflict, tend to be more influenced by outside connections both economically and politically. For example, many states are dependent on an external supply of armament. To overcome the dominance of the international economy, the country in question must work to build institutions that can ease global dependency and stimulate domestic economic growth.

==Resolving protracted social conflict==
As Edward Azar stated:
{{quote|"Reducing overt conflict requires reduction in levels of underdevelopment. Groups that seek to satisfy their identity and security needs through conflict are in effect seeking change in the structure of their society. Conflict resolution can truly occur and last if satisfactory amelioration of underdevelopment occurs as well. Studying protracted conflict leads one to conclude that peace is development in the broadest sense of the term."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt;}}

Conflict resolution approaches that focus on resources, or the interests of parties, may be appropriate means of conflict resolution in conflicts where the only issues are those of resource and interests; however, in protracted social conflicts the main issue is identity-based. Therefore, to be effective, a conflict resolution framework must specifically emphasize the needs and identities of the conflicting parties.

==ARIA model==
Rothman developed a unique approach of conflict resolution that is specifically designed to mitigate protracted social conflict. He terms this approach the ARIA model. In contrast to the model of interactive conflict resolution (ICR) that Fisher proposed in 1996, which includes identity as one of many human needs, the ARIA model "keeps its focus more narrowly attuned to identity issues in particular."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"&gt;Rothman, Jay, RESOLVING IDENTITY BASED CONFLICT IN NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES (Jossey Bass, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"&gt;Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, "From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution." ''Journal of Peace Research,'' 2001; 38: p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothman and Olson suggest that conflict can only be truly resolved when identity issues have been sufficiently addressed.

The ARIA model is a comprehensive, yet specific approach to resolving protracted social conflict. It attempts to break down "the barrier of identity through a four-phased process."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; The various stages of the ARIA model are outlined below:

===Antagonism (adversarial framing)===
This first step focuses on the tangible "what of the conflict." It is defined in "us" versus "them" terms and calls on the various entities to elaborate and make clear their underlying values and needs. By bringing animosities to the forefront, it is hoped that the mutual benefits of ending the conflict can be realized.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt;

===Resonance (reflexive–reframing)===
After parties have articulated their animosities, the next stage is termed the reflexive–reframing stage where the "why" and "who" of the issue is examined. The identity needs of all sides are brought to the forefront with the goal of getting "the disputants to move from positional bargaining to interest-based approaches."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; Rothman and Olson suggest that the parties should now engage in a "deep dialogue" to give a voice and structure to the underlying needs of the various parties. The needs of the various parties are, in turn, the underlying causes of the conflict. The effect of this stage is termed resonance, as each side has articulated their core concerns and heard the concerns of the other actors. At this point, actors begin to see where their identities converge, and where they diverge.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt;

===Invention===
The third stage is termed "inventing" and focuses on the "how" of "cooperatively resolving the conflict and its core through integrative solutions." This stage suggests a mutual attempt by all actors involved to create a mean of ending the conflict.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; It is suggested by Rothman and Olson that since both parties have now come to recognize the other's identity through the two previous stages, "they can concretely explore collaboratively how the tangible issues ... of the conflict can be resolved without threatening the identity of the other."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; The invention of possible means of solutions leads directly to the fourth stage.

===Action===
The fourth and final stage of the ARIA model addresses the "why" and "who" of the conflict, as well as the "how" of cooperation through the tangible "what" of solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, "From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution." ''Journal of Peace Research,'' 2001; 38: p. 289e&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the conflict resolution process based on identity is completed by the concrete outlining of future actions. This stage leads to the tangible resolution of the conflict.

==Protracted social conflict in Sri Lanka==
[[File:Sri Lanka Native Tamil.svg|thumb|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census|200px|right|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census]]
The Sri Lankan conflict exists primarily between the two majority ethnic groups, the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], who are mostly [[Buddhist]] and represent around 74% of the population, and the [[Tamil people|Tamil]], who are mostly [[Hindu]], representing around 18%. The majority of Tamils live in northern and eastern provinces and claim them as their traditional homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, Deepak and Sumanasiri Liyanage (2005) Long-Term Effects of Peace Workshops in Protracted Conflicts. ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 49(6), 908–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its independence in 1948 there has been a conflict between Sinhalese, which gained control over the Sri Lankan government, and different Tamil separatist movements. Among the Sinhalese, the anti-Tamil chauvinism started to spread and the Tamils were more and more disadvantaged and excluded. The incidents escalated into a war in July 1983, after the island-wide pogrom against Tamils.

Tamil secessionists saw the establishment of their own separate state as the only way for securing their people. The war, that has continued since then, has almost completely disrupted civil administration in the northern province and caused economic devastation of the whole country.&lt;ref name="insightonconflict.org"&gt;http://www.insightonconflict.org/sri-lanka/?gclid=CO37iZOb65YCFQI_MAodpmC5PA{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this ethno-political violence around 65,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands injured, and millions displaced.

Among various Tamil separatist groups that have emerged, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) have risen as the dominant fighting force in [[Sri Lanka]]. Their tactics, proscribed as terrorist by many countries, are ruthless, brutal and highly efficient in eliminating their opposition. They run a parallel government in many areas of the north and east of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="insightonconflict.org"/&gt;

Since the start of war there were some attempts to reach a ceasefire. In 2002 the Ceasefire agreement was signed, and the government agreed to disarm all paramilitary groups in the north and east. But hostilities continued and even intensified.

Government security forces conquered the LTTE on May 19, 2009 ending the conflict.

==Protracted social conflict in Cyprus==
[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|200px|right|The division of Cyprus]]
Before the independence of [[Cyprus]], the island's [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish]] communities coexisted relatively peacefully. The major conflict began with the independence in 1960, when Greek community wanted a union (''[[enosis]]'') with Greece, to which the Turkish community opposed. The 1960 constitution brought a complex system of [[Consociationalism|power-sharing]], but both groups wanted to gain more advantages.

When Greek Cypriots wanted to reduce autonomy and representation of Turkish Cypriots, the latter opposed it and intercommunal violence broke out. That led the two communities to embark on a hostile and protracted process of separation and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. ''Journal of Peace Research'' 38(3), 307–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|military coup]] in 1974 the situation erupted into a major crisis. Turkish [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|military intervention]] followed and Turkish forces occupied around 38% of the northern part of the island. This invasion caused an exodus of about 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Later voluntary regrouping of population resulted in another 10,000 Greek Cypriots leaving the northern part, and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots moving to the north, which created two homogeneous ethnic zones on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 311&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the northern part declared Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], recognized only by [[Turkey]]. In 1990s the southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] applied for a membership in the [[European Union]], and the Turkish Cypriots on the other side turned to Turkey.

Although the Cyprus conflict now lasts for a long time, its resolution does not seem to be close. Numerous peace proposals and plans have been made, but more or less unsuccessful. The pre-1974 proposals of different federal or centralist arrangements failed as one or the other side rejected them. The division in 1974 changed the demographics of Cyprus dramatically, putting it in a position where [[Federalism|federalist]] model would be the most appropriate. But again, because of opposing interests all the proposals failed.

With a land area of approximately {{cvt|2150000|km2|sqmi}}, Saudi Arabia is the largest [[sovereign state|sovereign]] state in the [[Middle East]], geographically the fifth-largest in [[Asia]], second-largest in the [[Arab world]] after [[Algeria]] and [[List of countries and dependencies by area|12th-largest in the world]]. Saudi Arabia is bordered by [[Jordan]] and [[Iraq]] to the north, [[Kuwait]] to the northeast, [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] to the east, [[Oman]] to the southeast and [[Yemen]] to the south. It is separated from [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] by the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. It is the only nation with both a [[Red Sea]] coast and a [[Persian Gulf]] coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland and mountains. Saudi Arabia is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|largest]] economy in the Middle East as of October 2018 and the 18th largest in the world.&lt;ref name=imf2/&gt;

The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct regions: [[Hejaz]], [[Najd]] and parts of [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]]) and [[Southern Arabia]] ([['Asir Region|'Asir]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Madawi Al-Rasheed]]|title=A Most Masculine State: Gender, Politics and Religion in Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmafWmVNJAAC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq|year=2013|page=65|isbn=9780521761048}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by [[Ibn Saud]]. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]. Saudi Arabia has since been an [[absolute monarchy]], effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along [[Islamist]] lines.&lt;ref name="HT2003: 14"&gt;[[#HT2003|Tripp, ''Culture Shock'', 2003]]: p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Malbouisson|Malbouisson]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The ultraconservative [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] religious movement within [[Sunni Islam]] has been called "the predominant feature of Saudi culture", with its global spread largely financed by the oil and gas trade.&lt;ref name="HT2003: 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Saudi Arabia is sometimes called "the Land of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Al-Masjid al-Haram]] (in [[Mecca]]) and [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] (in [[Medina]]), the two holiest places in Islam. As of 2013, the state had a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million were Saudi nationals and 8 million were foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14703476 "Saudi Arabia profile – Key facts"].

{{See also|Arab (etymology)}}

Following the unification of the [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] and [[Nejd]] kingdoms, the new state was named ''al-Mamlakah al-ʻArabīyah as-Suʻūdīyah'' (a transliteration of {{lang|ar|المملكة العربية السعودية}} in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) by royal decree on 23 September 1932 by its founder, Abdulaziz Al Saud ([[Ibn Saud]]). Although this is normally translated as "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia" in English,&lt;ref name="US State Dept Saudi Arabia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3584.htm |title=Background Note: Saudi Arabia |publisher=U.S. State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; it literally means "the Saudi Arab kingdom",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Crisis of Islam |author=Bernard Lewis |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-679-64281-7 |pages= xx–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Arab Saudi Kingdom".&lt;ref name="Safran1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nadav Safran|title=Saudi Arabia: The Ceaseless Quest for Security|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSkIi_1T1FsC&amp;pg=PA55|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-9484-0|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Saudi" is derived from the element ''as-Suʻūdīyah'' in the [[arabic language|Arabic]] name of the country, which is a type of adjective known as a [[Nisba (onomastics)|nisba]], formed from the dynastic name of the Saudi royal family, the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] ({{lang-ar|آل سعود}}).

There is evidence that human habitation in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] dates back to about 125,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110127/full/news.2011.55.html |title=Early human migration written in stone tools : Nature News |work=Nature|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now believed that the first modern humans to spread east across Asia left Africa about 75,000 years ago across the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] connecting Horn of Africa and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/69197/title/Hints_of_earlier_human_exit_from_Africa |title=Hints Of Earlier Human Exit From Africa |doi=10.1126/science.1199113 |publisher=Science News |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabian peninsula is regarded as a central figure in our understanding of hominin evolution and dispersals. Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the Quaternary that lead to profound evolutionary and demographic changes. Arabia has a rich Lower Paleolithic record, and the quantity of Oldwan-like sites in the region indicate a significant role that Arabia had played in the early hominin colonization of Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;out of Africa I: The first hominin Colonization of Eurasia. New York: Springer. p. 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Neolithic period, prominent cultures such as al-Magar whose epicenter lay in modern-day southwestern [[Najd]] flourished. al-Magar could be considered as a "Neolithic Revolution" in human knowledge and handicraft skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleolithic-neolithic.com/overview/al-magar// al-Magar]&lt;/ref&gt; The culture is characterized as being one of the first culture in the world where widespread domestication of animals occurred, particularly the horse, during the [[Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;

In November 2017 hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs, resembling the [[Canaan dog]], wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis, a hilly region of northwestern Saudi Arabia. These rock engravings date back more than 8000 years, making them the earliest depictions of dogs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/these-may-be-world-s-first-images-dogs-and-they-re-wearing-leashes|title=These may be the world’s first images of dogsand they’re wearing leashes|publisher= Science Magazine - David Grimm|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[4th millennium BC]], Arabia entered the [[Bronze Age]] after witnessing drastic transformations; metals were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2 m high burials which was simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples, that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red colours.&lt;ref&gt;طرق التجارة القديمة، روائع آثار المملكة العربية السعودية p .156 - 157 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Islamic===
[[File:Statue at National Museum of Korea.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Worshiping Servant'' statue (2500 BC), above one metre in height, the statue is much taller than any possible Mesopotamian or Harappan models&lt;ref&gt;Roads of Arabia p.180&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the Ubaid period, upon discovering various pottery shreds at Dosariyah. Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period shreds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the shreds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Roads of Arabia p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Roads of Arabia p.176.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.&lt;ref&gt;Roads of Arabia p.180&lt;/ref&gt; Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.&lt;ref&gt;Roads of Arabia p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Roads of Arabia p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Median and the Medianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible. Centered in [[Tabuk, Saudi_Arabia|Tabouk]], Median stretched from [[Wadi Arabah]] in the north to the area of al-Wejh in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig 1971; Payne 1983: Briggs 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of Median was Qurayyah,&lt;ref name="ArnoldStrawn2016"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e9xrDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT462 The World around the Old Testament: The People and Places of the Ancient Near East]''.

Politically, the Medianite were described as having decentralized structure headed by five kings (Evi, Rekem, Tsur, Hur and Reba), the names appears to be toponyms of important Medianite settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Knauf, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It is common view that Median designated a confederation of tribes, the sedentary element settled in the Hijaz while its nomadic affiliates pastured, and sometimes pillaged as far away land as Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Midian, Moab and Edom: The History and Archaeology of Late Bronze and Iron Age Jordan and North-West Arabia p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The nomadic Medianites were one of the earliest exploiters of the domestication of camels that enabled them to navigate through the harsh terrains of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Midian, Moab and Edom: The History and Archaeology of Late Bronze and Iron Age Jordan and North-West Arabia p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 7th century BC an emerging kingdom appeared on the historical theater of north-western Arabia. It started as a Sheikdom of Dedan, which developed into the Kingdom of Lihyan tribe.&lt;ref&gt;The State of Lihyan: A New Perspective - p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attestation of state regality, King of Lihyan, was in the mid-sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Lihyan was a powerful and highly organized ancient [[Arabian]] kingdom that played a vital cultural and economic role in the north-western region of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohmer, J. &amp; Charloux, G. (2015), "From Liyan to the Nabataeans: Dating the End of the Iron Age in Northwestern Arabia" - p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The Lihyanites ruled over large domain from [[Medina|Yathrib]] in the south and parts of the Levant in the north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiarabiatourismguide.com/lion-tombs-dedan// Saudi Arabia Tourism Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, [[Gulf of Aqaba]] used to be called Gulf of Lihyan.

Cedar Fort; 9 August 1996. {{ISBN|978-1-4621-2638-5}}. p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the [[Nabataeans]] around 65 BC upon their seizure of Hegra then marching to [[Tayma]], and to their capital Dedan in 9 BC. The Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by the Roman Empire.

===Middle Ages and rise of Islam===
{{Main|Caliphate}}
Shortly before the advent of Islam, apart from urban trading settlements (such as [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]), much of what was to become Saudi Arabia was populated by nomadic pastoral tribal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of Islam |author=Matthew Gordon |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-32522-9 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 571 [[Common Era|CE]]. In the early 7th century, Muhammad united the [[Tribes of Arabia|various tribes of the peninsula]] and created a single Islamic religious polity.&lt;ref name="James E. Lindsay 2005 33"/&gt; Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory]] (from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in west to modern day [[Pakistan]] in east) in a matter of decades. [[Arabia]] soon became a more politically peripheral region of the [[Muslim world]] as the focus shifted to the vast and newly conquered lands.&lt;ref name="James E. Lindsay 2005 33"/&gt;

From the 10th century to the early 20th century Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the [[Sharif of Mecca]], but at most times the Sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]] or [[Istanbul]]. Most of the remainder of what became Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia |title=History of Arabia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The changing map of Asia |author=William Gordon East |year=1971 |isbn=978-0-416-16850-1 |pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the 10th century the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]-Shi'ite [[Qarmatians]] were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf. In 930, the Qarmatians pillaged Mecca, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the [[Black Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;Glassé, Cyril. 2008. ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam''.

===Ottoman Hejaz===
{{Main|Ottoman era in the history of Saudi Arabia}}

In the 16th century, the [[Ottomans]] added the [[Red Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]] coast (the Hejaz, [['Asir Province|Asir]] and [[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]]) to the Empire and claimed [[suzerainty]] over the interior. One reason was to [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|thwart Portuguese attempts]] to attack the Red Sea (hence the [[Hejaz]]) and the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;Bernstein, William J.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=ePiReZWp0NwC&amp;pg=PA191 pp. 191 ff]&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire's central authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowen|Bowen]], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muddle of the Middle East, Volume 2 |author=Chatterji, Nikshoy C. |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-391-00304-0 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of the Saud dynasty===
{{See also|Unification of Saudi Arabia}}
[[File:Arabia 1914.png|thumb|The Arabian Peninsula in 1914]]

The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family, known as the Al Saud, began in [[Nejd]] in central Arabia in 1744, when [[Muhammad bin Saud]], founder of the dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowen|Bowen]], pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Religions: A World Guide |author=Ian Harris |author2=Stuart Mews|author3=Paul Morris|author4= John Shepherd |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-582-08695-1 |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of Islam in the Middle East |author=Mahmud A. Faksh |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-275-95128-3 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Emirate of Diriyah|first "Saudi state"]] established in 1744 in the area around [[Riyadh]], rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;D. Gold (6 April 2003) [http://www.jcpa.org/art/nypost-dg6apr03.htm "Reining in Riyadh"].

Library of Congress Country Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; A much smaller second "Saudi state", located mainly in Nejd, was established in 1824. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family, the [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]]. By 1891, the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;

[[File:Ibn Saud (kuwait 1910).jpg|thumb|[[Ibn Saud|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]], the founding father and first king of Saudi Arabia.]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued to control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula. Subject to this suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers,&lt;ref name= Murphy&gt;{{cite book |title=The Arab Revolt 1916–18: Lawrence Sets Arabia Ablaze |author=David Murphy |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84603-339-1 |pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics in an Arabian Oasis: The Rashidis of Saudi Arabia |author=Madawi Al Rasheed |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86064-193-0 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Sharif of Mecca]] having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Middle East: Geography and Geopolitics |author=Ewan W.

In 1916, with the encouragement and support of Britain (which was fighting the Ottomans in [[World War I]]), the Sharif of Mecca, [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], led a [[Arab Revolt|pan-Arab revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of World War I |author=Spencer Tucker |author2=Priscilla Mary Roberts |year=205 |isbn=978-1-85109-420-2 |page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Arab Revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective, [[Allies of World War I|the Allied]] victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Arab Peoples |author=Albert Hourani |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-571-22664-1 |pages=315–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter's final defeat, he took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25 and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself King of the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Brief History of Saudi Arabia |author=James Wynbrandt |author2=Fawaz A. Gerges |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8160-7876-9 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he added the title of King of Nejd. For the next five years, he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership's objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud's opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1929 at the [[Battle of Sabilla]], where their leaders were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Kingdom |author=Robert Lacey |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-09-953905-6 |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 1932, the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt; and that date is now a national holiday called [[Saudi National Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pmu.edu.sa/News/News.aspx?ID=866 |title=History of Saudi Arabia.

The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Afluence and Poverty in the Middle East |author=Mohamad Riad El Ghonemy |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-10033-5 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, vast reserves of [[Petroleum|oil]] were discovered in the [[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]] region along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and full-scale development of the oil fields began in 1941 under the US-controlled [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company)]]. Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally.&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt;

Cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the center for newspapers and radio. However, the large influx of [[foreign workers in Saudi Arabia]] in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for [[xenophobia]]. At the same time, the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant. By the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing.&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt;

In 1953, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia]] succeeded as the king of Saudi Arabia, on his father's death, until 1964 when he was deposed in favor of his half brother [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], after an intense rivalry, fueled by doubts in the royal family over Saud's competence. In 1972, Saudi Arabia gained a 20% control in Aramco, thereby decreasing US control over Saudi oil.

In 1973, Saudi Arabia led an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadrupled.&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt; In 1975, Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince [[Faisal bin Musaid]] and was succeeded by his half-brother [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khalid]].&lt;ref name="Al-Rasheed 136-137"&gt;[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1976, Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Resources Development in Saudi Arabia: Multinationals and Saudization |author=Joy Winkie Viola |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-88746-070-8 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid's reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country;&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed.&lt;ref name="Al-Rasheed 136-137"/&gt; In 1979, two events occurred which greatly concerned the government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Muslim world after 9/11 |author=Rabasa, Angel |author2=Benard, Cheryl |author3=Chalk, Peter |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8330-3712-1 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]]. It was feared that the country's [[Shi'a Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shi'ite minority]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region such as the [[1979 Qatif Uprising]].&lt;ref name="Toby Craig Jones 2010 218–219"&gt;{{cite book |title=Desert Kingdom: How Oil and Water Forged Modern Saudi Arabia |author=Toby Craig Jones |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-674-04985-7 |pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event was the [[Grand Mosque Seizure]] in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government.&lt;ref name="Toby Craig Jones 2010 218–219"/&gt; The government regained control of the mosque after 10 days and those captured were executed. Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country (for example, the closure of cinemas) and to give the [[Ulema]] a greater role in government.&lt;ref name= Hegghammer24&gt;[[#Hegghammer|Hegghammer]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Neither entirely succeeded as [[Islamism]] continued to grow in strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia Enters the 21st Century |author=Anthony H. Cordesman |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-275-98091-7 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Saudi Arabia bought out the American interests in Aramco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oil, Dollars, Debt, and Crises: The Global Curse of Black Gold|author1=Mahmoud A. El-Gamal |author2=Amy Myers Jaffe |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0521720700|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Khalid died of a heart attack in June 1982. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], who added the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" to his name in 1986 in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid use of "majesty" in association with anything except God. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;

The vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on Saudi society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernisation, urbanization, mass public education and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt; leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abir1993|Abir (1993)]], p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 billion in support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk (2005) ''[[The Great War For Civilisation]]''. Fourth Estate. p. 23. {{ISBN|1-4000-7517-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Saudi Arabia condemned the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990]] and asked the US to intervene.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt; King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of [[Yemen]] and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.

Saudi Arabia's relations with the West began to cause growing concern among some of the ulema and students of sharia law and was one of the issues that led to [[List of militant incidents in Saudi Arabia|an increase in Islamist terrorism]] in Saudi Arabia, as well as [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorist attacks]] in Western countries by Saudi nationals. [[Osama bin Laden]] was a Saudi national (until stripped of his nationality in 1994) and was responsible for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa and the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing]] near the port of Aden, Yemen. 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City, Washington, D.C., and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania were Saudi nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Saudi Arabia: Background and U.S. Relations |author=Christopher Blanchard |publisher=United States Congressional Research Service|year=2009 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Saudis who did not support the [[Islamist]] terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hegghammer|Hegghammer]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oil and Gas Infrastructure Persian Gulf (large).gif|thumb|[[Petroleum|Oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] pipelines in the Middle-East]]
Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although now extremely wealthy, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent, and has been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited "reforms" were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the "[[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]]", which emphasised the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. The King's intent was to respond to dissent while making as few actual changes in the status quo as possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind: "A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā]."&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt;

In 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the Crown Prince, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], assumed the role of ''de facto'' [[regent]], taking on the day-to-day running of the country. However, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd's full brothers (known, with Fahd, as the "[[Sudairi Seven]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1990s, signs of discontent continued and included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar.&lt;ref name="Cordesman 2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=Saudi Arabia: National Security in a Troubled Region |author=Anthony H. Cordesman |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-313-38076-1 |pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February–April 2005, the first-ever nationwide municipal elections were held in Saudi Arabia. Women were not allowed to take part in the poll.&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt;

In 2005, King Fahd died and was succeeded by Abdullah, who continued the policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests. The king introduced a number of economic reforms aimed at reducing the country's reliance on oil revenue: limited deregulation, encouragement of foreign investment, and privatization. In February 2009, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the [[Islamic religious police|Mutaween]] (religious police) with more moderate individuals and the appointment of the country's first female deputy minister.&lt;ref name="Britannica history" /&gt;

On 29 January 2011, hundreds of protesters gathered in the city of [[Jeddah]] in a rare display of criticism against the city's poor infrastructure after deadly floods swept through the city, killing eleven people.&lt;ref name="Montreal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Flood+sparks+rare+action/4189873/story.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201053307/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Flood%2Bsparks%2Brare%2Baction/4189873/story.html |archivedate= 1 February 2011 |title=Flood sparks rare action |date=29 January 2011 |work=Reuters via [[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police stopped the demonstration after about 15 minutes and arrested 30 to 50 people.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Dozens_detained"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dozens detained in Saudi over flood protests |date=29 January 2011 |work=[[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula]] (Qatar)/[[Thomson-Reuters]] |url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/middle-east/140720-dozens-detained-in-saudi-over-flood-protests.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9qUZeyR?url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/middle-east/140720-dozens-detained-in-saudi-over-flood-protests.html |archivedate=31 January 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of national elections and political parties,&lt;ref name=Cavendish78/&gt; politics in Saudi Arabia takes place in two distinct arenas: within the royal family, the Al Saud, and between the royal family and the rest of Saudi society.&lt;ref name= Noreng97&gt;{{cite book |title=Crude power: politics and the oil market |author=Oystein Noreng |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84511-023-9 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the Al-Saud, participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small segment of the population and takes the form of the royal family consulting with the ulema, tribal sheikhs and members of important commercial families on major decisions.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; This process is not reported by the Saudi media.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Long|Long]], p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

By custom, all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the ''[[majlis]]''.&lt;ref name=Cavendish92&gt;{{cite book |title=World and Its Peoples: the Arabian Peninsula |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2 |pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule. Tribal identity remains strong and, outside of the royal family, political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation, with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; As mentioned earlier, in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the National Dialogue Forum in 2003.&lt;ref name= Al-Rasheed242/&gt;

The rule of the Al Saud faces political opposition from four sources: [[Sunni]] [[Islamist]] activism; liberal critics; the [[Shia Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shi'ite minority]]—particularly in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]]; and long-standing tribal and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] particularistic opponents (for example in the [[Hejaz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ondrej Barenek|year=2009 |title=Divided We Survive: A Landscape of Fragmentation in Saudi Arabia |journal=Middle East Brief |issue=33 |url=http://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB33.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Islamic activists have been the most prominent threat to the government and have in recent years perpetrated a number of violent or [[List of militant incidents in Saudi Arabia|terrorist acts in the country]].&lt;ref name="Cordesman 2009"/&gt; However, open protest against the government, even if peaceful, is not tolerated.

[[Transparency International]] in its annual [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] for 2010 gave Saudi Arabia a score of 4.7 (on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is "highly corrupt" and 10 is "highly clean").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010|publisher=Transparency International|date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia has undergone a process of political and social reform, such as to increase public transparency and good governance. However, nepotism and patronage are widespread when doing business in the country. The enforcement of the anti-corruption laws is selective and public officials engage in corruption with impunity. A number of prominent Saudi Arabian princes, government ministers, and businesspeople, including Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]], were [[2017 Saudi Arabian anti-corruption arrests|arrested in Saudi Arabia]] in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html |title= Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes, Including Billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal |author= [[David D.

There has been mounting pressure to reform and modernize the royal family's rule, an agenda championed by King Abdullah both before and after his accession in 2005. The creation of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s did not satisfy demands for political participation, and, in 2003, an annual ''National Dialogue Forum'' was announced that would allow selected professionals and intellectuals to publicly debate current national issues, within certain prescribed parameters. In 2005, the first municipal elections were held. In 2007, the [[Allegiance Council]] was created to regulate the succession.&lt;ref name=Al-Rasheed242&gt;[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 180, 242–243, 248, 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post.&lt;ref&gt;

===Al ash-Sheikh and role of the ulema===
[[File:Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh Senate of Poland 02.JPG|thumb|[[Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh]] with [[Bogdan Borusewicz]] in the [[Polish Senate]], 26 May 2014]]

Saudi Arabia is almost unique in giving the [[ulema]] (the body of Islamic religious leaders and jurists) a direct role in government.&lt;ref name= Goldstein118&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion and the State |author=Natalie Goldstein |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8160-8090-8 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred ulema are of the [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] persuasion. The ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions, for example the imposition of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo in 1973]] and the [[Gulf War|invitation to foreign troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990]].&lt;ref name="meforum.org"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nawaf E.

By the 1970s, as a result of oil wealth and the modernization of the country initiated by King Faisal, important changes to Saudi society were under way and the power of the ulema was in decline.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abir1987|Abir (1987)]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, this changed following the [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque]] in Mecca in 1979 by [[Islamist]] radicals.&lt;ref name= Abir21&gt;[[#Abir1993|Abir (1993)]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The government's response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema's powers and increasing their financial support:&lt;ref name= Hegghammer24 /&gt; in particular, they were given greater control over the education system&lt;ref name= Abir21/&gt; and allowed to enforce stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour.&lt;ref name= Hegghammer24 /&gt; After his accession to the throne in 2005, King Abdullah took steps to reduce the powers of the ulema, for instance transferring control over girls' education to the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name="NYT Abdullah"&gt;{{cite news |title=Abdullah, King of Saudi Arabia |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/abdullah_bin_abdul_aziz_alsaud/index.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 November 2010 |author =Nada Bakri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal system===
{{Main|Legal system of Saudi Arabia}}
{{See also|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Public executions in Saudi Arabia}}

[[File:Iqra.jpg|thumb|Verses from the Quran. The Quran is the official constitution of the country and a primary source of law. Saudi Arabia is unique in enshrining a religious text as a political document.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowen|Bowen]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The primary source of law is the Islamic [[Sharia]] derived from the teachings of the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] (the traditions of the Prophet).&lt;ref name= Campbell/&gt; Saudi Arabia is unique among modern Muslim states in that Sharia is not [[Codification (law)|codified]] and there is no system of [[judicial precedent]], giving judges the power to use independent legal reasoning to make a decision. Saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the [[Hanbali]] school of jurisprudence (or ''[[fiqh]]'') found in pre-modern texts&lt;ref name= Haffner58&gt;{{cite book |title=Shari'a Politics: Islamic Law and Society in the Modern World |author=Robert W. Hefner|year=2011 |isbn=978-0-253-22310-4 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |author=Juan Eduardo Campo |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases,&lt;ref name="Sharia Inc Courts"/&gt; making predictability of legal interpretation difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oxford Business Group|title=The Report: Saudi Arabia 2009 |year=2009 |page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMPjxHzG1xQC&amp;pg=PA202|isbn=978-1-902339-00-9|quote=it is not always possible to reach a conclusion on how a Saudi court or judicial committee would view a particular case [because] decisions of a court or a judicial committee have no binding authority with respect to another case, [and] in general there is also no system of court reporting in the Kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges ([[qadi]]) and lawyers form part of the [[ulema]], the country's Islamic scholars.

Royal decrees are the other main source of law; but are referred to as ''regulations'' rather than ''laws'' because they are subordinate to the Sharia.&lt;ref name= Campbell/&gt; Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, traditional tribal law and [[Custom (law)|custom]] remain significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otto|Otto]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Extra-Sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and politics |author=John L. Esposito|year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8156-2774-6 |pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and all courts and tribunals follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure.&lt;ref name= Campbell268&gt;{{cite book |title=Legal Aspects of Doing Business in the Middle East |author=Christian Campbell|year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4303-1914-6 |pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi system of justice has been criticized for its "ultra-puritanical judges", who are often harsh in their sentencing (with beheading for the crime of witchcraft), but also sometimes overly lenient (for cases of rape or wife-beating) and slow, for example leaving thousands of abandoned women unable to secure a divorce.&lt;ref name=econ-2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=International: Law of God versus law of man; Saudi Arabia|journal=The Economist|date=13 October 2007|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9954500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist Cruel"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Saudi Arabian justice: Cruel, or just unusual? |url=http://www.economist.com/node/656147 |work=The Economist |date=14 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has also been criticized for being arcane,&lt;ref name="Economist Tentative"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Tentative steps in Saudi Arabia: The king of Saudi Arabia shows some reformist credentials |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13134598 |work=The Economist |date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacking in some of the safeguards of justice, and unable to deal with the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Support for shake-up of Saudi justice system |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec3ad182-72a2-11dc-b7ff-0000779fd2ac.html |newspaper=Financial Times |date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system,&lt;ref name="Sharia Inc Courts"&gt;[[#Otto|Otto]], pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2009, the King made a number of significant changes to the judiciary's personnel at the most senior level by bringing in a younger generation.&lt;ref name="Economist Tentative"/&gt;

[[Capital punishment|Capital]] and [[corporal punishment|physical]] punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as [[beheading]], [[stoning]] (to death), [[amputation]], [[crucifixion]] and [[Flagellation|lashing]], as well as the sheer number of executions have been strongly criticized.&lt;ref name="Sharia Inc175"&gt;[[#Otto|Otto]], p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder, rape, [[armed robbery]], repeated drug use, [[apostasy]], [[adultery]], [[witchcraft]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and can be carried out by beheading with a sword, stoning or firing squad, followed by crucifixion.&lt;ref name= FRD306&gt;{{cite book |title=Saudi Arabia A Country Study |author=Federal Research Division |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4191-4621-3 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2966790.stm |title=Saudi executioner tells all |date=5 June 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lu&gt;{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective |author=Terance D.

Even after allowing women to drive and work, public places in Saudi Arabia are still gender-segregated and the kingdom has very strict laws on how unrelated men and women can dine together.

Western-based organizations such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Freedom House]] condemn both the Saudi criminal justice system and its severe punishments. There are no jury trials in Saudi Arabia and courts observe few formalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doing business with Saudi Arabia |author=Anthony Shoult|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-905050-06-2 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that a criminal procedure code had been introduced for the first time in 2002, but it lacked some basic protections and, in any case, had been routinely ignored by judges. Those arrested are often not informed of the crime of which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret.&lt;ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia is widely accused of having one of the worst human rights records in the world. Human rights issues that have attracted strong criticism include the extremely disadvantaged position of women (see [[Saudi Arabia#Women|Women]] below), capital punishment for [[LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia|homosexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/24/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death/ |title=Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punished by death |date=24 February 2014 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; religious discrimination, the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police]] (see [[Saudi Arabia#Religion|Religion]] below).&lt;ref name="Sharia Inc175"/&gt; Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN human rights conventions and, in 2004, the government approved the establishment of the [[National Society for Human Rights]] (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 250–252&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia remains one of the very few countries in the world not to accept the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otto|Otto]], pp. 168, 172&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom had unsuccessfully&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/31/dispatches-obama-refuses-talk-human-rights-saudi-arabia |title=Dispatches: Obama Refuses to Talk Human Rights in Saudi Arabia |date=31 March 2014 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; urged President [[Barack Obama]] to raise human rights concerns with King Abdullah on his March 2014 visit to the Kingdom especially the imprisonments of Sultan Hamid Marzooq al-Enezi, Saud Falih Awad al-Enezi, and [[Raif Badawi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases/uscirf-urges-president-raise-religious-freedom-saudi-trip "USCIRF Urges President: Raise Religious Freedom on Saudi Trip"].

Tensions have escalated between the Saudi and its allies after the disappearance of [[Jamal Khashoggi]] from the Saudi consulate in [[Istanbul]]. Turkish officials are highly skeptical of Khashoggi being murdered inside the consulate; this has strained the already suffering [[Saudi Arabia–Turkey relations]].

In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder in October 2018, the US secretary of state [[Mike Pompeo]] and the US defence secretary [[Jim Mattis]] have called for a ceasefire in Yemen within 30 days followed by UN-initiated peace talks. Pompeo has asked Saudi Arabia and the UAE to stop their airstrikes on populated areas in Yemen. [[Theresa May]] backed the US call to end the coalition. President of the [[International Rescue Committee]] [[David Miliband]] called the US announcement as “the most significant breakthrough in the war in Yemen for four years”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/31/us-calls-ceasefire-yemen-within-30-days-sparking-hopes-diplomatic/|title=US calls for ceasefire in Yemen within 30 days, sparking hopes of diplomatic breakthrough|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Hunt]], the UK Foreign Secretary, on his visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE on 12 November 2018, is expected to raise the need for a ceasefire from all sides in the four-year long Yemen civil war. The US called for a ceasefire within 30 days. Prior to his visit, Hunt said, “The only solution is now a political decision to set aside arms and pursue peace. Britain has a unique position, both as pen-holder [lead state for drafting decisions] at the UN Security Council and as a key influencer in the region, so today I am travelling to the Gulf to demand that all sides commit to this process. We are witnessing a manmade humanitarian catastrophe on our watch: now is the window to make a difference, and to get behind both the UN peace process and current UK efforts in the security council.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/12/uk-jeremy-hunt-pressure-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-killing|title=UK piles pressure on Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi killing|accessdate=12 November 2018|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia has one of the highest [[List of countries by military expenditure share of GDP|percentages of military expenditure]] in the world, spending more than 10% of its GDP in its military. The Saudi military consists of the [[Royal Saudi Land Forces]], the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]], the [[Royal Saudi Navy]], the [[Royal Saudi Air Defense]], the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] (SANG, an independent military force), and paramilitary forces, totaling nearly 200,000 active-duty personnel. In 2005 the armed forces had the following personnel: the army, 75,000; the air force, 18,000; air defense, 16,000; the navy, 15,500 (including 3,000 marines); and the SANG had 75,000 active soldiers and 25,000 tribal levies.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Saudi_Arabia.pdf |title=Country Profile: Saudi Arabia, Sept. 2006 Library of Congress|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah]] military intelligence service.

Its modern existence, however, is attributable to it being effectively [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah's]] private army since the 1960s and, unlike the rest of the armed forces, is independent of the Ministry of Defense and Aviation. The SANG has been a counterbalance to the [[Sudairi]] faction in the royal family: The late prince Sultan, former Minister of Defense and Aviation, was one of the so-called 'Sudairi Seven' and controlled the remainder of the armed forces until his death in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/sang.htm |title=Saudi Arabian National Guard |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=27 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rich diversity is in part due to the {{cvt|2000|km|mi|-1}} of [[coral reef]] extending along its [[coastline]]; these [[fringing reef]]s are 5000–7000 years old and are largely formed of stony [[acropora]] and [[porites]] corals. The reefs form platforms and sometimes [[lagoon]]s along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders (such as the [[Blue Hole (Red Sea)]] at [[Dahab]]). These coastal reefs are also visited by [[pelagic]] species of Red Sea fish, including some of the [[List of sharks in the Red Sea|44 species of shark]].
The Red Sea also contains many offshore reefs including several true atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic (i.e., Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes, and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.
Domesticated animals include the legendary [[Arabian horse]], [[Arabian camel]], sheep, goats, cows, donkeys, chickens etc. Reflecting the country's dominant desert conditions, Saudi Arabia's plant life mostly consists of herbs, plants and shrubs that require little water. The [[Date (fruit)|date]] palm (''Phoenix dactylifera'') is widespread.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jica.go.jp/english/global/pov/profiles/pdf/sau_eng.pdf |title=Country Profile Study on Poverty: Saudi Arabia |accessdate=26 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226202420/http://www.jica.go.jp/english/global/pov/profiles/pdf/sau_eng.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2008 |website=jica.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the Kingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Pierru |first1=Axel |last2=Matar |first2=Walid |title=The Impact of Oil Price Volatility on Welfare in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Implications for Public Investment Decision-Making |date=16 July 2012 |publisher=USAEE Working Paper No. 2110172 |ssrn=2110172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World oil market chronology from 2003|Increases in oil prices in the aughts]]{{Peacock term|date=May 2015}} helped boost per capita GDP to $17,000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400 adjusted for inflation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl |title=CPI Inflation Calculator |publisher=Data.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.&lt;ref name=wti&gt;{{cite web|title=Crude Oil WTI (NYMEX) Price|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil.aspx?timeframe=10y|website=nasdaq.com|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OPEC]] (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) limits its members' oil production based on their "proven reserves." Saudi Arabia's published reserves have shown little change since 1980, with the main exception being an increase of about {{convert|100|Goilbbl|m3}} between 1987 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/crudeoilreserves.xls |title=Crude Oil Reserves |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122123445/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/crudeoilreserves.xls |archivedate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Simmons]] has suggested that Saudi Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production declines (see [[peak oil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy|author= Matthew Simmons|authorlink= Matthew_Simmons|publisher= Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-73876-3|year= 2005|origyear= 10 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003–2013 "several key services" were privatized—municipal water supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health care, traffic control and car accident reporting were also privatized. According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, "in almost every one of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the performance of these privatized entities."&lt;ref name=Aluwaisheg&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg|title=When privatization goes wrong|journal=Arab News|date=29 September 2014|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/464657}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tadawul]] All Share Index (TASI) of the Saudi stock exchange peaked at 16,712.64 in 2005, and closed at 8,535.60, at the end of 2013.&lt;ref name=MV2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Stock Exchange, Annual Statistical Report 2013|url=http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/saudi-stock-exchange-tadawul-annual-statistical-report-2013/|website=mondovisione.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Saudi Arabia was approved as a member of the [[World Trade Organization]]. Negotiations to join had focused on the degree to which Saudi Arabia is willing to increase market access to foreign goods and in 2000, the government established the [[Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority]] to encourage foreign direct investment in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.

The government has also made an attempt at "[[Saudization|Saudizing]]" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.&lt;ref name=house-161&gt;[[#House|House]], p. 161: "Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to 'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail. The foreign workforce grows, and so does unemployment among Saudis. .... The previous plan called for slashing unemployment to 2.8% only to see it rise to 10.5% in 2009, the end of that plan period. Government plans in Saudi are like those in the old Soviet Union, grandiose but unmet. (Also, as in the old Soviet Union, nearly all Saudi official statistics are unreliable, so economists believe the real Saudi unemployment rate is closer to 40%)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia has had five-year "Development Plans" since 1970. Among its plans were to launch "economic cities" (e.g. [[King Abdullah Economic City]]) to be completed by 2020, in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs. {{As of|2013}} four cities were planned.&lt;ref name=MCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia's Four New Economic Cities|url=http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/22205/saudi-arabia%E2%80%99s-four-new-economic-cities|website=The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel|accessdate=16 March 2015|date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King has announced that the per capita income is forecast to rise from $15,000 in 2006 to $33,500 in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://professional.tdctrade.com/content.aspx?data=Professional_content_en&amp;contentid=917452&amp;w_sid=194&amp;w_pid=836&amp;w_nid=10993&amp;w_cid=917452&amp;w_idt=1900-01-01&amp;w_oid=181&amp;w_jid= |title=Construction boom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE |accessdate=7 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212725/http://professional.tdctrade.com/content.aspx?data=Professional_content_en&amp;contentid=917452&amp;w_sid=194&amp;w_pid=836&amp;w_nid=10993&amp;w_cid=917452&amp;w_idt=1900-01-01&amp;w_oid=181&amp;w_jid= |archivedate=11 October 2007 |website=tdctrade.com |date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities will be spread around Saudi Arabia to promote diversification for each region and their economy, and the cities are projected to contribute $150 billion to the GDP.

In addition to petroleum and gas, Saudi also has a significant gold mining sector in the ancient [[Mahd adh Dhahab]] region and significant other mineral industries, an agricultural sector (especially in the southwest but not only) based on vegetables, fruits, dates etc. and livestock, and large number of temporary jobs created by the roughly two million annual ''[[hajj]]'' pilgrims.&lt;ref name="HT2009: 150"&gt;[[Saudi Arabia#HT2009|Tripp, ''Culture Shock'', 2009]]: p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With the first phase of [[Saudization]] into effect, 70% of sales job are expected to be filled by Saudis. However, the private sector still remains hugely dominated by foreigners. The rate of local unemployment is 12.9%, its highest in more than a decade.&lt;ref name=blooms/&gt; According to a report published by Bloomberg Economics in 2018, the government needs to produce 700,000 jobs by 2020 to meet its 9% unemployment target.&lt;ref name=blooms/&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Jabal Al Qara Cave - Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia ജബൽ അൽ ഖാറ ഗുഹ, അൽ ഹസ, സൗദി അറേബ്യ 13.JPG|thumb|[[Al-Hasa]] is known for its palm trees and dates. Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]

Serious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.
As a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.
The country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid. 
In addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449#|archivedate=13 November 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some thirty countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.
The Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title=Agriculture &amp; Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia. In 2018 the Al Jouf Agricultural Development Company received a certificate of merit from [[The Guinness World Records]] for the largest modern olive plantation in the world. The farm covers 7730 hectares and has 5 million olive trees. The Guinness World Records also took into consideration their production capacity of 15000 tonnes of high quality of olive oil, while the kingdom consumes double that.
The Al Jouf farms are located in [[Sakaka]], a city in the north-western part of Saudi Arabia, which is a deeply-rooted in history. Sakaka dates back more than 4,000 years.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title=Largest olive tree farm in Saudi Arabia enters Guinness World Records|url = https://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/largest-olive-tree-farm-in-saudi-arabia-enters-guinness-world-records-1.2215802 |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al Jouf region has millions of olive trees and the expected number is expected to go up to 20 million trees soon.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title=Inside the Saudi olive farm, the largest in the world|url = https://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/economy/2018/05/03/Saudi-olive-tree-farm-sets-Guinness-Records-for-largest-in-the-world.html|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consuming non-renewable groundwater resulted in the loss of an estimated four fifths of the total groundwater reserves by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia Stakes a Claim on the Nile – Water Grabbers – National Geographic|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/12/121217-saudi-arabia-water-grabs-ethiopia/ |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia}}

Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia is characterized by significant investments in [[Water desalination|seawater desalination]], water distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment leading to a substantial increase in access to drinking water and sanitation over the past decades. About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&amp;nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.&lt;ref name="GWI April 2011"&gt;Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually delegated to private companies as well.

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Saudi Arabia}}

Although most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector. According to the [[World Bank]], approximately 14.3 million people visited Saudi Arabia in 2012, making it the world's 19th-most-visited country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21607898-can-kingdom-attract-more-visitors-wish-you-were-here Tourism in Saudi Arabia: Wish you were here], economist.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is an important component of the [[Saudi Vision 2030]] and according to a report conducted by BMI Research in 2018, both religious and non-religious tourism have significant potential for expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/travel-hospitality/387984-tourism-key-to-saudi-arabias-vision-2030-plans Tourism key to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plans], arabianbusiness.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language of Saudi Arabia is [[Arabic]]. The three main regional variants spoken by Saudis are [[Hejazi Arabic]] (about 6 million speakers&lt;ref&gt;[[:ethnologue:acw|Arabic, Hijazi Spoken]]. Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Najdi Arabic]] (about 8 million speakers&lt;ref&gt;[[:ethnologue:ars|Arabic, Najdi Spoken]].

[[Saudi Sign Language]] is the principal language of the deaf community. The large expatriate communities also speak their own languages, the most numerous of which are [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (700,000), [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]] (400,000), [[Urdu]] (380,000), and [[Egyptian Arabic]] (300,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SA Saudi Arabia].

Saudi Arabia has centuries-old attitudes and traditions, often derived from Arab civilization. This culture has been heavily influenced by the austerely puritanical [[Wahhabi]] form of Islam, which arose in the eighteenth century and now predominates in the country. Wahhabi Islam has been called "the predominant feature of Saudi culture."&lt;ref name="HT2003: 14"/&gt;

Saudi [[Wahhabism]] is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to [[Shirk (Islam)|'shirk']] (idolatry), and the most significant historic Muslim sites (in Mecca and Medina) are located in the western Saudi region of [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref name="Arabia: the Cradle of Islam"/&gt; As a consequence, under Saudi rule, an estimated 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|have been demolished]] for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-destruction-of-mecca-saudi-hardliners-are-wiping-out-their-own-heritage-501647.html 'The destruction of Mecca: Saudi hardliners are wiping out their own heritage'], ''The Independent'', 6 August 2005.

===Dress===
Saudi Arabian dress strictly follows the principles of [[hijab]] (the Islamic principle of [[modesty]], especially in dress). The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.
* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|غتره}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth ("scarf"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].
* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|عقال}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.
* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|ثوب}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].
* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|بشت}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.
* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|عبائة}}) is a women's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niqāb and some do not.

[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]

During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.&lt;ref name="Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics"&gt;[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters. However, with King Abdullah's reforms from 2005, some cinemas have re-opened,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/12/saudi-arabia--1.html |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Babylon &amp; Beyond |date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including one in [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology|KAUST]].

From the 18th century onward, [[Wahhabi]] fundamentalism discouraged artistic development inconsistent with its teaching. In addition, Sunni Islamic prohibition of creating representations of people have limited the visual arts, which tend to be dominated by [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]], [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|floral]], and abstract designs and by [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]]. With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rabābah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the ṭabl (drum) and the ṭār (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the ʿarḍah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines. Bedouin poetry, known as nabaṭī, is still very popular.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

Censorship has limited the development of Saudi literature, although several Saudi novelists and poets have achieved critical and popular acclaim in the Arab world—albeit generating official hostility in their home country. These include [[Ghazi Algosaibi]], [[Abdelrahman Munif]], [[Turki al-Hamad]] and [[Rajaa al-Sanea]].&lt;ref name="Guardian2410"&gt;{{cite news |author=Trevor Mostyn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/24/ghazi-algosaibi-obituary |title=Ghazi al-Gosaibi obituary |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 August 2010 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Association football|Football]] is the national sport in Saudi Arabia. The [[Saudi Arabia national football team]] is considered as one of Asia's most successful national teams, having reached a joint record 6 [[AFC Asian Cup]] finals, winning three of those finals (1984, 1988, and 1996) and having qualified for the World Cup four consecutive times ever since debuting at the 1994 tournament.
In the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] under the leadership of Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia beat both Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before falling to defeat Sweden in the round of 16. During the [[1992 King Fahd Cup|1992 FIFA Confederations Cup]], which was played in Saudi Arabia, the country reached the [[1992 King Fahd Cup Final|final]], losing 1–3 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].
[[Scuba diving]], [[windsurfing]], sailing and basketball (which is played by both men and women) are also popular with the [[Saudi Arabia national basketball team|Saudi Arabian national basketball team]] winning bronze at the [[1999 ABC Championship|1999 Asian Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Saudi Arabian cuisine}}
[[File:ArabicCoffee.jpg|thumb|[[Arabic coffee]] is a traditional beverage in Arabian cuisine]]

[[Saudi Arabian cuisine]] is similar to that of the surrounding countries in the Arabian Peninsula and the wider Arab world, and has influenced and been influenced by Turkish, Indian, Persian, and African food. [[Islamic dietary laws]] are enforced: pork is not allowed and other animals are slaughtered in accordance with [[halal]]. [[Kebabs]] and [[falafel]] are popular, as is ''shāwarmā'' ([[shawarma]]), a marinated grilled meat dish of [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[mutton]], or chicken. As in other Arab countries of the Arabian Peninsula, ''machbūs'' ([[kabsa]]), a rice dish with lamb, chicken, fish or [[shrimp]], is among the national dishes as well as the dish [[mandi (food)]]. Flat, unleavened [[taboon bread]] is a staple of virtually every meal, as are [[Date (fruit)|dates]], fresh fruit, yoghurt and [[hummus]]. Coffee, served in the [[Arabic coffee|Arabic style]], is the traditional beverage but tea and various fruit juices are popular as well.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Arabic coffee is a traditional beverage in Arabian cuisine. The earliest substantiated evidence of either [[history of coffee|coffee drinking]] or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the 15th century, in the [[Sufi]] monasteries of [[Arabia]].

{{Main|Education in Saudi Arabia}}

Education is free at all levels. The school system is composed of elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools. A large part of the curriculum at all levels is devoted to Islam, and, at the secondary level, students are able to follow either a religious or a technical track. The rate of literacy is 90.4% among males and is about 81.3% among females.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook"/&gt; Classes are segregated by sex. Higher education has expanded rapidly, with large numbers of [[List of universities and colleges in Saudi Arabia|Universities and colleges being founded particularly since 2000]]. Institutions of higher education include the country's first university, [[King Saud University]] founded in 1957, the [[Islamic University of Madinah|Islamic University]] at [[Medina]] founded in 1961, and the [[King Abdulaziz University]] in [[Jeddah]] founded in 1967. [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]], known as KAUST, founded recently in 2009. Other colleges and universities emphasize curricula in sciences and technology, military studies, religion, and medicine. Institutes devoted to Islamic studies, in particular, abound. Women typically receive college instruction in segregated institutions.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

The ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'', known as Shanghai Ranking, ranked 4 of Saudi Arabian institutions among its 2016–2017 list of the 980 top universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larry|first1=Smith|last2=Abdulrahman|first2=Abouammoh|title=Higher Education in Saudi Arabia|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400763210|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EbVEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[QS World University Rankings]] has ranked nineteen Saudi universities among the top 100 Arab institutions, on its 13th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=19 Saudi universities among top 100 in the Arab world|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/980851/saudi-arabia|accessdate=7 December 2016|agency=Arab News|publisher=Arab News|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, Saudi curriculum is not just dominated by Islam but suffers from [[Wahhabi]] dogma that propagates hatred towards non-Muslim and non-Wahhabis&lt;ref name=FH-education&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/48.pdf |title=Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerence |publisher=Center for Religious Freedom, [[Freedom House]] |year=2006 |author=Shea, Nona |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001152022/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/48.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lacks technical and other education useful for productive employment.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;

Memorization by rote of large parts of the Qur'an, its interpretation and understanding ([[Tafsir]]) and the application of Islamic tradition to everyday life is at the core of the curriculum. Religion taught in this manner is also a compulsory subject for all University students.&lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick, Robert (1 November 2001) [http://www.wes.org/ewenr/01nov/practical.htm Education in Saudi Arabia]. World Education News and Reviews.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Saudi youth "generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs" according to the CIA.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook"/&gt; Similarly, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' wrote in 2010 that "the country needs educated young Saudis with marketable skills and a capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship. That's not generally what Saudi Arabia's educational system delivers, steeped as it is in rote learning and religious instruction."&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Saudi-Arabias-Education/124771/ "Saudi Arabia's Education Reforms Emphasize Training for Jobs"] ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 3 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious sector of the Saudi national curriculum was examined in a 2006 report by [[Freedom House]] which concluded that "the Saudi public school religious curriculum continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward the 'unbeliever', that is, Christians, Jews, Shiites, Sufis, Sunni Muslims who do not follow Wahhabi doctrine, [[Hindu]]s, atheists and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/48.pdf |title=Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerence |publisher=Center for Religious Freedom, [[Freedom House]] |year=2006 |author=Shea, Nona |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001152022/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/48.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=379|title=Revised Saudi Government Textbooks Still Demonize Christians, Jews, Non-Wahhabi Muslims and Other|date=23 May 2006|publisher=Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom via Saudi-linked [[madrasah]], schools, and clubs throughout the world.&lt;ref name = "Panorama 2010"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11799713 "Saudi school lessons in UK concern government"]. [[BBC News]]. 22 November 2010. &lt;/ref&gt; Critics have described the education system as "medieval" and that its primary goal "is to maintain the rule of absolute monarchy by casting it as the ordained protector of the faith, and that Islam is at war with other faiths and cultures".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/nov/26/saudi-arabia-religious-education "This medieval Saudi education system must be reformed"], ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia sponsors and promotes the teaching of [[Wahhabism]] ideology which is adopted by [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Jihadist groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Al-Nusra Front|Nusra Front]]. This radical teaching takes place in Saudi funded mosques and [[madrasas]] across the Islamic world from [[Morocco]] to [[Pakistan]] to [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Our Radical Islamic BFF, Saudi Arabia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/opinion/thomas-friedman-our-radical-islamic-bff-saudi-arabia.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 September 2015 |accessdate=19 September 2015 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Thomas L. |last=Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the educational plan for secondary (high school) education 1435–1438 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]], students enrolling in the "natural sciences" path are required to take five religion subjects which are: [[Tawhid]], [[Fiqh]], [[Tafsir|Tafseer]], [[Hadith|Hadith and Islamic Education]] and Quran. In addition, students are required to take six science subjects which are Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and Computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sa/News/Documents/studiesplan2.pdf |title=Secondary School Studies Plan 1438 Hijri |accessdate=23 September 2015 |website=Saudi Ministry of Education Official Website |publisher=Saudi Ministry of Education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925052557/https://www.moe.gov.sa/News/Documents/studiesplan2.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach taken in the Saudi education system has been accused of encouraging [[Islamic terrorism]], leading to reform efforts.&lt;ref name="Reforming Saudi Education"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2226874/entry/2226875/ Reforming Saudi Education] Slate 7 September. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Eli Lake|date=25 March 2014 |title=U.S. Keeps Saudi Arabia's Worst Secret |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/25/u-s-keeps-saudi-arabia-s-worst-secret.html |work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 9/11 attacks, the government aimed to tackle the twin problems of encouraging extremism and the inadequacy of the country's university education for a modern economy, by slowly modernising the education system through the "Tatweer" reform program.&lt;ref name="Reforming Saudi Education" /&gt; The Tatweer program is reported to have a budget of approximately US$2 billion and focuses on moving teaching away from the traditional Saudi methods of memorization and rote learning towards encouraging students to analyze and problem-solve. It also aims to create an education system which will provide a more secular and vocationally based training.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kinani, Mohammed [http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2008081814710 SR9 billion Tatweer project set to transform education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511114309/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2008081814710 |date=11 May 2011 }}. The Saudi Gazette.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Saudi Arabia ranks 28 worldwide in terms of high-quality research output according to the renowned [[scientific journal]] [[Nature (journal)|Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.natureindex.com/annual-tables/2018/country/all 2018 tables: Countries/territories], www.natureindex.com.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
This makes Saudi Arabia the best performing [[Middle Eastern]], [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] country.

==Early life==

Razin's parents were from the village of Usman Sobakina, {{convert|8|km|mi}} outside of [[Voronezh]]. He was first noted by history in 1661, as part of a [[diplomatic mission]] from the [[Don Cossacks]] to the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]]s. That same year Razin went on a long-distance pilgrimage to the great [[Solovetsky Monastery]] on the [[White Sea]] for the benefit of his soul. After that, all trace of him was lost for six years, when he reappeared as the leader of a [[robber]] community established at Panshinskoye, among the marshes between the rivers Tishina and [[Ilovlya River|Ilovlya]], from whence he levied [[tribute]] from all vessels passing up and down the [[Volga]].

A long war with [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Poland]] in 1654-1667 and [[Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658)|Sweden]] in 1656-1658 put heavy demands upon the people of Russia. [[Tax]]es increased, as did [[conscription]]. Many [[peasant]]s, hoping to escape these burdens, fled south and joined bands of Razin's marauding Cossacks. They were also joined by many others who were disaffected with the Russian government, including people of the lower classes, as well as representatives of non-Russian ethnic groups such as [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]]s, that were being oppressed at the time.

Razin's first considerable exploit was to destroy the great naval [[convoy]] consisting of the [[treasury]] [[barge]]s and the barges of the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarch]] and the wealthy merchants of [[Moscow]]. Razin then sailed down the Volga with a fleet of 35 vessels, capturing the more important [[fort]]s on his way and devastating the country. At the beginning of 1668, he defeated the [[voivode]] Yakov Bezobrazov, sent against him from [[Astrakhan]], and in the spring embarked on a predatory expedition into [[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]], which lasted for eighteen months.

==Background==
[[Image:Razin.jpg|right|thumb|Stepan Razin in a contemporary [[Kingdom of England|English]] engraving]]

Russia began the 17th century with the [[Time of Troubles]], which lasted from 1598 to 1613.  This time marked the end of the [[Rurik dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Romanov dynasty]] (which would eventually end with the [[October Revolution]] and the execution of the last tsar, [[Nicholas II]], and the tsarevich, [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei Nikolaevich]] in 1918). [[Michael Romanov]] (tsar from 1613 to 1645) and his son [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]] (tsar from 1645 to 1676) both strove to strengthen the power of the tsar in order to stabilize the country after the turmoil of the Time of Troubles.  As a result, the [[Zemsky Sobor]] and the [[boyar]] council, two other bodies of government in Russia, slowly lost influence.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=51}}  The Russian population went from fifteen years of "near anarchy"  to the reigns of two strong, centralizing autocrats.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=52}}

In addition, a deep divide existed between the peasantry and the nobility in Russia.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=53}}  Recent changes in the treatment and legal standing of peasants, including the institutionalization of serfdom in the [[Sobornoye Ulozheniye|Law Code of 1649]], contributed to the unrest among the peasantry.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=52}} The [[Cossacks|Don Cossacks]], a lower-class group that lived independently near the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and whom the tsar's government supplied in exchange for defending Russia, led Razin's rebellion.{{sfn|Perrie|2006|p=610}}  Historian [[Paul Avrich]] characterizes Razin's revolt as a "curious mixture of brigandage and revolt," similar to other popular uprisings of the period.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=70}}  Razin revolted against the "traitor-boyars" rather than the tsar.  The Cossacks supported the tsar because they worked for him.{{sfn|Perrie|2006|p=612}}

==Departure from the Don==
{{Cossacks}}
In 1667, Razin gathered a small group of Cossacks and left the Don for an expedition in the Caspian Sea.  He aimed to set up a base in [[Oral, Kazakhstan|Yaitsk]] (now known as Oral, located in Kazakhstan on the Ural River) and plunder villages from there.  However, Moscow learned of Razin's plans and attempted to stop him.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=69}} As Razin traveled down the [[Volga River]] to [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]], the voivodes of Astrakhan warned Andrei Unkovsky (the voivode or governor of Tsaritsyn) of Razin's arrival and recommended that he not allow the Cossacks to enter the town.{{sfn|Soloviev|Smith|1976|p=132}}

Unkovsky attempted to negotiate with Razin, but Razin threatened to set fire to Tsaritsyn if Unkovsky interfered.  When he encountered a group of political prisoners being transported by the tsar's representatives on his way from the Don to the Volga, Razin reportedly said, "I shall not force you to join me, but whoever chooses to come with me will be a free Cossack.  I have come to fight only the boyars and the wealthy lords.  As for the poor and plain folk, I shall treat them as brothers."{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=70}}

When Razin sailed by Tsartisyn, Unkovsky did not attack (possibly either because he felt that Razin posed a threat or because the guards of Tsaritsyn sympathized with Razin's Cossacks).  This incident gave Razin the reputation of an "invincible warrior endowed with supernatural powers."  He continued his travels down the Volga and into the [[Caspian Sea]], defeating several detachments of [[streltsy]], or armed guardsmen.  In July 1667, Razin captured Yaitsk by disguising himself and some of his companions as pilgrims to pray at the cathedral.  Once inside Yaitsk, they opened the gates for the rest of the troops to enter and occupy the city.  The opposition sent to fight Razin felt reluctant to do so because they sympathized with the Cossacks.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=70}}

In the spring of 1668, Razin led the majority of his men down the [[Ural River|Yaik River]] (also known as the Ural River) while a small portion stayed behind to guard Yaitsk.  However, the government defeated Razin's men in Yaitsk and Razin lost his base there.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=72}}

==Persian expedition==
[[Image:surikov1906.jpg|thumb|''Stepan Razin Sailing in the [[Caspian Sea]]'' by [[Vasily Surikov]], 1906.]]

After losing Yaitsk, Razin sailed south down the coast of the Caspian Sea to continue his pillaging.  He and his men then attacked [[Persia]]. Failing to capture the well-defended fortress port of Darband/[[Derbent]] in present-day [[Dagestan]], his forces moved south to attack the small port of Badkuba (present [[Baku]]) located on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] in present-day [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], but at [[Rasht]] (in the southwest Caspian Sea in modern [[Iran]]) the Persians killed roughly 400 Cossacks in a surprise attack.  Razin went to [[Isfahan]] to ask the shah for land in Persia in exchange for loyalty to the shah, but departed on the Caspian for more pillaging before they could reach an agreement.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=72}} Razin arrived in [[Farahabad, Mazandaran|Farahabad]] (on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea in Iran) and masqueraded as a merchant in the city for several days before he and his men pillaged the city for two days.  That winter the Cossacks with Razin fended off starvation and disease on the [[Miankaleh Peninsula]], and in the spring of 1669 Razin built a base on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea and began raiding Turkmen villages.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=73}}  Then in the spring of 1669 he established himself on the isle of Suina, off which, in July, he annihilated a Persian fleet sent against him. Stenka Razin, as he was generally called, had now become a potentate with whom [[prince]]s did not disdain to treat.

In August 1669 he reappeared at Astrakhan and accepted a fresh offer of [[pardon]] from [[Tsar]] [[Aleksey I of Russia|Alexei Mikhailovich]] there; the common people were fascinated by his adventures. The lawless Russian border region of Astrakhan, where the whole atmosphere was predatory and many people were still [[nomad]]ic, was the natural milieu for such a rebellion as Razin's.

In 1670 Razin, while ostensibly on his way to report at the [[Cossack]] [[headquarters]] on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], openly rebelled against the government, capturing [[Cherkassk]] and [[Tsaritsyn]]. After capturing Tsaritsyn, Razin sailed up the Volga with his army of almost 7000 men.  The men traveled toward Cherny Yar, a government stronghold between Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan.  Razin and his men swiftly took Cherny Yar when the Cherny Yar streltsy rose up against their officers and joined the Cossack cause in June 1670.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=82}} On June 24 he reached the city of Astrakhan.  Astrakhan, Moscow's wealthy "window on the East," occupied a strategically important location at the mouth of the Volga River on the shore of the Caspian Sea.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=83}}  Razin plundered the city despite its location on a strongly fortified island and the stone walls and brass cannons that surrounded the central citadel.  The local streltsy's rebellion allowed Razin to gain access to the city.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=84}}

After massacring all who opposed him (including two Princes [[Prozorovsky]]) and giving the rich [[bazaar]]s of the city over to pillage, he converted Astrakhan into a Cossack [[republic]], dividing the population into thousands, hundreds and tens, with their proper officers, all of whom were appointed by a [[veche]] or general assembly, whose first act was to proclaim Razin their ''gosudar'' ([[monarch|sovereign]]).

After a three-week carnival of blood and debauchery, Razin quit Astrakhan with two hundred barges full of troops.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} His aim was to establish the Cossack republic along the whole length of the Volga as a preliminary step towards advancing against Moscow. [[Saratov]] and [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] were captured, but [[Simbirsk]] defied all efforts, and after [[Battle of Simbirsk|two bloody encounters]] close at hand on the banks of the [[Sviyaga River]] (October 1 and 4), Razin was ultimately routed by the army of [[Yuri Baryatinsky]] and fled down the Volga, leaving the bulk of his followers to be extirpated by the victors.

But the rebellion was by no means over. The emissaries of Razin, armed with inflammatory proclamations, had stirred up the inhabitants of the modern governments of [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Tambov]] and [[Penza]], and penetrated even as far as Moscow and [[Novgorod]]. It was not difficult to stir the oppressed population to revolt by promising deliverance from their yoke. Razin proclaimed that his object was to root out the [[boyar]]s and all officials, to level all ranks and dignities, and establish Cossackdom, with its corollary of absolute equality, throughout [[Muscovy]]. 
[[Image:kustodiev razin.jpg|thumb|left|''Stepan Razin on the [[Volga]]'' (by [[Boris Kustodiev]], (1918) State [[Russian Museum]] in [[St Petersburg]].)]]

Even at the beginning of 1671 the outcome of the struggle was doubtful. Eight battles had been fought before the insurrection showed signs of weakening, and it continued for six months after Razin had received his quietus. At Simbirsk his prestige had been shattered. Even his own settlements at Saratov and Samara refused to open their gates to him, and the Don Cossacks, hearing that the [[patriarch of Moscow]] had [[anathema]]tized Razin, also declared against him.  The tsar sent troops to suppress the revolt.  As Paul Avrich notes in ''[[Russian Rebels, 1600–1800]]'', "The brutality of the repressions by far exceeded the atrocities committed by the insurgents."  The tsar's troops mutilated the rebels' bodies and displayed them in public to serve as a warning to potential dissenters.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=109}}

In 1671 Stepan and his brother [[Frol Razin]] were captured at [[Kagalnik fortress]] (Кагальницкий городок) by a Cossack ''[[starshina]]''. They were given over to Tsarist officials in Moscow, and on 6 June 1671, following the announcement of the verdict against him, Stepan Razin was quartered on the scaffold on [[Bolotnaya Square]]. A sentence of death was read aloud: Razin listened to this calmly, then turned to the church, bowed in three directions, passing the Kremlin and the tsar and said: "Forgive me". The executioner then proceeded to first cut off his right hand to his elbow, then his left foot to the knee. His brother [[Frol Razin|Frol]], witnessing Stepan's torment, shouted out: "I know the word and the matter of the sovereign!" (that is, "I am willing to inform upon those disloyal to the tsar").  Stepan shouted back, "Shut up, dog!" These were his last words; after them the executioner hurriedly cut off his head. Razin's hands, legs and head, according to the testimony of the Englishman Thomas Hebdon, were stuck on 5 specially-placed stakes.  The confession helped Frol to postpone his own execution, although five years later, in 1676, he was executed by beheading at the same place in Bolotnaya Square.

==Implications==
Razin originally set out to loot villages, but as he became a symbol of peasant unrest, his movement turned political.{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=116}}  Razin wanted to protect the independence of the Cossacks and to protest an increasingly centralized government.  The Cossacks supported the tsar and autocracy, but they wanted a tsar that responded to the needs of the people and not just those of the upper class.  By destroying and pillaging villages, Razin intended to take power from the government officials and give more autonomy to the peasants.  However, Razin's movement failed and the rebellion led to increased government control.  The Cossacks lost some of their autonomy, and the tsar bonded more closely with the upper class because both feared more rebellion.  On the other hand, as Avrich asserts, "[Razin's revolt] awakened, however dimly, the social consciousness of the poor, gave them a new sense of power, and made the upper class tremble for their lives and possessions."{{sfn|Avrich|1976|p=117}}

At the time of the [[Russian Civil War]], the famous writer and [[White emigre]] [[Ivan Bunin]] compared Razin to Bolshevik leaders, writing "Good God! What striking similarity there is between the time of Sten'ka and the pillaging that is going on today in the name of the '[[Third International]].'"{{sfn|Bunin|1998|p=246}}

==In Russian-language culture and folklore==
{{listen|filename=Stenka Razine Chaliapine.ogg|title=''Stenka Razine''|description=Folksong about Stenka Razin performed by [[Feodor Ivanovich Chaliapin]]}}
Razin is the subject of a [[Stenka Razin (Glazunov)|symphonic poem]] by [[Alexander Glazunov]], Symphony no. 8 by Myaskovsky (op. 26, 1925), a cantata by [[Shostakovich, op. 119]]; ''[[The Execution of Stepan Razin]]'' (1964), a poem by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and a novel, ''{{ill|I Have Come To Give You Freedom|ru|Я пришёл дать вам волю}}'', (Я пришёл дать вам волю)  by [[Vasily Shukshin]].

{{anchor|Song}}Stenka Razin is the hero of a popular [[Russian language|Russian]] [[folk song]], ''Ponizovaya Volnitsa'', better known by the words ''Volga, Volga mat' rodnaya'', ''Iz za ostrova na strezhen'', and, simply, ''Stenka Razin''. The words were written by [[Dmitri Sadovnikov]] (Дмитрий Николаевич Садовников) in 1883; the music is folk. The song gave the title to the famous Soviet musical comedy ''[[Volga-Volga]]''. The melody was used by [[Tom Springfield]] in the song "[[The Carnival Is Over]]" that placed [[The Seekers]] at #1 in 1965 in [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The lyrics of the song were dramatized in one of the very first Russian narrative films, ''[[Stenka Razin (film)|Stenka Razin]]'' directed by [[Vladimir Romashkov]] in 1908. The film lasts about 10 minutes. The screenplay was written by [[Vasily Goncharov]], and the music (the first film music to be specially written to accompany a silent film) was by [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]].

A version of this song is also performed by [[Doukhobors]] in Canada.{{sfn|Gritchen}}

The '''Uniform Parental Rights, Enforcement and Protection Act''' (UPREPA) was developed in September 2000 as a petition to the United States, and to several of the individual states. It is founded upon the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. The purpose of the reform was to guarantee that a child's rights to equal contact with each parent were protected by Federal law. The UPREPA would eliminate the concepts of custody and visitation.

This is a model legislation proposal, similar to the model legislation that has been proposed for tort reform, contract law, and criminal law. The act has been proposed to each of the fifty states of the United States of America, along with federal oversight requirements similar to that proposed, passed and enacted under the UCCJA - Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.

'''Verso Books''' (formerly '''New Left Books''') is a publishing house based in London and New York City, founded in 1970 by the staff of ''[[New Left Review]]''.

==Renaming, new brand and logo==

Verso Books was originally known as New Left Books. The name "Verso" refers to the technical term for the left-hand page in a book (see [[recto and verso]]), and is a play on words regarding its political outlook and also reminds of the [[vice versa]] - "the other way around".

==History and details==
The publisher gained early recognition for translations of books by European thinkers, especially those from the [[Frankfurt School]].

Verso Books' best-selling title is the autobiography of [[Rigoberta Menchú]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=about&gt;Verso Books, [http://www.versobooks.com/pg/about-verso About Verso]&lt;/ref&gt;

Verso Books titles are distributed in the United States by [[Random House]].

On April 8, 2014 Verso began bundling [[DRM-free]] e-books with print purchases made through its website. Verso's managing director Jacob Stevens stated that he expected the new offer on the Verso website to contribute £200,000 to the publisher's revenue in its first year helping to "shake up how publishers relate to their readership, and help to support independent publishing".&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/e-bookprint-bundling-venture-verso|title=E-book/print bundling venture from Verso |publisher=thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Berry was the first of four children born to John Marshall Berry, a lawyer and tobacco farmer in [[Henry County, Kentucky]], and Virginia Erdman Berry. The families of both parents had farmed in Henry County for at least five generations. Berry attended secondary school at [[Millersburg Military Institute]] and then earned a B.A. (1956) and M.A. (1957) in English at the [[University of Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=PWNS-2018/&gt;{{rp|990–991}} In 1956, at the University of Kentucky he met another Kentucky writer-to-be, [[Gurney Norman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://community.berea.edu/appalachianheritage/issues/summer2005/conversation.html |title=My Conversation with Gurney Norman |first=Wendell |last=Berry |publisher= |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his M.A. and married Tanya Amyx in 1957. In 1958, he attended [[Stanford University]]'s creative writing program as a [[Wallace Stegner]] Fellow, studying under Stegner in a seminar that included [[Larry McMurtry]], [[Robert Stone (novelist)|Robert Stone]], [[Ernest Gaines]], [[Tillie Olsen]], and [[Ken Kesey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Menand |first=Louis |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=4 |title=Show or Tell: A Critic at Large: The New Yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angyal-1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Angyal|first=Andrew|title=Wendell Berry|location=New York|publisher=Twayne|year=1995|isbn=0-8057-4628-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|139}} Berry's first novel, ''Nathan Coulter'', was published in April 1960.

A [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] Fellowship took Berry and his family to Italy and France in 1961, where he came to know [[Wallace Fowlie]], critic and translator of French literature. From 1962 to 1964, he taught English at [[New York University]]'s University Heights campus in [[the Bronx]]. In 1964, he began teaching creative writing at the [[University of Kentucky]], from which he resigned in 1977.&lt;ref name="Angyal-1995" /&gt; During this time in Lexington, he came to know author [[Guy Davenport]], as well as author and monk [[Thomas Merton]] and photographer [[Ralph Eugene Meatyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davenport |first=Guy |chapter=Tom and Gene |title=Father Louie: Photographs of Thomas Merton by Ralph Eugene Meatyard |location=New York |publisher=Timken |year=1991 |isbn=978-0943221090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1965, Berry, his wife, and his two children moved to a farm that he had purchased, Lane's Landing, and began growing corn and small grains on what eventually became a homestead of about 117 acres (0.47&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=PWNS-2018&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wendell Berry: Port William Novels &amp; Stories, The Civil War to World War II|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Library of America|year=2018|isbn=9781598535549|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|994}} They bought their first flock of seven Border Cheviot sheep in 1978.&lt;ref name=PWNS-2018/&gt;{{rp|998}} Lane's Landing is in [[Henry County, Kentucky]] in north central Kentucky near [[Port Royal, Kentucky|Port Royal]], and his parents' birthplaces, and is on the western bank of the [[Kentucky River]], not far from where it flows into the [[Ohio River]]. Berry has farmed, resided, and written at Lane's Landing ever since. He has written about his early experiences on the land and about his decision to return to it in essays such as "The Long-Legged House" and "A Native Hill."&lt;ref&gt;Both were published in ''The Long-Legged House.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1969 (Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, 2004). {{ISBN|9781593760137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and the early 1980s, he edited and wrote for the [[Rodale Press]], including its publications ''Organic Gardening and Farming'' and ''The New Farm''. From 1987 to 1993, he returned to the English Department of the University of Kentucky.&lt;ref name="Angyal-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quiviracoalition.org/images/category/459-2007Conference_Program_Web.pdf |title=The Quivira Coalition's 6th Annual Conference |page=14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203130354/http://quiviracoalition.org/images/category/459-2007Conference_Program_Web.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry has written at least twenty-five books (or [[chapbook]]s) of poems, sixteen volumes of essays, and eleven novels and short story collections. His writing is grounded in the notion that one's work ought to be rooted in and responsive to one's place.

Berry, who describes himself as "a person who takes the Gospel seriously,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/wendell-berry/ |title=The Brian Lehrer Show |publisher=WNYC.org |date=October 17, 2013 |quote=I'm not a Baptist in any formal way.

Berry is a fellow of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Temenos Academy]], a learned society devoted to the study of all faiths and spiritual pursuits; Berry publishes frequently in the annual ''[[Temenos Academy Review]]'', funded by the [[Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.temenosacademy.org/temenos_key_individuals.html |title=Key Individuals of The Temenos Academy |work=Temenosacademy.org |date=2009 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
On February 10, 1968, Berry delivered "A Statement Against the War in Vietnam" during the Kentucky Conference on the War and the Draft at the [[University of Kentucky]] in Lexington:&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. ''The Long-Legged House.'' Washington, D.C.: Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, 2004. p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We seek to preserve peace by fighting a war, or to advance freedom by subsidizing dictatorships, or to 'win the hearts and minds of the people' by poisoning their crops and burning their villages and confining them in concentration camps; we seek to uphold the 'truth' of our cause with lies, or to answer conscientious dissent with threats and slurs and intimidations. . . . I have come to the realization that I can no longer imagine a war that I would believe to be either useful or necessary. I would be against any war.&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite web |last=Vance |first=Laurence |date=December 4, 2006 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance98.html |title=Bill Kauffman: American Anarchist |work=[[LewRockwell.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On June 3, 1979, Berry engaged in nonviolent [[civil disobedience]] against the construction of a [[Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant at Marble Hill, Indiana]]. He describes "this nearly eventless event" and expands upon his reasons for it in the essay "The Reactor and the Garden."&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. ''The Gift of Good Land.'' Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2009. pp.161–170&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2003, Berry's essay titled "A Citizen's Response to the National Security Strategy of the United States" was published as a full-page advertisement in ''The New York Times''. Berry opened the essay—a critique of the [[George W. Bush|G. W.

On January 4, 2009, Berry and [[Wes Jackson]], president of [[Land Institute|The Land Institute]], published an op-ed article in ''The New York Times'' titled "A 50-Year Farm Bill."&lt;ref name="nytimes2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05berry.html |last1=Jackson |first1=Wes  |first2=Wendell |last2=Berry |title=A 50-Year Farm Bill |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 5, 2009 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 Berry, Jackson and Fred Kirschenmann, of The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, gathered in Washington DC to promote this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/21/AR2009072100645.html |title=Q&amp;A: Changing Farming's Uncertain Future |date=July 22, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry and Jackson wrote, "We need a 50-year farm bill that addresses forthrightly the problems of soil loss and degradation, toxic pollution, fossil-fuel dependency and the destruction of rural communities."&lt;ref name="nytimes2009"/&gt;

Also in January 2009, Berry released a statement against the death penalty, which began, "As I am made deeply uncomfortable by the taking of a human life before birth, I am also made deeply uncomfortable by the taking of a human life after birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danzigusa.blogspot.com/2009/01/wendell-berry-makes-public-statement-on.html |title=Wendell Berry Makes Public Statement on the Death Penalty |date=January 29, 2009 |work=Danzig U.S.A. |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in November 2009, Berry and 38 other writers from Kentucky wrote to [[Steve Beshear|Gov. Steve Beshear]] and [[Jack Conway (politician)|Attorney General Jack Conway]] asking them to impose a moratorium on the death penalty in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kcadp.org/2009/11/25/kentucky-writers-urge-moratorium-on-death-penalty/ |title=Kentucky writers urge moratorium on death penalty |date=November 25, 2009 |work=Kentucky Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2009, Berry joined over 2,000 others in non-violently blocking the gates to a coal-fired power plant in Washington, D.C. No one was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/3/headlines#5 |title=Climate Activists Block Gates to D.C.

On May 22, 2009, Berry, at a listening session in Louisville, spoke against the [[National Animal Identification System]] (NAIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc2xTRww3WE |title=NAIS Comments}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "If you impose this program on the small farmers, who are already overburdened, you're going to have to send the police for me. I'm 75 years old. I've about completed my responsibilities to my family. I'll lose very little in going to jail in opposition to your program – and I'll have to do it. Because I will be, in every way that I can conceive of, a non-cooperator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodrenegade.com/wendell-berry-picks-jail-over-nais/ |title=Wendell Berry Picks Jail Over NAIS |first=Kristen |last=Michaelis |work=Food Renegade |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Berry combined with "the Berea-based Kentucky Environmental Foundation (KEF), along with several other non-profit organizations and rural electric co-op members" to petition against and protest the construction of a coal-burning power plant in [[Clark County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://richmondregister.com/localnews/x546340377/Local-group-joins-protest-of-coal-burning-power-plant |title=Local group joins protest of coal-burning power plant |first=Ronica |last=Shannon |date=November 7, 2009 |newspaper=[[Richmond Register]] |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2011, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved the cancellation of this power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://migration.kentucky.gov/Newsroom/psc/pscpr2-28-2011.htm |title=PSC approves EKPC request to cancel power plant |first=Andrew |last=Melnykovych |work=Commonwealth of Kentucky |date=February 28, 2011 |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2009, due to the University of Kentucky's close association with coal interests in the state, Berry removed his papers from the university. He explained to the Lexington Herald-Leader, "I don't think the University of Kentucky can be so ostentatiously friendly to the coal industry … and still be a friend to me and the interests for which I have stood for the last 45 years. … If they love the coal industry that much, I have to cancel my friendship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kentucky.com/2010/06/23/1319383_wendell-berry-pulling-his-personal.html?rh=1 |title=Wendell Berry pulling his personal papers from UK |first=Cheryl |last=Truman |date=June 23, 2010 |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the papers were donated to The Kentucky Historical Society in Frankfort, KY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kentucky.com/2012/08/15/2300331/author-wendell-berry-donates-papers.html |title=Author Wendell Berry donates papers to Kentucky Historical Society |first=Cheryl |last=Truman |date=August 15, 2012 |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2010, Berry participated in a rally in Louisville during an EPA hearing on how to manage coal ash. Berry said, "The EPA knows that coal ash is poison. We ask it only to believe in its own findings on this issue, and do its duty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irjci.blogspot.com/2010/09/environmentalists-and-industry.html |title=Environmentalists and industry supporters turn out for Louisville coal ash hearing |first=Jon |last=Hale |date=September 29, 2010 |work=The Rural Blog |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry, with 14 other protesters, spent the weekend of February 12, 2011 locked in the Kentucky governor's office to demand an end to [[mountaintop removal mining|mountaintop removal coal mining]]. He was part of the environmental group [[Kentuckians for the Commonwealth]] that began their sit-in on Friday and left at midday Monday to join about 1,000 others in a mass outdoor rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/2/14/headlines/opponents_on_mountaintop_removal_occupy_kentucky_governors_office |title=Opponents of Mountaintop Removal Coal Mining Occupy Kentucky Governor's Office |date=February 14, 2011 |work=Democracy Now! |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article44079546.html |title=Sit-in at Kentucky governor's office ends with 'I Love Mountains' rally |first=John |last=Cheves |work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]] |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Berry Center was established at [[New Castle, Kentucky]], "for the purpose of bringing focus, knowledge and cohesiveness to the work of changing our ruinous industrial agriculture system into a system and culture that uses nature as the standard, accepts no permanent damage to the ecosphere, and takes into consideration human health in local communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berrycenter.org/ |title=The Berry Center |work=berrycenter.org |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Berry's [[nonfiction]] serves as an extended conversation about the life he values. According to him, the good life includes sustainable agriculture, [[appropriate technology|appropriate technologies]], healthy rural [[community|communities]], connection to place, the pleasures of good food, [[husbandry]], good work, local economics, the [[miracle]] of life, fidelity, [[frugality]], reverence, and the interconnectedness of life. The threats Berry finds to this good [[simple living|simple life]] include: [[industrial farming]] and the industrialization of life, ignorance, hubris, greed, violence against others and against the [[nature|natural world]], the eroding [[topsoil]] in the United States, [[globalization|global economics]], and [[Natural environment|environmental destruction]]. As a prominent defender of agrarian values, Berry's appreciation for traditional farming techniques, such as those of the [[Amish]], grew in the 1970s, due in part to exchanges with ''Draft Horse Journal'' publisher [[Maurice Telleen]]. Berry has long been friendly to and supportive of [[Wes Jackson]], believing that Jackson's agricultural research at The [[Land Institute]] lives out the promise of "solving for pattern" and using "nature as model."

Author [[Rod Dreher]] writes that Berry's "unshakable devotion to the land, to [[Localism (politics)|localism]], and to the dignity of traditional life makes him both a great American and, to the disgrace of our age, a prophet without honor in his native land."&lt;ref name=Dreher&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/all-american-anarchists/ |title=All-American Anarchists |first=Rod |last=Dreher |authorlink=Rod Dreher |work=[[The American Conservative]] |date=June 5, 2006 |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Bill Kauffman]] argues that "Among the tragedies of contemporary politics is that Wendell Berry, as a man of place, has no place in a national political discussion that is framed by [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] and [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]."&lt;ref name=Dreher /&gt; Historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]] calls Berry "the environmental writer who has most thoughtfully tried to come to terms with labor" and "one of the few environmental writers who takes work seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Richard |chapter='Are You an Environmentalist or Do You Work for a Living?': Work and Nature |title=Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature |editor-first=William |editor-last=Cronon |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=9780393038729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "''Solving for pattern''", coined by Berry in his essay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berry |first=Wendell |title=The Gift of Good Land: Further Essays Cultural and Agricultural |location=San Francisco |publisher=North Point |year=1981 |isbn=0-86547-052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same title, is the process of finding solutions that solve multiple problems, while minimizing the creation of new problems. The essay was originally published in the [[Rodale Press]] periodical ''The New Farm''. Though Mr. Berry's use of the phrase was in direct reference to agriculture, it has since come to enjoy broader use throughout the design community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156584/ |title=The designer's challenge |first=David |last=Orr |work=eoearth.org |date=April 16, 2008 |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.di.net/articles/solving-for-pattern-development-of-place-building-design-models/ |title=Solving for Pattern: Development of Place-Building Design Models |first=Stephen |last=Luoni |work=DesignIntelligence |date=December 21, 2005 |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry's core ideas, and in particular his poem "Sabbaths III (Santa Clara Valley)," guided the 2007 documentary feature film ''[[The Unforeseen (film)|The Unforeseen]]'', produced by [[Terrence Malick]] and [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref&gt;The poem has been published only in the limited edition chapbook ''Sabbaths 1987''. (Monterey, Kentucky: Larkspur, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  The film's director [[Laura Dunn (film director)|Laura Dunn]] stated, "We are of course most grateful to Mr. Berry for sharing his inspired work – his poem served as a guide post for me throughout this, at times meandering, project."&lt;ref&gt;[http://streams.twobirdsfilm.com/2007/07/09/wendell-berrys-poem-santa-clara-valley/ Wendell Berry's poem "Santa Clara Valley" ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427190543/http://streams.twobirdsfilm.com/2007/07/09/wendell-berrys-poem-santa-clara-valley/ |date=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry appears in the film narrating his own poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/the-unforeseen-1200510729/ |title=The Unforeseen |first=Robert |last=Koehler |date=January 30, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn went on to make the 2016 documentary feature ''Look &amp; See: A Portrait of Wendell Berry'', again produced by Malick and Redford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2017/02_programm_2017/02_Filmdatenblatt_2017_201711861.php#tab=video |title=Look &amp; See: A Portrait of Wendell Berry |publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |date=2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==

Berry's [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poetry often appears as a contemporary [[eclogue]], [[pastoral]], or [[elegy]]; but he also composes dramatic and historical [[Narrative poetry|narratives]] (such as "Bringer of Water"&lt;ref&gt;''Farming: A Hand Book''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; and "July, 1773",&lt;ref&gt;''A Part''. San Francisco: North Point, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively) and occasional and discursive poems ("Against the War in Vietnam"&lt;ref&gt;''Openings''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Some Further Words",&lt;ref&gt;''Given: New Poems''. Washington D. C.: Shoemaker &amp; Hoard. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively).

Berry's first published poetry book consisted of a single poem, the elegiac ''November Twenty Six Nineteen Hundred Sixty Three'' (1964), initiated and illustrated by [[Ben Shahn]], commemorating the death of [[John F. Kennedy]]. It begins,

&lt;poem&gt;We know
The winter earth
Upon the body
Of the young
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;President,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And the early dark
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Falling;&lt;/poem&gt;

and continues through ten more stanzas (each propelled by the [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]] of "We know"). The elegiac here and elsewhere, according to Triggs, enables Berry to characterize the connections "that link past and future generations through their common working of the land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/46714/PDF/1/ |title=Moving the Dark to Wholeness: The Elegies of Wendell Berry |first=Jeffery A. |last=Triggs |work=Rutgers University Libraries |year=1988 |accessdate=August 22, 2015 |doi=10.7282/T3QZ2CQ0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full-length collection, ''The Broken Ground'' (1964), develops many of Berry's fundamental concerns: "the cycle of life and death, responsiveness to place, pastoral subject matter, and recurring images of the Kentucky River and the hill farms of north-central Kentucky"&lt;ref name="Angyal-1995"/&gt;{{RP|119}}

According to Angyal, "There is little modernist formalism or postmodernist experimentation in [Berry's] verse."&lt;ref name="Angyal-1995"/&gt;{{RP|116}} A commitment to the reality and primacy of the actual world stands behind these two rejections. In "Notes: Unspecializing Poetry," Berry writes, "Devotion to order that is not poetical prevents the specialization of poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. ''Standing by Words''. San Francisco: North Point, 1983, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to note, "Nothing exists for its own sake, but for a harmony greater than itself which includes it. A work of art, which accepts this condition, and exists upon its terms, honors the Creation, and so becomes a part of it" &lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. ''Standing by Words''. San Francisco: North Point, 1983, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lionel Basney]] placed Berry's poetry within a tradition of [[Didacticism|didactic poetry]] that stretches back to [[Horace]]: "To say that Berry's poetry can be didactic, then, means that it envisions a specific wisdom, and also the traditional sense of art and culture that gives art the task of teaching this wisdom"&lt;ref&gt;Basney, Lionel. 175. "Five Notes on the Didactic Tradition, in Praise of Wendell Berry" in Paul Merchant, editor. ''Wendell Berry'' (American Authors Series). Lewiston, Idaho: Confluence, 1991. pp.174–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berry, poetry exists "at the center of a complex reminding"&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. "The Responsibility of the Poet." ''What Are People For?'' New York: North Point, 1990. p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the poet and the reader are reminded of the poem's crafted language, of the poem's formal literary antecedents, of  "what is remembered or ought to be remembered," and of "the formal integrity of other works, creatures and structures of the world.".&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. "The Responsibility of the Poet." ''What Are People For?'' New York: North Point, 1990. p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Sabbath Poems ===
From 1979 to the present Berry has been writing what he calls "[[Sabbath]] poems." They were first collected in ''A Timbered Choir: The Sabbath Poems 1979-1997''. This was followed by Sabbaths from 1998 to 2004 in ''Given: New Poems''; and those from 2005 to 2008 are in ''Leavings''. All Sabbath poems through 2012 are published in ''This Day: New and Collected Sabbath Poems 1979 - 2012''. ''Sabbaths 2013'' has been published by [[Larkspur Press]]. ''A Small Porch'' contains nine Sabbath poems from 2014 and sixteen from 2015. One Sabbath poem, "What Passes, What Remains" (VIII from 2016), is published as the epilogue in ''The Art of Loading Brush''. That poem, along with fourteen others, can also be found in ''Sabbaths 2016'', published by Larkspur Press.

The poems are motivated by Berry's longtime habit of walking out onto the land on Sunday mornings. As he puts it, "I go free from the tasks and intentions of my workdays, and so my mind becomes hospitable to unintended thoughts: to what I am very willing to call inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Day: Collected and New Sabbath Poems|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61902-198-3|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes in a poem from 1979,
&lt;poem&gt;The bell calls in the town 
Where forebears cleared the shaded land
And brought high daylight down
To shine on field and trodden road.
I hear, but understand
Contrarily, and walk into the woods.
I leave labor and load,
Take up a different story.
I keep an inventory
Of wonders and of uncommercial goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Day: Collected &amp; New Sabbath Poems|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61902-198-3|location=Berkeley|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;The Sabbath poems have been described as "written from a particular place and on particular Sabbaths, and so should be read as part of a spiritual practice and as poems, in some sense, devoted to dwelling, to living thoughtfully in one place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Marc|date=Winter 2015|title=Instantaneous and Eternal: Wendell Berry's Sabbath Poems|url=|journal=Sewanee Review|volume=123|pages=182–191|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oehlschlaeger links Berry's project to a key observation by [[Henry David Thoreau]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Thoreau continues in '[[Life Without Principle]],' he notes the constant busyness of Americans, so engaged in 'infinite bustle' that 'there is no sabbath.' And he notes later that 'there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself, than this incessant business.' The logic is clear: destruction of the Sabbath is contrary to 'life itself.' That, I suggest, is the context in which we should read the Sabbath poems that Berry has been writing for nearly the last thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Achievement of Wendell Berry: The Hard History of Love|last=Oehlschlaeger|first=Fritz|publisher=U P of Kentucky|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8131-3007-1|location=Lexington, KY|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fiction==

Berry's fiction to date consists of eight novels and fifty-one short stories (forty-three of which are collected in ''That Distant Land'', 2004 and ''A Place in Time'', 2012) which, when read as a whole, form a chronicle of the fictional small Kentucky town of [[Port William, Kentucky|Port William]]. Because of his long-term, ongoing exploration of the life of an imagined place, Berry has been compared to [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Janet. ''The Unforeseen Self in the Works of Wendell Berry.'' University of Missouri Press, 2001. p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, although Port William is no stranger to murder, suicide, alcoholism, marital discord, and the full range of losses that touch human lives, it lacks the extremes of characterization and plot development that are found in much of Faulkner. Hence Berry is sometimes described as working in an idealized, pastoral, or nostalgic mode, a characterization of his work which he resists: "If your work includes a criticism of history, which mine certainly does, you can't be accused of wanting to go back to something, because you're saying that what we were wasn't good enough." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/218/field-observations |title=Field Observations: An Interview with Wendell Berry |first=Jordan |last=Fisher-Smith |work=The Sun Magazine |year=1994 |accessdate=December 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of profound shifts in the agricultural practices of the United States, and the disappearance of traditional agrarian life,&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, Willard Wesley. The Development of American Agriculture: A Historical Analysis. University of Minnesota Press, 1993. pp.122–149.&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the major concerns of the Port William fiction, though the theme is often only a background or subtext to the stories themselves. The Port William fiction attempts to portray, on a local scale, what "a human economy … conducted with reverence"&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wendell. "Imagination in Place."  ''The Way of Ignorance.'' Washington, D. C.: Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, 2005. p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;  looked like in the past—and what civic, domestic, and personal virtues might be evoked by such an economy were it pursued today. Social as well as seasonal changes mark the passage of time. The Port William stories allow Berry to explore the human dimensions of the decline of the family farm and farm community, under the influence of expanding post-[[World War II]] agribusiness. But these works rarely fall into simple didacticism, and are never merely tales of decline. Each is grounded in a realistic depiction of character and community. In ''A Place on Earth'' (1967), for example, farmer Mat Feltner comes to terms with the loss of his only son, Virgil. In the course of the novel, we see how not only Mat but the entire community wrestles with the acute costs of World War II.

Berry's fiction also allows him to explore the literal and metaphorical implications of [[marriage]] as that which binds individuals, families, and communities to each other and to Nature itself—yet not all of Port William is happily or conventionally married. "Old Jack" Beechum struggles with significant incompatibilities with his wife, and with a brief yet fulfilling extramarital affair. The barber Jayber Crow lives with a forlorn, secret, and unrequited love for a woman, believing himself "mentally" married to her even though she knows nothing about it. Burley Coulter never formalizes his bond with Kate Helen Branch, the mother of his son. Yet, each of these men find themselves firmly bound up in the community, the "membership," of Port William.

Of his fictional project, Berry has written: "I have made the imagined town of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, in an attempt to honor the actual place where I have lived. By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, I have learned to see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it."&lt;ref&gt;"Imagination in Place" in ''Imagination in Place''. Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2010. p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Berry has said, "The only thing I try to accomplish in fiction is to show how people act when they love each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Memory of Old Jack by Wendell Berry: A Review |work=Above the Fray |date=December 2, 2014 |url=http://www.deanabbott.com/the-memory-of-old-jack-by-wendell-berry-a-review/ |first=Dean |last=Abbott |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The novels and stories can be read in any order.

In January, 2018, the [[Library of America]] published a volume of Berry's fiction—the first of a projected four volumes. ''Wendell Berry: Port William Novels &amp; Stories (The Civil War to World War II)'' contains four novels and twenty-three short stories in chronological order according to the stories' events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://loa.org/books/567-port-william-novels-stories-the-civil-war-to-world-war-ii|title=Wendell Berry: Port William Novels &amp; Stories (The Civil War to World War II)|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of America|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[W.

===''Nathan Coulter'' (1960)===
In Berry's first novel, young Nathan "comes of age" through dealing with the death of his mother, the depression of his father Jared, the rugged companionship of his brother Tom, and the mischief of his uncle Burley. ''Kirkus Review'' concludes, "A sensitive adolescent theme is handled rather poetically, but so uniform in tone that no drama is generated and no sense of time passing is felt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/wendell-berry-6/nathan-coulter/ |title="Nathan Coulter" by Wendell Berry |work=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Ditsky finds William Faulkner's influence in ''Nathan Coulter'', but notes, "Not only does the work avoid the pitfalls encountered by Faulkner's initial attempts to escape his postage stamp of native soil, but Nathan Coulter also seems a wise attempt to get that autobiographical first novel out of one's system, and to do so [with] honesty."&lt;ref&gt;John Ditsky, "Farming Kentucky: The Fiction of Wendell Berry," Hollins Critic 31, no. 1 (1994), https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-130929492/farming-kentucky-the-fiction-of-wendell-berry.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Place on Earth'' (1967/1983)===
Set in the critical year of 1945, this novel focuses on farmer Mat Feltner's struggle over the news that his son Virgil has been listed as missing in action while also telling multiple tales of the lives of other Port William residents, such as Burley Coulter, Jack Beechum, Ernest Finley, Ida and Gideon Crop. Reprinting by North Point Press in 1983 allowed Berry to radically revise the novel,&lt;ref&gt;"Author's Note", ''A Place on Earth''. Berkeley: Counterpoint, 1999. p.xi.&lt;/ref&gt; removing almost a third of its original length. Jeffrey Bilbro believes that these substantial changes marked growth in Berry's approach. "In Berry's revised edition, his technique caught up with his subject. He allows us, as readers, to participate in the ignorance of his characters, and in doing so, we may be able to understand more fully the painful difficulty of choosing fidelity to the natural order while living in the midst of mystery." &lt;ref&gt;"A Form for Living in the Midst of Loss: Faithful Marriage in the Revisions of Wendell Berry's ''A Place on Earth''" by Jeffrey Bilbro in ''The Southern Literary Journal'', Spring 2010 https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-228995624/a-form-for-living-in-the-midst-of-loss-faithful-marriage&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Memory of Old Jack''  (1974)===
This third novel of Port William begins with Jack Beechum as a very old man in 1952 and continues back into his youth and maturity to uncover his life and work as a dedicated farmer, conflicted husband, and living link to past generations. The story ranges from the Civil War to just past World War II. Josh Hurst comments on Berry's ability to avoid certain narrative pitfalls, "Jack's story could be presented us either as heroic ballad or as cautionary [tale]—and there is much in his life to support both admiration and gentle tisk-tisking—but the gift of this book is how it allows a man's memories to wash over us as though unshaped by narrative or conscious editorializing." &lt;ref&gt;"A Fiction of Remembering: Wendell Berry and The Memory of Old Jack" http://cahootsmag.com/2015/01/a-fiction-of-remembering-wendell-berry-and-the-memory-of-old-jack/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Remembering'' (1988)===
In Berry's fourth novel, an adult Andy Catlett wanders through San Francisco remembering, but feeling alienated from, his native Port William. He struggles to come to terms with himself, his marriage, his farm, and the distorted values of American society. Of Berry's vision here, Charles Solomon writes, "Wendell Berry contrasts modern American agribusiness--which he depicts as an artificial conglomeration of sterile flow charts, debts and mechanization--with the older ideal of farming as a nurturing way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-16/books/bk-1082_1_wendell-berry|title=REMEMBERING By Wendell Berry (North Point Press: $7.95)|first=CHARLES|last=SOLOMON|date=September 16, 1990|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But along these lines, Bruce Bawer finds a problem with the novel, "Here, for the first time in a Port William novel, Berry seems more interested in communicating opinions than in portraying sympathetic characters in plausible situations; the opening episode, set at a conference on agricultural policy, paints the ideological conflict between Andy and his adversaries in broad, unsubtle strokes." &lt;ref&gt;"Membership &amp; memory: A review of ''Fidelity'' by Wendell Berry" by Bruce Bawer http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Membership---memory-4642&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A World Lost'' (1996)===
Young Andy Catlett's uncle Andrew had been murdered back in 1944, and now an adult Andy is reconstructing the event and its aftermath. "Looking back with a mixture of a young boy's incomprehension and an older man's nostalgia, Andy evokes the past not as a narrative but as a series of disembodied fragments in the flow of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/books/books-in-brief-fiction-072109.html |title=A World Lost |first=Tobin |last=Harshaw |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 1996 |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this fifth novel of Port William, Berry considers the violence of men and its impact on the family and community that must come to terms with it. "Berry shows us the psychic costs of misplaced family pride and social rigidity, and yet he also celebrates the benevolent blessing of familial love. This is simple, soul-satisfying storytelling, augmented by understated humor and quiet insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-887178-22-8 |title=Fiction Book Review: "A World Lost" by Wendell Berry |work=PublishersWeekly.com |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jayber Crow'' (2000)===
Port William's barber recounts his life's journey in Berry's sixth novel. Jayber's early life as an orphan near Port William is followed by studies towards a possible vocation to Church ministry. A questioning mind, however, sends him in other directions until he finds himself back in Port William with an ever-growing commitment to that place and its people. As ''Publisher's Weekly'' notes, "Crow's life, which begins as WWI is about to erupt, is emblematic of a century of upheaval, and Berry's anecdotal and episodic tale sounds a challenge to contemporary notions of progress. It is to Berry's credit that a novel so freighted with ideas and ideology manages to project such warmth and luminosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-58243-029-4 |title=Fiction Book Review: "Jayber Crow" by Wendell Berry |work=PublishersWeekly.com |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hannah Coulter'' (2004)===
Berry's seventh novel presents a concise vision of Port William's "membership." The story encompasses Hannah's life, including the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], the postwar industrialization of agriculture, the flight of youth to urban employment, and the consequent remoteness of grandchildren. The tale is told in the voice of an old woman twice widowed, who has experienced much loss yet has never been defeated. Somehow, lying at the center of her strength is the "membership"—the fact that people care for each other and, even in absence, hold each other in a kind of presence. All in all, ''Hannah Coulter'' embodies many of the themes of Berry's Port William saga.

===''Andy Catlett: Early Travels'' (2006)===
Andy Catlett, age nine, makes his first solo journey to visit with both sets of grandparents in Port William. ''The New York Times'' reviewer notes, "What the grown-up Andy recalls of that experience is transformed into 'a sort of homage' to a now-vanished world. Title characters from Berry's earlier Port William volumes — Jayber Crow, Old Jack, Hannah Coulter — appear here in affectionate cameos as the adult Andy, echoing Wordsworth, observes that 'in my memory, all who were there ... seem now to be gathered into a love that is at once a boy's and an aging man's.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Hoffman |title=Boy on the Bus |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 28, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Hoffman.t.html?_r=0 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth activism''' is youth engagement in [[community organizing]] for [[social change]].

==Overview==
{{POV section|date=November 2013}} 
Young people are often underrepresented in politics because adults dominate the discourse. However, many youth are concerned and informed citizens who can advocate for change within their communities.&lt;ref name="Youth Activism: Volume 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrod|first=Lonnie R|title=Youth activism: an international encyclopedia, Volume 2|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth is an elastic category, the age at which it begins and ends varies within cultural contexts, but it is often a very distinct stage in a person’s life to which particular issues or policies are highly relevant. These may include politics, health,  and social issues.&lt;ref name="Beyond Resistance"&gt;{{cite book|last=Noguera|first=Pedro|title=Beyond Resistance! Youth Activism and Community Change: New Democratic Possibilities for Practice and Policy for America's Youth|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociopolitical development is a "psychological process that covers the range of cognitions, skills, attitudes, worldviews, and emotions that support social and political action" (Watts, Griffith, &amp; Abdul-Adil, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Watts, R. J., Griffith, D. M., &amp; Abdul-Adil, J. (1999). Sociopolitical Development as an Antidote for Oppression—Theory and Action. American Journal of Community Psychology, 27(2), 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of SPD was further defined by Watts &amp; Flannagan "to impact young people’s social analysis, worldview and sense of agency and to provide them opportunity structures and support towards their societal involvement behavior (2007)."&lt;ref&gt;Watts, R.

Social activism is the predominant form of youth activism today, as millions of young people around the world participate in social activism that is organized, informed, led, and assessed by adults. Many efforts, including [[education reform]], [[children's rights]], and [[Reform movement|government reform]] call on youth to participate this way, often called [[youth voice]]. [[Youth council]]s are an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Chawla, L. (2002) Growing Up in an Urbanizing World. Paris/London: Earthscan/UNESCO Publishing.{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth-driven activism requires young people to be the primary movers within an adult-led movement. Such is the case with the Sierra Club, where youth compel their peers to join and become active in the environmental movement. This is also true of many organizations that were founded by youth who became adults, such as [[Student Environmental Action Coalition|SEAC]] and [[National Youth Rights Association]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Political activism by youth can go unnoticed because youth activism often occurs on school grounds and away from the adult society, but youth often face resistance when forming youth activist groups in schools.&lt;ref name="Gordon, H. 2010"&gt;Gordon, H. (2010). We fight to win. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As the central beneficiaries of [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], youth are also advocating for [[student-led school change]] and [[education reform]] through [[student activism]] and meaningful [[Student engagement|student involvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Checkoway, B. &amp; Gutierrez, L. (2006) "An introduction," in Checkoway &amp; Gutierrez (eds) Youth Participation and Community Change. New York: Hawthorne Press. p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; There are structural inequalities that keep youth from engaging in political talk and action on school grounds or the public domain. School clubs require an adult adviser to make the club official, further adding to school hierarchies of adult power.&lt;ref name="Gordon, H. 2010"/&gt; While some youth participate in [[student government]], others prefer [[Students' union|student unions]] because they provide a real voice to the students and present it to the administration while student governments do not have the power to effect real change in a school system.&lt;ref name="Gordon, H. 2010"/&gt;

==Technology==

===Social media===
[[Facebook]] has become a tool for youth activists to gather information, post [[broadcast]]s about events and activities, participate in activists' groups, and get in contact with other activists.

[[Twitter]] is another tool. Although it is used to provide links to activism topics and activities, it is not regarded to be as useful because of the limitation of 140 characters per message.&lt;ref name="Zhang, W. 2013"&gt;Zhang, W. (2013). Redefining youth activism through digital technology in Singapore. International Communication Gazette, 75(3), 253-270. doi:10.1177/1748048512472858&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter has also been used to spread awareness of social issues by using [[hashtags]]. Some of these movements included [[Kony 2012]] and [[Trayvon Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (2012, March 25). Hashtag activism, and its limits. New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video blogging===
[[Video blogging]] may be used by youth activists as a tool to reach out to their peers and audience, gather support, establish a discourse, and mobilize others. Young activists use videos to articulate ideas and needs, organize resources and supporters, and work toward achieving the goals and causes of their supporters.&lt;ref name="Lim, J. 2013"&gt;Lim, J. (2013). Video blogging and youth activism in Malaysia. International Communication Gazette, 75(3), 300-321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Video blogs are usually found through linking in social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and [[Instagram]], as well as on [[YouTube]].

===Indymedia===
[[Independent Media Center]], also known as Indymedia, is a recent development that has helped involve youth into social movement activism. It has also led to the recognition of youth as political actors in the public domain.&lt;ref name="Gordon, H. 2010"/&gt;

== Global youth activism ==
Youth activism in the [[Global South]] increased in the first years of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, C. 2013. Geographies of children and youth III: Alchemists of the revolution?  Progress in Human Geography 37(1): 145-152.&lt;/ref&gt; People under the age of 18 comprise 46% of the global population, and these youth played a crucial role around the world during the first two decades of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Global Uprising"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=Linda|title=Global Uprising: Confronting the Tyrannies of the 21st Century : Stories from a New Generation of Activists|year=2001|publisher=New Society Publ.}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

==== South Africa ====
A classic example of youth engagement in political activism is the [[Soweto riots]]. When teachers started instructing in [[Afrikaans]], the language of their oppressors, children took the streets for a peaceful demonstration. The police reaction was brutal and on June 16, 1976, at least 25 people were killed. The violence continued and spread all across the country. By the end of the year, 575 people had died and 2,389 had been wounded.&lt;ref name="Youth Activism: Volume 2" /&gt;

A contemporary challenge for [[South Africa]]n youth is the AIDS pandemic. Around 60% of adults who contract HIV become infected before they turn 25, meaning youth are particularly endangered. To advocate and protest about HIV/AIDS, South African youth known as "urban warriors" have created social movements that use youth culture, media, and peer-to-peer campaigns to advocate about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Youth Activism: Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrod|first=Lonnie R|title=Youth activism: an international encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Federation of Students leads the social umbrella movement against the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of 31 August.

==== India ====
In India, youth born in the 1980s and 1990s comprise part of a middle class increasingly vocal against impunity for rapists and against government corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Chandrashekar, V.  2013.  "Could gang-rape protests mark beginning of an age of activism for India?" ''The Christian Science Monitor''. January 3, 2013. Web. Date Accessed: 2013/03/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assam Movement]] (or Assam Agitation) (1979-1985) was a popular movement against illegal immigrants in Assam. The movement, led by [[All Assam Students Union]](AASU) and the 'All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad' (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the [[Indian government]] to identify and expel illegal, (mostly [[Bangladeshis]]), immigrants and protect and provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous [[Assamese people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Historical Background of Youth Activism in Assam|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/194323/8/08_chapter%203.pdf|journal=shodhganga|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Role of the Student of Assam Since Independence|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67807/14/14_chapter%205.pdf|journal=shodhganga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Origin, Growth &amp; Activities of AASU|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67057/7/07_chapter%202.pdf|journal=shodhganga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Impact of AASU on Assam Politics|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67057/11/11_chapter%206.pdf|journal=shodhganga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Youth Activism and Democratic Politics in India’s Northeast-2014 Election in Perspective|url=https://www.thehinducentre.com/migration_catalog/article22982380.ece/BINARY/Policy%20Report%20No.14|journal=The Hindu Centre for Politics &amp; Public Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2017 a large group of students (more than 20 lakhs) protested in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Puducherry]] for the ban on [[Jallikattu]]. The ban was made by Supreme court of India in 2014 when PETA filed a petition against Jallikattu as a cruelty to animals.

[[Young India Foundation]] has been working on a campaign to decrease the age of candidacy in India of MPs/MLAs from 25 to better reflect the large young demographic of India called India's Age of Candidacy&lt;ref&gt;https://ageofcandidacy.in&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
Youth activism in [[Indonesia]] takes many different forms and include a number of mass protests to overthrow governments and remove colonial powers in the past. Popular motivations of youth activism in Indonesia are indigenous rights and national unity, pro-communism, anticommunism, pro-democracy and militant Islam. A common form of activism is massa, a cavalcade of motorcycles, trucks, music, and many young people on foot. These cavalcades are mostly males and end with a rally to address a certain political issue. In general, youth have been looking for political change during the last four decades.&lt;ref name="Youth Activism: Encyclopedia" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
Video blogging has become increasing popular in Malaysia. Youth activists upload their videos and independent films to the popular site [[EngageMedia]]. This is used by Malaysians to encourage young people to become citizen journalists. Youth view EngageMedia as a safe space for their video blogs, but there is still fear of retribution.&lt;ref name="Lim, J. 2013" /&gt;

====Nepal====
In Nepal, [[Youth For Blood]] is working to solve the nation's problem of blood scarcity. They support patients to find fresh blood, award people for donating blood, and advocate to pressure the authorities for quality blood transfusion services and policies.

==== Singapore ====
Singapore is one of the most developed information and communication technology (ICT) countries in the world. In 2010 the computer ownership rate was 84 percent, with internet access at 78 percent. In 2009, mobile phone penetration reached 137 percent, meaning many people of Singapore have access to more than one phone.&lt;ref name="Zhang, W. 2013" /&gt;

Youth use ICT for social and political purposes. In the 2011 general election, people between the ages of 21 and 34 were more active in online politics. Youth who wrote about elections on blogs, Facebook or Twitter were at 28 percent, while the general public were only 10 percent.&lt;ref name="Zhang, W. 2013"/&gt;

===Middle East===

==== Egypt ====
Youth proved to be central to the Egyptian Revolution and the [[April 6 Movement]].

==== Iran ====
Young adults in Iran defy the official regime's cultural and political policies through engaging in prohibited activities in places like taxi rides, coffee shops, and basements. Such actions re-imagine Iranian reality in ways that contest regime policies.&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S.  2008. Young and Defiant in Tehran.  University of Pennsylvania Press, pp. 169-170, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
Youth citizens of [[Saudi Arabia]] seek quiet forms of resistance because outright activism is prohibited. Students blog to share viewpoints and feelings despite potential personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmari|first=Sohrab|authorlink=Sohrab Ahmari|title=Arab Spring Dreams: The Next Generation Speaks Out for Freedom and Justice from North Africa to Iran|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2012}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

==== Serbia ====
Throughout the 1900s, youth took to the streets to protest against Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Youth activists were credited with contributing to his resignation. During the years of protests youth faced unemployment, a failing education system, and economic instability. They created the [[Exit festival|Exit]] music festival, which lasted one hundred days and led up to the September 2000 elections. The first year this festival was called [[EXIT festival#Exit 00|EXIT 00]] and has been defined as "creative" and "politically savvy" activism. The festival contained a civic education component and continues today.&lt;ref name="Youth Activism: Encyclopedia" /&gt;

===North America===

==== United States ====
Youth activism as a social phenomenon in the United States truly became defined in the mid- to late-nineteenth century when young people began forming labor strikes in response to their working conditions, wages, and hours. [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris "Mother" Jones]] organized the first youth activism in the U.S., marching 100,000 child miners from the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in 1908. Youth newspaper carriers soon followed. These actions isolated youths' interests in the [[popular media]] of the times, and separated young people from their contemporary adult labor counterparts.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} This separation continued through the 1930s, when the [[American Youth Congress]] presented a "Bill of Youth Rights" to the US Congress. Their actions were indicative of a growing student movement present throughout the US from the 1920s through the early 1940s. The 1950s saw the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] bring young people into larger movements for [[civil rights]]. All the way back in 1959, Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] engaged youth activists in protesting against [[Bull Connor]]'s racist law enforcement practices in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  The youth activism of [[Tom Hayden]], [[Keith Hefner (activist)|Keith Hefner]] and other 1960s youth laid a powerful precedent for modern youth activism. [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]], [[Myles Horton]] and [[Paulo Freire]] were important in this period. Youthful life and expression defined this era.

== Youth activism in the 21st century ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=Needs to be summarized, possibly merged into other sections. Also predominantly focuses on activism in or from the USA|date=June 2018}}

Youth activism continues to take place in the 21st century at local, regional, national, and international levels.  Youth activists today use technology and social media to share their message. This makes it easier for a local or regional protest to gain national and international recognition.  Additionally, a local or regional protest may, in fact, be focused on inequity or oppression in another part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechtimes.com/2017/05/30/youth-social-media-and-smartphone-use-a-problem-or-tool-for-good/|title=Youth Social Media and Smartphone Use: A Problem or Tool for Good?|date=2017-05-30|work=EdTech Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.youthforchange.org/latest-posts/2016/8/12/youth-digital-media-and-activism|title=Youth, Activism and the Power of Digital Media|work=Youth For Change: a global platform for girls' rights youth activism|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uml.edu/News/stories/2017/PrendergastStudents.aspx|title=Activist: Students Are Leaders of Social Change|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2001 ===
&lt;p&gt;Since 2001, various legislation in the United States, commonly known as [[DREAM Act|DREAM]], has been proposed to help undocumented migrant youth and young adults who arrived as children.  In 2012, President Obama authorized the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program, which has a similar purpose.  [[United We Dream]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://unitedwedream.org/|title=United We Dream {{!}} The Largest Immigrant Youth-Led Network in the Country|date=2017-04-12|work=United We Dream|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an immigrant youth-led community established in 2015.  In collaboration with other activist groups, they have coordinated four campaigns:  #RIGHT2DREAM in 2012; #WECANTWAIT in 2014; and END OF 287G IN HOUSTON and PROTECT IN-STATE TUITION IN TEXAS in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
