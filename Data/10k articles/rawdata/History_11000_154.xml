      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">'''Anthony John R. Russell-Wood''' (1940 – August 13, 2010) was a leading historian of colonial [[Brazil]], the [[Portuguese Empire]], and the broader Luso-Brazilian world.  

Russell-Wood was born in [[Wales]].  He was educated at [[Rossall School]] and [[Oxford University]] and became a member of the faculty of the Department of History at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in 1971; at the time of his death, he was the [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] Professor of History.

His first book, ''Fidalgos and Philanthropists: The Santa Casa da Misericórdia of Bahia, 1550-1755'' (1968), was an ambitious study covering two centuries of the operation and impact of a key, royally chartered and privately financed social-welfare institution of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. It was awarded the 1969 [[Herbert Eugene Bolton]] Prize (now the [[Bolton-Johnson Prize]]) by the Congress of Latin American Historians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-oieahc&amp;month=1008&amp;week=d&amp;msg=4kq92SH%2BqUjv2gXuiYbLyg&amp;user=&amp;pw=/ H-Net Humanities and Social Sciences Online obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;  His second book was a path-breaking work on the [[Afro-Brazilian]] experience, ''The Black Man in Slavery and Freedom in Colonial Brazil'' (1982); it paid particular attention to regional particularities within Brazil and the importance of brotherhood societies in [[Afro-Brazilian]] history. ''World on the Move: The Portuguese in Africa, Asia, and America, 1415-1808'' (1992) explored the [[Portuguese Empire]] as the world's first truly global [[empire]], though one often overshadowed in the public imagination by the [[Spanish Empire]]; Russell-Wood was intrigued by how the Portuguese made sense of their exposure to the once unimaginable vastness of the world, its people, languages, culture, flora, and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+World+on+the+Move%3A+The+Portuguese+in+Africa,+Asia,+and+America,...-a017097881/ Review by Prof. Allyson M. Poska of [[University of Mary Washington]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He died, aged 70, in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

Therefore, [[archaeologists]] limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found.

== Definitions ==
Scholars have frequently used in textual analogies such as 'record', 'source' and 'archive' to refer to material evidence of the past since at least the 19th century. The term 'archaeological record' probably originated this way, possibly via parallel concepts in [[geology]] ([[geologic record]]) or [[Paleontology|palaeontology]] ([[fossil record]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|title=Understanding the Archaeological Record|chapter=The Trouble with Theory|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ1GHy1PoBYC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-107-01026-0|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used regularly by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Piecing Together the Past: The Interpretation of Archaeological Data|last=Childe|first=V. Gordon|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=1956|isbn=9781138812789|location=London|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have entered common parlance thereafter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the first critical review of the concept, philosopher [[Linda Patrik]] found that by the 1980s archaeologists conceptualised the term in at least five different ways:&lt;ref name="Patrik 1985" /&gt;
# As a "receptacle" for material deposits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=David|date=1973|title=Archaeology: the loss of innocence|url=|journal=Antiquity|volume=47|issue=185|page=16|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0003598X0003461X|issn=1745-1744|quote="[...] hominid activities, social patterns, and environmental factors, one with another and with the sample and traces which were at the time deposited in the archaeological record."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrik argued that the first three definitions reflected a "physical model" of archaeological evidence, where it is seen as the direct result of physical processes that operated in the past (like the fossil record); in contrast, definitions four and five follow a "textual model", where the archaeological record is seen as encoding cultural information about the past (like historical texts). She highlighted the extent to which archaeologists' understanding of what constituted 'the archaeological record' was dependent on broader currents in [[archaeological theory]], namely, that [[Processual archaeology|processual archaeologists]] were likely to subscribe to a physical model and [[Post-processual archaeology|postprocessual archaeologists]] a textual model.&lt;ref name="Patrik 1985" /&gt;

Lucas condenses Patrik's list into three distinct definitions of the archaeological record:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# The archaeological record is [[material culture]]
# The archaeological record is the material remains of the past
# The archaeological record is the sources used by archaeologists

=== As material culture ===
In its broadest sense, the archaeological record can be conceived as the total body of objects made by, used by, or associated with, humanity. This definition encompasses both [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] (objects made or modified by humans) and '[[Biofact (archaeology)|ecofacts]]' (natural objects associated with human activity). In this sense, it is equivalent to [[material culture]], and includes not just 'ancient' remains but the physical things associated with contemporary societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This definition, which emphasizes the [[Materiality (archaeology)|materiality]] of the archaeological record and aligns archaeology with [[material culture studies]] and the 'material turn' in [[cultural anthropology]], has become increasingly common with the rise of [[post-processual archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ1GHy1PoBYC|title=Understanding the Archaeological Record|chapter=Materialized culture|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|date=2012-02-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107010260|location=Cambridge|pages=124–168|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As material remains ===
More conservative definitions specify that the archaeological record consists of the "remains", "traces" or "residues" of ''past'' human activity, although the dividing line between 'the past' and 'the present' may not be well-defined. This view is particularly associated with [[processual archaeology]], which saw the archaeological record as the "fossilised" product of physical, cultural and taphonomic processes that happened in the past, and focused on understanding those processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|title=Understanding the Archaeological Record|chapter=Formation Theory|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ1GHy1PoBYC&amp;pg=PA74|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-107-01026-0|pages=74–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As sources ===
The archaeological record can also consist of the written documentation that is presented in scientific journals. It is what [[archaeologists]] have learned from the artifacts they have documented. This spans the entire world; [[archaeology]] is the human story that belongs to everyone’s past and represents everyone's heritage.&lt;ref name="McChesney2012"/&gt; This data can be archived and retrieved by [[archaeologists]] for research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Birch|first2=Suzanne E. Pilaar|title=A Standard for the Scholarly Citation of Archaeological Data as an Incentive to Data Sharing|journal=Advances in Archaeological Practice|date=5 April 2018|volume=6|issue=02|pages=125–143|doi=10.1017/aap.2018.3|url=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/py4hz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The mission of an archaeologist is often preservation of the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="McChesney2012"/&gt; There are different databases which are used to archive and preserve the documentation in addition to the artifacts which serve as archaeological records. One of these databases is The Digital Archaeological Record. The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) is an international digital repository for the digital records of archaeological investigations. tDAR's use, development, and maintenance are governed by Digital Antiquity, an organization dedicated to ensuring the long-term preservation of irreplaceable archaeological data and to broadening the access to these data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = About | work = The Digital Archaeological Record | url = https://www.tdar.org/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological record serves as a database for everything archaeology stands for and has become. The material culture associated with archaeological excavations and the scholarly records in academic journals are the physical embodiment of the archaeological record. The ambiguity that is associated with the archaeological record is often due to the lack of examples, but the archaeological record is everything the science of archaeology has found and created.

== Components ==
Components of the archaeological record include: artifacts, built structures, [[human impact on the environment]], garbage, [[stratigraphy]], mortuary practices, plant remains, or animal remains. Artifacts from the archaeological record are usually found in the ground, and once dug up, archaeologists put data such as photographs and exact location of the artifact into the archaeological record. Bones are sometimes found and included in the archaeological record. Bones can be from both animals and humans that have died and been preserved. Bone fragments and whole bones can be a part of the archaeological record. Plant and organic material found can also become a part of the archaeological record. Seeds are a common plant material that are found and included in the archaeological record. The seeds that [[archaeologists]] find are usually those that were burned during cooking, which helps to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hal.state.mi.us/mhc/michrelics|title=The Role of Archaeology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703154541/http://www.hal.state.mi.us/mhc/michrelics/archaeology.html|archive-date=3 July 2013|work=Michigan Historical Museum's Digging Up Controversy Exhibit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features are also part of the archaeological record, and are [[material culture]] that usually [[archaeologists]] are unable to take and study inside a lab. Features can include burn marks in the ground from fire pits or [[mound]]s and other structures constructed long ago. Features can also include mounds or other monuments that have been constructed by other civilizations.

'''Assyria''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|ɪər|i|ə}}) was reputedly a Roman province that lasted only two years (116–118 AD).

==History==

According to [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], who in the second half of the 4th century historians, at a time when the [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] was perceived as "a valuable paradigm for contemporary events and figures", wrote under the direction of the Emperor [[Valens]], Assyria was one of three [[Roman provinces|provinces]] (with Armenia and [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)#Trajan's province|Mesopotamia]]) created by Trajan in AD 116 following a successful military campaign against [[Parthia]] that in that year saw him cross the River [[Tigris]] from Mesopotamia and take possession, in spite of resistance, of the territory of [[Adiabene]] and then march south to the Parthian capital of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] and to [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name=Mommsen&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_gWcNAAAAQAAJ/page/n409 Theodore Mommsen, ''Römische Geschichte'' (Berlin 1885), vol. V (''Die Provinzen von Caesar bis Diocletian''), pp. 400−401]&lt;/ref&gt; There is numismatic evidence for the Trajanic provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia, but none for that of Assyria, whose existence is questioned by C.S. Lightfoot and F. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-studies/article/trajans-parthian-war-and-the-fourthcentury-perspective/D5CCE57D517EE6E9AF24CAD504E72371 C. S. Lightfoot, "Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective" in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 80 (1990), pp. 115-126]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kettenhofen&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/trajan Erich Kettenhofen, "Trajan" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-quarterly/article/another-look-at-the-breviarium-of-festus/6E9C796F42187BFBC7671CC48B1A9DD8 Simon Grote, "Another look at the ''Breviarium'' of Festus" in ''The Classical Quarterly'', Volume 61, Issue 2 (December 2011), pp. 704-721]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Rome's military victory, Trajan's 116 conquest was plagued with difficulties. From the start, a Parthian prince named Santruces organized an armed revolt by the native peoples, during which Roman garrisons were driven from their posts and a Roman general was killed as his troops tried to stop the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;David Magie, ''Roman Rule in Asia Minor to the End of the Third Century After Christ'', Princeton, NJ:  Princeton University Press, 1950:  p. 609.&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan overcame the revolt, capturing and burning Seleucia and Edessa, and even setting up a puppet Parthian king; but then, on his journey homeward in triumph, he fell sick and died on 8 August 117.&lt;ref name=Mommsen/&gt;

Trajan's successor, [[Hadrian]], implemented a new policy with respect to the recently acquired territories in the east. Believing that they overextended the [[Roman Empire|empire]], he withdrew to the more easily defensible borders.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Freeman, ''The World of the Romans'', New York:  Oxford University Press, 1993:  p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume XI'', London:  Cambridge University Press, 1970:  p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; He left unfinished the work of overcoming the Parthians, which he saw would require an excessive increase in military spending. He sent the puppet Parthian king elsewhere and restored to the former ruler the lands east of the Euphrates, together with his daughter who had been captured, preferring to live with him in peace and friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_gWcNAAAAQAAJ/page/n411 Theodore Mommsen, ''Römische Geschichte'' (Berlin 1885), vol. V (''Die Provinzen von Caesar bis Diocletian''), p. 403]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth-century historians Eutropius and Festus assume that the supposed Roman province of Assyria was situated east of the Tigris and so outside of [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=Kettenhofen/&gt;

[[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote that it was located north of the Roman Mesopotamia province, in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], stretching into western Persia (in an area called [[Media Atropatene]]) in what is now northwestern [[Iran]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--This does not appear to be in Mommsen's volume on the Roman provinces--&gt;

But some modern scholars argue that the ''Assyria Provincia'' was located between the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers, in present-day central Iraq, a location that is corroborated by the text of the 4th-century Roman historian Festus.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lightfoot, "Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective," ''The Journal of Roman Studies, Volume 80'', (1990), p. 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other sources contend that the province was located near [[Armenia]] and east of the Tigris, in a region formerly known as [[Adiabene]],&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot p. 121; Magie p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; which was a [[neo-Assyrian]] kingdom.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Further Roman activity in Mesopotamia ==

Hadrian's withdrawal in 118 did not mark the end of Roman rule in Mesopotamia.  A second Parthian campaign was launched from 161-165 under the command of [[Lucius Verus]], with the [[Roman army]] once more conquering territory east of the Euphrates.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History'' p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome pursued military action against the Parthians again in 197-8 under the command of emperor [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;Magie p. 674-5; Fergus Millar, ''The Roman Empire and its Neighbors'', London:  Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967:  p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his successful campaign, Septimius Severus instituted two new Roman provinces: [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] and [[Osroene]], a [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdom{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} or, according to Matthew Bunson, a kingdom that began only in the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HsrGEFpW80UC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=Osroene+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzzfj5n8reAhUHMewKHeZtB9UQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Osroene%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press 1995), p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt; centered on [[Edessa]]. He also stationed two Roman [[Roman legion|legions]] in the new provinces to ensure stability and prevent against first Parthian, and later [[Sassanid empire|Sassanian]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Magie p. 674-5; Fergus Millar, ''The Roman Empire and its Neighbors'', London:  Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967:  p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman influence in the area came to an end under [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] in 363, who abandoned the region after concluding a hasty peace agreement with the Sassanians and retreating to [[Constantinople]] to consolidate his political power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] The Later Roman Empire (354-378) ''A shameful peace concluded by Jovian'' 6.7 pg.303, Penguin Classics, Translated by [[Walter Hamilton (translator)|Walter Hamilton]] 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continued Roman activity in the region, no further reference is made to a Roman province of Assyria following Hadrian's evacuation in 118 AD. When Septimus Severus created the provinces of Osroene and Mesopotamia at the end of the 2nd century, no mention is made of a Roman province of Assyria. 

The Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (c. 330 − c. 391) says that the district of Adiabene was formerly called Assyria, with no indication that either ever was a Roman province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_23_book23.htm Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Rerum gestarum libri'' 23.6.20]&lt;/ref&gt; He says that Assyria was the nearest to Rome of the chief Persian provinces and that in his time it was known by a single name, though previously divided among several peoples and tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus 23.6.14−15&lt;/ref&gt; He lists among the cities of Assyria Babylon, Seleucia and Ctesiphon.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus, 23.6.23&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks of the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] as, in his campaign against the [[Sasanian Empire]], attacking Assyrians shortly before crossing the Euphrates into Osroene,&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus 23.2.6&lt;/ref&gt; as living near the Euphrates to the south of [[Carrhae]],&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus 23.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;  

Thus, it seems that the province of Assyria only existed during Trajan's reign, if even then, and was not reinstated during later Roman occupations of the region. The general area coincided with ancient [[Assyria]];{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} however, and the [[Medes]], Achaemenid Persians, Seleucid Greeks, Sassanids and Parthians all had similar names for the area ([[Ashur]], [[Athura]], [[Assuristan]]).

The [[Assyrian people]] of the region had already begun to adopt Christianity by Trajan's time,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and still retained an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-infused [[Eastern Aramaic]] as a spoken and literary tongue, as they do to this day.

:''For the origin of life, see [[Abiogenesis]].''
'''Biogenesis''' is the production of new living [[organism]]s or [[organelle]]s. Conceptually, biogenesis is primarily attributed to [[Louis Pasteur]] and encompasses the belief that complex [[life|living things]] come only from other living things, by means of [[reproduction]]. That is, life does not spontaneously arise from non-living material, which was the position held by [[spontaneous generation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm Pasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pasteur#External links|Louis Pasteur: External links]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is summarized in the phrase ''Omne vivum ex vivo'', Latin for ''"all life [is] from life."'' A related statement is ''Omnis cellula e cellula'', "all cells [are] from cells;" this conclusion is one of the central statements of [[cell theory]].

== Biogenesis and abiogenesis ==
The term biogenesis was coined by [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] to mean the generation of a life form  from nonliving materials, however, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] chose the term [[abiogenesis]] and redefined biogenesis for life arising from preexisting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Strick |first= James |title= Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate= August 28, 2012 |date= April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv|chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of life from non-living material is called [[abiogenesis]], and occurred through stepwise chemical and [[molecular evolution]] over millions of years.&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120110"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spiegel |first=David S. |last2=Turner |first2=Edwin L. |title=Bayesian analysis of the astrobiological implications of life’s early emergence on Earth |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/2/395.full.pdf+html |date=January 10, 2012 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=109 |number=2 |pages=395–400 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1111694108 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |arxiv = 1107.3835 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109..395S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9868373"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Orgel LE| title=The origin of life--a review of facts and speculations. | journal=Trends Biochem Sci | year= 1998 | volume= 23 | issue= 12 | pages= 491–5 | pmid=9868373 | doi= 10.1016/s0968-0004(98)01300-0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9868373 | quote=Life, therefore, originated on or was transported to the earth at some point within a window of a few hundred million years that opened about four billion years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH-20060612"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharov |first=Alexei A. |title=Genome increase as a clock for the origin and evolution of life |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |date=June 12, 2006 |issue= |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-17 |pmc=1526419 |pmid=16768805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20110114"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vieru |first=Tudor |title=Life Is 10 Billion Years Old |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Life-Is-10-Billion-Years-Old-178156.shtml |date=January 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=March 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSR-201010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wesson |first=Paul S. |title=Panspermia, Past and Present: Astrophysical and Biophysical Conditions for the Dissemination of Life in Space |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11214-010-9671-x |date=October 2010 |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=156 |issue=1-4 |pages=239–252 |doi=10.1007/s11214-010-9671-x |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |arxiv = 1011.0101 |bibcode = 2010SSRv..156..239W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biogenesis'' may also refer to biochemical processes of production in living organisms (see [[biosynthesis]]).

==Spontaneous generation and its disproof==
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
The Ancient Greeks believed that living things could spontaneously come into being from nonliving matter, and that the goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] could make life arise spontaneously from stones – a process known as ''Generatio spontanea''. [[Aristotle]] disagreed, but he still believed that creatures could arise from dissimilar organisms or from soil. Variations of this concept of spontaneous generation still existed as late as the 17th century, but towards the end of the 17th century, a series of observations and arguments began that eventually discredited such ideas. This advance in scientific understanding was met with much opposition, with personal beliefs and individual prejudices often obscuring the facts.

[[William Harvey]] (1578–1657) was an early proponent of all life beginning from an egg, ''omne vivum ex ovo''.
[[Francesco Redi]], an Italian physician, proved as early as 1668 that higher forms of life did not originate spontaneously by demonstrating that [[maggot]]s come from eggs of [[fly|flies]].&lt;ref name=lev&gt;{{cite web|author= Levine R, Evers C|title= The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859)|url= http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080426191204/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2008-04-26|accessdate= 2013-04-18|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But proponents of spontaneous generation claimed that this did not apply to microbes and continued to hold that these could arise spontaneously.  Attempts to disprove the spontaneous generation of life from non-life continued in the early 19th century with observations and experiments by [[Franz Schulze]] and [[Theodor Schwann]].&lt;ref name="Jgerm"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juuXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 | title=Germ Theory | publisher=Twenty-First Century Books | author=Herbst, Judith | year=2013 | pages=18–20 | isbn=1467703710}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1745, [[John Needham]] added chicken broth to a flask and boiled it. He then let it cool and waited. Microbes grew, and he proposed it as an example of spontaneous generation. In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] repeated Needham's experiment but removed all the air from the flask. No growth occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsguide.in/microbiology/microbiology/controversy-over-spontaneous-generation.html The controversy over spontaneous generation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, [[Heinrich G. F. Schröder]] (1810–1885) and [[Theodor von Dusch]], and in 1859, Schröder  alone, repeated the [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] filtration experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1864, [[Louis Pasteur]] finally announced the results of his scientific experiments. In a series of experiments similar to those performed earlier by Needham and Spallanzani, Pasteur demonstrated that life does not arise in areas that have not been contaminated by existing life. Pasteur's empirical results were summarized in the phrase ''Omne vivum ex vivo'', Latin for "all life [is] from life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=27 The microbial world: a look at things small]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE8/B-Ab.html Biogenesis and Abiogenesis: Critiques and Addresses]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis.gif|Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis]]

After obtaining his results, Pasteur stated: "''La génération spontanée est une chimère''" ("Spontaneous generation is a dream").

{{History of Canada sidebar}}
During the '''[[World war]]s and Interwar Years''' [[Canada]] experienced economic gain, more freedom for women and new technological advancements.

==World War I==
{{Main|Home front during World War I#Canada|Military history of Canada during World War I|Canadian women during the World Wars}}
On June 28, 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] was assassinated, setting off a chain of events leading to [[World War I]]. At the time, [[Canadians]] were more concerned with events within their own country than European affairs, specifically in the [[Balkans]] where crises and wars had been brutal perennials for generations. The summer of 1914 brought a second year of drought turning wheat fields into parched deserts while the two new transcontinental railways [[Grand Trunk Pacific|the Grand Trunk Pacific]] and the [[Canadian Northern]] fell further into debt, sending the thousands of men who had helped build them into unemployment. Canada was facing its worst depression since the 1890s. Canadians hoped the [[Great Power]]s of Europe could keep the peace as they had done many times before in earlier disputes of the century. Besides, so far [[United Kingdom|Britain]] had no reason to join in the squabble forming on the main continent, leaving no obligation for Canada to join if war did break out between [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. News of war did not make a stir in Canada until Germany invaded Belgium as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], and the British delivered an ultimatum to [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]]: withdraw from Belgium by August 4 or Britain would be at a state of war with Germany.

On July 29, 1914, Britain warned its colonies to take precautions in case of war. Most recent wars had begun with surprise attacks such as the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Soldiers and Canada's few sailors manned [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] fortifications and brought guns to command the [[St. Lawrence| St. Lawrence river]]. In [[Victoria, British Columbia]] Premier [[Richard McBride]] signed a cheque for $1,150,000 and bought two submarines from a [[Seattle]] shipyard, so at least British Columbia's coast was not completely defenceless. On August 2 armed militia mounted guard on bridges, canals, tunnels and railway stations in preparation. In [[Ottawa]], the [[Minister of Militia]], [[Sam Hughes|Colonel Sam Hughes]], had dreamed for years of leading Canadians to war and had for a long time preached and prepared for war with Germany and now had only to wait on [[London]] to make the first move, much to his irritation, but was persuaded by the octogenarian quartermaster general [[Donald Alexander Macdonald|Major-General Donald Alexander Macdonald]] to be patient. On August 4 8:55 P.M., Canada got the news and Hughes was ecstatic: Britain was at war with Germany.

Canada was then automatically at war, as she did not yet have control over her foreign policy — not that there were many dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Graham |title=Through the First World War |work=The Canadians, 1867-1967  |editor-first1=J.M.S. |editor-last1=Careless |editor-link1=J.M.S. Careless |editor-first2=Robert Craig |editor-last2=Brown |location=Toronto |publisher=Macmillan of Canada |date=1967 |p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war was initially popular even among French Canadians, including [[Henri Bourassa]], who historically looked afoul at the British Empire. Liberal leader [[Wilfrid Laurier]] created a 'party truce' for as long as Canada was in danger and had those dissenters in the liberal caucus hold their tongues. When asked what Canada 'must do' by the press, Laurier responded "When the call comes, our answer goes at once, and it goes in the classical language of the British answer to the call of duty, 'Ready, aye, ready!'" [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Borden]] called a meeting of [[Canadian Parliament|Parliament]] on August 18, and without division or significant debate, MPs approved an overseas contingent of 25,000 men with Canada bearing the full cost: a war appropriation of $50 million and a [[Canadian Patriotic Fund]] to support the families of men who would fight in [[Europe]]. The Cabinet spent many hours trying to devise adequate emergency legislation, resulting in the [[War Measures Act]], decreeing the Cabinet would have the authority to do whatever it deemed necessary for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In no way was Canada prepared for this scale of war. Its [[economy of Canada|economy]] could not support it for more than a few months before being hit hard by its cost, as was with other participants. No one expected it to last longer than a few months though, many claiming it would be over by Christmas. Mass recruiting for the war effort began on August 6 with hundreds of telegrams notifying Militia colonel to begin recruiting men between the ages of 18 and 45. Hordes of British immigrants and the unemployed answered the call. [[Ontario]], hard hit by the depression, accounted for third of the recruits, while two thirds of the recruits were British born. Few recruits came from the Maritimes and just over 1,000 were French. The cities of [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Montreal]] sent enough men each for two battalions. By September 4 there were 32,000 men and 8,000 horses in camp, far more than had been expected. There was an immediate demand for equipment, uniforms and weapons. [[The Ross Rifle Company]] worked overtime as did the textile mills and clothing factories. With a force of 32,000 equipped and ready, it soon became apparent that Embarkation from the docks would be a nightmare. Extra ships had to be chartered to carry the additional men. Battalions were marched on to ships only to be marched back off when they didn't fit. Units ignored orders and schedules and crowded the docks not wishing to wait. When it was all done, the last of 30 ships had cleared the harbour, leaving 863 horses, 4,512 tons of baggage, vehicles and ammunition behind, for which another ship had to be called in to pick up.

The first Canadian casualties of the war occurred before these troops arrived in Europe. [[Christopher Cradock|Sir Christopher Cradock's]] squadron was sunk at the [[Battle of Coronel]] off the coast of [[Chile]], claiming four midshipmen who became Canada's first war dead. By the time that the First Contingent reached England on October 14 it became apparent the war would not be over by Christmas. Germany's initial rapid successes in Belgium and France had come to halt and both sides were starting to dig into their positions.

Canadians fought at [[Ypres]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], and other important battles, originally under British command, but eventually under a unified Canadian command. From a Canadian point of view the most important battle of the war was the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917, during which Canadian troops captured a fortified German hill that had eluded both the British and French. Vimy, as well as the success of the Canadian flying ace [[Billy Bishop]], helped give Canada a new sense of identity.
With mounting costs at home, Sir [[William Thomas White|Thomas White]] introduced the first [[income tax]] in Canada as a "temporary" measure. The lowest bracket was 4% and highest was 25%.

The 620,000 men in service were most remembered for combat in the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; there were 67,000 war dead and 173,000 wounded. This total does not include the 2,000 deaths and 9,000 injuries in December 1917 when [[Halifax Explosion|a munitions ship exploded in Halifax.]]&lt;ref&gt;War Office, ''Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920'' (London, 1922) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

===The conscription crisis of 1917===
{{Main|Conscription Crisis of 1917}}
[[File:Affiche Voltigeurs.jpg|thumb|upright|French-Canadian recruitment poster emphasizing duty to France with French national heroes]]
After three years of a war that was supposed to have been over in three months, Canada was suffering from a shortage of volunteers. Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] had originally promised not to introduce conscription, but now believed it was necessary to win the war. The ''Military Service Act'' was passed in July, but there was fierce opposition, mostly from French Canadians (led not only by Bourassa, but also by [[Wilfrid Laurier]]), as well as [[Quakers]], [[Mennonite]]s, and other [[pacifism|pacifists]]. Borden's government almost collapsed, but he was able to form a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government with the Liberal opposition (although Laurier did not join the new government). In the [[Canadian federal election, 1917|1917 election]], the Union government was re-elected, but with no support from Quebec. Over the next year, the war finally ended, with very few Canadian conscripts actually participating.

===Halifax Explosion===
{{Main|Halifax Explosion}}
Halifax, Nova Scotia, was the main staging point for convoys making trans-Atlantic crossings. On December 6, 1917, a Belgian relief ship collided with the {{SS|Mont-Blanc}}, a French munitions ship in Halifax harbour. The crash set the ''Mont-Blanc'' on fire; its holds were full of benzol, picric acid, and TNT. Twenty minutes later it exploded with a force stronger than any man-made explosion before it, destroying most of Halifax and the surrounding towns. Out of a population of 50,000, 1600 people were killed and over 9,000 injured; hundreds were blinded by flying glass. The city was evacuated and dropped out of the war effort, focusing primarily on economic survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sally M. |last=Walker |title=Blizzard of Glass: The Halifax Explosion of 1917 |date=2011 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUkyHbJVPbIC |isbn=978-1-4668-0510-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war society==
During the war, the [[woman's suffrage]] movement gained support. The provinces began extending voting rights to women in 1916, and women were finally allowed to vote in federal elections in 1918. Canada was also faced with the return of thousands of soldiers, with few jobs waiting for them at home. They also brought back with them the [[Spanish Flu]], which killed over 50,000 people by 1919, almost the same number that had been killed in the war.

===Labour conflicts===
[[File:WinnipegGeneralStrike.jpg|thumb|left|Crowd gathered outside old City Hall during the Winnipeg General Strike, June 21, 1919]]
The move from a wartime to a peacetime economy, combined with the unwillingness of returned soldiers to accept pre-war working conditions, led to another crisis. In 1919, the [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]] was formed by trade union [[syndicalism|syndicalists]] with the intent of improving conditions for all workers, not just in a single workplace, industry, or sector. The OBU had some influence on the [[Winnipeg General Strike of 1919]], which business and political leaders saw as an outbreak of [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]], especially since the [[Soviet Union]] had recently been formed. The army was sent in to break the strike and the entire [[Winnipeg Police Service|Winnipeg police force]] was fired and replaced with a much larger and better paid force of armed [[Special Constables|special constables]]. Although the Winnipeg strike is the best known, it was part of [[Canadian Labour Revolt|a larger strike wave]] that swept the country. Special constables, vigilante "citizens" organizations, and replacement workers were mobilized in strikebreaking throughout the country in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Stace, "Remembering and Forgetting Winnipeg: Making History on the Strike of 1919." ''Constellations'' (2014) 5#1 on the historiography of 1919; [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/constellations/article/viewFile/21381/16125 online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122923/https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/constellations/article/viewFile/21381/16125 |date=March 4, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Campbell Masters, ''The Winnipeg general strike'' (University of Toronto Press, 1950) is a scholarly history.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Meanwhile, in western Canada, and to some extent in the Maritimes, [[populism|populist]] reformers were pushing for increased provincial rights and a focus on agriculture, rather than the industrial focus of [[Central Canada]]. They formed the [[Progressive Party of Canada]], which supported [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] when the Liberals had a minority government in 1925-26. King eventually [[Motion of Confidence|lost support]], however, because of the trade tariffs issue, as well as a liquor smuggling scandal. When his request that parliament be dissolved was rejected by the [[Governor General of Canada]] (''see [[King-Byng Affair]]''), he was forced to resign in 1926, but was re-appointed after his party won [[Canadian federal election, 1926|the election later that year]], after which, at [[1926 Imperial Conference|an Imperial Conference]], King advocated the redefining of the role of the Governor General and the gain of increased independence for Canada in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]].

===Radio===
{{main|History of broadcasting in Canada}}
The history of broadcasting in Canada begins in the early 1920s, as Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations. Main themes in the history include the development of the engineering  technology; the construction of stations across the country and the building of networks; the widespread purchase and use of radio and television sets by the general public; debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations; financing of the broadcasts media through the government, license fees, and advertising; the changing content of the programming; the impact of the programming on Canadian identity; the media's influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics; the role of the Québec government; Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes; the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations; and fears of American cultural imperialism via the airwaves. In the late 20th century, Radio was largely overwhelmed by television, but still maintained a niche. In the 21st century, the central question is the impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Armstrong, ''Broadcasting Policy in Canada'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Raboy, ''Missed Opportunities: The Story of Canada's Broadcasting Policy'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Canadian-owned stations had weak signals compared with American stations. In the 1930s there were 60 Canadian stations but 40% of Canadians could only tune in American stations.&lt;ref name = "Conrado"&gt;"History of the Canadian Peoples, 1867–present," Alvin Finkel &amp; Margaret Conrad, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Many stations simply rebroadcast American radio shows. Little funding was available for Canadian content. The most notable exceptions were religious radio shows, such as "Back to the Bible Hour," produced by Alberta's premier, [[William Aberhart]], and the increasingly popularity of broadcast hockey games.&lt;ref&gt;Anne F. MacLennan, "Learning to Listen: Developing the Canadian Radio Audience in the 1930s." ''Journal of Radio &amp; Audio Media'' (2013) 20#2 pp: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure from [[Graham Spry]] and the Canadian Radio League encouraged Mackenzie King to request a [[Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting]]. Its report called for a national radio network to encourage national sentiment. In 1932, the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] established the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, transformed into the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Vipond, ''Listening In: The First Decade of Canadian Broadcasting 1922-1932'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  CBC set up a French language network in Quebec and adjacent Francophone areas.  Although the French language service had little competition from American stations, it proved quite conservative in technology and programming. It was closely aligned with powerful newspaper and Church interests and became a propaganda forum for the traditional elites of Quebec. It did not promote separatism or a sense of Québec nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Vipond, "One Network or Two? French-Language Programming on the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, 1932–36," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (2008) 89#3 pp: 319-343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elzéar Lavoie, "L'évolution de la radio au Canada français avant 1940."

==The Great Depression==
{{Main|Great Depression in Canada}}
[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|upright|The Single Men's Unemployed Association parading to Bathurst Street [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] in Toronto]]

Canada was hard hit by the worldwide [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929. Between 1929 and 1933, the gross national product dropped 40% (compared to 37% in the US). Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933. Many businesses closed, as corporate profits of $396 million in 1929 turned into losses of $98 million in 1933. Canadian exports shrank by 50% from 1929 to 1933. Construction all but stopped (down 82%, 1929–33), and wholesale prices dropped 30%. Wheat prices plunged from 78c per bushel (1928 crop) to 29c in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Urquhart, ed. ''Historical Statistics of Canada'' (1965) series F1-F13&lt;/ref&gt;

Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming, mining and logging, as prices fell and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts become heavier as prices fell. Some families saw most or all of their assets disappear, and suffered severely.

While the decline started in the United States, it quickly spread to Canada.  The first industry affected was wheat farming, which saw a collapse in prices.  This impoverished the economies of the Prairie provinces, but as wheat was then Canada's largest export it also hurt the rest of the country. With the collapse of the construction industry, lumbering was even worse hit, as there were few alternative jobs in the lumbering region.  This was soon followed by a deep recession in manufacturing, first caused by a drop-off in demand in the United States, and then by Canadians also not buying more than bare essentials.  The auto industry that prospered so greatly in the 1920s was badly hit.  Construction came to a halt. People who lost jobs because of layoffs and closures had a very hard time finding a new ones—especially older men and teenagers. [[Unemployment]] rose to 25 per cent.

===Government reaction===
In 1930 in the first stage of the long depression, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]  believed that the crisis was a temporary swing of the business cycle and that the economy would soon recover without government intervention.  He refused to provide unemployment relief or federal aid to the provinces, saying that if Conservative provincial governments demanded federal dollars he would not give them "a five cent piece."&lt;ref&gt;[[Neatby, H. Blair]] ''William Lyon Mackenzie King,'' 2:312, 318&lt;/ref&gt; His blunt wisecrack was used to defeat the Liberals in the 1930 election.  The main issue was the rapid deterioration in the economy and whether the prime minister was out of touch with the hardships of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression, 1929-1939'' (1990) pp 54, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morton, ''Working people'' (1998) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930 election]] was [[Richard Bedford Bennett]] and the Conservatives.  Bennett, a successful Western businessman, campaigned on high tariffs and large scale spending, but as deficits increased he became wary and cut back severely on Federal spending. With falling support and the depression only getting worse Bennett attempted to introduce policies based on the [[New Deal]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) in the United States, but this was largely unsuccessful. The government became a focus of popular discontent, even though its policies were largely the same as those of other Western governments.  Canadian car owners who could no longer afford gasoline reverted to having their vehicles pulled by horses and dubbed them [[Bennett Buggy|Bennett Buggies]]. Bennett's perceived failures during the Great Depression led to the re-election of Mackenzie King's Liberals in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]].

Although the United States began to see rapid improvements as a result of FDR's policies, Canada saw far less growth.  Nevertheless, by 1936 the worst of the Depression was over. Mackenzie King implemented some relief programs such as the National Housing Act and National Employment Commission, and also established the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (1936) and Trans-Canada Airlines (1937, the precursor to [[Air Canada]]).  However, it took until 1939 and the outbreak of war for the Canadian economy to return to 1929 levels.

===New parties===
[[File:William Aberhart.jpg|thumb|right|William Aberhart addresses a rally (1937)]]
The [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] and [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]] Parties had achieved some success in the 1920s, but during the 1930s, their members generally joined other parties, like the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit movement]] and the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]].

In [[Alberta]], a Christian radio broadcaster named [[William Aberhart|William "Bible Bill" Aberhart]] became interested in politics partly because the [[Great Depression]] had been especially harsh on Albertan farmers. Particularly, he was drawn to the "[[social credit]]" theories of Major [[C. H. Douglas]], a Scottish engineer. From 1932 to 1935, Aberhart lobbied for the governing political party, the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], to adopt these theories. The basis of social credit is that the difference in production cost and individuals' purchasing power should be supplemented through government grants. When these efforts failed, Aberhart helped found the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta]], which won the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 provincial election]] by a landslide with over 54% of the popular vote.

[[File:CooperativeCommonwealthFederationFoundingMeeting.jpg|thumb|CCF founding meeting, Calgary, 1932]]
The [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) was founded in 1932 in [[Calgary, Alberta]], by a number of [[socialism|socialist]], farm, [[co-operative]] and [[labour movement|labour]] groups, and the [[League for Social Reconstruction]]. The CCF aimed to alleviate the suffering of the [[Great Depression]] through economic reform and public "co-operation". Many of the party's first [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) were former members of the [[Ginger Group (Canada)|Ginger Group]] of left-wing [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] and [[Labour candidates and parties (Canada)|Labour]] MPs. In its first election in [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935]], seven CCF MPs were elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Eight were elected in the following election in [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940]].

The period also saw the rise of the openly fascist [[National Unity Party (Canada)|National Unity Party]] (NUP) and the [[Communist Party of Canada]], which was declared illegal under [[Section 98]] of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] from 1931 to 1936.  The party continued to exist, but was under the constant threat of legal harassment, and was for all intents and purposes an underground organization until 1936. The party greatly contributed in the mobilization of volunteers to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The NUP and, again, the Communist Party were banned in 1940.

===On to Ottawa Trek===
[[File:Kamloops on to Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Strikers from unemployment relief camps climbing on boxcars in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]] ]]

The depression had crippled the economy and left one in nine Canadians on relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Zuehlke | first=Mark | year=1996 | title=The Gallant Cause: Canadians in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939 | publisher=Whitecap Books | location=Vancouver | isbn =1-55110-488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did relief come free; the Bennett government had asked the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Canadian Department of National Defense]] to organize work camps where the labour of unemployed single men was used to construct roads and other public works with little remuneration. The poor working conditions in the camps led to serious unrest, including a major strike in Vancouver in April 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hoar (Howard)|first = Victor|year = 1969|title = The Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion: Canadian Participation in the Spanish Civil War|publisher = Copp Clark|location = Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strikers' demands included adequate [[first aid]] equipment in the camps, the extension of the [[Workers' compensation|Workmen's Compensation Act]] to include camp workers, and that workers in camps be granted the right to vote in [[Elections in Canada|Federal elections]]. Public support was enormous, and the action snowballed into a bigger movement when the men decided to take their grievances to the federal government. In June 1935, hundreds of men boarded boxcars headed East in what would come to be known as the "[[On to Ottawa Trek]]".

The protest was halted, however, before it could reach the capital. In [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) confined the protesters in a local stadium. Only the eight leaders of the protest were actually allowed to proceed to Ottawa, where they were granted a meeting with [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Richard Bedford Bennett|R.B. Bennett]]. Bennett attacked the group as radicals, and eventually had the delegation hustled out of his office. Upon returning to Regina to unite with the rest of the protesters, they organized large public rallies, which broke out into riots when the Federal government deployed police to break up the rallies and arrest the leaders. Two people were killed as a result of the riot and many more injured. When the trek was over the government provided free transportation back to the camps. These camps were soon abolished following Bennett's electoral defeat, and new, less extensive, relief work schemes were devised on farms and in forestry camps in conjunction with provincial governments, and pay rates changed from twenty-cents a day to five dollars a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Berton| first =Pierre| title =The Great Depression, 1929-1939| publisher =Penguin| year =1990| location =Toronto| pages =542–543| isbn =  0-14-015770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian foreign policy in the Interwar Years==
At the end of World War I Canada was a founding member of the [[League of Nations]] and was granted full membership. But the Borden and King governments made it clear that "Canada lived 'in a fireproof house far from flammable materials' and felt no automatic obligation to the principle of collective security".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Craig in: The Illustrated History of Canada, Toronto, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Very much like the United States, after the great war Canada turned away from international politics. Instead, King focused his attention on good relations with the United States and on greater independence from Great Britain, moving into a position of near isolation. Thus, in 1922 King refused to support the British to enforce a peace settlement during the [[Chanak Crisis]], when revolutionary [[Turkey]] attacked and drove out the Greek in Asia Minor. At an [[Imperial Conference]] in 1923 it was agreed that no resolution was binding unless approved by each dominion parliament. Canada then for the first time signed a treaty (the 1923 [[Halibut Treaty]] with the US) without British participation, and it proceeded to establish its own embassy in Washington. Further steps to independence were the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931.

Canadians were all the more preoccupied with domestic economic problems and chose to remain neutral throughout the 1930s. Japan's invasion of Manchuria raised little concern in Canada, as did Hitler's rise to power in 1933 or [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italy's invasion of Ethiopia]] in 1935. The Canadian government declared its neutrality on the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 where [[Francisco Franco]] lead a military uprising, supported with military hardware and tens of thousands of troops by Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]] against the legitimate Spanish government. Nevertheless, many Canadians volunteered to fight for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] in the [[International Brigade]]s and couldn't be deterred by the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1937, outlawing participation by Canadians in foreign wars. Eventually, 1,546 Canadians participated, mainly in the [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]] (also called "Mac-Paps") of which 721 were killed. Except for France, no other country gave as great a proportion of its population as volunteers in Spain than Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Michaëlle, Governor General of Canada, Speech on the Occasion of the Unveiling of the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion Monument, Ottawa, October 20, 2001, {{cite web |url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang%3De%26DocID%3D1331 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030816165231/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=1331 |archivedate=2003-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its expressed neutrality, in 1936, Canada began a modest program of rearmament and in 1937, King let Britain know that Canada would support the Empire in case of a war in Europe. He visited Germany in June 1937 and met with [[Adolf Hitler]]. Like many other political leaders of the time, King was seduced by Hitler's charm and rehearsed simplicity and he supported the policy of "[[appeasement]]" of Germany. King and other leaders remained quiet when [[Hitler annexed Austria]] in 1938 and [[Bohemia]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent.html&amp;lang=E&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=13&amp;chapter_id=4&amp;page_id=1 |title=Canada: A People's History - Teacher Resources: Grades 10-12 |publisher=History.cbc.ca |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[anti-Semitism]] in Germany and the growing trickle of refugees arriving in the country, Canada began to actively restrict Jewish immigration by 1938. [[Frederick Charles Blair]], the country's top immigration bureaucrat, raised the amount of money immigrants had to possess to come to Canada from $5,000 to $15,000. As well, immigrants had to prove they were farmers, which no Jew coming from central Europe was. Senator [[Cairine Wilson]] was one of the country's leading voices against fascism and one of the few non-Jews lobbying for the refugees but she was unable to get Mackenzie King to intervene. For King himself shared the anti-Semitism of many Canadians; in his diary he wrote: "We must seek to keep this part of the continent free from unrest and from too great an intermixture of foreign strains of blood."&lt;ref name="history.cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.cbc.ca/history/webdriver?MIval=EpisContent&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=13&amp;chapter_id=4&amp;page_id=2&amp;lang=E |accessdate=November 14, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Through government inaction and Blair's bureaucratic [[Antisemitism in Canada|anti-Semitism]], Canada emerged from the war with one of the worst records of Jewish refugee resettlement in the world. Between 1933 and 1939, Canada accepted only 4,000 of the 800,000 Jews who had escaped from Nazi-controlled Europe."&lt;ref name="history.cbc.ca"/&gt;

==World War II==
{{Main|Military history of Canada during the Second World War}}
[[File:CanadiansdestroyerDieppe.jpg|thumb|Canadian troops resting on board a destroyer after the Combined Operations daylight [[Dieppe Raid|raid on Dieppe]] during World War II.]]
The Canadian economy, like the economies of many other countries, improved in an unexpected way with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. When Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, [[Mackenzie King]] was finally convinced that military action would be necessary, but advised [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], [[Monarchy of Canada|King of Canada]], to wait until September 10, after parliament had debated the matter, to declare war (unlike World War I, when Canada was automatically at war as soon as Britain was).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Granatstein| first=Jack | author-link=Jack Granatstein| title=Going to war?

===Military accomplishments===
One of Canada's major contributions to the war was the [[Commonwealth Air Training Plan]], in which over 140,000 Allied pilots and air crews received training at bases in Canada. Canada is widely recognized for its key role in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].  The first major land actions of the war, at Hong Kong and [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe]], were unsuccessful. The bulk of Canadian land forces remained undeployed until the landings in Sicily and Italy in 1943. In 1944, Canadian forces successfully captured [[Juno Beach]] during the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], and by the autumn, an entire field army under Canadian command was instrumental in liberating the Netherlands, for which many Dutch still fondly remember Canadians today.

===Women===
Women began to play a more significant part in war efforts, joining the armed forces for the first time (aside from nursing) by means of the Canadian Women's Army Corps, the Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division, and the Royal Canadian Naval Women's Service (Wrens).&lt;ref name="proud"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/propaganda-and-the-second-world-war/im-the-proudest-girl-in-the-world.html 'I'm the proudest girl in the world!'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112010432/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/propaganda-and-the-second-world-war/im-the-proudest-girl-in-the-world.html |date=November 12, 2016 }}, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Although women were still not allowed to enter combat, they performed a number of other roles in clerical, administrative, and communications divisions. A total of 45,423 women enlisted during the course of the war, and one in nine served overseas.&lt;ref name = "proud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overseas"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/on-every-front-canadian-women-in-the-second-world-war/canadian-women-serving-overseas.html Canadian women serving overseas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130035854/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/on-every-front-canadian-women-in-the-second-world-war/canadian-women-serving-overseas.html |date=November 30, 2016 }}, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

With over a million Canadians serving in the Armed Forces during the war, enormous new employment opportunities appeared for women in workplaces previously unknown to them. To encourage women to work in factories, machine shops, and other heavy industries, the Canadian government offered free child-care and tax breaks. [[Elsie MacGill]], an aeronautical engineer who supervised the production of [[Hawker Hurricane]] aircraft for the [[Canadian Car and Foundry|Canada Car and Foundry]] Company became a celebrated war hero known as "Queen of the Hurricanes."&lt;ref name="rosie"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/on-every-front-canadian-women-in-the-second-world-war/canadas-own-rosie.html Canada's own 'Rosie'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130024350/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/on-every-front-canadian-women-in-the-second-world-war/canadas-own-rosie.html |date=November 30, 2016 }}, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aid to the United Kingdom===
[[File:Monumento ottawa.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Monument to the Canadian soldiers who fought in [[World War II]], in [[Ottawa]].]]
The ''Gander Air Base'' now known as [[Gander International Airport]] built in 1936 in the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was leased by the UK to Canada for 99 years because of its urgent need for the movement of fighter and bomber aircraft to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=C.P. | last=Stacey | title=Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada 1939-1945 | year=1970 | pages=361, 374, 377 | publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada gave the United Kingdom gifts totalling $3.5 billion during the war; the UK used it to buy Canadian food and war supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.

===The conscription crisis of 1944===
{{Main|Conscription Crisis of 1944}}
As in World War I, the number of volunteers began to run dry as the war dragged on. Mackenzie King had promised, like Borden, not to introduce conscription, though his position was somewhat ambiguous: as he declared to the House of Commons on June 10, 1942: "Not necessarily conscription but conscription if necessary."

With rising pressure from the people, on June 21, 1940, King passed the ''National Resources Mobilization Act'' (NRMA) which gave the government the power to "call out every man in Canada for military training for the defence of Canada", and only Canada. Conscripts could not be sent overseas to fight. English Canadians, expectedly, were displeased and took to calling these soldiers "zombies" who they stereotyped as French Canadians who were "sitting comfortably" while their countrymen died.

On April 27, 1942, Mackenzie King held a national plebiscite to decide on the issue, having made campaign promises to avoid conscription (and, it is thought, winning the election on that very point). The majority of English Canadians voted in favour of the conscription, while the majority of French Canadians did not. Nevertheless, the final result was a yes, which granted King the permission to bring in a conscription law if he wanted. However, the issue was put off for another two years, until November 1944 when King decided on a levy of NRMA troops for overseas service. There were riots in Quebec and a [[Terrace Mutiny|mutiny]] by conscripts based in [[Terrace, British Columbia]]. An aged Henri Bourassa also spoke out against the decision.

Some 13,000 NRMA men eventually left Canada, but only 2,463 reached units in the field before the end of the fighting. 69 died in battle. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Japanese internment===
{{Main|Japanese Canadian internment}}
[[File:JapaneseCanadian-Confiscating-Boat.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Canadian Navy|R.C.N.]] officer questions [[Japanese-Canadian]] fisherman while confiscating their boat.]]
When Canada declared war on Japan in December 1941, members of the non-Japanese population of British Columbia, including municipal government offices, local newspapers and businesses called for the internment of the Japanese. In [[British Columbia]], some claimed that Japanese residents who worked in the fishing industry were charting the coastline for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese navy]], and many of their boats were confiscated. The pressure from the public was so great that early in 1942 the government gave in to the pressure and began the internment of both Japanese nationals and [[Japanese Canadians|Japanese Canadian]] citizens. Most of the nearly 22,000 people of [[Japanese Canadians|Japanese]] descent who lived in Canada were naturalized or native-born citizens.&lt;ref name="cbc-ji"&gt;[http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent.html&amp;lang=E&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=14&amp;chapter_id=3&amp;page_id=3 Japanese Internment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221171803/http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent.html&amp;lang=E&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=14&amp;chapter_id=3&amp;page_id=3 |date=December 21, 2008 }} - [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Those unwilling to live in internment camps faced the possibility of deportation to Japan.

Unlike [[Japanese American internment]], where families were generally kept together, Canada initially sent its male evacuees to road camps in the British Columbian interior, to [[sugar beet]] projects on the [[Prairie]]s, or to internment in a [[POW camp]] in [[Ontario]], while women and children were moved to six inland British Columbia towns. There, the living conditions were so poor that the citizens of wartime Japan even sent supplemental food shipments through the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="uwash"&gt;[http://www.lib.washington.edu/subject/Canada/internment/intro.html Japanese Canadian Internment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613054742/http://www.lib.washington.edu/subject/Canada/internment/intro.html |date=June 13, 2007 }}, University of Washington Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of detention, the Canadian government spent one-third the per capita amount expended by the U.S. on Japanese American evacuees.&lt;ref name="uwash"/&gt;

'''Carlo Giovanni Maria Denina''' (1731, [[Revello]] – 5 December 1813, Paris) was an Italian historian.

He was born at [[Revello]], [[Piedmont]], in 1731, and was educated at [[Saluzzo]] and [[Turin]]. In 1753 he was appointed to the chair of humanity at [[Pinerolo]], but he was soon compelled by the influence of the [[Jesuits]] to retire from it. In 1756 he graduated as doctor in [[theology]], and began authorship with a theological treatise.

Promoted to the professorship of humanity and rhetoric in the college of Turin, he published (1769–1770) his ''Delle revoluzioni d'Italia'', the work on which his reputation is mainly founded. Collegiate honors accompanied the issue of its successive volumes, which, however, at the same time multiplied his foes and stimulated their hatred.

In 1782, at [[Frederick the Great]]'s invitation, he went to Berlin, where he remained for many years, in the course of which he published his ''Vie et régne de Frédéric II'' (Berlin, 1788) and ''La Prusse littéraire sous Frédéric II'' (3 vols., Berlin, 1790–1791). His ''Delle revoluzioni della Germania'' was published at [[Florence]] in 1804, in which year he went to [[Paris]] as the imperial librarian, on the invitation of [[Napoleon]]. At Paris he published in 1805 his ''Tableau de la Haute Italie, et des Alpes qui l'entourent''. He died there in 1813.

The French politician and poet [[Joseph Aurèle de Bossi]] studied law under his direction.

== Works ==
Carlo Denina left a great many mnumber of works, most of them in Italian, including:
*1760: ''Discours sur les vicissitudes de la littérature'';
*1770: ''Révolutions d'Italie'', [[1769]] et [[1820]] (translated by abbé Jardin from 1770) ;

As a financier and representative of the [[Fugger]]s he provided the financial backing to [[Ferdinand Magellan|Ferdinand Magellan's]] 1519 voyage, the first [[circumnavigation]] around the world.&lt;ref name=bergreen&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]| title=Over the Edge of the World| publisher=Harper Perennial, 2004| page=37f |isbn=0-06-621173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother Jacob de Haro headed a commercial firm based in [[Antwerp]].  Christopher de Haro, as a representative of this firm, had been based in Lisbon and later joined Magellan in [[Spain]].{{Ref|leite}}    

Christopher de Haro had a dispute with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] king, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], and as a result left Lisbon and moved to Seville. There he met again with Magellan whom he knew from Lisbon. Familiar with the secret Portuguese expeditions, he thought Magellan's plan was worthy of his financial backing. He provided about one-quarter of the cost of Magellan's expedition directly. Three-quarters of the cost was defrayed by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], much of it loaned by Haro at high interest.&lt;ref name=bergreen/&gt;

The author [[Maximilianus of Transylvania]] (Maximilianus Transylvanus) was married to Frances, daughter of Jacob de Haro, and was thus well-positioned to write the first account of Magellan's voyage, which was published in 1523.  Transylvanus had observed that de Haro had assisted Magellan and [[Ruy Faleiro]] considerably in presenting their proposals before the Spanish royal counselors.{{Ref|Joyner}}

'''Claro Abánades López''' (12 August 1879 – 16 December 1973) was a Spanish journalist, publisher, historian and a [[Carlist]] activist. His career of a journalist lasted over 70 years (1897–1969), though he is rather known as author of studies on history of [[La Alcarria|Alcarria]] and as editor of monumental multi-volume series of [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]] works.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Molina de Aragon2.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Molina de Aragón]]]]
Claro Abánades López was born to a [[working class]] family from tierra alcarreña, a natural region covering mostly what is now the [[Guadalajara Province|Guadalajara province]]. His father, [[Pedro Abánades Jiménez]] (1847–1907), was a construction contractor.&lt;ref&gt;“master de obras”, ''La Torre de Aragón'' 15.01.07, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/pdf.raw?query=parent%3A0004276617+type%3Apress%2Fpage&amp;name=La+Torre+de+Arag%C3%B3n.+15-1-1907%2C+no.+5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his mother, Antonia López del Rey.&lt;ref&gt;she was born in [[Anchuela del Pedregal]] to Mauricio López and María del Rey, see Claro Abánades' certificate of birth, available [http://postimg.org/image/s5e73e2dz/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 5 children, Claro born as the second oldest son; all were raised in a profoundly Catholic ambience. He was first educated in the local [[Molina de Aragón|molinese]] Colegio de Santa Clara, a primary school ran by the [[Poor Clares]] order, later to join [[Colegio Molines de los Padres Escolapios]] (Escuelas Pias), a prestigious provincial secondary education establishment; it is there he gained the bachelor title.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Pablo Calero Delso, ''Claro Abánades López'', [in:] ''Diccionario Biográfico de la Guadalajara Contemporánea'' online, 29.12.13, available [http://bioguada.blogspot.com/2013/12/claro-Abánades-lopez.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Claro intended to pursue law in [[Madrid]], but financial standing of his parents did not allow regular studies; in 1899 he entered Facultad de Derecho of [[:es:Universidad de Madrid|Universidad Central]] (later to become [[Universidad Complutense]]) as an unenrolled student.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Having graduated at an unspecified date he went on studying philosophy and letters, obtaining diploma in Sección de Historia in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;and later “doctorado” in philosophy in 1906, Gonzalo Díaz Díaz, ''Hombres y documentos de la filosofía española'', vol. 1, Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788400081454}}, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Some time afterwards he became a Doctor in both disciplines,&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013, Tomas Gismera Velasco, ''Claro Abánades Lopez'', [in:] ''Biografias de gentes de Guadalajara'' 13.12.2013, available [http://gentesdeguadalajara.blogspot.com/2013/12/claro-Abánades-lopez.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Spanish education system of the time the title which enabled him to teach in primary or secondary schools.

Claro Abánades married Natalia Arpa, originating from [[Torrijos, Spain|Torrijos]] in the [[Toledo province]]. They initially lived in Molina de Aragón; in 1907 the family moved to Madrid, settling at calle Jesús del Valle in the university quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Claro was employed as professor at [[Colegio de la Concepción (Madrid)|Colegio de la Concepción]], a prestigious education institution for the privileged and the wealthy. The college remained his primary workplace for unspecified time; in the early 1930s he was already reported as headmaster of another Madrid secondary school, [[Colegio San Ildefonso (Madrid)|Colegio San Ildefonso]], offering a complete Catholic curriculum from kindergarten to bachillerato,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 30.09.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000516103&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; involved in education activities as late as in the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;in 1943 he was Director Técn. de la Sección de Bachillerato del Colegio de Terciarias Franciscanas de la Divina Pastora de Madrid, Claro Abánades López, ''La Madre Mogas: Bosquejo de una vida santa'', Madrid 1943, front page, see [http://sibhilla.uab.cat/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/scripts/?IsisScript=iah.xis&amp;lang=es&amp;base=fons&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp;exprSearch=ABÁNADES%20LOPEZ,%20CLARO&amp;indexSearch=AU_ here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 3 children: Claro Pedro, Mariano and María de los Angeles. The older son, born already in Molina, worked as a journalist;&lt;ref&gt;''Acción. Diario de Teruel y su provincia'', 10.04.34, available [http://bibliotecavirtual.aragon.es/bva/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3702753 here]&lt;/ref&gt; the younger one became a professor at another secondary school in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Manuel Orozco, Don Mariano y la natación sincronizada, [in:] Colegia Infanta Maria Teresa service, available [https://historiasdelinfanta.wordpress.com/profesores/1977-don-mariano-y-la-natacion-sincronizada/ here]; he graduated in 1926, see ''ABC'' 02.10.26, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1926/10/02/pagina-18/33253989/pdf.html here] and was later very well remembered by his pupils, see huerfanosinfanta service, available [http://huerfanosinfanta.blogspot.com/2012/04/el-eterno-director.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:BNN.81.2.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|''La Torre de Aragón'']]
Abánades started his journalist career in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;in 1897 in the local ''La Cronica de Guadalajara'' he published a series of articles titled ''Geografia descriptiva del Señorio de Molina'', Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; gradually commencing co-operation with many provincial periodicals regardless of their political outlook.&lt;ref&gt;like a republican ''El Molinés'', a liberal ''La Crónica'', a Catholic ''Flores y Abejas'' and many others, though contributing most frequently to ''La Ilustración Diocesana Seguntina'', the first periodical he joined as member of the editorial board, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions ranged from history to politics, literature and customs; touring the province he also kept sending local correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;at one point he had to flee one of the locations, [[Maranchón]], whose inhabitants found his correspondence on the town, published in ''La Crónica'', offending, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 he co-founded&lt;ref&gt;Angel Monterde Navarro&lt;/ref&gt; a petty new journal, ''La Torre de Aragón'';&lt;ref&gt;an 8-page weekly edited from his house at Calle del Chorro, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; though not defined politically,&lt;ref&gt;the authors defined themselves as “católicos sinceros” holding the banner of “patria y honor’, ''La Torre de Aragón'' entry at ''emerotecadigital'' service, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/details.vm?lang=es&amp;q=id:0004276416 here]&lt;/ref&gt; it pursued a [[Social Catholicism|social-Catholic]] line.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. promoting the campaign to set up Cajas Rurales in the comarca, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Following differences with his partner&lt;ref&gt;the periodical ceased to exist in 1907, ''La Torre de Aragón'' entry at ''Hemerotecadigital'' service&lt;/ref&gt; in 1908 he launched an own weekly, ''El Vigia de la Torre''.&lt;ref&gt;though managed together with a local Carlist entrepreneur Clodoaldo Mielgo Castel, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It assumed more militant tone, claiming to have been the unique genuinely Catholic periodical in the province.&lt;ref&gt;and having been allegedly published “con la aprobación y censura ecclesiástica”, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One work described it as Catholic, though formatted along the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] pattern;&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; another one claims that both weeklies revealed a clear Carlist leaning.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Pablo Calero Delso, ''Los curas trabucaires. Iglesia y carlismo en Guadalajara (1868–1876)'', [in:] ''Iglesia y religiosidad en España: historia y archivos : actas de las V Jornadas de Castilla-La Mancha sobre investigación en archivos'', Guadalajara 2001-2, {{ISBN|8493165859}}, p. 375. Once he moved to the capital, Abánades was gradually losing control over ''El Vigia'', which he ceased to support some time afterwards&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910–1914 in Madrid Abánades three times unsuccessfully attempted to launch a local weekly of the Carlist youth: ''Juventud Tradicionalista'',&lt;ref&gt;as a private enterprise, Calero Delso 2013, Gismera Velasco 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Combate''&lt;ref&gt;official weekly of the Carlist youth organisation; only one number was issued, [[:es:José Navarro Cabanes|José Navarro Cabanes]], ''Apuntes bibliográficos de la prensa carlista'', Valencia 1917, pp. 276-7&lt;/ref&gt; and ''El Cruzado''.&lt;ref&gt;Navarro Cabanes 1917, pp. 280-1&lt;/ref&gt; His career in full-blown national newspaper commenced in 1914, when he was invited to contribute to ''[[:es:El Correo Español|El Correo Español]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gismera Velasco 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the official Carlist daily.&lt;ref&gt;in terms of circulation it was laggining behind most popular national newspapers, but enjoyed some sort of prestige as having been in print for 28 years already&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming member of its [[editorial board]],&lt;ref&gt;''Revista general de enseñanza y bellas artes'' 01.04.16, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003993682&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1919 Abánades left ''El Correo'' during the [[Mellismo|Mellista]] breakup in the party. The same year he became editor-in-chief of ''[[El Pensamiento Español]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gismera Velasco 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a journal intended to be the piecemouth of the new Mellist party, and kept managing the paper until it ceased to exist in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During the dictatorship Abánades co-operated with a vast array of dailies, be it national ones like ''[[El Día (Spanish daily of 1920s)|El Día]]'' and ''[[:es:La Nación (España)|La Nación]]''&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; or local ones, like the [[Gipuzkoa]]n ''[[:es:La Constancia (1897-1936)|La Constancia]]''&lt;ref&gt;''La Constancia'' 30.11.23, available [http://liburutegidigitala.donostiakultura.com/Liburutegiak/download.php?fich=LA+CONSTANCIA%2F1923%2F11%2F30%2F0001.pdf&amp;path=PDF here]&lt;/ref&gt; or the Toledan ''El Castellano'',&lt;ref&gt;''El Castellano'' 06.12.22&lt;/ref&gt; contributing also to weeklies like ''[[La Ilustración Española y Americana]]'' or ''Le Touriste'' and unsuccessfully renewing attempts to manage own periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;''La Tribuna'' and ''Orden'', Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; During the Republic he contributed initially to ''[[:es:La Correspondencia Militar|La Correspondencia Militar]]'', in 1932 emerging as its top comentator,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia Militar'' 20.01.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002276594&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though starting 1933 he switched mostly to ''[[El Siglo Futuro]]'', formally entering its editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 29.11.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000566308&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He kept publishing also in other Catholic papers, be it local dailies like Navarrese ''[[:es:Diario de Navarra|Diario de Navarra]]'' and even Canarian ''Gaceta de Tenerife''&lt;ref&gt;''Gaceta de Tenerife'' 08.03.35, available [http://h3.bbtk.ull.es/pandora/cgi-bin/Pandora.exe?fn=commandselect;query=id:0003604198;command=download_pdf;tampon=La%20Gaceta%20de%20Tenerife%20(Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife)%2008/03/1935.%20P%C3%A1gina%201;nombre_pdf=La%20Gaceta%20de%20Tenerife-08.03.1935-pagina%20001 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or weeklies like ''[[:es:La Hormiga de Oro|La Hormiga de oro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''La Hormiga de Oro'' 25.08.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012119484&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He is not known to have published in two leading national newspapers, the monarchist ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' and the Catholic ''[[El Debate]]''.

After the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Abánades was active mostly in [[Prensa Asociata]], the agency he formed part of already before the war and where he remained during the early [[Francoist]] years.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He also briefly managed an unidentified periodical named “Lúmen”&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated with a number of other titles,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1963 with ''Nueva Alcarria'' promoting tourism in the area, ''ABC'' 14.02.63, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1963/02/14/043.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; above all with ''[[:es:El Alcázar (España)|El Alcázar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 03.10.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1943/10/03/030.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; one of key dailies in the [[Falangist]] propaganda machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013, though he does not appear as engaged until at least 1948, see Jordi Rodriguez Virgili, ''La cooperativa del diario “El Alcázar”'', [in:] ''Historia y comunicación social'' 5 (2000), pp. 171-187&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s he became one of the seniors of the Spanish press corps; in 1947, 50 years after commencing his newspaper career, he was awarded the [[order of Alfonso X the Wise]] as “veterano periodista”&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 22.04.47, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1947/04/22/005.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was later named Periodista de Honor by [[:es:Asociación de la Prensa de Madrid|Asociación de la Prensa de Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;Gismera Velasco 2013&lt;/ref&gt; becoming its oldest member.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 18.07.75, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1975/07/18/025.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; His latest newspaper piece identified comes from 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Claro Abánades, ''Mella, cantor der Catolicismo'', [in:] ''Portavoz del Circulo Vazquez de Mella'' 3 (1969), p. 10, available [http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/ppc/VM/VM_a1969m8-9n3.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalist profile==
[[File:BNN.81.21.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|''[[:es:La Correspondencia Militar|Correspondencia Militar]]'']]
Apart from privately owned, small and ephemeral newspapers, Abánades was heading a major periodical only during his 1919–1923 tenure at ''El Pensamiento Español''; he is also known as forming part of editorial board of ''El Correo Español'' and ''El Siglo Futuro''. None of the sources consulted claims he headed a section or held jobs in middle management editorial structures; in case of the remaining 30-odd titles he seems to have contributed as a correspondent. Though his juvenile pieces covered a wide range of topics, later on Abánades specialised in three areas.&lt;ref&gt;apart from purely editorial work and unsigned pieces; none of the sources consulted provides any information on his would-be pen-names&lt;/ref&gt; He supplied weeklies and in some cases dailies with articles focusing on history of Spain and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in particular, often a byproduct of his own research.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''La Hormiga de Oro'' 25.08.32&lt;/ref&gt; As [[editor-in-chief]] of ''El Pensamiento Español'' he took part in ongoing political debates, advocating political cause of the Mellistas; later on, during the 1920s and especially the 1930s, this thread was transformed as writings on history and doctrine of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''El Siglo Futuro'' 29.01.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000535941&amp;page=1 here]	&lt;/ref&gt; usually formatted as more or less direct homages to [[Juan Vázquez de Mella|Vazquez de Mella]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 08.08.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000514005&amp;page=3 here] or ''El Siglo Futuro'' 26.02.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000522128&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he made his name mostly as foreign affairs comentator.&lt;ref&gt;even fairly distant ones, like the Chinese-Japanese war, see ''La Correspondencia Militar'' 02.02.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002276860&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings, usually medium-size essays of some 500 words, followed major events; their author aimed to inform the readers about international background of specific developments, their logic and implications. Some of them appear questionable; his piece on the [[Greek revolution of 1922]] seems to confuse cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;''El Castellano'' 06.12.22, available [http://biblioteca2.uclm.es/biblioteca/CECLM/ARTREVISTAS/Toledo/Castellano/Pdf/4017.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Most turned out to be quite accurate, like his 1923 prediction that having won the war [[France]] found itself isolated and was not in position to safeguard status quo negotiated in [[Versailles Treaty|Versailles]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Constancia'' 30.11.23&lt;/ref&gt; or his 1932 analysis denouncing European collective security systems as unstable and forecasting the advent of power-based politics.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia Militar'' 20.01.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002276594&amp;page=1&amp;search=Abánades&amp;lang=es%20or%20http://biblioteca2.uclm.es/biblioteca/CECLM/ARTREVISTAS/Toledo/Castellano/Pdf/4017.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Abánades’ comments were plagued by political bias, especially by his anti-[[Republicanism|Republican]] and anti-[[British Empire|British]] views.&lt;ref&gt;by no means atypical for Spanish Right, Carlism and other groups, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 here].

Abánades’ vision of European political developments in the 1930s was derived from his germanophile&lt;ref&gt;as late as 1923 he appeared in Asociación Nacional Alemana de Empleados do Comercio, ''El Sol'' 18.01.23, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/pdf.raw?query=id:0000266782&amp;lang=es&amp;log=00000000-00000-00001/ here]; he was rewarded with the German Hoher Orden vom Schwarzen Adler, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and conservative outlook. Sympathetic towards the [[Central Powers]] during the First World War, he considered Versailles treaty responsible for long-lasting crisis in international relations. Before [[Hitler]]’s ascension to power he noted that [[Nazi Party|his party]] was “admirably organized on the national basis“ and hoped that ruled by the Rightist alliance, [[Germany]] would be an example to follow when it comes to confronting “communists, anarchists and those who support them with money, namely the Jews and their branch, the freemasonry”.&lt;ref&gt;“el bloque derechista aleimán nos da la pauta a seguir para oponer en la Europa occidental nuevas fuerzas contra las cuales se estrellen las propagandas de comunistas, anarquistas, y las de los que las sostienen con su dinero y sus alientos, que no son otros que los judíos, y su rama filial, la masonería”, ''La Correspondencia Militar'' 23.03.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002277809&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the assassination of [[Dolfuss]] he shifted his sympathy to the [[Belgian]] [[Rexist Party|Rexists]]&lt;ref&gt;who proposed to do away with "el régimen liberal caduco y estéril" in defense of religion and family; [[Leon Degrelle]] was applauded as "un caudillo joven y valeroso" who will help the Catholic idea to triumph across Europe, Javier Ugarte Telleria, ''En l’esprit des années trente europeo: la actitud del Diario de Navarra y Garcilaso en la primavera de 1936'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 209 (1996), p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular to the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]]. Always demonstrating respect and esteem for [[Benito Mussolini]],&lt;ref&gt;in the 1920s he was impressed by Italian fascism and kept endorsing it in his publications, also in a paradoxically titled “Mussolini no quiere ser un dictator”, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; he titled his 1936 commentary on [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Abyssinian war]] “Italia tiene su Imperio”, the headline with a highly nostalgic tone in Spain;&lt;ref&gt;according to Abánades, in Italy the „men of action” prevailed over „men of politics”, Ugarte Telleria 1996, p. 650&lt;/ref&gt; he did not miss the opportunity to declare the British the true losers of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Telleria 1996, 650&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his work as a journalist Abánades was active also as a writer. He published a number of books and booklets; he wrote some of them himself, some were co-authored and in some cases he edited writings produced by the others. His work falls chiefly into 3 areas: drama, history and Carlism, the last two at times hardly distinguishable.

His original contribution consists mostly of historical works related to the Alcarra region. The first to be mentioned is ''El Señorío de Molina. Estudio histórico geográfico'', monumental 6-volume study which has never been published;&lt;ref&gt;and remains in the municipal Molina archives, ''ABC'' 22.12.73, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1973/12/22/049.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; its scaled-down versions were ''La Ciudad de Molina'' (1952), ''El Real Señorío Molinés. Compendio de su historia'' (1966), ''Diego Sánchez Portocarrero'' (1966) and ''Tierra molinesa. Breve estudio geográfico de sus pueblo'' (1969), leaving also other related unedited studies in the archive.&lt;ref&gt;''La Casa Comunidad de Villa y Tierra'', ''Geografia histórica de los pueblos del Real Señorio'', ''Hijos ilustres de la comarca molinesa'' and ''El Cabildo Eclesiastico de Molina'', Antonio Herrera Casado, ''Molina de Aragón: veinte siglos de historia'', Guadalajara 2000, {{ISBN|9788495179425}}, pp. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat different focus is at work at ''La Reina del Señorío'' (1929), the work dedicated to sanctuary of [[:es:Santuario de la Virgen de la Hoz|Virgen de la Hoz]], the works on local history completed by ''El alcazar de Molina: la Fábrica de Artillería de Corduente'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;José N. Alcalá-Zamora, ''Altos hornos y poder naval en la España de la edad moderna'', Madrid 1999, {{ISBN|9788489512238}}, p. 129, Emilio Benedicto Gimeno, José Antonio Mateos Royo, ''La minería aragonesa en la cordillera ibérica durante los siglos XVI y XVII'', Zaragoza 2013, {{ISBN|9788415770053}}, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of historical publications unrelated to Guadalajara province,&lt;ref&gt;''Una excursión a Toledo'' (1907), ''Guadalalete y Covadonga'' (1911), ''Hernán Cortés y la conquista de Méjico'' (1923), ''Avanzada de Castilla'' (1936), and ''La Madre Mogas. Bosquejo de una vida santa'' (1943), Díaz Díaz 2003, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apuntes, para una Historia, del Colegio de Madrid de Doctores y Licenciados en Ciencias y Letras'' (1949)&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.02.50, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1950/02/12/044.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; provides valuable insight into the history of Madrid educational structures.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Javier Peralta, ''Representación matemática en el Colegio de Doctores y Licenciados de Madrid (1899 - 1949)'', [in:] ''Avances de Investigación en Educación Matemática'' 85 (2004), pp. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, other historical studies remain in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Like ''La Madre Humildad. Biografía de la Madre Serra'', ''Fundadora y Fundación. Biografía de Sor Joaquina López Alcázar'', ''Geografía especial de España'', ''Historia de la civilización española'', ''Historia de la literatura latina'' and ''La existencia real de Pedro Crespo'', see ''virgendelahoz'' service, available [http://virgendelahoz.com/Primera%20parte.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his merits, Abánades was nominated Cronista Oficial and Hijo Predilecto of Molina de Aragón.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013, Gismera Velasco 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Zumalacarregui portrait.png|thumb|160px|right|[[Zumalacárregui]]]]
Abánades’ contribution to Carlist literature is probably mostly about his monumental, 31-volume edition of all works of Vazquez de Mella, published in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;1.'' Selección de Elocuencia e Historia'', 2. ''Ideario''. T. I., 3. ''Ideario''. T. II., 4. ''Ideario''. T. III., 5. ''La persecución religiosa y la Iglesia, independiente del Estado ateo'', 6. ''Discursos parlamentarios''. T. I., 7. ''Discursos parlamentarios''. T. II., 8. ''Discursos parlamentarios''. T. III, 9. ''Discursos parlamentarios''. T. IV., 10. ''Discursos parlamentarios''. T. V., 11. ''Discursos parlamentarios''. T. VI, 12. ''Dogmas nacionales''., 13. ''Política general''. T. I., 14. ''Política general''. T. II, 15. ''Política tradicionalista'' T. I., 16. ''Política tradicionalista''. T. II., 17. ''Crítica''. T. I., 18. ''Crítica'' T. II., 19. ''Filosofía. Teología. Apologética''. T. I., 20. ''Flosofía. Teología. Apologética''. T. II., 21. ''Filosofía. Teología. Apologética''. T. III., 22. ''Filosofía. Teología. Apologética''. T. IV., 23. ''Temas internacionales''., 24. ''Temas sociales''. T. I., 25. ''Temas sociales''. T. II., 26. ''Regionalismo''. T. I., 27. ''Regionalismo''. T. II., 28. ''El pensamiento de Mella''., 29. ''Juicios sobre Mella''., 30. ''Índice cronológico y temático''., 31. ''Vázquez de Mella y la educación nacional''.&lt;/ref&gt; and supplemented by own synthetic attempt, ''Doctrina tradicionalista de las obras de Mella'' (1935). Works retaining historical profile are ''La Casa de los Tradicionalistas'' (1918), ''Leyendas y Tradiciones'' (1923), ''Carlos V de España'' (1935), ''Centenario del Tradicionalismo Español'' (1935), ''Carlos VI, Conde de Montemolín'' (1936), ''Carlos VII, Duque de Madrid'' (1936), ''Balmes'' (1936), ''Las predicciones de Mella'' (1940) and ''Dinastia insobornable'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;Gismera Velasco 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, publications intended as current political leaflets are ''Filosofía de la vida'' (1911), ''El peligro de España'' (1914), ''El año germanófilo'' (1915), ''La legitimidad'' and ''¿Quién es el Rey, de derecho en España?'' (1916), ''La resurrección de Don Quijote'' (1921), ''Un verano, por el Mediodía de Francia'' (1928) and ''Gibraltar y Tánger'' (1929).

The last and the least-known part of Abánades’ works is this related to the theatre. Probably in the very early years of the 20th century he wrote ''La mano de una madre'', a drama played at various opportunities at Teatro Calderón in Molina in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s he was active in Madrid as amateur actor in cultural associations like [[Sociedad Española de Arte]];&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 09.05.28, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1928/05/09/036.html here], ''ABC'' 25.03.31, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1931/03/25/042.htm here] l&lt;/ref&gt; he also founded a theatrical group “Nosotros”, based in Casa de Guadalajara in Madrid and active between 1934 and 1938. Finally, Abánades kept delivering public lectures, be it either on history of Molina,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 12.01.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000520322&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; on Virgen de la Hoz&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.06.44, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1944/06/17/017.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; or on de Mella and Traditionalist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 10.01.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000571331&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlist: ''Restauración''==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
In the late 19th century the Guadalajara provincial Carlism lost much of its previous appeal, reduced mostly to support among peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2001-2, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of political preferences of Pedro Abánades Jiménez, though he was allegedly proud of his son’s beginnings of a conservative Catholic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;''La Torre de Aragón'' 15.01.07, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/pdf.raw?query=parent%3A0004276617+type%3Apress%2Fpage&amp;name=La+Torre+de+Arag%C3%B3n.+15-1-1907%2C+no.+5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from journalism, Claro served the cause also as an enthusiastic local Carlist activist; in 1896 he was elected president of [[Juventud Católica]] in Molina&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founded [[La Benéfica Molinesa]], a Catholic social fund.&lt;ref&gt;together with Manuel Gómez de Llerena, Francisco Iturbe, Claudio Josa, Celestino Marco y Pedro Granje. He was its treasurer until 1908, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to his work Señorio de Molina became the most dynamic Carlist county in the province, though he animated party structures also beyond Castile; he is noted as active in the neighboring [[Teruel Province|Teruel]],&lt;ref&gt;like in 1897, Jordi Canal i Morell, ''Banderas blancas, boinas rojas: una historia política del carlismo, 1876–1939'', Madrid 2006, {{ISBN|8496467341}}, 9788496467347, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. in 1897 co-organising the propaganda tour of [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|marquis de Cerralbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''La revitalización política del carlismo a fines del siglo XIX: los viajes de propaganda del Marqués de Cerralbo'', [in:] ''Studia Zamorensia'' 3 (1996), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of provincial leader, [[José de Sagarmínaga]], the new one [[Pablo Marín Alonso]] considered Abánades one of the future alcarreña leaders and directed him towards the press propaganda, possibly resulting in launching two periodicals in 1906 and 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[Juventud Jaimista]] homage meeting in a Madrid restaurant in 1911 Abánades first met Juan Vazquez de Mella, the encounter which shaped his political future and theoretical outlook for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;many Carlists were present in Madrid, as they came to attend the Congreso Eucaristico, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately became one of de Mella’s followers, the faction increasingly at odds with the Carlist claimant. Though during the First World War [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaime III]] officially backed neutral stance leaning towards the [[Entente Cordiale|Entente]], in 1915 Abánades together with Manuel Abelló and de Mella published ''El año germanófilo'', dubbed “perfect manual of a germanophile”, and kept delivering pro-German lectures.&lt;ref&gt;“Germany is the most chivalrous nation while Iberia is the Latin race capable of pursuing great objectives and serving all the humanity. Germany was persecuted; it was England trying to snatch away its commerce and industry, as it has done with ours. Today Germany is a giant nation gallantly flying its colors; it keeps fighting the most formidable duel of the centuries. We do not intend to intervene in the struggle of two peoples, taking place in the centre of the world. Longing for peace, we want to establish sympathy between the Spaniards and the Germans; inspired by reasons put forward by our great man, Juan Vazquez de Mella, we want to set up an alliance with Germany to make sure that in the times to come unredeemed territories come back to the Spanish nation”, full text available [https://archive.org/stream/elanogermanofilo00madruoft/elanogermanofilo00madruoft_djvu.txt. here]&lt;/ref&gt; It was de Mella who invited him to join ''El Correo Español'', the official party newspaper that two opposing Carlist factions competed to control. Finally, in 1919 Abánades followed de Mella when he was expulsed from the party.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Juan Vazquez de Mella 1906.JPG|thumbnail|160px|[[Juan Vazquez de Mella]]]]
The years of 1919–1923 mark the climax of Abánades’ political career, as it was the only period when he emerged from the party back benches. Though he did not hold any major posts in the newly emergent Mellist organization, [[:es:Partido Católico Tradicionalista|Partido Tradicionalista]]&lt;ref&gt;he is not listed among provincial party leaders, Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; and by historians he is not counted among key Mellistas,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; he was entrusted with the task of managing the party newspaper, ''El Pensamiento Español''. Abánades propagated political line of his leader, speaking against taking any official posts,&lt;ref&gt;as that would be repeating the liberal crime, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; lambasting idea of a right-wing monarchist party&lt;ref&gt;the vision promoted by ''El Debate''; he went on saying that “mejor seía pedir la adhesión de las extremas derechas a un Ministerio o a un soberano efectivo; de ningun modo a quien no lo es”, quoted after Andrés Martín 2000, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; and especially voicing mistrust towards some conciliatory gestures made by [[Alfonso XIII]] versus Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;like spiritual subordination of Spain to Jesus in 1919 and criticism of liberal parliamentarism, which allowed ''El Debate'' to recommend Alfonso XIII to the Carlists as “tradicionalista convencido y hasta antiparlamentario”. Abánades responded writing that “antiliberal por el discurso del Cerro de los Angeles, y como antiparlamentario por el de Córdoba; pero como un cautivo del sistema liberal y parlamentario [...] para qué invita a las extremas derechas? Paraque rompan el cautiverio o para qué sean cautivos también”?, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated derogation of [[:es:Constitución española de 1876|1876 constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;“necesario exitrpar también el regimen escrito”, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; and building an entirely new Traditionalist regime, possibly based on military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;“Debemes seguir el ejemplo de los legitimistas lusitanos”, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; At the time when political system of [[Restoration (Spain)|Restauración]] was falling into pieces and two major [[:es:Bipartidismo en España|partidos turnistas]] were rapidly disintegrating, it might have appeared that an anti-establishment extreme-Right alliance envisioned by de Mella could grow into a major player on the Spanish political scene. However, Mellismo proved ineffective as agglutinatory force and decomposed in the early 1920s;&lt;ref&gt;La Asamblea de Zaragoza of October 1922, animated by [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Victor Pradera]], delivered a deadly blow to Mellismo, Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 237-241&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Pensamiento Español'' ceasing to exist.

==Carlist: dictatorship, republic and Francoism==

Unlike most [[Mellismo|Mellistas]] who left the party to pursue their career elsewhere, Abánades was one of the few faithful and remained also a personal friend of Mella, who withdrew from politics.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 22.12.73, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1973/12/22/049.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; This boiled down to his political isolation during [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship; Abánades was active neither in semi-official Carlist structures nor in official primoderiverista institutions. In 1931–1932 together with many already orphaned former Mellistas he reconciled with the new Carlist king [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos]] and joined the united Carlist organization, [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]]. He did not assume major posts, merely forming part of Junta del Círculo Tradicionalista de Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution to the cause consisted mostly of propaganda activities: press articles, books, booklets&lt;ref&gt;in 1935 he went on to declare that it is now the time to fulfill the “I will return” promise of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]] of 1876, Canal 2006, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and semi-scholarly lectures.&lt;ref&gt;he preferred lectures on closed meetings to harangues on public gatherings, for an example see ''ABC'' 02.02.35, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1935/02/02/040.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Second-row speaker, he was usually not mentioned in press headlines.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''El Siglo Futuro'' 27.02.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000537220&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His modest personal victory was getting elected to Madrid educational board,&lt;ref&gt;named Junta del Colegio de Doctores y Licenciados en Filosofia y Letras y en Ciencias&lt;/ref&gt; hailed by conservative press as “triumph of the Right”.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.01.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/01/17/017.html here]; he was active in the organisation since the mid-1920s, see ''El Imparcial'' 03.02.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000995738&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether Abánades was involved or aware of the forthcoming [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup of July 1936]]; none of the sources consulted provides also any information about his whereabouts during the Civil War and the very first years of Francoism. A single author claims he joined those Carlists who estranged the intransigent regent-claimant [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] and aligned themselves with the [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|partido unico]] amalgamation line; indeed in 1943 he is noted as paying homage to founders of Falange&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.03.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1943/03/12/009.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved in the Francoist propaganda, especially ''El Alcazar''.&lt;ref&gt;Calero Delso 2013, though at least until 1948 he is recorded as contributing to ''El Alcazar'', as he is not mentioned in Rodriguez Virgili 2000&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, at the same time he was recorded as active in Academia Vazquez de Mella, a semi-official Carlist cultural enterprise;&lt;ref&gt;in 1942 was reported by the press as head of “grupo escolar Vazquez de Mella", ''ABC'' 26.02.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1943/02/26/011.html here], active in the group also in 1947, see ''ABC'' 27.02.47, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1947/02/27/011.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s he joined supporters of [[Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince of Tuscany|Karl Pius]], styled as the Carlist claimant Carlos VIII,&lt;ref&gt;he is listed as [[Carloctavismo|carloctavist]]a with no specific access date given, Francisco de las Heras y Borreo, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco, Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|8497725565}}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; though at that time he was engaged mostly in religious projects, culminating in crowning of Virgen de la Hoz as Reina de Molina de Aragón.&lt;ref&gt;and used to spend part of his summer holidays in Barranco de la Hoz, near the sanctuary, Calero Delso 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Carlos Hugo 1968.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Carlos Hugo]], 1968]]
Once Carlism abandoned its opposition strategy in the mid-1950s Abánades was awkwardly involved in a new internal power struggle. At that time a young generation of socially minded activists, grouped around [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|prince Carlos Hugo]], launched their bid to take control of Carlism. It was they who benefitted most from the new rapprochement policy towards Francoism, as javieristas controlled many new Carlist institutions, now officially permitted by the regime. One of them was [[Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella]],&lt;ref&gt;the other key structures were a Carlist workers’ organisation Movimiento ObreroTradicionalista (MOT), students’ association Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas (AET) and new periodicals, especially ''Azada y asta'' and ''[[Montejurra (magazine)|Montejurra]]''&lt;/ref&gt; soon formatted by the socialist youth as means of disseminating their vision.&lt;ref&gt;for details, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962–1977'', Pamplona 1997; {{ISBN|9788431315641}}, 9788431315641 and Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos.: La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788477682653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not yet ready for open challenge, they invited older Carlists as front-men, supposed to provide them with Traditionalist credentials.&lt;ref&gt;in 1958 Carlos Hugo wrote to him: “La proclamación de las Leyes Fundamentales en mayo 1958 [sic!] es el triunfo definitivo y la gloria de Juan Vázquez de Mella”, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Abánades was probably not aware of the plot when elected president of Junta Nacional de los Círculos Vázquez de Mella in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; later becoming the honorary president.&lt;ref&gt;he was replaced by Miguel Fagoaga, ''ABC'' 13.11.62, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1962/11/13/059.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s - officially reconciled with the Javierista Carlists&lt;ref&gt;e.g. nominated to preside of Javiersta feasts in 1962, Ramón María Rodon Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 204; in 1962 he co-signed a letter hailing "la feliz consecución de la plena unidad carlista bajo la autoridad de S. M. C. don Javier de Borbón Parma", Heras y Borreo 2004, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; - he was celebrated by Carlos Hugo and his faction, awarded orders,&lt;ref&gt;Orden de la Legitimidad Proscrita&lt;/ref&gt; presiding over official homages to de Mella,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.06.61, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1961/06/17/058.html here], ''ABC'' 11.10.61, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1961/10/11/049.htm here] l&lt;/ref&gt; quoted as authority on his writings&lt;ref&gt;instead of mid-age experts on de Mella, [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Francisco Elias de Tejada]] and [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Rafael Gambra]], who firmly pursued the Traditionalist line. When re-creating the Carlist student organisation [[AET (Carlist organisation)|AET]] in the early 1960s, the javieristas kept making constant references to de Mella’s vision of sociedalismo and quoting Abánades, Martorell Perez 2009, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; and receiving flattering letters from the prince.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Hugo wrote to Abánades, probably consciously expoiting his lifetime adherence to Mella: “Mella no es el canto del pasado. Utiliza el pasado para exponer su sistema (...) La tradición es un conjunto de soluciones que han creado los hombres y que la historia ha acreditado como eficaces (...) La tradición no puede suponer nunca una coacción del pasado; es un proyecto de futuro, a partir de una altura histórica [...] La necesidad origina y precede a la tradición; de ahí que, cuando surgen problemas nuevos, es necesario inventar tradiciones nuevas cara el futuro”, quoted after Martorell Perez 2009, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969&lt;ref&gt;in 1968 he was still recorded as honorary president, ''ABC'' 28.04.68, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1968/04/28/086.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; he published his last article identified, printed in the Carlist periodical.&lt;ref&gt;the piece in question was an analysis of de Mella’s outlook, see ''Portavoz del Circulo Cultural Vazquez de Mella'' September 1969, available [http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/ppc/VM/VM_a1969m8-9n3.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{French literature sidebar}}
'''Edmond de Goncourt''' (26 May 1822{{snd}}16 July 1896), born '''Edmond Louis Antoine Huot de Goncourt''', was a French writer, literary critic, [[art critic]], book publisher and the founder of the [[Académie Goncourt]].&lt;ref&gt;http://arthistorians.info/goncourte&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Goncourt was born in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. For much of his life, he collaborated with his brother [[Jules de Goncourt|Jules]] creating works of art criticism, a  [[Goncourt Journal|notorious journal]], and subsequently several [[novel]]s. He also collected rare books, including a copy of Pierre Rameau's 1725 ''Abbregé de la nouvelle Methode, dans L'Art D'Ecrire ou De Tracer toutes sortes de Danses de Ville'' (New Abridged Method for writing or tracing all sorts of country dances).&lt;ref&gt;Friderica Derra de Moroda, "Choréographie: The Dance Notation of the Eighteenth Century: Beauchamp or Feuillet?," The Book Collector 16, no. 4 (1967): 459.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Jules he continued to write novels alone.

He bequeathed his entire estate for the foundation and maintenance of the Académie Goncourt. In honour of his brother and collaborator, [[Jules de Goncourt]] (17 December 1830{{snd}}20 June 1870), each December since 1903, the Académie awards the [[Prix Goncourt]]. It is the most prestigious prize in [[French language]] [[literature]], given to "the best imaginary [[prose]] work of the year".

[[Marcel Proust]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Michel Tournier]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Romain Gary]] (who exceptionally won it twice) and [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize]] [[Patrick Modiano]] are among the best-known authors who have won the century-old prize.

Edmond de Goncourt died in [[Champrosay]] in 1896, and was interred in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]].

==Quotes==
*"A painting in a museum hears more ridiculous opinions than anything else in the world."
*"If there is a God, [[atheism]] must seem to Him as less of an insult than religion."

[[File:Andersoncoat.jpg|thumb|right|175px|All-purpose service coat.]]

The '''Eisenhower jacket''', or '''"Ike" jacket''', is a type of waist length jacket or [[blouson]] developed for the U.S. Army during the later stages of World War II.  Intended to be worn on its own or as an insulating layer beneath the [[U.S. Army M-1943 Uniform|M-43 Field Jacket]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} it featured a pleated back, adjustable waist band, fly-front buttons, bellows chest pockets, slash side pockets, and [[Shoulder strap#Military shoulder strap|shoulder straps]].

==Overview==
Until the late-1930s, the [[United States Army]]’s field uniform consisted of a [[wool]] [[shirt]], mid-hip-length "all-purpose service coat" and wool overcoat. Save for its belted waist, the single-breasted service coat resembled a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] or [[sport coat]] more than a uniform. Little changed since World War I, it featured notched lapels and five metal buttons from its open collar to its belted waist. Made of heavy wool [[Serge (fabric)|serge]], it touted two flapped and button-through patch pockets at the breast and two identically styled patch pockets below its belted waist – its four pockets either box-pleated or bellows-styled-pleats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Katcher|year=1978|title=The US Army 1941-45|publisher=Ospery Publishing Ltd|ISBN=0-85045-522-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[civilian]] "[[windbreaker]]s" as its ideal design objective, the army began a four-year study in 1935 to develop a more practical and effective combat jacket to replace the service coat.

[[File:M1941 Jacket.jpg|thumb|right|175px|M-41 Field Jacket or "Parsons' Jacket".&lt;ref name="found-nyc1943"/&gt;]]

In 1940, it first adopted the first pattern field jacket, the "Parsons Jacket" named for Major General [[James K. Parsons]] who helped with its development.  This was quickly followed by an updated pattern, using the same nomenclature. Simply designed and modeled after a civilian [[windbreaker]] made by John Rissman &amp; Sons of Chicago, it was a short, button-front [[weatherproof]] [[jacket]] with a tight fitting waist and two flapped and button-through front pockets.

In early 1943, front-line [[skirmishes]] in [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]] proved the Service Coat, as well as the field jacket, inappropriate for combat. The Service Coat was re-designated for [[garrison]] and parade duty and the field jacket was replaced by a new and completely redesigned Field Jacket, M-1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Emerson|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms|publisher=The University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Publishing Division of the University|ISBN=0-8061-2622-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field Jacket, O.D. ("Parsons Jacket")==
Although the Field Jacket, O.D. (more widely known as the "Parsons Jacket" or the modern term "M41 Jacket") was widely used in many theaters during World War II, it was found to be an unsatisfactory solution for the soldiers using it. The War Department created a new field jacket based on the layering principle to give greater flexibility for the numerous environmental conditions encountered in the world-wide war.&lt;ref name="found-nyc1943"/&gt;

==Field Jacket, M-1943==
{{details|U.S. Army M-1943 Uniform}}
[[File:M1943 Field Jacket.jpg|right|thumb|175px|M-43 Field Jacket.&lt;ref name="found-nyc1943"/&gt;]]
Built around the [[layered clothing|layering]] principle, the [[U.S. Army M-1943 Uniform|M-1943]] became the basic building block of a multi-environment, all-season [[combat]] uniform being developed by the Office of the Quartermaster General (OQMG) for worldwide combat.&lt;ref name="found-nyc1943"/&gt;

On May 15, 1943, the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC) recommended development of a short, waist cropped woolen field jacket that could be worn under the M-1943 as an added [[Thermal insulation|insulator]].

==Field Jackets, Wool, O.D.==
By mid-1944, the OQMG finalized the several layering components of its multi-environment combat uniform, anointing the M-1943 Field Jacket its basic, universal building block. A completely new design, the M-1943 touted a wind-proof, olive drab colored [[cotton]] [[poplin]] outer shell with internal layers that could be added or eliminated depending on local battle conditions. In cold [[wikt:environ|environ]]s, its notched lapels converted to a stand-up, storm-flap for added neck protections. A pile jacket [[wikt:Special:Search/liner|liner]] and fur-edged hood could also be added.&lt;ref name="found-nyc1943"/&gt;

During the Autumn of 1943, the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] prototype jacket was sent to Chief Quartermaster of the [[European Theater of Operations]] for review and possible adoption by ETO commanding general, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].

==The Eisenhower Jacket==
[[File:Allied_Commanders_after_Germany_Surrendered.jpg|thumb|Eisenhower, wearing his M44 jacket, with some Allied commanders following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender at Reims.]]
Eisenhower had already requested a waist-cropped style; stemming from his appreciation of the functionality of the British [[Battle Dress|battle jacket]], "but with more distinctive style."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The M-44 jacket that emerged was fundamentally a waist-length M-43, with some improvements.  Made of olive drab 18-ounce wool [[Serge (fabric)|serge]], it shared the notched [[Jacket lapel|lapel]]  "storm collar", snag-free "fly front" buttons and flapped, bellows breast pockets, shoulder straps for gear retention, and roomy sleeves to accommodate insulating layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|author=Shelby Stanton|year=1991|title=U.S. Army Uniforms of WWII|publisher=Stackpole Books|ISBN=0-8117-2595-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staggered cuff buttons adjusted for layering or allowed a loose fit in warmer conditions, as did adjustable waist buckles.   A pair of "action-back" pleats extended from shoulder to waistband, providing freedom of movement with a slim fit. Intended to be worn on its own or underneath the M-43,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, the "Ike jacket", was classified standard issue in November 1944, and additionally designated as the Army’s dress and parade uniform.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

According to [[Paul Fussell]]’s Uniforms, "Eisenhower had a reputation among his troops as an eminently decent man, friendly and sympathetic," an admiration that Ike elevated even further, tells Fussell, by having the bravado to casually rest his hands inside his pocket and "violate the sacred Army injunction." That anecdote, Fussell says, explains why Eisenhower refused to adorn his personal jacket with gilded buttons: He considered his jacket an every-warrior’s combat uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=42|author=Paul Fussell|title=Uniforms: Why We Are What We Wear|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lERXgU9uQS4C | isbn=978-0-618-38188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower died in 1969 and was buried dressed in his famous short green jacket.&lt;ref name=FinalPost&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=August 21, 2012|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/all_about_ike/final_post.html|title=Dwight D. Eisenhower&amp;nbsp;– Final Post|publisher=[[Eisenhower Presidential Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The US Marine Corps and the Vandegrift jacket==
Following the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] under Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift]] were posted to the cooler climate of [[Melbourne]] Australia.  As the Marines only had dungarees and tan summer uniforms, they were issued Australian army [[battle dress]] with the Marines calling the short jacket the '''''Vandegrift Jacket'''''. An American made forest green version was issued to officers in December 1944 and to enlisted Marines in August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;p.31 Rottman, Gordon L. ''US Marine Corps 1941-45'' Osprey Publishing, 15/05/1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vandegrift jacket was retained until 1960.

==The post-WWII redesigns and adaptations==
[[File:Michael Fisher.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol [[Michael J. Fisher]] wearing the [[U.S. Border Patrol|Border Patrol's]] version of the Ike Jacket.]]

Post-World War II development of the U.S. field jacket was momentous. In 1947, the Army introduced a shorter and better tailored version of the M-44. Designated the MQ-1 and designed solely as a [[Dress uniform|dress and parade uniform]], the jacket was again refined in 1950 and re-introduced as the M-1950 Field Jacket, but without button cuffs. With the later introduction of the "Army green" [[U.S. Army service uniform#Green Service Uniform|U.S. Army service uniform]] in 1957, the Ike jacket gradually began to disappear domestically but was still a uniform option for troops stationed in international theaters.

In 1947, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) added still another Ike jacket design iteration, the M-47, and continued its use for the next two years, before changing its color to "[[Air Force blue]]" in 1949, where it remained a signature of the USAF, until being retired in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usafflagranks.com/usaf_service_dress_ike_jacket.html United States Air Force Dress Ike Jacket]&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the M-1943 jacket was to prove so successful that many military forces around the world still wear field jackets that closely follow its original designs. During the 1950s, a modified version, called the M-1950, was issued to U.S. forces in [[Korea]]. It had a button-in liner instead of the separate liner garment as in the M-1943. During the next year, the sometimes permanently hooded, M-1951 coat came into use. It was another very similar design, but now had both a zip instead of buttons under the front fly and metal snap closures for the pockets. The [[M-1951 field jacket]] was actually not sent to the forces in Korea until after the 1953 armistice and so was not seen during the [[Korean War]]. It thus remained in service until replaced by the [[M-1965 field jacket]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="found-nyc1943"/&gt;

Thanks to its greater comfort and the unobstructed ease it offered while operating a vehicle or brandishing a side-arm, the Ike jacket design became a popular post-WWII uniform staple among Federal and state law enforcement agencies as well as with countless numbers of municipal and civilian police departments throughout America.

To this day, uniforms of the [[U.S. Border Patrol]], along with most allied agencies within its broader, umbrella department, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Agency (USCBPA) and the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) have a dress jacket that is nearly identical to the Ike jacket original.

'''George Cockburn Henderson''' (1 May 1870 – c. 9 April 1944) was an Australian academic with a considerable career in Adelaide.

==History==
Cockburn was born in [[Hamilton, New South Wales]], the eighth of nine children&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; of Richard T. Henderson (c. 1830–1897) and was educated at Hamilton and [[Lawrence, New South Wales|Lawrence]] public schools. He passed the public instruction examination at age 13 and was admitted to Macquarie Superior Public School as a pupil teacher under his brother Richard Henderson. In December 1889 he won a £72 ''per annum'' scholarship to the [[Fort Street Training College]]. He matriculated the following March and in so doing won two-years' free tuition at Sydney University, later extended by another year.&lt;ref name=Hamiltonian&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132785681 |title=A Distinguished Hamiltonian |newspaper=[[Newcastle Morning Herald And Miners' Advocate]] |issue=7613 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=5 April 1899 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated BA in March 1893, winning a gold medal in philosophy, the Fraser Scholarship in History, and the [[James King of Irrawang]] Travelling Scholarship of £110 for two years, and in 1894 he enrolled at [[Balliol College]], Oxford, where he was awarded a [[Brackenbury Scholarship]] in history which funded his studies there to the value of £80 ''per annum'' for five years. He also excelled at athletics and was a leading oarsman and member of the Balliol crew at the Henley and Oxford races.&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt; He graduated MA and was employed in various parts of England as a [[University extension]] lecturer.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48791944 |title=Death of Prof. G.C. Henderson |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=10 April 1944 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his highly successful work, he was promoted by the Oxford extension delegacy to first-class lecturer.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71325403 |title=Mr. G. C. Henderson, B.A. |newspaper=[[Australian Town And Country Journal]] |volume=LVIII, |issue=1519 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 March 1899 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 he accepted a position at Sydney University as Acting Professor of History, while [[George Arnold Wood|Professor Wood]] was on holiday in England. On 5 January 1899, two days before leaving, he married May Gertrude Sturge, a niece of [[John Bright]] and of [[Joseph Sturge]],&lt;ref name=Hamiltonian/&gt; at the Friends' Meeting Place, [[Leicester]], England. They arrived in Sydney aboard the P &amp; O steamer ''Oceana'' in late February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113701835 |title=An Australian Scholar Returned |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)]] |issue=9901 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 March 1899 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A second acting Professorship, of Philosophy, arose at Sydney University, which Henderson filled, in 1900 returning to England, living at [[Kingham]], and at [[Charlbury]], in Oxfordshire, the home of his wife's parents.&lt;ref name=courts&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59088907 |title=In the Courts |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXVI, |issue=20,106 |location=South Australia |date=21 April 1911 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1902 Henderson was invited to give a course of lectures in Sydney, and while he was in Australia [[Robert Langton Douglas|Professor Douglas]] peremptorily resigned, and the University of Adelaide offered him the chair of History (or perhaps his friend [[William Mitchell (philosopher)|William Mitchell]], professor of English and Philosophy, persuaded him to apply); he accepted and took up residence in North Adelaide. He attempted to persuade his wife to join him, but she repeatedly declined. By 1910 she was living with one Richard Henry Gretton, and Henderson instituted divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name=courts/&gt; Henderson was spending much of his spare time at the [[Adelaide Club]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In 1921 [[Charles Rischbieth Jury|Mrs G. A. Jury]] made a bequest to the University, which enabled Henderson's dual responsibilities to be divided: [[A. T. Strong]] was appointed to the Jury professorship of English Literature in 1922, and Henderson retained the Professorship of Modern History.
On 27 October 1922 Henderson married Dr. [[Annie Heloise Abel]] (1873–1947), an English-born Professor of History in America, with an interest in American colonial history.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;
They settled on a rural property at [[Blackwood, South Australia|Blackwood]], but she was unhappy; he suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised in June 1923 and insisted she leave him; they divorced on the grounds of incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 1: Abel|publisher=[[Radcliffe College]]|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson's resignation from the University was accepted reluctantly and he was awarded the title of [[Professor Emeritus]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

He moved to [[Dora Creek, New South Wales]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article164839223 |title=People in the News |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXX, |issue=5,996 |location=South Australia |date=29 December 1923 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |page=38 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his historical researches; notably on [[Abel Tasman]] with M. Wieder, the Dutch historian.

He was cared for over the course of 20 years by his niece Elsie Henderson, who lived next door to his "cozy villa". When the pair visited England in 1936 he arranged for Elsie to be presented to the court of [[King Edward VIII]] (later Duke of Windsor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230294718 |title=Attended Reception Given By The King |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)]] |issue=8298 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=7 August 1936 |accessdate=4 July 2018 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was she who found him on 9 April 1944 near the road on his property, throat slit, with a [[straight razor|razor]] under his body.&lt;ref name=Truth&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article203753401 |title=Professor Suicides: 'My Book Is Finished' |newspaper=[[Truth (Brisbane newspaper)]] |issue=2299 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=16 April 1944 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">The '''Glasgow Chronology''' is a proposed revision of the [[Egyptian chronology]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was first formulated between the years 1978 and 1982 by a working group following the Glasgow Conference of Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS, a non-profit organization advocating serious academic analysis of the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and other [[catastrophism|catastrophist]]s).&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Thebes, or, Ages in chaos revisited|author=Emmet John Sweeney|pages=19|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007| isbn=9780875864808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[chronology]] placed the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] some five hundred years later than the [[conventional chronology of Egypt]].

==Chronology formation==
The Glasgow Chronology was initially presented at an SIS conference, held in 1978 in [[Glasgow]] and entitled "Ages in Chaos?". Flaws were pointed out in it almost immediately, and by the 1980s its original proponents had all abandoned it, in favour of other chronologies.&lt;ref name=Sweeney /&gt;

The Glasgow Chronology accepted all the character identifications proposed by [[Velikovsky]] in ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952). Thus [[Hatshepsut]], who visited the Divine Land, was equated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], who visited [[Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Thutmose III]], who followed Hatshepsut, was equated with [[Shishak]], who plundered the Jerusalem temple after the death of Solomon. Velikovsky therefore reduced the age of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] by five centuries. However, in his subsequently published ''Ramses II and his Time'' (1978), he brought the Nineteenth dynasty down by roughly seven centuries, thus opening a two-century gap between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Despite the Glasgow Chronology intent of reducing the age of the Nineteenth dynasty by five centuries and allowing it to naturally follow from the Eighteenth dynasty, its original proponents concluded that it was historically insupportable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">The '''Great Contract''' was a plan submitted to [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1610 by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]]. It was an attempt to increase Crown income and ultimately rid it of debt. 

Cecil suggested that, in return for an annual grant of £200,000, the Crown should give up its [[feudal]] rights of [[Ward (law)|Wardship]] and [[Purveyance]], as well as [[New Impositions]]. The plan was eventually rejected by both James and Parliament: the failure of his cherished project was thought by some to have hastened Cecil's early death in 1612, although it is most likely that he died of [[cancer]]. The King withdrew from the contract because it meant that he would lose a useful means of controlling his more powerful subjects, and he also did not think £200,000 was a worthy substitute for his feudal rights. The House of Commons withdrew because they were wary of providing an income that might give the King financial independence. 

Whether it would have helped the financial situation remains a matter of speculation. It  has been argued  that the financial settlement at the [[Restoration of Charles II]] was partly inspired by the Great Contract. On the other hand,  James I was rather extravagant in financial matters,  and it is uncertain whether the Contract would have been a permanent solution of his difficulties. It is also important to consider how, at the point of Elizabeth's death, the Crown was £400,000 in debt, considering that Elizabeth ran a rather frugal court and was careful with money, and thus the financial problems of James' reign were  not  all of his own making.  Furthermore, it must also  be said that  James, who had a wife and,  by 1605, four children to support, had many legitimate expenses which the unmarried and childless  Elizabeth did not.

The '''Green Street Trust''' was an Irish company incorporated in 1990 with charitable status. Its aim was to promote urban renewal in disadvantaged inner city areas through the rehabilitation of historic buildings for contemporary use and where possible to secure multiple uses within individual buildings.  The Trust obtained a 99 year lease from the [[Office of Public Works]] (OPW) of the former [[Debtors' Prison Dublin|Debtors’ Prison]] situated on Halston Street and Green Street in Dublin’s north inner city and  undertook restoration works to the building to plans prepared by McCullough Mulvin Architects.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Business Post 'Locked away for the public good' Teri Griffin, 5 November 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish Times ‘Plans to convert former Debtors Prison into flats’, 5 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1992 a group of volunteers from Voluntary Service International carried out restoration works to the building.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Times ‘Debtors’ Prison makes welcome return’ 19 August 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994 the Trust ran a carpentry and joinery course as a Fás Community Youth Training Project to replace the timber sash windows in the building that were in poor condition. The Trust carried out substantial works to refurbish the Debtors’ Prison in the 1990s but due to escalating building costs and a lack of funding construction work ceased and the Trust handed back the lease to the OPW.

Most of its directors of the company had been members of [[Students Against the Destruction of Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Business Post 'Locked away for the public good' Teri Griffin, 5 November 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The directors included [[Tony Connelly]], Frank Cooney, [[Ciarán Cuffe]], Deryck Fay (Company Secretary), Emma Kelly, Garret Kelly, Ger Lambert, Richard Lyons, Eunan McLaughlin,  Rachel McRory (Chair), Colm Murray, Jerome Ó Drisceoil, Colmán Ó Siochrú, and Blaise Smith.

Its patrons were Dermot Egan, The [[Knight of Glin]], Justice [[Niall McCarthy (judge)|Niall McCarthy]], [https://www.tcd.ie/chancellor/prochancellor/current/mcparland.php Dr. Edward McParland], John O’Connor, Breege O’Donaghue, [[Ruairi Quinn|Ruairí Quinn TD]], [[Nicholas Robinson (historian)|Nicholas Robinson]], Gerry Walker and [http://www.museum.ie/en/news/press-releases.aspx?article=e9bbcd83-9967-4c3e-8620-158f9fbb1e51 Dr. Pat Wallace].

'''Hilti Corporation''' (Hilti Aktiengesellschaft or Hilti AG, also known as Hilti Group) is a [[Liechtenstein]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] company that develops, manufactures, and markets products for the construction, [[building maintenance]], energy and manufacturing industries, mainly to the professional end-user. It concentrates mainly on anchoring systems, fire protection systems, installation systems, measuring and detection tools (such as [[laser level]]s, range meters and line lasers), power tools (such as [[hammer drill]]s, demolition hammers, diamond drills, cordless [[electric drill]]s, heavy angle drills,  [[power saw]]s) and related software and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hilti Corporate website |url=https://www.hilti.group/content/hilti/CP/XX/en/products/product-overview/product-overview.html |website=Hilti Group |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilti, a registered [[trademark]] of the various Hilti corporate entities, is the family name of the company's founders.

==History==

===1941 through 1946===
In 1941, the Hilti company was founded by Martin and Eugen Hilti,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilti.com/data/editorials/-12323/milestones_en.pdf Hilti: Company Milestones.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235247/http://www.hilti.com/data/editorials/-12323/milestones_en.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the opening of a mechanical workshop in Schaan, Liechtenstein. Martin Hilti was trained in mechanical engineering and automotive design at the Wismar Engineering College and was 26 at the time of founding the company. The Martin Hilti Family Trust holds all of Hilti's registered shares as of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilti.com/holcom/modules/editorial/edit_singlepage.jsp?edtid=-12320_000003 Hilti: Company.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824114105/http://www.hilti.com/holcom/modules/editorial/edit_singlepage.jsp?edtid=-12320_000003 |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilti OHG began as a company that produced equipment and components on contract for the German industry during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hilti-ag-history/|title=History of Hilti AG – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exports went largely to Maybach Motorenbau in Friedrichshafen and Robert Bosch in Stuttgart.

===1947 through 1963===
After the war there was a sharp decline in sales and the company was close to bankruptcy.  To make ends meet Martin Hilti signed sub-contracts as diverse as gray cast iron parts for the Swiss textile industry, machining eggcups molds, or lighters and pencil sharpeners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/391591240/Hilti-75-Years-Anniversary-Book?secret_password=G0W8uc3s44mr3iYxfSHU |author1=Hilti Corporation |title=Ready for the future |date=September 2016 |publisher=BVD Verlag + Druck |location=Schaan, Liechtenstein|page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Geiger"&gt;Peter Geiger et al.: Frage zu Liechtenstein in der NS-Zeit und im Zweiten Weltkrieg: Flüchtlinge, Vermögenswerte, Kunst Rüstungsproduktion. Vaduz, Zürich 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the late 1940s Martin Hilti found a technology that would allow setting nails into concrete or masonry, and he acquired the original designs and the patents rights of what would later become Hilti's Direct Fastening first tool. Although promising, the technology proved to be immature, and required significant development.  In the meantime, through the early 1950s, Hilti produced its own line of household products, which included a cigarette lighter, and a water-powered kitchen mixer called "Ello", which enjoyed considerable success.  In 1952, with a solution that proved mature to be marketed, Hilti launched its first construction-related product, a manual tool to drive threaded studs into steel, and in 1953 the company introduced its first powder-actuated high-velocity fastener that allowed setting nails into concrete, called Perfix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/391591240/Hilti-75-Years-Anniversary-Book?secret_password=G0W8uc3s44mr3iYxfSHU |author1=Hilti Corporation |title=Ready for the future |date=September 2016 |publisher=BVD Verlag + Druck |location=Schaan, Liechtenstein|page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At this time Hilti opened own offices in Italy, Belgium, Poland, Finland, Norway, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Austria, France, Australia, Canada and the USA.  In 1963 Hilti was present in 23 countries, with a turnover of over 400 million Swiss Francs.

===1964 until today===
In 1964 Hilti started marketing a drill that also had a chiselling function, made by the Kocher Company, in Basel, under the name "Torna 765".  After receiving customer feedback Hilti started a product development and improvement project under the name "Torna Entwicklung" (German for "Torna Development"), or "TE" for short, which has since then become the standard name for all Hilti electropneumatic tools.  In 1967 the company introduced the TE17, a fully electropneumatic rotary hammer drill which featured a safety clutch, and it was shipped to customers in Hilti's first distinctive red toolbox.

The global expansion continued throughout the 1960s and by 1971, Hilti's global turnover was 376 million Swiss Francs across 45 countries, including new production facilities in Austria and in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/391591240/Hilti-75-Years-Anniversary-Book?secret_password=G0W8uc3s44mr3iYxfSHU |author1=Hilti Corporation |title=Ready for the future |date=September 2016 |publisher=BVD Verlag + Druck |location=Schaan, Liechtenstein|page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1974 Hilti started to develop and market mechanical metal anchors, and in 1977 Hilti introduced its first chemical anchor product line. Two more production facilities were opened, a plastic manufacturing plant in Germany purchased in 1975 and a plant in England acquired in 1978. In 1979 the company opened another production facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, to produce anchors.  During the 1980s Hilti formed market region centers for America, Europe, Africa and Asia, to improve the proximity to their customers.

In 2018 Hilti has offices in 90 countries and sales of over 5 billion Swiss Francs.

He served with [[No. 264 Squadron RAF|264]] and [[No. 85 Squadron RAF|85 Squadron]]s, flying [[Boulton Paul Defiant|Defiant]]s, [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]]s and [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesoutheastecho.co.uk/Pilots/Bailey_JR.htm J.

===''Drum'' and ''Golden City Post''===
In 1951 he provided financial backing to [[Bob Crisp]] to start a magazine called ''African Drum'' based in [[Cape Town]], and aimed at a Black readership, but as readership dropped, Bailey took full control. The monthly magazine was renamed to simply ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' and the head office moved to [[Johannesburg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3098">'''Jean Chapeauville''' (b. at [[Liège]], 5 January 1551; d. there 11 May 1617) was a Belgian theologian and historian.

==Life==

He made his philosophical studies at the [[University of Cologne]] and [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]], and at the latter received the degree of Licentiate of Theology. He then entered the priesthood, and in 1578 was appointed one of the synodal examiners for the [[Diocese of Liège]], and in 1579 parish priest of St. Michael's in the same city. He performed the functions of the latter office for about ten years.

Having been a canon of the collegiate church of St. Peter's in Liège since 1582, he was elevated in 1599 to the dignity of a provost of the same church. In 1587, [[Pope Sixtus V]] appointed him the first [[penitentiary canon]] of [[Saint Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|St. Lambert's Cathedral]]. On 12 June 1600, he was promoted to the archdeaconship of [[Famenne]].

Meanwhile, in 1582, he had been nominated Inquisitor of the Faith, and in 1598, [[Ernest of Bavaria]], Bishop of Liège, appointed him [[vicar-general]], in which office he was retained, despite his protests, by Bishop Ernest's successor, [[Ferdinand of Bavaria]].

He taught theology with great success in several monasteries of Liège and published works on theological subjects. He endeavoured to enforce in the diocese the reforms decided upon by the [[Council of Trent]], particularly the establishment of a clerical seminary and the concursus for the nomination of parish priests.

==Works==

He published a collection of the chief works on the history of the bishops of Liège, and wrote an account of the episcopate of Liège, commencing with [[Erard de la Marck]] (1506) and ending with the year 1613. His principal works are:

*"Tractatus de necessitate et modo administrandi sacramenta tempore pestis" (Liège, 1586); 
*"Petit traite des vices et des vertus" (Liège, 1594); 
*"Abbrege de la somme des péchez M. [[Jean Benedicti|J. Benedicti]]" (Liège, 1595); 
*"De casibus reservatis tractatus" (Liège, 1596); 
*"Catechismi Romani elucidatio scholastica" (Liège, 1600);
* "Historia admirandarum curationum quae divinitus ope deprecationeque divi Perpetui Leodiensis episcopi contigerunt. Adjecta est vita B. Perpetui" (Liège, 1601; Fr. tr., 1601); 
*"Summa catechismi Romani" (Liège, 1605); 
*"Epistola ad catechistas de taedio quod catechistis obrepere solet" (Liège, 1605); 
*"Catechista, sive brevis tractatus de necessitate et modo administrandi doctrinam christianam" (Liège, 1608); 
*"Qui gesta pontificum tungrensium, trajectensium et leodiensium scripserunt auctores praecipui" (3 vols., Liège, 1612, 1613, 1616).

The legacy of Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) is constantly evolving in the collective imagination. As a ubiquitous symbol of [[counterculture]] worldwide, Guevara is one of the most recognizable and influential revolutionary figures of the twentieth century. However, during his life, and even more since his death, Che has elicited controversy and wildly divergent opinions as to who he was and what he represented. Mostly revered and occasionally reviled, he is passionately characterized along the entire continuum as everything from a heroic defender of [[Oppression|the poor]], to a cold-hearted [[executioner]]. Admired, sanctified, romanticized and derided, his crystallized status as either a brilliant intellectual or a violent ideologue is usually dependent on where one falls along the [[left-wing|left]] and [[right-wing|right]] of the [[political spectrum]]. The debate around his legacy is further complicated by the fact that Guevara exists simultaneously as several different entities, both literal man and global emblem, leading to disputes between what people contend he did and what he now represents.

==Written legacy==
::''See also: [[Che Guevara#List of English works|Che Guevara's list of works]]'' and [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|''The Motorcycle Diaries'']]

Guevara's extensive written legacy includes intellectual writings on radical [[Marxist]] politics and [[social theory]], military/[[guerrilla warfare]] strategy and tactics, diplomatic memos, books, speeches, magazine articles, letters, poetry and diaries, as well as official documents preserved in Cuban government archives. Che's practical and theoretical work had a profound political impact around the globe during the second half of the 20th century, especially in the developing world, where revolutionary organizing and [[anti-colonial]] struggles were inspired by his thought and example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostlywater.org/index.php?q=commandante_ernesto_che_guevara_1928_1967 Commandante Ernesto "Che" Guevara (1928–1967)] by ''The Mostly Water Collective''&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, his writings have been translated into hundreds of different languages.

{{Quote box|"Che was not only a heroic fighter, but a revolutionary thinker, with a political and moral project and a system of ideas and values for which he fought and gave his life. The philosophy which gave his political and ideological choices their coherence, colour, and taste was a deep revolutionary humanism. For Che, the true Communist, the true revolutionary was one who felt that the great problems of all humanity were his or her personal problems, one who was capable of "feeling anguish whenever someone was assassinated, no matter where it was in the world, and of feeling exultation whenever a new banner of liberty was raised somewhere else. Che’s internationalism -a way of life, a secular faith, a [[categorical imperative]], and a spiritual "nationality"- was the living and concrete expression of this revolutionary Marxist humanism."|— [[Michael Löwy]], author of ''The Marxism of Che Guevara: Philosophy, Economics, Revolutionary Warfare'' &lt;ref name = "Löwy"&gt;[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1144 The Spark that does not Die] by [[Michael Löwy]], ''International Viewpoint'', July 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Che Guevara statue closeup.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Statue of Che Guevara near the site of his execution in [[Bolivia]].]]

In 1967, while pictures of Guevara's dead body were being circulated and the circumstances of his death debated, his legend began to spread. Demonstrations in protest against his execution occurred throughout the world, and articles, tributes, songs and poems were written about his life and death.&lt;ref&gt;[[File:Loudspeaker.svg|11px]] Carlos Puebla: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/spanish/audio/seriemilenio02e.ram "Hasta Siempre, Comandante"]&lt;/ref&gt; Latin America specialists advising the [[U.S. State Department]] immediately recognized the significance in the demise of "the most glamorous and reportedly most successful revolutionary", noting that Guevara would be eulogized by communists and other leftists as a "model revolutionary who met a heroic death."&lt;ref name = "Rusk"&gt;[[United States State Department|U.S. Department of State]]: [http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=108 Guevara's Death, The Meaning for Latin America] pg 6.

British politician [[George Galloway]] has remarked that "one of the greatest mistakes the US state ever made was to create those pictures of Che's corpse. Its Christ-like poise in death ensured that his appeal would reach way beyond the turbulent university campus and into the hearts of the faithful, flocking to the worldly, fiery sermons of the [[Liberation theology|liberation theologists]]."&lt;ref&gt;George Galloway [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/george-galloway-should-che-be-an-icon-yes-396109.html "Should Che be an icon? Yes"], ''The Independent'', October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Economist]] magazine has also pointed out how Che's post death photos resemble [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|The Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]''. Thus fixing Guevara as a modern saint, the man who risked his life twice in countries that were not his own before giving it in a third, and whose invocation of the "new man", driven by moral rather than material incentives, smacked of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] more than [[Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9947002 Che Guevara: Modern Saint and Sinner"] by ''[[The Economist]]'', Oct 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

This rung true the following year in 1968 when among [[Italy]]'s emerging new breed of Roman Catholic militants, named the Jacques Maritain Circle arranged a memorial [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in Che's honor and Catholic services were held for him in several other countries. In addition, in [[Brazil]], mythmakers began to circulate thousands of photograph copies of a dead Che captioned "A Saint of Our Time".&lt;ref name = "Cult" /&gt; Italian students took up a similar tone and christened Guevara an "Angela della Pace" – "[[Angel]] of Peace."&lt;ref name = "Cult"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838357,00.html The Cult of Che] by Time, May 17, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of Che's non-sanctifying failures and contradictions, or the obsolescence of his methods and ideology, the potency of his "messianic image", with its "symbolic" and "religious quality", continues to inspire many throughout the World.&lt;ref name = "Messiah" /&gt;

In addition, more [[Far-left politics|radical left]] wing activists responded to Guevara's apparent indifference to rewards and glory, and concurred with Guevara's sanctioning of violence as a necessity to instill [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Trento, Angelo. ''Castro and Cuba : From the revolution to the present". p.64.

==Personal legacy==

===In Cuba===
[[File:SculptureCheGuevaraCuba.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Monumental image on [[Cuba]]n Ministry of the Interior, by artist Enrique Ávila based on [[Alberto Korda]]'s [[Che Guevara (photo)|March 1960 photo]]. During Guevara's tenure as head of the Ministry of Industries (MININD) from 1961 to 1965, this building was the MININD's headquarters and his office was on the top floor.]]

Cuba has promoted Che as a "symbol of revolutionary virtues, sacrifice and internationalism" inside and outside the country since his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2991206.stm Cuba Honours Comrade Che] by ''[[BBC News]]'', June 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara remains a "beloved national hero" in Cuba (almost a secular [[saint]], to many on the Caribbean island),&lt;ref name = "PWW"&gt;Che Guevara Remains a Hero to Cubans'', by ''[[People's Weekly World]]'', October 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; where he is remembered for promoting unpaid voluntary work by working shirtless on building sites or hauling sacks of sugar. To this day, he appears on a Cuban banknote cutting sugar cane with a machete in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_18610.shtml Cuba remembers Che Guevara 40 years after his fall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213092006/http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_18610.shtml |date=2008-02-13 }} by Rosa Tania Valdes, ''[[Reuters]]'', October 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban state has continued to cultivate Guevara’s appreciation, constructing numerous statues and artworks in his honor throughout the land; adorning school rooms, workplaces, public buildings, billboards, and money with his image.&lt;ref&gt;''Cuba's Face'', by Stanford University Germanic Collections&lt;/ref&gt; His visage is also on postage stamps and the 3-peso coin beneath the words ''"Patria o Muerte"'' (Homeland or Death).&lt;ref name = "PWW"/&gt; Moreover, children across the country begin each school day with the chant "Pioneers for Communism, We will be like Che!"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. The [[University of Havana]] also possesses an academic [[Academic major|concentration]] in "Che."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Che Guevara Mausoleum|Guevara's mausoleum]] in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] has also become a site of almost religious significance to many Cubans,&lt;ref name = "Pretty" /&gt; while the nation’s burgeoning [[Tourism in Cuba|tourist industry]] has benefited greatly from the ongoing international interest in Guevara's life. For example, some 205,832 people visited the mausoleum during 2004, of whom 127,597 were foreigners. However, Argentine [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Pacho O'Donnell]] regrets the formal rigidity of Che's state-crafted image, opining that "The Cubans have excluded everything about the younger Che that is not heroic, including that which is most deliciously human about him. Personal doubts, the sexual escapades, the moments when he and [[Alberto Granado|(Alberto) Granado]] were drunk, none of that fits with the immortal warrior they want to project."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt;

Despite the formal adulation, Guevara's legacy is less pronounced on a national policy front. In Cuba, Guevara's death precipitated the abandonment of guerrilla warfare as an instrument of foreign policy, ushering in a ''rapprochement'' with the [[Soviet Union]], and the reformation of the government along Soviet lines. When Cuban troops returned to Africa in the 1970s, it was as part of a large-scale military expedition, and support for insurrection movements in Latin America and the Caribbean became logistical and organizational rather than overt. Cuba also abandoned Guevara's plans for economic diversification and rapid industrialization which had ultimately proved to be impracticable in view of the country's incorporation into the [[COMECON]] system. As early as 1965, the Yugoslav communist journal [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] observed the many half-completed or empty factories in Cuba, a legacy of Guevara's short tenure as Minister of Industries, "standing like sad memories of the conflict between pretension and reality".&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas. Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom. p. 1,007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Cuban-American community===
Many [[Cuban exiles]] have spoken of Guevara in unfavorable terms, and he is remembered by some with the [[epithet]] "The Butcher of [[La Cabaña Fortress|la Cabaña]]", a reference to Guevara’s post-revolutionary role as "supreme prosecutor" over the [[revolutionary tribunal (Cuba)|revolutionary tribunal]]s at the fortress. Similar disapproval has been shared by [[Cuban-American]] actor and director [[Andy García]], who alleged in 2004 that "Che has been romanticized over the years, but there is a darker side to his story. He looks like a rock star, but he executed a lot of people without trial or defense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/5/4/171619.shtml Andy Garcia Tells His Cuba Story, at Last] by ''[[NewsMax.com]]'' May 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia's 2005 film ''[[The Lost City (2005 film)|The Lost City]]'', portrays what could be perceived by some, as the brutality of pre and post revolution [[Cuban revolution|Cuba]], including Che.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OWI2ZDcyMTliNmNiMGIwYTliMDc3NDcyZmZiOTc5YTY= Don’t Let This Movie Get Lost] by Kathryn Jean Lopez, ''[[National Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to such polarization, Cuban-American academic Uva de Aragon has hypothesized that "we'll still have to wait many years for history to deliver a definite judgement on Che, when the passions of both sides have passed."&lt;ref&gt;''Sympathizers Mark 40th anniversary of Che Guevara's Death'', by the ''[[Associated Press]]'', October 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the youth of Latin America, Guevara's memoir [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|''The Motorcycle Diaries'']] has become a cult favorite with college students and young intellectuals.&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/letter-from-the-americas-che-today-more-easy-rider-than-revolutionary.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Letter from the Americas; Che Today? More Easy Rider Than Revolutionary] by [[Larry Rohter]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed Guevara to emerge as "a romantic and tragic young adventurer, who has as much in common with [[Jack Kerouac]] or [[James Dean]] as with [[Fidel Castro]]."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt; Speaking on this phenomenon, biographer [[Jon Lee Anderson]], has theorized that Che is "a figure who can constantly be examined and re-examined, to the younger, post-cold-war generation of Latin Americans, Che stands up as the perennial [[Icarus]], a self-immolating figure who represents the romantic tragedy of youth. Their Che is not just a potent figure of protest, but the [[idealism|idealistic]], questioning kid who exists in every society and every time."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt;

===Critics===
Although to some Che is known as a hero — [[Nelson Mandela]] referred to him as: "An inspiration for every human being who loves freedom"&lt;ref&gt;Editorial Review of The Bolivian Diary on [https://www.amazon.com/Bolivian-Diary-Authorized-Guevara-Publishing/dp/1920888241 Amazon.com] --- This quote also appears in the opening trailer for ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)]]''&lt;/ref&gt; — others view him as the spokesman of a failing ideology and a ruthless executioner who did not afford others a proper legal process. Critics point out that Che justified murdering people without knowing if they are fully guilty. They point out that in a May 18, 1962 speech Che said: "We executed many people by firing squad without knowing if they were fully guilty. At times, the Revolution cannot stop to conduct much investigation; it has the obligation to triumph." &lt;ref&gt;[http://cubaarchive.org/home/images/stories/che-guevara_interior-pages_en_final.pdf Che Guevara Forgotten Victims] by ''María C. Werlau, The Free Society Project'', p.9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also point out that Che supported banning independent newspapers. In 1959, Che told Cuban leftist journalist José Pardo Llada: “We must eliminate all newspapers; we cannot make a revolution with free press. Newspapers are instruments of the oligarchy.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://cubaarchive.org/home/images/stories/che-guevara_interior-pages_en_final.pdf Che Guevara Forgotten Victims] by ''María C. Werlau, The Free Society Project'', p.10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. State Department was advised that his death would come as a relief to non-leftist Latin Americans, who had feared possible insurgencies in their own countries.&lt;ref name = "Rusk" /&gt; Subsequent critical analysts have also shed light on aspects of cruelty in Guevara’s methods, and analysed what Fidel Castro described as Guevara’s "excessively aggressive quality."&lt;ref&gt;Fidel Castro on Che Guevara: Speech by Fidel Castro, given on October 18, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Studies addressing problematic characteristics of Guevara's life have cited his unsympathetic treatment of his fellow fighters during various guerrilla campaigns, and his frequent humiliations of those deemed his intellectual inferiors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Resurrection of Che Guevara'', by [[Samuel Farber]], Summer 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson5&gt;Anderson, Jon Lee.

Particularly rock and hip-hop. Despite this, some see Che as more champion of political and ideological conformity.

On the 40th anniversary of Guevara's execution in Bolivia the compilation ''Che in Verse''  brought together a diverse collection of 135 poems and songs in tribute to Che Guevara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latamrob.com/Review.asp?book_id=184 A Radiant Face Driven Mad with a Rifle: Che in Verse] by ''The Latin American Review of Books'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108212900/http://www.latamrob.com/Review.asp?book_id=184 |date=November 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrated poets such as [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Nicolas Guillén]], [[Derek Walcott]], [[Al Purdy]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Ko Un]], and [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] devoted the aforementioned works to, as the book states in its introduction, "celebrate the world’s [[icon]] of [[rebellion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Intro to: Che in Verse, by Gavin O'Toole, Aflame Books, 2007, {{ISBN|0-9552339-5-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2007, Guevara was voted "[[Argentina]]'s greatest historical and political figure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2166117,00.html Poems Guevara Lived and Died by], by Javier Espinoza, ''[[The Observer]]'', September 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
 | quote = "Che Guevara - hero of the [[Cuban Revolution]], left-wing icon and the face that has sold more posters than anyone else in history. Remembered as a romantic [[freedom fighter]], an expert in [[guerrilla warfare]], and a thoughtful philosopher who died young for his cause, Guevara has always been the revolutionaries' revolutionary. Stylish, vehemently anti-American and considerably better looking than [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], he practically invented the image of the bearded, beret-wearing left-wing radical, as adopted by thousands during the 1960s and 70s."| source = — [[BBC News]],&lt;ref name = "BBC02"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/2356903.stm Comrade Che Keeps an Eye on British Workers] by Owen Booth, ''[[BBC News]]'', October 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the occasional controversy, Guevara's status as a [[Popular culture|popular icon]] has continued throughout the world, leading commentators to speak of a global "cult of Che". Well known [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] writers extolled him, while West German playwright [[Peter Weiss]] has even compared him to "a Christ taken down from the Cross."&lt;ref name = "Embalm" /&gt; A [[Guerrillero Heroico|photograph of Guevara]] taken by photographer [[Alberto Korda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1352650.stm Che Guevara Photographer Dies] by ''BBC News'', May 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; has become one of the century's most ubiquitous images, and the portrait, transformed into a monochrome graphic by Irish artist [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick]], is reproduced endlessly on a vast array of merchandise, such as T-shirts, posters, cigarettes, coffee mugs, and baseball caps. This fact led Argentine business analyst Martin Krauze to postulate that "the admiration for El Che no longer extends to his politics and ideology, it’s a romantic idea of one man going to battle against the windmills, he’s a [[Don Quixote|Quixote]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=9024 Che Guevara: An Image that Keeps the Spirit of Revolution Alive] by the ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', Issue 2005, June 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O’Hagan]] has described Che as "more [[John Lennon|(John) Lennon]] than [[Vladimir Lenin|(Vladimir) Lenin]]." Taking the opposite [[hypothesis]], [[Mexican people|Mexican]] commentator and Che Biographer [[Jorge Castañeda Gutman]] has proclaimed that: "Che can be found just where he belongs in the niches reserved for [[cultural icon]]s, for [[symbols]] of social uprisings that filter down deep into the soil of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=9024 Che Guevara: An Image that Keeps the Spirit of Revolution Alive] 2005 Issue of The ''[[Socialist Worker]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Castañeda has further stated that "Che still possesses an extraordinary relevance as a symbol of a time when people died heroically for what they believed in", adding that in his view "people don't do that anymore."&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 76&lt;/ref&gt; The saying "Viva la revolucion!" has also become very popular and synonymous with Guevara.&lt;ref&gt;''Discussion about Che Guevara'', by CBC Radio One&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, Western Europe and many regions outside Latin America, the image has been likened to a global brand, long since shedding its ideological or political connotations. Conversely, the obsession with Guevara has also been dismissed by critics as merely "adolescent revolutionary romanticism."&lt;ref name = "Pretty" /&gt;

American, Latin American and European writers, [[Jon Lee Anderson]], [[Régis Debray]], [[Jorge G. Castañeda]] and others contributed to demystify the image of Guevara via articles and extensive biographies, which detailed his life and legacy in less idealistic terms; and, in the case of [[Octavio Paz]], was accompanied by a critical indictment of the Marxism espoused by many in the Latin American left. Political writer [[Paul Berman]] went further, asserting that the "modern-day cult of Che" obscures the work of dissidents and what he believes is a "tremendous social struggle" currently taking place in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2107100/ The Cult of Che] by [[Paul Berman]], ''[[Slate magazine]]'', September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Christopher Hitchens]], who was a socialist and a supporter of the Cuban revolution in the 1960s but later changed his views, summarised Guevara's legacy by surmising that "Che's iconic status was assured because he failed. His story was one of defeat and isolation, and that's why it is so seductive. Had he lived, the myth of Che would have long since died."&lt;ref name = "Pretty" /&gt; Taking the opposing view, [[Richard Gott]] a [[The Guardian|Guardian]] journalist in [[Vallegrande]], sent a dispatch on the day of Guevara's death stating the following: {{quote|It was difficult to recall that this man had once been one of the great figures of Latin America. It was not just that he was a great guerrilla leader; he had been a friend of Presidents as well as revolutionaries. His voice had been heard and appreciated in inter-American councils as well as in the jungle. He was a doctor, an amateur economist, once Minister of Industries in revolutionary Cuba, and [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]'s right-hand man. He may well go down in history as the greatest continental figure since [[Simón Bolívar|Bolivar]]. Legends will be created around his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/23/theobserver.worldnews The Final Triumph of Saint Che] ''The Guardian'', September 23, 2007.

'''Lucumí''' is a lexicon of words and short phrases derived from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] language in Cuba and used in as the [[liturgical language]] of [[Santería]] in [[Cuba]] and the Cuban Diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tndbo3yLEdcC&amp;dq=lucumi+language&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Santeria from Africa to the New World |author=George Brandon |page=56 |publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz, Kristina. 2014. ''Performing Afro-Cuba: Image, Voice, Spectacle in the Making of Race and History''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-11905-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Yoruba language is no longer a vernacular among the Yoruba descendants in the Americas from the time of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and by extension all the devotees of the Orisa religion as it developed in Cuba, the remains of the liturgical usage reflect deterioration.  It has been influenced by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] phonetics and pronunciation.  There has also been some minimal influence from [[Bantu languages]] and Fongbe, some of which were spoken by other enslaved Africans in close proximity in the Americas.

The Yoruba descendants in these communities, as well as non-descendants that have adopted one of the [[Yoruba religion#Yoruba religion around the world|Yoruba-based religions]] in the [[diaspora]], no longer speak any of the Yoruba dialects with any level of fluency. Its status as a spirit language also means that there isn't an understanding of correct grammar standards nor proper intonation, since Yoruba language is a tone language and relies upon proper inflection for meaning. Santería practitioners claim that spirit possession in Cuba shows that it manifested in the devotee at a Cuban [[orisa]] ceremony speaking in [[Bozal]].

'''Martha Craven Nussbaum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ʊ|s|b|ɔː|m}}; born May 6, 1947) is an American [[philosopher]] and the current [[Ernst Freund]] Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the [[University of Chicago]], where she is jointly appointed in the Law School and the Philosophy department. She has a particular interest in [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[feminism]], and [[ethics]], including [[animal rights]].  She also holds associate appointments in classics, divinity, and [[political science]], is a member of the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, and a board member of the Human Rights Program. She previously taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Brown University|Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/nussbaum/ "Martha Nussbaum"], University of Chicago, accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum is the author of a number of books, including ''The Fragility of Goodness'' (1986), ''Sex and Social Justice'' (1998), ''Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law'' (2004), and ''Frontiers of Justice: Disability, Nationality, Species Membership'' (2006).

==Life and career==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum 2010.jpg|thumb|Nussbaum in 2010]]

Nussbaum was born in [[New York City]], the daughter of George Craven, a Philadelphia lawyer, and Betty Warren, an interior designer and homemaker; during her teenage years, Nussbaum attended the [[Baldwin School]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]. She described her upbringing as "East Coast [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] elite...very sterile, very preoccupied with money and status".&lt;ref&gt;McLemee, Scott. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. [http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i06/06a01401.htm "What Makes Martha Nussbaum Run?"]&lt;/ref&gt;  She would later credit her impatience with "mandarin philosophers" and dedication to [[public service]] as the "repudiation of my own aristocratic upbringing. I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury group]] or [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]".&lt;ref name="robertboynton1"&gt;Boynton, Robert S. ''The New York Times Magazine.'' [http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy? A Profile of Martha Nussbaum]&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied [[theatre]] and [[classics]] at [[New York University]], getting a BA in 1969, and gradually moved to philosophy while at [[Harvard University]], where she received an MA in 1972 and a PhD in 1975, studying under [[G.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;L. Owen]]. This period also saw her marriage to [[Alan Nussbaum]] (married in 1969, divorced in 1987), her [[conversion to Judaism]], and the birth of her daughter Rachel.

Nussbaum's interest in Judaism has continued and deepened: on August 16, 2008 she became a ''[[bat mitzvah]]'' in a service at [[K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple|Temple K. A. M. Isaiah Israel]] in Chicago's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], chanting from the ''[[Parashah]] Va-etchanan'' and the ''[[Haftarah]] Nahamu'', and delivering a ''D'var [[Torah]]'' about the connection between genuine, non-[[narcissistic]] consolation and the pursuit of [[global justice]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Mourner's Hope: Grief and the Foundations of Justice", ''The Boston Review'', November/December 2008., 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her studies at Harvard, Nussbaum encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination, including sexual harassment, and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she became the first woman to hold the [[Harvard Fellow|Junior Fellowship at Harvard]], Nussbaum received a congratulatory note from a "prestigious classicist" who suggested that since "female fellowess" was an awkward name, she should be called ''[[Hetaera|hetaira]]'', for in Greece these educated courtesans were the only women who participated in philosophical symposia.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980 she taught philosophy and classics at Harvard, where she was denied tenure by the Classics Department in 1982.&lt;ref name="robertboynton1"/&gt; Nussbaum then moved to [[Brown University]], where she taught until 1994 when she joined the [[University of Chicago Law School]] faculty. Her 1986 book ''The Fragility of Goodness'', on ancient Greek ethics and Greek tragedy, made her a well-known figure throughout the humanities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} More recent work (''Frontiers of Justice'') establishes Nussbaum as a theorist of global justice.

Nussbaum's work on capabilities has often focused on the unequal freedoms and opportunities of women, and she has developed a distinctive type of feminism, drawing inspiration from the liberal tradition, but emphasizing that liberalism, at its best, entails radical rethinking of gender relations and relations within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha. ''Women and Human Development''. New York:  Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum's other major area of philosophical work is the emotions.  She has defended a ''neo-[[stoicism|Stoic]]'' account of emotions that holds that they are appraisals that ascribe to things and persons, outside the agent's own control, great significance for the person's own flourishing.  On this basis she has proposed analyses of grief, compassion, and love,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. Poetic Justice:  ''Literary Imagination and Public Life.'' Boston:  Beacon Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a later book, of disgust and shame.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Hiding from Humanity:  Shame, Disgust, and the Law.''  Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum has engaged in many spirited debates with other intellectuals, in her academic writings as well as in the pages of semi-popular magazines and book reviews and, in one instance, when testifying as an expert witness in court. She testified in the Colorado bench trial for ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', arguing against the claim that the history of philosophy provides the state with a "compelling interest" in favor of a law denying gays and lesbians the right to seek passage of local non-discrimination laws. A portion of this testimony, dealing with the potential meanings of the term ''tolmêma'' in Plato's work, was the subject of controversy, and was called misleading and even [[perjury|perjurious]] by critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9609/stand.html The Stand] by Daniel Mendelsohn, from ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy?: A profile of Martha Nussbaum] by Robert Boynton from ''The New York Times Magazine'', November 21, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She responded to these charges in a lengthy article called "Platonic Love and Colorado Law".&lt;ref&gt;Martha C. Nussbaum.  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1073514 "Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies"], Virginia Law Review, Vol. 80, No. 7 (Oct. 1994), pp. 1515-1651.&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum used multiple references from Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and his interactions with Socrates as evidence for her argument. The debate continued with a reply by one of her sternest critics, [[Robert P. George]].&lt;ref&gt;George, Robert P. '"Shameless Acts" Revisited: Some Questions for Martha Nussbaum', Academic Questions 9 (Winter 1995-96), 24-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nussbaum has criticized [[Noam Chomsky]] as being among the leftist intellectuals who hold the belief that "one should not criticize one’s friends, that solidarity is more important than ethical correctness". She suggests that one can "trace this line to an old Marxist contempt for bourgeois ethics, but it is loathsome whatever its provenance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/violence-on-the-left-nandigram-and-the-communists-of-west-bengal |title=Violence on the Left |author=Martha C.

Nussbaum is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1988) and the [[American Philosophical Society]].

===''The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy''===
''The Fragility of Goodness''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; confronts the [[ethical dilemma]] that individuals strongly committed to [[justice]] are nevertheless vulnerable to external factors that may deeply compromise or even negate their [[human flourishing]]. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks to determine the extent to which [[reason]] may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the [[Platonism|Platonic]] notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[playwright]]s and [[Aristotle]] in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good.

Her interpretation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' in particular drew considerable attention. Under Nussbaum's consciousness of vulnerability, the re-entrance of [[Alcibiades]] at the end of the dialogue undermines [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]'s account of the ladder of love in its ascent to the non-physical realm of the [[Theory of the forms|forms]]. Alcibiades's presence deflects attention back to physical [[beauty]], sexual passions, and bodily limitations, hence highlighting human fragility.

''Fragility'' made Nussbaum famous throughout the humanities. It garnered wide praise in academic reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Hazel E. ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 40, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, Paul B. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 50, No. 1 (Sep. 1989), pp. 205-210&lt;/ref&gt; and even drew acclaim in the popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Knox|Knox, Bernard]]. "The Theater of Ethics". [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=4941 ''The New York Review of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] credited ''Fragility'' with matching "the highest academic standards" of the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''Sex, Art, &amp; American Culture''. NY: Vintage Books, 1991. pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Times Higher Education'' called it "a supremely scholarly work".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Lucy. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=95200&amp;sectioncode=26 ''And you may ask yourself...]''&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum's fame extended her influence beyond print and into television programs like PBS's [[Bill Moyers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoppbs.org/search/noResults.jsp?kw=2407861|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909144927/http://www.shoppbs.org/search/noResults.jsp?kw=2407861|deadurl=yes|title=Shop PBS|date=September 9, 2012|archivedate=September 9, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cultivating Humanity''===
''Cultivating Humanity''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; appeals to classical Greek texts as a basis for defense and reform of the [[liberal education]]. Noting the Greek [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]]' aspiration to transcend "local origins and group memberships" in favor of becoming "a [[Global citizenship#World citizen|citizen of the world]]", Nussbaum traces the development of this idea through the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[Cicero]], and eventually the [[classical liberalism]] of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Nussbaum champions [[multiculturalism]] in the context of [[ethical universalism]], defends scholarly inquiry into race, gender, and [[human sexuality]], and further develops the role of literature as narrative imagination into ethical questions.

At the same time, Nussbaum also censured certain scholarly trends. She excoriated [[deconstructionist]] [[Jacques Derrida]] saying "on [[truth]] [he is] simply not worth studying for someone who has been studying [[W. V. O. Quine|Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]". She cites Zhang Longxi, who labels Derrida's analysis of [[Chinese culture]] "pernicious" and without "evidence of serious study".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pages 41 &amp; 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  More broadly, Nussbaum criticized [[Michel Foucault]] for his "historical incompleteness [and] lack of conceptual clarity", but nevertheless singled him out for providing "the only truly important work to have entered philosophy under the banner of '[[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;  Nussbaum is even more critical of figures like [[Allan Bloom]], [[Roger Kimball]], and [[George Will]] for what she considers their "shaky" knowledge of non-Western cultures and inaccurate caricatures of today's humanities departments.

''The [[New York Times]]'' praised ''Cultivating Humanity'' as "a passionate, closely argued defense of multiculturalism" and hailed it as "a formidable, perhaps definitive defense of diversity on American campuses".&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, James. ''Beyond the Culture Wars''. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4D61E3EF937A35752C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2/ ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum was the 2002 recipient of the University of Louisville [[Grawemeyer Award|Grawmeyer Award]] in Education.

===''Sex and Social Justice''===
''Sex and Social Justice'' sets out to demonstrate that sex and sexuality are morally irrelevant distinctions that have been artificially enforced as sources of [[social hierarchy]]; thus, [[feminism]] and [[social justice]] have common concerns. Rebutting anti-universalist objections, Nussbaum proposes functional freedoms, or central human capabilities, as a rubric of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex &amp; Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 29-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum discusses at length the feminist critiques of [[liberalism]] itself, including the charge advanced by [[Alison Jaggar]] that liberalism demands [[ethical egoism]].  Nussbaum notes that liberalism emphasizes respect for ''others'' as individuals, and further argues that Jaggar has elided the distinction between [[individualism]] and self-sufficiency.  Nussbaum accepts [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s critique of abstract liberalism, assimilating the salience of history and context of group hierarchy and subordination, but concludes that this appeal is rooted in liberalism rather than a critique of it.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex &amp; Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 55-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum condemns the practice of [[female genital mutilation]], citing deprivation of [[normative]] human functioning in its risks to health, impact on sexual functioning, violations of dignity, and conditions of non-[[autonomy]]. Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of [[Patriarchy|male domination]], Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation as an issue of injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex &amp; Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 118-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also refines the concept of "[[objectification]]", as originally advanced by [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]]. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: [[instrumental rationality|instrumentality]], denial of autonomy, inertness, [[fungibility]], violability, ownership, and denial of [[subjectivity]]. Her characterization of [[pornography]] as a tool of objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with [[sex-positive feminism]]. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of [[prostitution]], a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Spitzer scandal]], writing: "The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing one of the ones they do have is grotesque."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nussbaum, "[http://www.ajc.com/search/content/opinion/2008/03/13/spitzered_0314.html Trading on America's [[puritan]]ical streak]", ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', March 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sex and Social Justice'' was lauded by critics in the press. [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] declared: "She shows brilliantly how sex is used to deny some people—i.e., women and gay men—social justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/it/1999/04/19/nussbaum/|title=Rescuing the Feminist Book|author=Maria Russo|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the work as "elegantly written and carefully argued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/14/reviews/990314.14ryanlt.html?scp=5&amp;sq=martha+nussbaum&amp;st=cse|title=Cultural Perversions|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Trevenen praised Nussbaum's effort to shift feminist concerns toward interconnected transnational efforts, and for explicating a set of universal guidelines to structure an agenda of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Trevenen, Kathryn.  "Global Feminism and the 'Problem' of Culture". ''Theory &amp; Event'' 5.1 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrick Hopkins singled out for praise Nussbaum's "masterful" chapter on sexual objectification.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Patrick D. "Sex and Social Justice". ''Hypatia'' 17.2 (2002): 171-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin faulted Nussbaum for "consistent over-intellectualisation of emotion, which has the inevitable consequence of mistaking suffering for cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea R. "Rape is not just another word for suffering". ''Times Higher Education.'' August 4, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hiding from Humanity''===
''Hiding from Humanity''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; extends Nussbaum's work in [[moral psychology]] to probe the arguments for including two emotions—[[shame]] and [[disgust]]—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or [[animal]]ity through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how [[psychological projection|projective]] disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, [[Jews]], and [[homosexuals]]), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.

Turning to shame, Nussbaum argues that shame takes too broad a target, attempting to inculcate [[humiliation]] on a scope that is too intrusive and limiting on human freedom. Nussbaum sides with [[John Stuart Mill]] in narrowing legal concern to acts that cause a distinct and assignable harm.

In an interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Nussbaum elaborated: "Disgust and shame are inherently [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]; they set up ranks and orders of human beings. They are also inherently connected with restrictions on [[liberty]] in areas of non-harmful conduct. For both of these reasons, I believe, anyone who cherishes the key [[Democracy|democratic]] values of [[egalitarianism|equality]] and liberty should be deeply suspicious of the appeal to those emotions in the context of law and [[public policy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/33316.html|title=Discussing Disgust|work=Reason.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum's work was received with wide praise. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called her argument "characteristically lucid" and hailed her as "America's most prominent philosopher of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, John. ''You Stink therefore I am''.[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/05/02/you_stink_therefore_i_am/?page=2/ ''The Boston Globe'']&lt;/ref&gt; Her reviews in national newspapers and magazines garnered unanimous praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/08/08/LVGC580JDU1.DTL&amp;hw=nussbaum&amp;sn=002&amp;sc=952/|title=Philosopher warns us against using shame as punishment / Guilt can be creative, but the blame game is dangerous|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academic circles, Stefanie A. Lindquist of [[Vanderbilt University]] lauded Nussbaum's analysis as a "remarkably wide ranging and nuanced treatise on the interplay between emotions and law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/nussbaum904.htm|title=''Stefanie A. Lindquist's Review''|publisher=|accessdate=October 31, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012004410/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/nussbaum904.htm|archivedate=October 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent exception was [[Roger Kimball]]'s review published in ''[[The New Criterion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger. ''The New Criterion''.[http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/23/sept04/shame.htm ''Does Shame have a Future?'']&lt;/ref&gt; in which he accused Nussbaum of "fabricating" the renewed prevalence of shame and disgust in public discussions and says she intends to "undermine the inherited moral wisdom of millennia". He rebukes her for "contempt for the opinions of ordinary people"  and ultimately accuses Nussbaum herself of "hiding from humanity".

Nussbaum has recently drawn on and extended her work on disgust to produce a new analysis of the legal issues regarding sexual orientation and same-sex conduct.  Her book ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and the Constitution'' was published by Oxford University Press in 2009, as part of their "Inalienable Rights" series, edited by Geoffrey Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195305319|title=From Disgust to Humanity|work=oup.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604142304/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195305319|archivedate=June 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''===

In the 2010 book ''[[From Disgust to Humanity|From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law]]'' Martha Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha. Oxford University Press. "From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law" (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The book primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of its broader thesis regarding the "politics of disgust".

Nussbaum posits that the fundamental motivations of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a "politics of disgust". These legal restrictions include blocking [[sexual orientation]] being protected under [[anti-discrimination law]]s (See: ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''), sodomy laws against consenting adults (See: ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''), constitutional bans against same-sex marriage (See: [[California Proposition 8 (2008)]]), over-strict regulation of gay bathhouses, and bans on sex in public parks and public restrooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the last two, see Martha Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''.  Oxford University Press, 2010, 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on polygamy and certain forms of incestuous (e.g. brother–sister) marriage partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity'', 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

She identifies the "politics of disgust" closely with [[Lord Devlin]] and his famous opposition to the [[Wolfenden report]] that recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts on the basis that those things would "disgust the average man". To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the '[[wisdom of repugnance]]' as advocated by [[Leon Kass]] as another "politics of disgust" school of thought as it claims that disgust "in crucial cases ... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it".

Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]], have all been driven by popular revulsion.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum 2004"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Nussbaum, Martha C. |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |title=Danger to Human Dignity: The Revival of Disgust and Shame in the Law |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=August 6, 2004 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of this "politics of disgust", Nussbaum argues for the [[harm principle]] from [[John Stuart Mill]] as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of [[consent]], the [[age of majority]], and [[privacy]], protects citizens while the "politics of disgust" is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this "politics of disgust" has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and [[equality before the law]] on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected.

{{History of Japan |image=Shoso-in.jpg |caption=[[Shōsōin]]}}

{{nihongo|'''''Meiwa'''''|明和}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} after ''[[Horeki|Hōreki]]'' and before ''[[Anei|An'ei]].''  This period spanned the years from June 1764 through November 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Meiwa''" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 625|page=625}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning empress and emperor were {{nihongo|[[Empress Go-Sakuramachi of Japan|Go-Sakuramachi]]''-tennō''|後桜町天皇}} and {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Momozono of Japan|Go-Momozono]]''-tennō''|後桃園天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA419,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', p. 419.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1764''' {{nihongo|''Meiwa gannen''|明和元年}}: The era name became ''Meiwa'' (meaning "Bright Harmony") because of the enthronement of Empress [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi of Japan|Go-Sakuramachi]].

As a cultural phenomenon, the literature of this period records concerted attempts to distill the aggregate characteristics of the inhabitants of [[Edo]] (''Edokko'') into a generalized thumbnail description. These traits (''Edokko katagi'') were put into use to draw a contrast between Edokko and those who didn't have this "sophisticated" gloss -— those not from the city, as in merchants from the [[Kansai|Kyoto-Osaka]] region or [[samurai]] from distant provinces. Sometimes ''Edokko katagi'' was presented with pride; and it was used mockingly.&lt;ref&gt;Nara, Hiroshi. (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PmiT_rrPGQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Structure+of+Detachment:+the+Aesthetic+Vision+of+Kuki+Sh%C5%ABz%C5%8D+with+a+translation+of+%22Iki+no+k%C5%8Dz%C5%8D.%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PRA1-PA1,M1  ''The Structure of Detachment: the Aesthetic Vision of Kuki Shūzō with a translation of "Iki no kōzō,"'' p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the ''Meiwa'' Era==
* '''1765''' (''Meiwa 2''): Five-momme coin issued.
* '''1766''' (''Meiwa 3''): A planned insurrection to displace the Shōgun was thwarted.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, T. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BLzQA7cpr7wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Secret+Memoirs+of+the+Shoguns:+Isaac+Titsingh+and+Japan,+1779-1822&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA139,M1  ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779-1822.'' pp. 139]-145.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1768''' (''Meiwa 5''): Five-momme usage halted.
* '''1770''' (''Meiwa 7''): A typhoon flattened the newly built Imperial Palace in Kyoto.&lt;ref name="h120"&gt;Hall, John. (1955). ''Tanuma Okitsugu, 1719-1788'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1770''' (''Meiwa 7''): A great comet ([[Lexell's Comet]]) with a very long tail lit up the night skies throughout the summer and autumn.&lt;ref name="h120"/&gt;
* '''1770''' (''Meiwa 7''): Although no one could have known it at the time, this was the first of 15 consecutive years of drought in Japan.&lt;ref name="h120"/&gt;
* '''April 1, 1772''' (''Meiwa 9, 29th day of the 2nd month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 明和九年二月二十九日 --&gt;: "The Great ''Meiwa'' Fire"—one of the three greatest Edo fire disasters. Unofficial reports describe a swath of ashes and cinders nearly five miles wide and {{convert|15|mi|km}} long—destroying 178 temples and shrines, 127 daimyō residences, 878 non-official residences, 8705 houses of [[Bannerman (samurai)|bannermen]], and 628 blocks of merchant dwellings, with estimates of over 6,000 casualties. All this devastation subsequently engendered the staggering costs of reconstruction.&lt;ref name="h120"/&gt;
* '''August 2, 1772''' (''Meiwa 9, 4th day of the 6th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 明和九年七月四日 --&gt;: A terrible tempest hit the Kantō bringing floods and ruining crops.&lt;ref name="h120"/&gt;
* '''August 17, 1772''' (''Meiwa 9, 19th day of the 6th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 明和九年七月十九日 --&gt;: Another storm with more flooding and winds no less intense blew down an estimated 4000 houses in Edo alone.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1772''' (''Meiwa 9''): At the time, it was said that "''Meiwa'' 9 is Year of Trouble" because it was marked by an extraordinary succession of natural calamities. The pun was made linking the words ''"Meiwa"'' + ''"ku"'' (meaning "''Meiwa'' 9") and the sound-alike word ''"meiwaku"'' (meaning "misfortune" or "annoyance").&lt;ref name="h120"/&gt;
* '''1772''' (''Meiwa 9,  11th month''): The ''nengō'' was changed to ''Anei'' (meaning "eternal tranquillity"), but this symbolic act was proved futile.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Narentines''' were a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]]{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=306}} tribe that occupied an area of southern [[Dalmatia]] centered at the river [[Neretva]] ({{lang|la|Narenta}}), active in the 9th and 10th centuries, noted as pirates on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. Named ''Narentani'' in Venetian sources, Greek sources call them ''Paganoi'', "pagans", as they were for long pagan, in a time when neighbouring tribes were Christianized. The tribe were fierce enemies of the [[Republic of Venice]], having attacked Venetian merchants and clergy passing on the Adriatic, and even raided close to [[Venice]] itself, as well as defeated the Doge several times. Venetian–Narentine peace treaties did not last long, as the Narentines quickly returned to piracy. They were finally defeated in a Venetian crackdown at the turn of the 10th century and disappeared from sources by the 11th century.

==Terminology==
The word ''Narentine'' is a [[demonym]] derived from the local [[Neretva river]] ({{lang-lat|Narenta}}). The terms "Narentines", "Pagania" or "Pagans" are found in two contemporary sources: ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' ({{abbr|DAI|De Administrando Imperio}}), a mid-10th century Greek work, and ''[[Chronicon Venetum et Gradense]]'', a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] chronicle by [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] from the early 11th century.{{sfn|Ančić|2011|p=255}}{{sfn|Živković|2012b|pp=11–12}} In ''De Administrando Imperio'' of Byzantine emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] (r. 913–959), the tribe is called ''Paganoi'' ({{lang-gr|Παγανοὶ, Παγανοἰ}}), and their polity ''Pagania'' (Παγανὶα, Παγανἰα), in Greek, while also noting that in Latin they are called ''Arentanoi'' (Αρεντανοἰ) and their polity ''Arenta'' (Αρεντα).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|pp=152, 164–165}} Chronicler John the Deacon used the geographical term ''Narentani'' (as in ''princeps Narentanorum'',{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=62}} ''Narrentanos Sclavos''{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=39}}). In Serbo-Croatian, the tribal name is rendered as ''Neretljani'' (Неретљани) and ''Pagani'' (Пагани), while the polity mostly as ''Paganija'' (Паганија).

==Geography and economy==
In DAI's chapters ''Story of the province of Dalmatia'' and ''Of the Pagani, also called Arentani, and of the country they now dwell in'', the geography of Pagania is described. Pagania had the counties (''[[župa|župa (zoupanias)]]'') of Rhastotza, Mokros and Dalen.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=145}} Rhastotza and Mokros lay by the coast, and had galleys, while Dalen was distant from the sea and was based on agriculture.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=145}} Pagania had the inhabited cities of Mokron ([[Makarska]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}), Beroullia (presumably [[Brela]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}), Ostrok ([[Zaostrog]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}) and Slavinetza (near [[Gradac, Split-Dalmatia County|Gradac]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}), and the large islands of Kourkra/Kiker with a city ([[Korčula]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}), Meleta/Malozeatai ([[Mljet]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}), Phara ([[Hvar]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}) and Bratzis ([[Brač]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=165}} The Pagani raised flocks on the islands.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=145}} Islands in the vicinity but not part of Pagania were Chora (presumably [[Sušac]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}), Iës ([[Vis (island)|Vis]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}) and Lastobon ([[Lastovo]]{{sfn|Institut za hrvatsku povijest|1974|p=29}}).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=165}} Croatia was situated to the west, and [[Zachumlia]] to the east; Serbia was situated inland to the north, behind Pagania, Zachumlia, [[Travunija|Travunia]] and [[Duklja|Dioklea]], and bordered to Croatia on the Tzentina ([[Cetina]]) river.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=145}}

==History==

The ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (South Slavs) overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th century. The ''DAI'' speaks of the Narentines as descended from the "unbaptized Serbs" that settled Dalmatia under the protection of Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] (r. 610–641), and that the land of the Narentines had earlier been devastated by the Avars.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967}} In 639 AD, ''[[Narona]]'', until then a flourishing Roman city, was destroyed by a horde of [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and Slavs.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=363}} A few years later, Slavic tribes took control of the lower Neretva.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=363}} The Slavs built a new town on the ruins of Narona, and erected a monument to their Slavic god [[Svetovid]], on the ruins of Roman temples.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=363}} According to Evans, ''Narentia'' became a stronghold for pagans in the Balkans, similarly to [[Balto-Slavs]] in [[Rügen]] (at [[Jaromarsburg]]).{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=363}} In 642, Slavs invaded southern Italy and attacked [[Siponto]], by ship from the Dalmatian coast.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD-N2009-3&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|2001|loc=ch. "Prva srpska država"}}; {{harvnb|Narayan|2009|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic naval raids on the Adriatic increased and it became unsafe for travel.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD-N2009-3/&gt;

The first conflicts between the Venetians and Narentines came immediately before 830, around which time the first peace agreement was signed between the two (the Venetian Doge and ''Sclavorum de insula Narrentis'').{{sfn|Filozofski fakultet|1964|p=147}} Narentine Slavs sent envoys to Doge [[Giovanni I Participazio]] (r. 829–836).{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=37}} P. Skok believes this period also being the first contact between Venice and the middle Dalmatian islands.{{sfn|Filozofski fakultet|1964|p=147}} According to [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik|Šafárik]] (1795–1861), by the beginning of the 9th century their power had increased so much that Doge Giovanni I attacked them and then offered them peace.{{sfn|Kostić|1963|p=23}} The [[Republic of Venice]] was ''de facto'' subordinate the [[Byzantine Empire]], a period in which Venice expanded its trade relations towards the East.{{sfn|Šišić|1990|p=321}} In the first half of the 9th century Byzantium was struck by internal unrest, while the Bulgars and Arabs strengthened themselves thanks to this.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|2001|loc=ch. "Prva srpska država"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs took Crete in 825, Palermo in 831, Taranto in 839, then after destroying the Venetian navy by 840, they roamed freely in the Adriatic.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; In 841 Arabic ships attacked Adriatic cities and reached a confluence of the Padua river, while smaller contingents attacked [[Budva]], Roza and Lower [[Kotor]].&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; In 842 the Arabs conquered Bari, and in 846 reached Rome itself.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; The Venetian navy, obliged to defend the Byzantine Adriatic, were occupied almost fully with battles with the Arabs.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; The Byzantine navy rarely appeared, and with small numbers of ships.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; This, and Arab harassment, gave the Slavic pirates around the Neretva upswing to develop their ship capabilities.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; When the Venetian navy was in Sicilian waters as guards in 827–828, the Narentines received momentum; when the Venetian navy returned, they calmed down.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; Venetian chronicles speak of a Narentine leader having been baptized in Venice, for greater security for the latter; however, the Narentines are unsteady and deceptive as their sea; as soon as events in Venice or the Adriatic worsen, the Narentines continued their piracy.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; One of their attacks in 834–835, when they robbed and killed some Venetian merchants returning from Benevento, caused great resentment against them in Venice.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt;

In order to stop these assaults, the Venetians undertook a large expedition against the Dalmatian Slavic pirates in 839.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; Doge [[Pietro Tradonico]] sent warships against the Slavic lands (''Sclavenia'').{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=37}} According to [[Ferdo Šišić|F. Šišić]] Doge Pietro ordered an attack on the Narentines in the spring of 839.{{sfn|Šišić|1990|p=328}} According to [[Vjekoslav Klaić|V. Klaić]], Tradonico had first defeated and made peace with the Croats under Mislav, then proceeded to attack the Narentine islands and make peace with Narentine leader Drosaico.{{sfn|Klaić|1972|p=73}} There are no information on the fights that year, but it is known that peace was concluded with Croats and a part of the Narentines.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; Venetian chronicler [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] (1008) records a renewal of the peace treaty signed by Drosaico (''ad Narrentanas insulas cum Drosaico, Marianorum iudice, similiter fedus instituit'').{{sfn|Klaić|1971|p=217}} The peace with the Narentines did not last long, perhaps as the Narentines signed it to avoid danger, or more likely because it was not concluded with all, but a tribe or clan of the Narentines.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; In 840 the Venetians attacked Narentine leader Ljudislav, ending in failure;&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; Ljudislav (''Liuditus sclavus''), possibly a successor or co-ruler of Drosaico, defeated the Venetian Doge and killed hundreds of his men.{{sfn|Šišić|1990|p=328}} According to Klaić it was the Narentines who broke the peace.{{sfn|Klaić|1972|p=73}} It seems that Narentine piracy even reached Istria by February 840.{{sfn|Šišić|1990|p=328}} The [[840 Venetian–Frankish treaty]] included common fight against Slavic tribes (''generationes Sclavorum inimicas'').{{sfn|Fine|2006|pp=37–38}} After two defeats to the Venetian navy by the Arabs immediately after, the Venetians were unable to enter new fights with the Dalmatian Slavs.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt; In 846 the Narentines reached close to Venice itself, and raided nearby [[Caorle]].&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt;{{sfn|Narayan|2009|p=4}}
 [[File:Map of the Western Balkans around 814 AD.png|left|thumb|Western Balkan polities in the early 9th century.]]
The arrival of [[Basil I]] (r. 867–886) to the Byzantine throne led to important changes in Byzantium; energetic, he managed to enter closer ties with Bulgars, and even the distant Croats, and protected the Empire well.&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|2001|loc=ch. "Pokrštavanje Južnih Slovena"}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]] asked for the emperor's help against the threat of the [[Saracens]], he dispatched a strong navy into the Adriatic.&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; Byzantine admiral [[Niketas Ooryphas]] took up closer contacts with the Serb tribes around Ragusa, the [[Zahumlje|Zachumlians]], [[Travunija|Travunians]] and [[Konavle|Konavlians]], and invited them to jointly combat the Saracens, both on land and sea, in 869.&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; Only Slavic tribes of southern Dalmatia were called to cooperate; to the north, the Croats and Dalmatians entered relations with Italian king [[Louis II of Italy|Louis]] at the dismay of the Byzantines.&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; When some "Slavs"&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; (Narentines according to Narayan{{sfn|Narayan|2009|p=4}}) in March 870 kidnapped the [[Bishop of Rome]]'s emissaries returning home from the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|Fourth Council]] in [[Constantinople]],{{sfn|Narayan|2009|p=4}} the Byzantines used this as a good pretext to attack and force them into submission (871).&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; The ''DAI'' mentions that the Narentines were called "pagans, because they did not accept baptism in the time when all Serbs were baptized", which is placed during Basil's rule.&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; The Narentines are not mentioned in relation to the Byzantine military expedition on Bari dispatched by [[Basil I]] (r. 867–886), in which other Dalmatian Slavs participated.{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|1997|p=15}} The Croats, Serbs, Zachlumians, Travunians, Konavlians, Ragusans, "with all the men of the towns of Dalmatia", crossed over the sea to [[Longobardia|Langobardia]] and took Bari.{{sfn|Živković|2008|p=165}} Basil returned [[Dalmatia (theme)|Dalmatia under Byzantine rule]]{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|1997|p=15}} by 878, and a large part of Dalmatia was put under the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=C2001-PJS/&gt; The ''DAI'' claims that the Dalmatian Slavs asked Basil I to baptize them; the Christianization of the Narentines seems to have failed.{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|1997|p=15}} According to Evans, the Narentines remained pagan until 873, when Byzantine admiral Ooryphas persuaded them to accept baptism.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=363}} While Doge [[Orso I Participazio]] and his son [[Giovanni II Participazio]] made peace and an alliance with the Croats after 876, the Venetians were still at war with the Narentines.{{sfn|Klaić|1972|p=80}}

In 880 the Venetian–Frankish treaty was renewed.{{sfn|Brković|2001|p=32}} In 887 Doge [[Pietro I Candiano]] sent troops against the Narentine Slavs, landing at the "Slavic Hill" (''mons Sclavorum''), putting the Slavs to flight.{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=37}} The Narentines were defeated in a battle in August 887 at Makarska, and their five ships were destroyed with axes.{{sfn|Brković|2001|p=32}} With help from neighbours, the Narentines decisively defeated the Venetian navy on 18 September 887, with the Doge killed in action and his body left laying (Andrea Tribun later secretly took the body to Venice).{{sfn|Brković|2001|p=32}} From this time until 948 the Venetian chronicles do not mention conflicts with the Croats, which would mean that the Venetians offered peace and paid tribute to the Croats.{{sfn|Brković|2001|p=32}}

Pagania was by the reign of Serbian ruler [[Petar Gojniković]] (r. 892–917) part of the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian principality]]. Petar and the Byzantine commander of [[Dyrrhachium (theme)|Dyrrhachion]] [[Leo Rhabdouchos]] met in Narentine lands regarding an alliance against the Bulgars.&lt;ref name=C2001-SiVHB&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|2001|loc=ch. "Srbi između Vizantije, Hrvatske i Bugarske"}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael of Zahumlje]], who had been pushed out from Zahumlje to the neighbouring islands by Petar, informed the Bulgars about these negotiations.&lt;ref name=C2001-SiVHB/&gt; In 917 Petar was tricked by the Bulgars, who then annexed Serbia in 924–927,{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=153}} until [[Časlav]] returned to Serbia and rebuilt the state, in Byzantine alliance.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=159}} Časlav's state included Pagania (the Narentines).{{cn|date=June 2016}} In the 940s, the islands of [[Brač]] and [[Hvar]], which had earlier become part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Croatian kingdom]], seceded during Ban [[Pribina, Ban of Croatia|Pribina]]'s rebellion and rejoined the Narentine province.{{sfn|Šišić|1990|p=436}} The Narentines took advantage of the internal unrest in Croatia after the death of [[Petar Krešimir]] (945) and took the islands of [[Sušac|Cazza]], [[Vis (island)|Vis]] and [[Lastovo]].&lt;ref name=C2001-SiVHB/&gt; In 948 the Narentines were at war with Venetian Doge [[Pietro III Candiano]], who sent 33 war galleys under Urso Badovario and Pietro Rozollo; the Narentines managed to defend themselves.{{sfn|Šišić|1990|p=436}} The Venetians were forced to pay tribute to the Narentines for safe sea passage.&lt;ref name=C2001-SiVHB/&gt; Serbia collapsed after Časlav's death in ca. 960, into smaller units.&lt;ref name=C2001-SiVHB/&gt;

In 997, the Narentines increased raids against Latin and Venetian towns, and they had close ties with Croat ruler [[Svetoslav Suronja]], who at the time fought his two brothers over the throne; this relation caused the Latin Dalmatian towns and Venice to turn against Svetoslav.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=274}} In 998, the Republic of Venice, under the Byzantine Emperor, exerted control over the Byzantine Dalmatian towns; Dalmatian Croatia was in civil war; the Narentines were semi-independent, raiding the Adriatic, particularly against Venice.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=276}} As Venice gained authority in Dalmatia, some Dalmatian towns that felt threatened allied with the Narentines.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=276}} The Venetians then interved and defeated the Narentines and their Croatian allies decisively on sea, resulting in Narentine power decline.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=276}}

On 9 May 1000, Venetian Doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]]&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Frederic Chapin. ''Venice, a Maritime Republic'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; decided to conquer the allied Croats and Narentines, protecting the interests of their trading colonies and the Latin Dalmatian citizenry. Without difficulty, he struck the entire eastern Adriatic coastline - with only the Narentines offering him some resistance. As a counterattack, the Narentines kidnapped 40 of the foremost citizens of [[Zadar|Zara (Zadar)]] and stole a transport of goods from [[Apulia]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} On their way home, Pietro II dispatched 10 ships that surprised them between Lastovo and Kača and took them as prisoners to [[Trogir]]. Narentine emissaries came to the Doge's temporary residence at [[Split (city)|Split]] (Spalato) to beg for the release of the prisoners. They guaranteed that the Narentine prince himself would show up with his men and renounce the old rights to tax the Venetians for free passage. All prisoners were allowed to return to their homes, except for six that were kept as hostages. Lastovo and Korčula continued to oppose the Venetians. Korčula was conquered by Pietro II and Lastovo fell too after long bloody fights. As Lastovo was very infamous in the Venetian world for being a pirate haven, the Doge ordered it to be evacuated in order to be razed. After the denizens of Lastovo refused to concur, the Venetians attacked and razed it to the ground.

==Legacy==

There is a historical festival called ''matrimonio'' in [[Venice]] commemorating the victory over the Narentines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Brion|title=Venice: The Masque of Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qHBoAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Elek|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; held on [[Candlemas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catholic World|volume=106–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAkXAQAAIAAJ|year=1918|publisher=Paulist Fathers|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The question of the ethnic designation of the tribe, whether it, apart from being Slavic, was to be described as Serb or Croat, is often found in historiography.{{sfn|Živković|2012b|p=12}} The earliest information about the Narentines is from the early 9th century, compiled in the ''Chronicon Venetum et Gradense''.{{sfn|Živković|2012b|p=13}} The Venetian chronicle used the Slavic ethnonym ({{lang-la|Narrentanos Sclavos}}) to refer to the Narentines.{{sfn|Fine|2006|pp=37, 39, 62}}

''De Administrando Imperio'' also gives information about the Narentines, originating from the 870s.{{sfn|Živković|2012b|p=13}} There, the Narentines are described as "descended from the unbaptized Serbs" ... The Pagans are so called because they did not accept baptism at the time when all the Serbs were baptized."{{sfn|Živković|2012|pp=194–195}} Romanian-American historian [[Florin Curta]] considered it "an indication that in the mid-tenth century the coastal zhupanias were under the control of the Serbian ''zhupan'' Časlav", as noted in his 2006 book.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=210}} Serbian historian [[Tibor Živković]] wrote in 2012 that "it was stated in the DAI that the Serbs had been baptized much earlier, and therefore, the Pagans could not have belonged to the Serb tribe. There is information in chapter 32, that the Serbs controlled Pagania in ca. 895, during the rule of the Archon Peter, and from this political situation Constantine would have been able to write that the Pagans belonged to the Serbian tribe."{{sfn|Živković|2012|p=195}} Croatian historian Neven Budak also holds that remarks regarding the Narentines were related to the political situation at the time.{{sfn|Budak|1994|p=58}}

In the ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]'', a work written by a Catholic bishop likely for a Croatian ruler in ca. 1300–10,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Živković|first1=T.|last2=Kunčer|first2=D.|title=Gesta regum Sclavorum, I–II|location=Београд|year=2009|pages=362–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southern Dalmatian principalities are referred to as part of "[[Red Croatia]]".{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=62}} While later parts of the ''Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja'' are considered of high value, events described in the early Middle Ages are largely discredited in historiography.{{sfn|Živković|2006|p=16}}

[[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861) viewed that the first information on Serbs in history were from events regarding the Narentines.{{sfn|Kostić|1963|p=23}} [[Konstantin Josef Jireček]] (1854–1918) treated them as a distinct South Slavic tribe.&lt;ref name=Zs49&gt;{{cite book|title=Zadarska smotra|volume=49|issue=4–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJwTAQAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian historian [[Ferdo Šišić|F. Šišić]] (1869–1940) said that the Neretva population were "ever and always fully identical to the Croat [population], including also its [[Chakavian]] dialect" (1952).&lt;ref name=Zs49/&gt; Croatian historian [[Vladimir Košćak]] (1921–1991) believed that the Narentines were under Croat rule from [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]] until [[Domagoj of Croatia|Domagoj]] (d. 876), and that after the latter's death, they sent emissaries to Basil I and recognized his rule, which was however short-lived as spanning only to the fall of Byzantine [[:wikt:protégé|protégé]] [[Zdeslav of Croatia|Zdeslav]] (879) when the Narentines again fell away from Byzantium; Košćak wanted to reduce Byzantine rule also to the south of Pagania, claiming that the provinces of Pagania, Zachumlia, Travunia and Duklja again came under Croat rule during [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]] (r. 879–892).{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|1997|p=16}} This theory was criticized by the Serbian academic [http://www.byzinst-sasa.rs/eng/ Institute for Byzantine Studies].{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|1997|p=16}} Serbian historiography in the 19th and 20th century considered the Narentines to be Serbs.{{sfn|Ančić|2011|p=224}} [[Vladimir Ćorović]] (1885–1941) treated the Narentines as the first of the Serb tribes to take the initiative of fighting, not for defence and tribal organization, but for the liberty of selfish desires and security raids.&lt;ref name=C2001-PSD/&gt;

According to Croatian historian [[Ivo Goldstein]], the Narentines "could not be regarder neither Serbs nor Croats."{{sfn|Goldstein|1995|p=196}} Budak wrote that the Narentines were "undoubtedly a distinct ethnic group", who "disappeared as a separate ethnicity when their principality was joined into Croatia".{{sfn|Budak|1994|p=59}}

{{POV|talk=The article has strong anti Israeli Point Of View|date=January 2014}}
The '''origins of the Six-Day War''', which was fought between June 5 and June 10, 1967, by [[Israel]] and the neighboring states of [[Egypt]] (known then as the [[United Arab Republic]], UAR), [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]], include both longstanding and immediate issues. At the time of the [[Six-Day War]], the earlier foundation of Israel, the resulting [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian refugee issue]], and Israel's participation in the invasion of Egypt during the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956 continued to be significant grievances for the Arab world. Arab nationalists, led by Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], continued to be hostile to Israel's existence and made grave threats against its Jewish population. By the mid-1960s, relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors had deteriorated to the extent that a number of border clashes had taken place.

In April 1967, Syria shot at an Israeli tractor ploughing in the demilitarized zone, which escalated to a prewar aerial clash. In May 1967, following misinformation about Israeli intentions provided by the [[Soviet Union]], Egypt expelled [[United Nations Emergency Force|UN peacekeepers]] who had been stationed in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] since the [[Suez conflict]],&lt;ref&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A/6730 and Add.1-3 |body=A |type=Special Report |title=Report of the Secretary-General on the withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force |date=26 June 1967 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced a blockade of Israel's access to the Red Sea (international waters) via the [[Straits of Tiran]], which Israel considered an act of war. Tension escalated, with both sides' armies mobilising. Less than a month later, Israel launched a surprise strike which began the [[Six-Day War]].

The conventional view and memoirs of key Israelis indicate that Israel's actions leading into the war were prudent and the blame for the war rested on Egypt. According to political scientist [[Zeev Maoz]], most scholarly studies attribute the crisis to a complicated process of unwanted escalation, which all sides wanted to prevent, but for which all were ultimately responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Maoz, Zeev.  ''Defending the Holy Land: A Critical Analysis of Israel's Security &amp; Foreign Policy'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHQe4qn-EmUC&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111] (University of Michigan Press, 2009): "It is most important to reiterate the conclusion of most scholarly accounts of the crisis: this was a process of unwanted escalation, which everybody wanted to prevent, but all were responsible for making this escalation unavoidable."&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser knew that his blockade of the Straits of Tiran from Israeli vessel passage, on 23 May 1967, might very likely provide Israel with reason to launch war.&lt;ref name="Bickerton2009P111"/&gt; His decisions to ask for the removal of the UN peacekeepers from Sinai and especially to block the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping via the Straits of Tiran, are commonly accepted as the point where war became inevitable.&lt;ref name="Bickerton2009P111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferris2012p286"/&gt; Some commentators consider the war as the classic case of anticipatory attack in self-defense,&lt;ref name="Szabo2011p147"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quigley2012p135"/&gt; while in the 21st century the view that Israel acted in self-defense has become increasingly contested.&lt;ref name="Quigley2012p134-5"/&gt;

==Summary of events leading to war==
After the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], Egypt agreed to the stationing of a [[United Nations Emergency Force]] (UNEF) in the Sinai to ensure all parties would comply with the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 =Rauschning | last2 = Wiesbrock | last3 = Lailach | year = 1997 | page = 30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachar 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;504, 507–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = UN | url = https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html |title= First United Nations Emergency Force (Unef I) — Background (Full text)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the overwhelming support for Resolution 1000 in the UN General Assembly, Israel refused to allow UNEF forces onto its territory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/od-bdo/di-ri-eng.asp?IntlOpId=273&amp;CdnOpId=427&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, there were numerous minor border clashes between Israel and its Arab neighbors, particularly Syria.

==Territorial, water ways and water resources disputes==

===Territorial disputes===
The peace accord at the end of the 1948 war had established demilitarized zones (DMZs) between Israel and Syria&lt;ref name=SergeSchmemann/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elie Podeh , Asher Kaufman, Moshe Maoz 2006 118–119"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOzJeyjF2_UC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=dayan+%22I+know+how+at+least+80+percent%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dayan%20%22I%20know%20how%20at%20least%2080%20percent%22&amp;f=false|title=Arab-Jewish Relations: From Conflict to Resolution|author1=Elie Podeh |author2=Asher Kaufman |author3=Moshe Maoz |edition=Hardcover|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903900-68-0|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as recalled by UN military forces officers such as [[Odd Bull]] and [[Carl von Horn (1903–1989)|Carl von Horn]], Israelis gradually took over portions of the zone, evicting Arab villagers and demolishing their homes; these actions incurring protests from the UN Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|2003|pp=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe Dayan]], the Israeli defense minister at the time of the Six Day War, recounted in a 1976 interview that Israeli policy in the Demilitarized Zone between 1949 and 1967 was "to seize some territory and hold it until the enemy despairs and gives it to us", thus changing "the lines of the ceasefire accord with military actions that were less than a war".&lt;ref name=SergeSchmemann&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmemann |first=Serge |date=11 May 1997 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E4D91239F932A25756C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=General's Words Shed a New Light on the Golan |publisher=[[The New York Times]] See also Shlaim 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;235-236;  Eyal Zisser, June 1967: Israel's capture of the Golan Heights, ''Israel Studies'', Vol 7, 168-194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelstein 2003 131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|2003|pp=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dayan related further that in the process Israel had provoked more than 80% of the border clashes with Syria in the lead-up to its April 7, 1967 invasion of Syria.&lt;ref name=SergeSchmemann/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elie Podeh , Asher Kaufman, Moshe Maoz 2006 118–119"/&gt; In defense of the Israeli actions historian [[Michael Oren]] said that "[t]here is an element of truth to Dayan's claim", but that Israeli actions were justified, as "Israel regarded the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory".&lt;ref name=OrenQA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.jpost.com/C004/QandA/qa.orenm.html |title=Q&amp;A with Michael Oren |date=5 June 2007 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluska qualified this view by pointing out that such Israeli sovereignty over all of the DMZ "was not sanctioned by the UN".&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, Ami. "The Israeli Military and the 1967 War", Routledge, 2007, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the Israeli view had been rejected in 1951 by both Britain and the UN Security council (in Resolution 93).&lt;ref&gt;Sitta, [http://www.plands.org/articles/006.html The Line of 1967-1949], Part 3 - "The mysterious line of June 4, 1967", October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1967 Israel reverted to claiming sovereignty over the DMZ.&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, Ami. "The Israeli Military and the 1967 War", Routledge, 2007, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicly, Syria claimed that the escalating conflict was the result of Israel attempting to increase tension in order to justify a large-scale military operation against Syria, and to expand its occupation of the Demilitarized Zone by dispossessing the remaining Arab farmers.

According to Moshe Shemesh, a historian and former senior intelligence officer in the IDF, Jordan's military and civilian leaders estimated that Israel's main objective was conquest of the West Bank. They felt that Israel was striving to drag all of the Arab countries into a war. After the Samu raid, these apprehensions became the deciding factor in Jordan's decision to participate in the war. King Hussein was convinced Israel would try to occupy the West Bank whether Jordan went to war, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Shemesh 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straits of Tiran===
After the 1956 war, Egypt agreed to reopen the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping, whose closure had been a significant catalyst in precipitating the Suez Crisis.

===Water dispute===
{{main article|War over Water (Jordan river){{!}}War over Water}}
The [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan|Johnston Plan]] was a plan for the unified [[water resource]] development of the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], sponsored by [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]] and accepted by the main Arab leader, Nasser,&lt;ref name="Gat2003p101"/&gt; and by [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]]. In 1964, Israel began drawing water from the [[Jordan River]] for its [[National Water Carrier]], in accordance with the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan|Johnston Plan]], reducing the flow that reached Hashemite territory to the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan|Johnston Plan]] allocation.&lt;ref&gt;Sosland, Jeffrey (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ci0q-p0m0EC&amp;dq= Cooperating Rivals: The Riparian Politics of the Jordan River Basin], SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-7201-9}} p 70&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo, claimed that the diversion of the Jordan waters by Israel multiplies the dangers to Arab existence and decided to deprive Israel of 35% of the National Water Carrier capacity, by a diversion of the [[Jordan River]] headwaters (both the Hasbani and the Banias tributaries) to the [[Yarmouk River]], although the scheme was only marginally feasible, it was technically difficult and expensive.&lt;ref name="Shlaim2000p229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapland1997p13"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Shapland|title=Rivers of Discord: International Water Disputes in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDKJV-916UoC&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=1997|publisher=C.

The [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) attacked the diversion works in Syria in March, May, and August 1965, perpetuating a prolonged chain of border violence that linked directly to the events leading to war.&lt;ref&gt;Koboril and Glantz 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;129–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events during the years before the war==

===Israel and the Arab states===
At the time, no Arab state had [[Diplomatic recognition|recognized]] Israel. Syria, aligned with the [[Soviet bloc]], began sponsoring guerrilla raids on Israel in the early 1960s as part of its "people's war of liberation", designed to deflect domestic opposition to the [[Ba'ath Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabil 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to the UN General Assembly in September 1960, Nasser had stated that "The only solution to Palestine is that matters should return to the condition prevailing before the error was committed — i.e., the annulment of Israel's existence." In 1964 he said, "We swear to God that we shall not rest until we restore the Arab nation to Palestine and Palestine to the Arab nation. There is no room for imperialism and there is no room for Britain in our country, just as there is no room for Israel within the Arab nation." In 1965 he asserted, "We shall not enter Palestine with its soil covered in sand, we shall enter it with its soil saturated in blood."&lt;ref&gt;Sachar,  2007. pp.&amp;nbsp;615–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after nearly two decades of its existence, no neighboring Arab country of Israel was willing to negotiate a peace agreement with Israel or accept its existence. [[Tunisia]]n President [[Habib Bourgiba]] suggested in a speech in [[Jericho]] in 1965 that the Arab world should face reality and negotiate with Israel, but this was rejected by the other Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel and Egypt: Suez Crisis aftermath===
The [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 represented a military defeat but a political victory for Egypt, and set the stage leading to the Six-Day War. In a speech delivered to the [[Knesset]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] said that the 1949 armistice agreement with Egypt was dead and buried, and that the armistice lines were no longer valid and could not be restored. Under no circumstances would Israel agree to the stationing of UN forces on its territory or in any area it occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Alteras 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brecher 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy diplomatic pressure from both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] forced Israel into a conditional withdrawal of its military from the [[Sinai Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;Sachar 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;503-505.&lt;/ref&gt; only after satisfactory arrangements had been made with the international force that was about to enter the canal zone.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher 1996 p.&amp;nbsp;106&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1956 war, Egypt agreed to the stationing of a UN peacekeeping force in the Sinai, the [[United Nations Emergency Force]], to keep that border region demilitarized, and prevent [[Palestinian fedayeen]] guerrillas from crossing the border into Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Sachar 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;504.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the border between Egypt and Israel remained quiet for the vast majority of the period up to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Colaresi, 2005, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1956 war, the region returned to an uneasy balance without resolution of any of the underlying issues.

===Israel and Egypt: Rotem Crisis===
{{main article|Rotem Crisis}}
In February 1960, tensions along the Israeli–Syrian border prompted Nasser to deploy Egyptian armed forces in northern Sinai. Only six days after troop movements had begun, did Israel learn of the presence of an Egyptian force, numbering around 500 tanks, on its undefended southern border. Caught off-guard, Israel scrambled to deploy its own forces, while Ben-Gurion adopted a policy of pacification to ease tensions and prevent the outbreak of hostilities.&lt;ref name=gluska&gt;{{cite book|title=The Israeli Military and the Origins of the 1967 War: Government, armed forces and defence policy 1963-1967|first=Ami|last=Gluska|isbn=978-1-134-16377-9|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z3-LzdcZacC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=barjoseph&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rotem: The Forgotten Crisis on Road to the 1967 War|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/261020|first=Uri|last=Bar-Joseph|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=31|date=July 1996|pages=547–566|issue=3|publisher=Sage Publications|doi=10.1177/002200949603100306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides eventually stood down, yet each drew different conclusions from the affair. Israeli national defence policy came to see any mass deployment of Egyptian forces on its border as unacceptable, and believed new rules had been set in place. Egypt, however, viewed the crisis as a great success. Egypt believed the deployment had prevented an Israeli attack on Syria, and it was thus possible to deter Israel with the mere deployment of forces, without the danger of going to war. The crisis was to have a direct effect on both sides during the events of May 1967, which eventually led to the Six-Day War. Both Israel and Egypt applied the lessons they had learned in the earlier affair. Indeed, these were at first perceived to be a repeat of the Rotem affair, and were expected to follow the same course. Major differences however gave the new crisis its own momentum and eventually led to war.&lt;ref name=gluska/&gt;&lt;ref name=barjoseph/&gt;

==Events during the months before the war==

===Israel and Jordan: Samu incident===
{{Main article|Samu Incident}}
The long armistice line between [[Jordan]] and Israel was tense since the beginning of [[Fatah]]'s guerrilla operations in January 1965. While Syria supported such operations, Egypt and Jordan refused to let PLO guerrillas operate from their territory.&lt;ref name=MZ84&gt;{{cite book|last=Maoz|first=Zeev|title=Defending the Holy Land: A Critical Analysis of Israel's Security and Foreign Policy |year=2009|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472033417|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHQe4qn-EmUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;d#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Jordan and Egypt refused to let guerrillas from the newly formed Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) operate from their territory. In contrast, the Ba'ath regime in Syria provided both logistical and practical support to the PLO.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1965 the majority of raids on Israel originated from the Syrian border.&lt;ref name=MZ84(a)&gt;{{cite book|last=Maoz|first=Zeev|title=Defending the Holy Land: A Critical Analysis of Israel's Security and Foreign Policy |year=2009|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472033417|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHQe4qn-EmUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;d#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel viewed the state from which the raids were perpetrated as responsible. King [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]], the [[Hashemite]] ruler, was in a bind: he did not want to appear as cooperating with Israel in light of the delicate relationship of his government with the majority Palestinian population in his kingdom, and his success in preventing such raids was only partial. In the summer and autumn of 1966 the PLO carried out several guerrilla attacks that caused death and injury to Israeli civilians and military personnel. This culminated on November 11, 1966, when an [[Israel Border Police|Israeli border patrol]] hit a [[land mine]], killing three soldiers and injuring six others. Israel believed the mine had been planted by militants from [[as-Samu|Es Samu]], a village in the southern [[West Bank]], close to where the incident took place, which was a Fatah stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This led the Israeli cabinet to approve a large scale operation called 'Shredder'. On Friday, November 12, King Hussein of Jordan penned a letter of personal condolence to Israel which he cabled to U.S. ambassador to Israel, [[Walworth Barbour]], through the U.S. embassy in Amman which passed it to Barbour in Tel Aviv. Barbour, believing there was no urgency to delivering the letter, left it on his desk over the weekend, thus failing to deliver it in a timely fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, on the morning of November 13, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] invaded Jordan, crossing the border into the West Bank and attacked Es Samu. The attacking force consisted of 3,000-4,000 soldiers backed by tanks and aircraft. They were divided into a reserve force, which remained on the Israeli side of the border, and two raiding parties, which crossed into the West Bank.

The larger force of eight [[Centurion tank|Centurion Tanks]], followed by 400 paratroopers mounted in 40 open-topped [[half-track]]s and 60 engineers in 10 more half-tracks, headed for Samu; while a smaller force of three tanks and 100 paratroopers and engineers in 10 half-tracks headed towards two smaller villages: Kirbet El-Markas and Kirbet Jimba. According to Terrence Prittie's ''Eshkol: The Man and the Nation,'' 50 houses were destroyed, but the inhabitants had been evacuated hours before.

To Israel's surprise, the Jordanian military intervened. The 48th Infantry Battalion of the Jordanian Army ran into the Israeli forces northwest of Samu; and two companies approaching from the northeast were intercepted by the Israelis, while a platoon of Jordanians armed with two 106&amp;nbsp;mm recoilless guns entered Samu. The Jordanian Air Force intervened as well and a Jordanian [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter]] fighter was shot down in the action. In the ensuing battles, three Jordanian civilians and 16 soldiers were killed; 54 other soldiers and 96 civilians were wounded. The commander of the Israeli paratroop battalion, Colonel Yoav Shaham, was killed and 10 other Israeli soldiers were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israeli government, 50 Jordanians were killed, but the true number was never disclosed by the Jordanians, in order to keep up morale and confidence in King Hussein's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Prittie 1969, pp.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole battle was short: the Israeli forces crossed the ceasefire line at 6:00 A.M. and returned by 10:00 A.M.

====Samu incident consequences====

Hussein felt betrayed by the operation which shattered the fragile trust between Israel and Jordan.&lt;ref name=AG85&gt;{{cite book|last=Gluska|first=Ami|title=The Israeli Military and the Origins of the 1967 War|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-39245-4|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been having secret meetings with Israeli foreign ministers [[Abba Eban]] and [[Golda Meir]] for three years.  According to him he was doing everything he could to stop guerrilla attacks from the West Bank and Jordan. "I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one".&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;26 (citing Amman Cables 1456, 1457, 11 December 1966, National Security Files (Country File: Middle East), LBJ Library (Austin, Texas), Box 146).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, in a memo to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], his Special Assistant [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] wrote: "retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target," and went on to describe the damage done to US and Israeli interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis... They've undercut Hussein. We've spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest border and vis-à-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses... They've set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xviii/zh.html |title=Memorandum From the President's Special Assistant (Rostow) to President Johnson |location=Washington |date=15 November 1966 |accessdate=22 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024032540/http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xviii/zh.html |archivedate=24 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 228|Resolution 228]] unanimously deploring "the loss of life and heavy damage to property resulting from the action of the Government of Israel on 13 November 1966", censuring "Israel for conducting "a large-scale and carefully planned military action against Jordanian territory" in violation of the United Nations Charter and of the General Armistice Agreement between Israel and Jordan" and emphasizing "to Israel that actions of military reprisal cannot be tolerated and that, if they are repeated, the Security Council will have to consider further and more effective steps as envisaged in the Charter to ensure against the repetition of such acts."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United Nations Security Council Resolution 228|United Nations Security Council Resolution 228]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing a storm of criticism from Jordanians, Palestinians, and his Arab neighbors for failing to protect Samu, Hussein ordered a nationwide mobilization on November 20.&lt;ref&gt;'King Husain orders nation-wide military service', ''The Times'', Monday, 21 November 1966; pg. 8; Issue 56794; col D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Unified Arab command criticizes Jordan's actions', ''The Times'' Saturday, November 26, 1966; pg. 6; Issue 56799; col D.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hussein complained that Egypt and Syria had failed to protect the West Bank, while "hiding behind UNEF skirts"; this accusation may have been a factor in Nasser's decision to rid his country of the UNEF force on the eve of the Six-Day War.&lt;ref name=bar-on135/&gt;

This was the largest scale operation that Israel had been involved with since the Suez Crisis. While the diplomatic and political developments were not as Israel expected, following the operation Hussein worked hard to avoid any further clashes by preventing guerrilla operations from being launched from within Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view the Samu attack as the beginning of the escalation in tensions that led to the war,&lt;ref&gt;Parker 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; with others going further to describe it as the first step in the prelude to war.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Yehûdā and Sandler, 2002, State University of New York Press, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel and Syria===
Overall, Oren's account of the period portrays Israel as the innocent victim of Syrian provocation and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|2003|pp=186–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Golan Heights, Syrians had shelled Israeli settlements and other targets,&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelstein 2003 132"&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|2003|pp=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as fishermen in the [[Sea of Galilee]],&lt;ref&gt;Hajjar 1999&lt;/ref&gt; drawing punitive responsive strikes from Israel.&lt;ref name="Finkelstein 2003 132"/&gt;  In addition, following the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état]], attacks and acts of sabotage by Syrian-based Palestinian guerrillas (Fatah) had increased,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|2003|pp=132–3, 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, Ami. "The Israeli Military and the 1967 War", Routledge, 2007, Table 4, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; although Jordan was still the main source. For two and a half years from the start of the attacks up until the Israeli invasion of Syria on April 7, 1967, the Fatah incursions launched from Syrian territory had resulted in three Israeli deaths, all of them soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/c.hsJPK0PIJpH/b.2715623/k.16D2/Breakdown_of_Attacks_Against_Israel_Leading_up_to_the_SixDay_War.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1966 the Israeli Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin gave an interview in which he stated that Israeli actions  "should be aimed at those who carry out the attacks and at the regime that supports them". These 'unfortunate' words were interpreted as a 'plot' to bring down the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom, 2007, op.cit., p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria also claimed that Syrian shelling had always occurred in response to Israeli firing on peaceful Arab farmers or Syrian posts.&lt;ref name="Yearbook1967"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/0/17bdf357679b218f85256c41006ad66d? |title=OpenDocument Yearbook of the United Nations 1967 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206101025/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/0/17bdf357679b218f85256c41006ad66d |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=April 2011}} This point, also raised by Dayan in his interview,{{Dubious |The article has strong anti Israeli POV  |reason=error.

In November 1966, Egypt and Syria signed a defense pact whereby each country would support the other if it were attacked. According to [[Indar Jit Rikhye]], Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Mahmoud Riad]] told him that the [[Soviet Union]] had persuaded Egypt to enter the pact with two ideas in mind: to reduce the chances of a punitive attack on Syria by Israel, and to bring the Syrians under Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s moderating influence.&lt;ref&gt;Rikhye 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;143 (author interview).&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1967 the Israeli Minister of Health, Yisrael Barzilai, warned that Egypt’s commitment to Syria under their mutual defense pact "could escalate the situation and nobody foresee how it will end".&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to London in February 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Abba Eban]] briefed journalists on Israel's "hopes and anxieties" explaining to those present that, although the governments of [[Lebanon]], Jordan and the [[United Arab Republic]] (Egypt's official name until 1971) seemed to have decided against active confrontation with Israel, it remained to be seen whether Syria could maintain a minimal level of restraint at which hostility was confined to rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;'Intentions of Syria Crucial: Mr. Eban surveys Israel's hopes and anxieties', ''The Times'', Thursday, 23 February 1967; pg. 4; Issue 56873; col A.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Israel was planning, approving and executing the provocations of Syria along the DMZ referred to by Dayan. The provocations were sending a tractor to plow in the demilitarized areas. The Syrians would fire on these tractors and would frequently shell Israeli settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=heR4OG-LdIYC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=syria%20israel%20%20tractor%20dmz%20OR%20%20dz%20shelling%20settlements&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=syria%20israel%20%20tractor%20dmz%20OR%20%20dz%20shelling%20settlements&amp;f=false Embattled neighbors: Syria, Israel, and Lebanon, By Robert G Rabil, p.15-16.], They followed to a great extent a pattern of action and reaction. Israel would move tractors and equipment, often guarded by police, into disputed areas of the DMZ. From its high ground positions. Syria would fire at those advancing, and would frequently shell Israeli settlements in the Huleh Valley. Israel would retaliate with excessive raids on Syrian positions, including the use of air power.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MCnY_VN9AjIC&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=syria%20israel%20%20tractor%20%20shelling%20settlements&amp;pg=PA500#v=onepage&amp;q=syria%20israel%20%20tractor%20%20shelling%20settlements&amp;f=false The defense policies of nations: a comparative study, by Douglas Murray, Paul R. Viotti, p. 500]&lt;/ref&gt; This reached a critical point when armored tractor work on land in the southern demilitarized zone close to Kibbutz Ha-On was scheduled. It was anticipated that the Syrians would react. The Israeli Air Force was placed on alert. Prime Minister Eshkol approved the plan.&lt;ref name="Gluska-p100"&gt;Gluska, op. cit., p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

====April 7, 1967 cross-border battle====
Earlier in the week, Syria had twice attacked an Israeli tractor working in the DMZ area. When the tractor returned on the morning of April 7, 1967, as predicted in the plan, the Syrians opened fire again initially with light weapons. The Israelis responded by sending in armor-plated tractors to continue ploughing, resulting in further exchanges of fire. The resulting tit-for-tat escalated, leading to tanks, heavy mortars, machine guns, and artillery{{Dubious |The article has strong anti Israeli POV  |reason=error. The Syrians planned in advance to extend the light arms fire to artillery and tanks against Israeli civilian settlements |date=February 2014}} being used in various sections along the 47 mile (76&amp;nbsp;km) border in what was described as "a dispute over cultivation rights in the demilitarized zone south-east of [[Lake Tiberias]]." At this point the critical departure from previous incidents occurred. Without advance planning nor having been submitted for prior approval to the Ministerial Committee on Security,&lt;ref name="Gluska-p100" /&gt; Israeli aircraft dive-bombed Syrian positions with 250 and 500&amp;nbsp;kg bombs. For the first time the IAF was employed before an Israeli settlement had actually been shelled (with the exception of stray shells which fell in Tel Katzir) and Israeli planes penetrated as far as Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, op. cit., p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrians then responded by shelling Israeli border settlements heavily, and Israeli jets retaliated by bombing the village of Sqoufiye, destroying around 40 houses in the process. At 15:19 Syrian shells started falling on [[Gadot|Kibbutz Gadot]]; over 300 landed within the kibbutz compound in 40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bowen |pages=30–31 |url=http://www.catalogue.nationalarchives.gov.uk/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=6327944&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;CATREF=FCO+17%2F474 |title= Report of ground/air action on Israeli/Syrian border on 7 April 1967, from Defence and Military Attaché's office |location=Tel Aviv |date=11 April 1967}} {{paywall}}; also {{cite web |url=http://www.catalogue.nationalarchives.gov.uk/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=6327943&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;CATREF=FCO+17%2F473 |title= Syria/Israel, account of incident from Eastern Department; attack on Sqoufiye reported by UNTSO PRO/FCO 17/473 |date=10 April 1967}} {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "incident" had escalated into a full-scale aerial battle over the Golan Heights after Israel scrambled jets, resulting in the loss of six [[Syrian Air Force]] [[Mikoyan MiG-21|MiG-21]]s to [[Israeli Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage III]]s, and the latter's flight over [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Aloni 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) attempted to arrange a ceasefire, but Syria declined to co-operate unless Israeli agricultural work was halted.&lt;ref&gt;'Jets and tanks in fierce clash by Israel and Syria', ''The Times'', Saturday, 8 April 1967; pg. 1; Issue 56910; col A.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote "This was not an 'incident' but a real war."&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom, op. cit., p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union intervened to halt the downward course of events and to deter Israel by activating the Egyptian–Syrian defense pact signed in November 1966 under Soviet pressure for this precise purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the April 7 cross-border battle is often called an 'incident', various reactions to the event belie this description. The Israeli press called it a war. Moshe Dayan was reported by Ezer Weismann to have responded "Have you lost your minds? You are leading the country to war!". Brigadier-General Israel Lior agreed: "From my point of view, the Six-Day War had begun."&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2007, op. cit., p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 21, 1967 as in May 1966. the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Yaakov Malik, relayed an oral message to the Israeli ambassador in Moscow: "The government of the Soviet Union sees the need to warn again the government of Israel that the hazardous policy it has been waging for several years is fraught with danger, and [Israel] will be held solely responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4u-ZheMnqf8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Arab Politics, Palestinian Nationalism, and the Six Day War|author=Moshe Shemesh|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=2008| page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later developments====
Speaking to a [[Mapai]] party meeting in [[Jerusalem]] on May 11 [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Levi Eshkol]] warned that Israel would not hesitate to use air power on the scale of 7 April in response to continued border terrorism, and on the same day Israeli envoy Gideon Rafael presented a letter to the president of the [[Security Council]] warning that Israel would "act in self-defense as circumstances warrant".&lt;ref&gt;'Warning by Israelis Stresses Air Power', ''New York Times'', 12 May 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing from Tel Aviv on May 12, James Feron reported that some Israeli leaders had decided to use force against Syria "of considerable strength but of short duration and limited in area" and quoted "one qualified observer" who "said it was highly unlikely that Egypt (then officially called [[United Arab Republic]]), Syria's closest ally in the Arab world, would enter the hostilities unless the Israeli attack were extensive".&lt;ref&gt;Feron, 13 May 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; In early May the Israeli cabinet authorized a limited strike against Syria, but Rabin's renewed demand for a large-scale strike to discredit or topple the Ba'ath regime was opposed by Eshkol.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen reports:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The toughest threat was reported by the news agency United Press International (UPI) on 12 May: 'A high Israeli source said today that Israel would take limited military action designed to topple the Damascus army regime if Syrian terrorists continue sabotage raids inside Israel. Military observers said such an offensive would fall short of all-out war but would be mounted to deliver a telling blow against the Syrian government.' In the West as well as the Arab world the immediate assumption was that the unnamed source was Rabin and that he was serious. In fact, it was Brigadier-General [[Aharon Yariv]], the head of military intelligence, and the story was overwritten. Yariv mentioned 'an all-out invasion of Syria and conquest of Damascus' but only as the most extreme of a range of possibilities. But the damage had been done. Tension was so high that most people, and not just the Arabs, assumed that something much bigger than usual was being planned against Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;col E.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Border incidents multiplied and numerous Arab leaders, both political and military, called for an end to Israeli attacks. Egypt, then already trying to seize a central position in the Arab world under Nasser, accompanied these declarations with plans to re-militarize the Sinai. Syria shared these views, although it did not prepare for an immediate invasion. The [[Soviet Union]] actively backed the military needs of the [[Arab League|Arab states]].

===Israel and Egypt===
In April 1967, after meeting with Nasser, [[Lucius D. Battle]], The U.S ambassador in Egypt reported to Washington that Nasser plans to deflect mounting internal pressure against his regime by creating a foreign policy crisis which could be to heat up the Israeli situation.&lt;ref name="CashmanRobinson2007p181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BATTLE1991Interview"/&gt;

==Events during the weeks before the war==

===Misinformation from the Soviet Union===
In 1967, Israeli leaders repeatedly threatened to invade Syria and overthrow the Syrian government if Palestinian guerrilla actions across the border did not cease.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/egypt/36.htm ''Egypt: A Country Study'', U.S. Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;  In that context, the [[Soviet Union]] fed the Syrian government false information in the Spring of 1967 that Israel was planning to invade Syria.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html "Part 4: The 1967 Six Day War"], ''[[NPR]]'': "In the spring of that year [1967], the Soviet Union had led the radical government in Damascus to believe that Israel was planning to invade Syria. Syria shared this misinformation with Nasser. The Egyptian leader closed the Gulf of Aqaba to shipping, cutting off Israel's primary oil supplies. He also ordered United Nations peacekeepers to leave the Sinai Peninsula. And he sent scores of tanks and hundreds of troops into the Sinai toward Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, a Soviet intelligence report given by Soviet President [[Nikolai Podgorny]] to Egyptian Vice President [[Anwar Sadat]] likewise claimed falsely that Israeli troops were massing along the Syrian border.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001. Pg 304&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 14, Nasser sent his chief of staff, [[Mohamed Fawzi (general)|General Fawzi]], to Syria in order to verify the Soviet warning.&lt;ref name="Oren2002p64"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Oren|title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcD1bCMAP6AC|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515174-9|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian Troop Build-up in Sinai===
Egyptian President Nasser was in a difficult position. He had received humiliating rebukes for Egypt's lack of action after the recent Israeli attacks on Jordan and Syria in April 1967. This, combined with Israeli threats to topple the Syrian regime and the Soviet urging that the Syrian-Egyptian defence agreement had thereby been triggered, left Nasser feeling as though he had no option other than to display solidarity with Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2007, op. cit., p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May, Nasser began the re-militarization of the Sinai, and concentrated tanks and troops there.&lt;ref name = "MFA: The Arab-Israeli Wars"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern+History/Centenary+of+Zionism/The+Arab-Israeli+Wars.htm | title = The Arab-Israeli Wars| accessdate = 2007-03-04| date = 2003-09-02| last = Lorch| first = Netanel| publisher = Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was reminiscent of what he had done in the [[Rotem Crisis]], although this time it was done openly.&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., pp. 118 &amp; 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Fawzi reported to Nasser that the Soviet alarm about an Israeli plot to attack Syria was baseless, but Nasser continued to pour his divisions into Sinai.&lt;ref name="Oren2002p64" /&gt;

Egyptian Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] explained to (Soviet Ambassador) Pozhidaev that the influx of troops into Sinai was for deterrence: "Israel will not risk starting major military actions against Syria, because if it does Egyptian military units, having occupied forward initial positions on this border will immediately move out on the basis of the mutual defense agreement with Syria."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, John, 2012, op. cit., Kindle Locations 447-450.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, Ahmed el-Feki, Egypt's Under Secretary of State, assured David Nes, US chargé d'affaires in Cairo that Egypt would not "take the initiative in attacking Israel." But in case of a large-scale Israeli attack against its neighbors, el-Feki said, Egypt would come to their aid. Nes came away from the conversation "certain" that Egypt had "no aggressive intent."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, John, 2012, op. cit., Kindle Locations 431-436.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for Nasser's decisions to expel the UN peacekeepers (UNEF) and the move to reinforce Egyptian forces in the Sinai were reported to the Israeli government by Prime Minister Eshkol on May 16, 1967 as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is estimated that, in light of Syrian reports and appeals to Egypt regarding Israel’s intention to take major action against Syria; in light of declarations and warnings issued by Israel in the past few days; and Egypt’s predicament since April. Egypt has come to the decision that in the present circumstances it cannot sit by idly. It has therefore decided, in the face of the Israeli threat, to demonstrate readiness to come to Syria’s aid within the framework of the mutual defence pact. At the same time, it may be assumed that the Egyptians hope that their actions and demonstration will achieve the practical effect of deterring Israel from implementing its threat."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Removal of U.N. peacekeepers from Egypt===
At 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on May 16, the commander of [[United Nations Emergency Force]], General [[Indar Jit Rikhye]], was handed a letter from General Mohammed Fawzy, Chief of Staff of the [[United Arab Republic]], reading: "To your information, I gave my instructions to all UAR armed forces to be ready for action against Israel, the moment it might carry out any aggressive action against any Arab country.  Due to these instructions our troops are already concentrated in Sinai on our eastern border. For the sake of complete security of all UN troops which install [[Observation post|OPs]] along our borders, I request that you issue your orders to withdraw all these troops immediately." The emissary who delivered the letter requested immediate withdrawal of United Nations troops from [[Sharm el Sheikh]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;"The Six-Day War and Israeli Self-Defense", John Quigley, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN-Thant1967-06-26"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U Thant|first1=The United Nations Secretary-General|title=Report of the Secretary-General on the withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force, General Assembly A/6730 &amp; Add.1-3 &amp; A/6730/Add.3/Corr.1 |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/D21AF95689E8F2C00525660B0051640F |date=26 June 1967 |quote=" Brigadier Mokhtar, who handed General Fawzy's letter to the Commander of UNEF, told General Rikhye at the time that he must order the immediate withdrawal of United Nations troops from El Sabha and Sharm el Sheikh on the night of 16 May since United Arab Republic armed forces must gain control of these two places that very night"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll2010p164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oren2002p69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sitkowski2006p51"/&gt; Rikhye said he would report to the Secretary-General for instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Rikhye 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sources on the expulsion of UN forces:

The UNEF was established following the Suez crisis in 1956 by various resolutions of the Security Council culminating in resolution 1001. Egypt agreed to the presence of the unit on her territory. Israel refused.

Initially, Nasser's letter had not demanded a full withdrawal of UNEF, but that they vacate the Sinai and concentrate in Gaza.{{Disputed inline|Sharm el Sheikh withdrawal |date=January 2015}}  Detailed archival studies revealed that the original letter had not included a request to withdraw troops from Sharm el-Sheik, overlooking the [[Straits of Tiran]].&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, John (December 2012). "The Six-Day War and Israeli Self-Defense", Kindle Location 485. Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Secretary-General]], [[U Thant]], demanded an all-or-nothing clarification from Nasser, leaving the Egyptians with little choice but to ask for their total withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2007, op. cit., p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;  U Thant then attempted to negotiate with the Egyptian government, but on May 18 the Egyptian Foreign Minister informed nations with troops in UNEF that the UNEF mission in Egypt and the Gaza Strip had been terminated and that they must leave immediately. Egyptian forces then prevented UNEF troops from entering their posts. The Governments of [[India]] and [[Yugoslavia]] decided to withdraw their troops from UNEF, regardless of the decision of U Thant. While this was taking place, U Thant suggested that UNEF be redeployed to the Israeli side of the border, but Israel refused, arguing that UNEF contingents from countries hostile to Israel would be more likely to impede an Israeli response to Egyptian aggression than to stop that aggression in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Permanent Representative]] of Egypt then informed U Thant that the Egyptian government had decided to terminate UNEF's presence in the Sinai and the Gaza Strip, and requested steps that would withdraw the force as soon as possible. The UNEF commander was given the order to begin withdrawal on May 19.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html United Nations, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC On this Day, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/5/newsid_2654000/2654251.stm 1967: Israel launches attack on Egypt]. Retrieved 8 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The withdrawal of UNEF was to be spaced over a period of some weeks. The troops were to be withdrawn by air and by sea from Port Said. The withdrawal plan envisaged that the last personnel of UNEF would leave the area on June 30, 1967. On the morning of May 27, Egypt demanded that the Canadian contingent be evacuated within 48 hours "on grounds of the attitude adopted by the Government of Canada in connection with UNEF and the United Arab Republic Government's request for its withdrawal, and ‘to prevent any probable reaction from the people of the United Arab Republic against the Canadian Forces in UNEF.’"  The withdrawal of the Canadian contingent was accelerated and completed on May 31, with the effect that UNEF was left without its logistics and air support components. In the war itself 15 members of the remaining force were killed and the rest evacuated through Israel.&lt;ref name="Yearbook1967" /&gt;

====The Egyptian right to remove the U.N. peacekeepers====
Before UNEF could be deployed in 1956 negotiations were necessary with the compliant host country, Egypt, Israel having refused to host the peacekeepers.&lt;ref name=JTA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdfs.jta.org/1967/1967-06-21_119.pdf?_ga=2.263214411.695446306.1529068869-891138325.1529068869|title=U.N. Secretary-general Takes Issue with Eban on Withdrawal of U.N.E.F.|author=United Nations|publisher=JTA Daily News Bulletin|year=1967| accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; A key principle governing the stationing and functioning of UNEF, and later of all other peacekeeping forces, was the consent of the host Government. Since it was not an enforcement action under Chapter VII of the Charter, UNEF could enter and operate in Egypt only with the consent of the Egyptian Government. This principle was clearly stated by the General Assembly in adopting resolution 1001 (ES-I) of 7 November 1956 concerning the establishment of UNEF. ... The Secretary-General impressed upon those authorities that the Force provided a guarantee for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Egypt and that, since it would come only with Egypt's consent, it could not stay or operate in Egypt if that consent were withdrawn. ... Moreover, because Israel refused to accept UNEF on its territory, the Force had to be deployed only on the Egyptian side of the border, and thus its functioning was entirely contingent upon the consent of Egypt as the host country. Once that consent was withdrawn, its operation could no longer be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html "First United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) — Background"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rostow is of a contrary opinion that "Egyptian commitments of the period were broken one by one, the last being the request for the removal of U.N.E.F."&lt;ref&gt;Rostow, Eugene V., "Legal Aspects for the Search for Peace in the Middle East", 1970, The American Journal of International Law Vol. 64, No. 4, The United Nations: Appraisal at 25 Years, p. 67 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25660349]&lt;/ref&gt; In another publication Rostow adds detail: "One of the most important terms of the agreement was set out in an aide memoire by Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjold]]: if Egypt ever tried unilaterally to remove the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Sinai, or to close the Straits of Tiran, the Secretary-General would call the Security Council into session immediately and block such initiatives until a peaceful resolution of the conflict could be reached."&lt;ref&gt;Rostow, "The Perils of Positivism", 1992, DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 2.2, p. 233 [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1313&amp;context=djcil]&lt;/ref&gt; Oren, however, confirms Egypt's right as follows: "That (UNEF) presence, however, hung on a legal fiction. The "good-faith agreement" forged by Dag Hammarskjold in 1957, according to which Egypt would consult with the General Assembly and the UNEF Advisory Council before altering the force’s mandate, was in no way binding. The Egyptians could, in fact, dismiss UNEF whenever they chose.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, Michael B., 2002, "Six-day Storm: The June 1967 War and the Creation of the Modern Middle East", Oxford University Press, P. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Bunche (UN expert on Middle East diplomacy) fully adhered to the secretary-general’s position that Egypt had a sovereign right to dismiss UNEF’, however imprudent that decision might be."&lt;ref&gt;Oren, 2002, op. cit., p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Further contrary to Rostow's position, the Secretary-General in 1967, U Thant, specifically addressed the Hammarskjold memoire during the build-up of tension, declaring that the 1957 memorandum by the late Secretary-General, which had interpreted the agreement on UNEF between the United Nations and Egypt as meaning that an Egyptian request for UNEF withdrawal would have to be referred to the General Assembly, was “a purely private” understanding by Mr. Hammarskjold and not binding either on the present Secretary-General or on Egypt.&lt;ref name=JTA/&gt;

====International reactions====
The United States did not find a UNEF withdrawal overly worrying. Walworth Barbour, US ambassador in Tel Aviv, told Israeli officials that the withdrawal did not affect the "fundamental military situation," and that there was "every reason for Nasser" not to attack Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, op. cit., Kindle Locations 495-497&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt volunteered that if Israel were concerned about an Egyptian invasion, it could accept UNEF on its own side of the armistice line. "If Israel wants them to stay," Field Marshal Amer told Soviet Ambassador Pozhidaev, "it can make its own territory available." U Thant was thinking along the same lines. On May 18, he posed that option to Israel's UN ambassador, Gideon Rafael, as a protection against a possible invasion. Rafael replied that this option was "entirely unacceptable to his Government."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, 2012, op.cit., Kindle location 508&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Roux, France's ambassador in Cairo, gave Maurice Couve de Murville, the French foreign minister, an assessment that Egypt was making its moves in reaction to accusations that Egypt was not living up to its obligations to other Arab states. The request for a UNEF withdrawal did not, in Roux's view, mean that the Egyptian leadership was embarking on "an adventure."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, 2012, op.cit., Kindle locations 504-507&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel was not particularly troubled by the evacuation of the UNEF in itself. There were some who even thought that it would be to Israel’s advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Straits of Tiran closure===
[[File:Strait tiran 83.jpg|right|thumb|250px]]
Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol repeated declarations that Israel had made in 1957, saying that closure of the Straits of Tiran would be an act of war.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, David.  ''Warriors for Jerusalem: the six days that changed the Middle East'', p. 88 (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1984): "In separate messages to the leading maritime powers, Eshkol warned: 'Israel would stop short of nothing to cancel the blockade. It is essential that President Nasser should not have any illusions.'"
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/26+Statement+to+the+General+Assembly+by+Foreign+Mi.htm "Statement to the General Assembly by Foreign Minister Meir, 1 March 1957"] (Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs):  "Interference, by armed force, with ships of Israeli flag exercising free and innocent passage in the Gulf of Aqaba and through the Straits of Tiran will be regarded by Israel as an attack entitling it to exercise its inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter and to take all such measures as are necessary to ensure the free and innocent passage of its ships in the Gulf and in the Straits."&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, on May 22, Egypt responded by announcing, in addition to the UN withdrawal,&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; that the [[Straits of Tiran]] would be closed to "all ships flying Israeli flags or carrying [[strategic material]]s", with effect from May 23.&lt;ref&gt;"Egypt Closes Gulf Of Aqaba To Israel Ships: Defiant move by Nasser raises Middle East tension", ''[[The Times]]'', p. 1 (May 23, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; In order to enforce the blockade, Egypt falsely announced that the Tiran straits had been mined.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Rogan 2012 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of Israeli oil passed through the Straits of Tiran.&lt;ref name="ShlaimLouis2012p224"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Avi Shlaim|author2=William Roger Louis|title=The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: Origins and Consequences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YhNPNeBh8IC&amp;pg=PA27|date=13 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00236-4| quote="90% of Israeli oil was imported through the Straits of Tiran"|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil tankers that were due to pass through the straits were delayed.&lt;ref name="ShlaimLouis2012p27"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Avi Shlaim|author2=William Roger Louis|title=The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: Origins and Consequences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YhNPNeBh8IC&amp;pg=PA27|date=13 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00236-4| pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily brief to the U.S president on 27 May 1967|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/pdbnews/blanton11.pdf|date=27 May 1967|quote="diverted as was a sister ship yesterday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sami Sharaf, Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nasser knew that the decision to block the Tiran straits made the war "inevitable".&lt;ref name="ShlaimLouis2012p64"/&gt;  Nasser stated, "Under no circumstances can we permit the Israeli flag to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba."  The closure of the Tiran Straits was closely linked to the previous withdrawal of the UN peacekeepers, because having the peacekeepers (rather than the Egyptian military) at [[Sharm el Sheik]] was important for keeping that waterway open.&lt;ref name="ShlaimLouis2012p63"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Avi Shlaim|author2=William Roger Louis|title=The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: Origins and Consequences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YhNPNeBh8IC&amp;pg=PA63|date=13 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00236-4| quote="the occupation of Sharm-al-Sheikh would force the closure of the Tiran Straits"|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to Arab [[trade unionists]] on May 26, Nasser announced: "If Israel embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt, the battle against Israel will be a general one and not confined to one spot on the Syrian or Egyptian borders. The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Gamal | last = Nasser | url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/nasser1.html |title=Statement to Arab Trade Unionists | publisher= Jewish Virtual Library | accessdate = 13 March 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;131 citing Stephens 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;479.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser publicly denied that Egypt would strike first and spoke of a negotiated peace if Israel allowed all [[Palestinian refugee]]s the [[Palestinian right of return|right of return]], and of a possible compromise over the Straits of Tiran.&lt;ref name = "countrystudies.us"/&gt;

====For the Egyptian right to close the Straits====
Egypt stated that the Gulf of Aqaba had always been a national inland waterway subject to the sovereignty of the only three legitimate [[Littoral zone|littoral]] States — Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt — who had the right to bar enemy vessels. The representative of the United Arab Republic further stated that "Israel's claim to have a port on the Gulf was considered invalid, as Israel was alleged to have occupied several miles of coastline on the Gulfline, including Umm Rashrash, in violation of Security Council resolutions of 1948 and the Egyptian-Israel General Armistice Agreement."&lt;ref&gt;'The Situation in the Middle East: Communications Relating to the Observance of the Armistice Agreements in the Period January–May 1967', [https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/17BDF357679B218F85256C41006AD66D Yearbook of the United Nations 1967], Office of Public Information, United Nations, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab states disputed Israel's right of passage through the Straits, noting they had not signed the [[Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone]] specifically because of article 16(4) which provided Israel with that right.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Nations General Assembly]] debates after the war, the Arab states and their supporters argued that even if international law gave Israel the right of passage, Israel was not entitled to attack Egypt to assert that right, because the closure was not an "armed attack" as defined by Article 51 of the [[United Nations Charter]]. 
Supporting this view in a letter written to the ''New York Times'' in June 1967, lawyer [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] argued that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The United Arab Republic had a good legal case for restricting traffic through the Strait of Tiran. First it is debatable whether international law confers any right of innocent passage through such a waterway.... [Secondly]... a right of innocent passage is not a right of free passage for any cargo at any time. In the words of the Convention on the Territorial Sea: 'Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state... taking the facts as they were I, as an international lawyer, would rather defend before the International Court of Justice the legality of the U.A.R's action in closing the Strait of Tiran than to argue the other side of the case...&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Roger letter to the ''New York Times'', 9 June 1967 quoted in Finkelstein, 2003, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Against the Egyptian right to close the Straits====
After the [[Suez Crisis|1956 campaign]] in which Israel conquered Sharm el-Sheikh and opened the blocked Straits, it was forced to withdraw and return the territory to Egypt. At the time, members of the international community pledged that Israel would never again be denied use of the [[Straits of Tiran]]. The French representative to the UN, for example, announced that an attempt to interfere with free shipping in the Straits would be against international law, and American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] went so far as publicly to recognize that reimposing a blockade in the [[Straits of Tiran]] would be seen as an aggressive act which would oblige Israel to protect its maritime rights in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman 2000, p 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights of Egypt regarding the [[Straits of Tiran]] had been debated at the General Assembly pursuant to Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai following the [[Suez Crisis]]. A number of states, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] argued that the Straits were [[international waters]], and, as such, all vessels had the right of "free and innocent passage" through them. [[India]], however, argued that Egypt was entitled to require foreign ships to obtain its consent before seeking access to the gulf because its territorial sea covered the Straits of Tiran. It too recognized the right of [[innocent passage]] through such waters, but argued it was up to the coastal State to decide which passage was "innocent".&lt;ref&gt;Jia 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel’s political ‘anchor’ in its efforts to prevent any disruption of freedom of shipping through the Straits was a statement by then Foreign Minister Golda Meir at the UN Assembly on 1 March 1957, while announcing her government’s decision to respond to the demand for withdrawal from Sinai and the Gaza Strip, to the effect that Israel would view disruption of free shipping through the Tiran Straits as an act of aggression and would reserve the right to react in accordance with Clause 51 of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ami Gluska|title=The Israeli Military and the Origins of the 1967 War: Government, Armed Forces and Defence Policy 1963–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQp2fvnSDm0C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-96596-2|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International law professor [[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]] argues that under the doctrine of proportionality, Israel would only be entitled to use such force as would be necessary to secure its right of passage.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

State practice and customary international law is that ships of all states have a right of innocent passage through territorial seas.&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org pp29"&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/1/1645.pdf The Corfu Channel Case (Merits), International Court of Justice, ICJ Reports, 1949, pp.&amp;nbsp;27–29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122144003/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/1/1645.pdf |date=2016-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "O'Brien, John p407"&gt;O'Brien 2001, ''International Law'', p.&amp;nbsp;407.&lt;/ref&gt; That Egypt had consistently granted passage as a matter of state practice until then suggests that its ''[[opinio juris]]'' in that regard was consistent with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Aldy &amp; Al-Khoshman 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, during the Egyptian occupation of the Saudi islands of [[Sanafir]] and Tiran in 1950, it provided assurances to the US that the military occupation would not be used to prevent free passage, and that Egypt recognizes that such free passage is "in conformity with the international practice and the recognized principles of international law.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/2%20Aide-memoire%20from%20Egypt%20to%20the%20United%20States%20reg Aide-memoire from Egypt to the United States regarding Passage through the [[Straits of Tiran]], 28 January 1950.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the [[International Court of Justice]] held in the [[The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. People's Republic of Albania)|Corfu Channel Case (''United Kingdom v. Albania'')]] that where a [[Corfu Channel Incident|strait was overlapped]] by a territorial sea foreign ships, including warships, had unsuspendable right of innocent passage through such straits used for international navigation between parts of the high seas, but express provision for innocent passage through straits within the territorial sea of a foreign state was not codified until the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.&lt;ref name = "icj-cij.org pp29"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "O'Brien, John p407"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boczek 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt's plan to attack Israel on 27 May===

Caught up in Arab enthusiasm for military action and encouraged by the lack of response to the closure of the Straits, Egyptian Field Marshal Amer planned for initiating an attack on Israel in late May. He told one of his generals that "This time we will be the ones to start the war."  This was counter to Nasser's strategy of pushing Israel to start the war. Historian [[Michael Oren]] states that Egyptian sources are divided over why Nasser did not veto Amer's plan. Oren suggests that "Nasser was apprised of [the plan] but lacked the political strength to override Amer's order. Also, the preparation of an Egyptian invasion of Israel had certain advantages for Nasser..."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Oren | year = 2002 | edition = electronic | chapter = Amer's Dawn}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian attack plan was code-named [[Operation Dawn (1967)|Operation Dawn]], and was planned by General [[Abdel Hakim Amer]]. It called for the strategic bombing of Israeli airfields, ports, cities, and the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]]. Arab armies would then invade Israel, and cut it in half with an armored thrust through the [[Negev]].

On May 25, 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Abba Eban]] landed in Washington "with instructions to discuss American plans to re-open the Straits of Tiran".  As soon as he arrived, he was given new instructions in a cable from the Israeli government.  The cable said that Israel had learned of an imminent Egyptian attack, which overshadowed the blockade. No longer was he to emphasize the Straits issue; he was instructed to ‘inform the highest authorities of this new threat and to request an official statement from the United States that an attack on Israel would be viewed as an attack on the United States."  Historian [[Michael Oren]] explains Eban's reaction to the new instructions: "Eban was livid. Unconvinced that Nasser was either determined or even able to attack, he now saw Israelis inflating the Egyptian threat — and flaunting their weakness — in order to extract a pledge that the President, Congress-bound, could never make."  He described the cable as an "...act of momentous irresponsibility... eccentric..." which "lacked wisdom, veracity and tactical understanding," and later came to the conclusion that the genesis of the cable was Rabin's indecisive state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;102–3.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Tom Segev]], the instructions sent to Eban in Washington were an attempt to mislead him, and through him president Johnson, to support Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev, "1967", loc 4986 in the Kindle edition. "Eshkol knew that no such danger had suddenly emerged over the past two days. He was obviously trying to mislead Eban, and through him President Johnson, in order to ensure U.S. support"&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his own skepticism, Eban followed his instructions during his first meeting with Secretary Rusk, Under Secretary Rostow, and Assistant Secretary [[Lucius Battle]].  American intelligence experts spent the night analyzing each of the Israeli claims.&lt;ref name= QuandtPP&gt;Quandt 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;31-2&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 26, Eban met with [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]], Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]], and finally with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In a memo to the President, Rusk rejected the claim of an Egyptian and Syrian attack being imminent, plainly stating "our intelligence does not confirm [the] Israeli estimate".&lt;ref name=ruskmemo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d71 | title= Memorandum From Secretary of State Rusk to President Johnson | year= 1967| accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to declassified documents from the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|Johnson Presidential Library]], President Johnson and other top officials in the administration did not believe war between Israel and its neighbors was necessary or inevitable.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2007/06/04/six_day_war |title=Rethinking Israel's David-and-Goliath past |author=Tolan, Sandy|date=June 4, 2007|accessdate= 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All of our intelligence people are unanimous that if the [[United Arab Republic|UAR]] attacks, you will whip hell out of them", Johnson told Eban during a visit to the White House on May 26.&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baylis Thomas, ''How Israel was won: a concise history of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' Lexington Books, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Johnson declined to airlift special military supplies to Israel or even to publicly support it.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Eban left the White House distraught.

In a lecture given in 2002, Oren said, "Johnson sat around with his advisors and said, ‘What if their intelligence sources are better than ours?’  Johnson decided to fire off a [[Moscow-Washington hotline|Hotline]] message to his counterpart in the Kremlin, [[Alexei Kosygin]], in which he said, ‘We've heard from the Israelis, but we can't corroborate it, that your proxies in the Middle East, the Egyptians, plan to launch an attack against Israel in the next 48 hours. If you don't want to start a global crisis, prevent them from doing that.’  At 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May 27, Soviet Ambassador to Egypt [[Dimitri Pojidaev]] knocked on Nasser's door and read him a personal letter from Kosygin in which he said, ‘We don't want Egypt to be blamed for starting a war in the Middle East. If you launch that attack, we cannot support you.’

According to Oren, Nasser knew that operation Dawn was already set to be launched in only few hours time, at sunrise. His mood soured since he realized that Israel had accessed Egyptian secrets and compromised them. Nasser hurried to an emergency meeting at the headquarters, and told Amer about the exposure of Dawn and asked him to cancel the planned attack.&lt;ref name="Oren2002p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Oren|title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcD1bCMAP6AC|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515174-9|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdel Hakim Amer|Amer]] consulted his sources in the Kremlin, and they corroborated the substance of Kosygin's message. Despondent, Amer told the commander of Egypt's air force, Major General [[Muhammad Sidqi Mahmud|Mahmud Sidqi]], that the operation was cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oren (2002, 24 June).  ''[http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-06oren-speech.html 1967: The unwanted war that made the Middle East].''  Transcript of speech to The Commonwealth Club of California.  Retrieved 20 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cancellation orders arrived to the pilots when they were already in their planes, awaiting the final go ahead.&lt;ref name="Oren2002p120"/&gt;

According to then Egyptian Vice-President [[Hussein el-Shafei]], as soon as Nasser knew what Amer planned, he cancelled the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;57 (author interview, Cairo, 15 December 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], there is thin evidence that there was any Egyptian plan to attack Israel that would actually have been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;"The Six-Day War and Israel Self-Defense", John Quigley, p. 34 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdel Magid Farid,&lt;ref&gt;Farid was the secretary-general of the Presidency, a cabinet level post, from 1959 to until Nasser's death http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5195412&amp;fileId=S0020743800065971&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Nasser did actually consider the first strike option until early on 27 May, when he was hauled out of bed at mid night by the Soviet Union ambassador (his only source of arms and spare parts) and warned not to precipitate a confrontation. Other evidence, however, suggests he never intended to strike first. Nasser rejected the first strike option as politically impossible as he felt it would provide a pretext for Israel and the U.S, and alienate the Soviets. All of Nasser's plans were based on an assumption the Israelis would strike first.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Louis, 2012, p68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The crisis and diplomacy ===
The Israeli government asked the U.S. and UK to reopen the Straits of Tiran, as they had guaranteed they would in 1957. [[Harold Wilson]]'s proposal of an international maritime force to quell the crisis was adopted by President Johnson, but received little support, with only Britain and the Netherlands offering to contribute ships. The British cabinet later stated that there was a new balance of power in the Middle East, led by the United Arab Republic, that was A) to the detriment of Israel and the Western powers and B) something Israel was going to have to learn to live with.

United Nations Secretary-General [[U Thant]] also went to Cairo to help negotiate an agreement to avoid conflict. UN Secretary General, U Thant, visited Cairo for mediation and a renewed diplomatic effort to solve the crisis. Talks failed as President Nasser kept the straits closed and Israel refused to accept the UN troops on its side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the UNEF |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most American diplomats who worked in the Middle East were sympathetic to Nasser's views on the Straits{{Citation needed|reason=mistake|date=June 2015}}, with several of them arguing that the US should ignore both its on-the-record promises to Israel regarding the Straits being open and international law; a few diplomats who were not as impressed by threats from Arab nations advised the Johnson Administration to back the flotilla option as a "show of force" that would forestall war from breaking out.

The US also tried to mediate, and Nasser agreed to send his vice-president to Washington to explore a diplomatic settlement. The meeting did not happen because Israel launched its offensive.

On May 30, Nasser responded to Johnson's request of 11 days earlier and agreed to send his Vice President, [[Zakkariya Muhieddin]], to Washington on June 7 to explore a diplomatic settlement in "precisely the opening the [[White House]] had sought".&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;145.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan joins Egypt===
During May and June the Israeli government had worked hard to keep Jordan out of any war; it was concerned about being attacked on multiple fronts, and did not want to have to deal with the Jordanian [[West Bank]]. Israel called upon Jordan numerous times to refrain from hostilities. Israel's own sense of concern regarding Jordan's future role stemmed from the Jordanian control of the West Bank. This put Arab forces just 17 kilometers from Israel's coast, a jump-off point from which a well-coordinated tank assault would likely cut Israel in two within half an hour.&lt;ref name=segevs/&gt; Hussein had doubled the size of Jordan's army in the last decade and had US training and arms delivered as recently as early 1967, and it was feared that it could be used by other Arab states as [[staging area|staging grounds]] for operations against Israel; thus, an attack from the West Bank was always viewed by the Israeli leadership as a threat to Israel's existence.&lt;ref name=segevs/&gt;

However, Jordan's King Hussein got caught up in the wave of pan-Arab nationalism preceding the war;{{ref label|reference_name_G2|g|b}}. According to Mutawi, Hussein was caught on the horns of a galling dilemma: allow Jordan to be dragged into war and face the brunt of the Israeli response, or remain neutral and risk full-scale insurrection among his own people. Army Commander-in-Chief General [[Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker]] warned in a press conference that "If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Mutawi 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Avi Shlaim]], Hussein's actions were prompted by his feelings of Arab nationalism.{{ref label|reference_name_G3|g|c}}

An extremely important change took place on May 30, when Jordan signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt, thereby joining the military alliance already in place between Egypt and Syria.&lt;ref name=quandt2005p37&gt;Quandt, 2005, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The move surprised both Egyptians and foreign observers, because President Nasser had generally been at odds with Hussein, calling him an "imperialist lackey" just days earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc onthisday"&gt;BBC On this Day, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2493000/2493177.stm Egypt and Jordan unite against Israel]. Retrieved 8 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser said that any differences between him and Hussein were erased "in one moment" and declared: "Our basic objective will be the destruction of Israel. The Arab people want to fight."&lt;ref name="bbc onthisday"/&gt;

At the end of May 1967, Jordanian forces were given to the command of an Egyptian general, [[Abdul Munim Riad]].&lt;ref&gt;Mutawi 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Nasser proclaimed: "The armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria are poised on the borders of Israel ... to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of [[Iraq]], [[Algeria]], [[Kuwait]], [[Sudan]] and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not of more declarations."&lt;ref&gt;Leibler 1972, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S president envoy reported from Cairo on 30 May that Nasser "cannot and will not retreat" and "he would probably welcome, but not seek, military showdown with Israel".&lt;ref name=quandt2005p37/&gt;

On June 3, days before the war, Egypt flew to Amman two battalions of commandos tasked with infiltrating Israel's borders and engaging in attacks and bombings so as to draw IDF into a Jordanian front and ease the pressure on the Egyptians. Soviet-made artillery and Egyptian military supplies and crews were also flown to Jordan.&lt;ref name=segevs&gt;Segev 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;82,&amp;nbsp;175-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab states preparations===
At the same time several other Arab states not bordering Israel, including Iraq, Sudan, Kuwait and Algeria, began mobilizing their armed forces.

Writing from Egypt on June 4, 1967, ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[James Reston]] observed: "Cairo does not want war and it is certainly not ready for war. But it has already accepted the possibility, even the likelihood, of war, as if it had lost control of the situation."&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James 'The Issue in Cairo: Israel a US "Base"', ''New York Times'', 5 June 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] of [[Iraq]] said that "the existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is an opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Jewish Virtual Library | url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/67_War.html |title = 67 War}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi Prime Minister predicted that "there will be practically no Jewish survivors".

In May 1967, [[Hafez al-Assad]], then Syria's Defense Minister declared: "Our forces are now entirely ready not only to repulse the aggression, but to initiate the act of liberation itself, and to explode the Zionist presence in the Arab homeland. The [[Syrian Army]], with its finger on the trigger, is united... I, as a military man, believe that the time has come to enter into a battle of annihilation."&lt;ref&gt;Bard 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by the virulent Arab rhetoric, mounting concern and pressure from the media, public bellicose statements by their military, the unexpected major battle over Syria in April, the consequences thereof for the Egyptian-Syrian defense agreement, the expulsion of UNEF, and the mobilization of Egyptian troops into Sinai, the Israeli public sense was of heightened fear and of an approaching holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2007, op. cit., pp. 106 &amp; 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., pp. 103 &amp; 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yitzhak Rabin reported that the cabinet was deadlocked over the issue of the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt; Interior Minister [[Haim-Moshe Shapira]] in particular had pointed out that the Straits had been closed from 1951 to 1956 without the situation endangering Israel's security.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;80&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, on May 22 General Rabin reported to Israel's cabinet that the Egyptian forces were in a defensive posture, that they were not being deployed to attack. The IDF concluded that Nasser meant to intervene in case of an Israeli attack against Syria. On 23 May, Rabin realized that by blocking the Tiran straits, Nasser probably understood that he was going to war.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Rogan, 2012 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli cabinet met on May 23 and decided to launch an attack if the Straits of Tiran were not re-opened by May 25. Following an approach from United States [[Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]] [[Eugene Rostow]] to allow time for the negotiation of a nonviolent solution, Israel agreed to a delay of ten days to two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Gelpi 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24 Prime Minister Eshkol told his generals: "Nobody ever said we were an army for preventive war ... I do not accept the mere fact that the Egyptian army is deployed in Sinai makes war inevitable. ... You did not receive all these weapons in order for you to say that now we are ready and well-equipped to destroy the Egyptian army, so we must do it".&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, 2005, op. cit., p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

U. S. intelligence likewise did not expect Egypt to attack in the absence of an Israeli invasion of Syria. On May 26 the United States communicated that assessment to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, John, "Palestine and Israel: A challenge to justice", 1990, Duke University Press, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May Jordan joined Egypt and Israel felt threatened also by the opening of Jordan to Iraqi and other Arab troops and an Israeli preemptive attack became more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Rogan, 2012 p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

While the generals were more troubled by the tanks and fighter airplanes that Nasser kept pouring into Sinai, the Israeli government were preoccupied with the Tiran Straits closure.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Rogan, 2012 p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Within Israel's political leadership, it was decided that if the US would not act, and if the UN could not act, then Israel would have to act. On 1 June, [[Moshe Dayan]] was made Israeli Defense Minister, and on June 3 the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] administration gave an ambiguous statement; Israel continued to prepare for war. Israel's attack against Egypt on June 5 began what would later be dubbed the Six-Day War.

==Who would win the war==
The [[CIA]] assessed that Israel could "defend successfully against simultaneous Arab attacks on all fronts... or hold on any three fronts while mounting successfully a major offensive on the fourth."&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no1/html_files/arab_israeli_war_1.html | title= CIA Analysis of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War |date=April 15, 2007 |accessdate= 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days before the war, the C.I.A assessed that Israel failed to take the instant military counteraction to Nasser's steps which might have been most effective. An attack would still be able to drive the Egyptians away from the entrance to the Strait of Tiran, but it would certainly cost Israel heavy losses of men and materiel, and doubted if Israel had sufficient war supply for a few weeks war.&lt;ref name="CIAestimate1967"/&gt;

The Soviet leadership considered the armed forces of Egypt, Syria, Algeria and Iraq as superior to the IDF in number of troops, tanks, planes, ships and amount of armaments. They had been equipped with the most modern weapons, and had received high-level training from the Soviets. They estimated mistakenly, that Israel was militarily weak, and operated under the illusion that Arab armies could easily repel any Israeli attack and defeat the IDF on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="RoiMorozov2008p13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nizameddin1999p26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Golan1990p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brezniev1967"/&gt;

==Retrospective==

===Israel: was the war imminent?===

Israel viewed the Straits of Tiran as a vital interest, through which Israel received vital imports, mainly oil from Iran, and a blockade threatened Israel's ability to develop the Negev.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oUSbvWDgYucC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=israel+exports+straits+of+tiran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O7K5VdVC5W&amp;sig=LmTJ_FYlvd92wz2XybPzLRwEyCU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DgmdUaOlMMG4rQH2joDwBQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=israel%20exports%20straits%20of%20tiran&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chief of Staff of the armed forces, [[Haim Bar-Lev]] (a deputy chief during the war) stated: "the entrance of the Egyptians into Sinai was not a [[casus belli]]," but argued instead that the Egyptian blockade of the [[Straits of Tiran]] ultimately caused the war.

After the closing of the Straits of Tiran, Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, contended that this was enough to start the war. Eban said, "From May the 24th onward, the question who started the war or who fired the first shot became momentously irrelevant. There is no difference in civil law between murdering a man by slow strangulation or killing him by a shot in the head... From the moment at which the blockade was posed, active hostilities had commenced, and Israel owed Egypt nothing of her Charter rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1967/Six-Day-War/12303074818188-2/ |title=Year In Review 1967, UPI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not viewed by the Israeli military as an imminent threat, the presence of a long-term direct and 'immediate' threat on the border would require the IDF to mobilize its reserves and stand ready, thus severely disrupting normal life in Israel at intolerable economic cost.&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2002, [[United States|American]] [[National Public Radio]] journalist [[Mike Shuster]] expressed a view that was prevalent in Israel before the war that the country "was surrounded by Arab states dedicated to its eradication. Egypt was ruled by Gamal Abdel Nasser, a firebrand nationalist whose army was the strongest in the Arab Middle East. Syria was governed by the radical [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist Party]], constantly issuing threats to push Israel into the sea."&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; With what Israel saw as provocative acts by Nasser, including the blockade of the Straits and the mobilization of forces in the Sinai, creating military and economic pressure, and the United States temporizing because of its entanglement in the [[Vietnam|Vietnam War]], Israel's political and military elite came to feel that preemption was not merely militarily preferable, but transformative.

Major General [[Mattityahu Peled]], the Chief of Logistics for the Armed Forces during the war, said the survival argument was "a bluff which was born and developed only after the war ... When we spoke of the war in the General Staff, we talked of the political ramifications if we didn't go to war — what would happen to Israel in the next 25 years. Never of survival today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877748,00.html Middle East: Was the War Necessary?] (1972, 19 June). Time Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Peled also stated that "To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers were in a position to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of situation, but above all an insult to Zahal (Israeli military)."&lt;ref&gt;Gerteiny &amp; Ziegler 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;142&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 30 March 1968 Ma’ariv interview Defense Minister Moshe Dayan explained: "What do you mean, [the war was] unavoidable? It was, of course, possible to avoid the war if the Straits [of Tiran] had stayed closed to Israeli shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Bober 1972, p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Menachem Begin]] also stated that "The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches did not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=MFA |location=IL |title=Foreign Relations since 1947: 1982–1984 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1982-1984/55%20Address%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begin%20at%20the%20National  |first=Menachen |last=Begin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112173139/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1982-1984/55%20Address%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begin%20at%20the%20National |archivedate=January 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin van Creveld]], the IDF pressed for war: "...the concept of 'defensible borders' was not even part of the IDFs own vocabulary. Anyone who will look for it in the military literature of the time will do so in vain. Instead, Israel's commanders based their thought on the 1948 war and, especially, their 1956 triumph over the Egyptians in which, from then Chief of Staff Dayan down, they had gained their spurs. When the 1967 crisis broke they felt certain of their ability to win a 'decisive, quick and elegant' victory, as one of their number, General [[Haim Bar Lev]], put it, and pressed the government to start the war as soon as possible".&lt;ref&gt;van Creveld 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

That the announcement of the blockade of the Strait of Tiran paved the way for war is disputed by Major General [[Indar Jit Rikhye]], military adviser to the [[United Nations Secretary General]], who called the accusation of a blockade "questionable," pointing out that an Israeli-flagged ship had not passed through the straits in two years, and that "The U.A.R. [Egyptian] navy had searched a couple of ships after the establishment of the blockade and thereafter relaxed its implementation."&lt;ref name="Rikhye"&gt;{{cite book |first=Indar Jit |last=Rikhye |title=The Sinai Blunder: Withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force Leading to the Six-Day War of June 1967 |location=London |publisher=Rutledge |year=1980 |isbn= 0-7146-3136-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Did Israel plan a war?===

====For====

According to the U.S. assessment, Egypt had no intention of attacking Israel, and the Americans desperately tried to dissuade Israel from invading Egypt. The U.S. further views that Jordan and Syria only entered the war as a response to Israel's invasion of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;John Quigley, "The Six-Day War and Israeli Self-Defense", p. 192 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR had come to similar conclusions: "... it is clear that the Soviet assessment from mid-May 1967 that Israel was about to strike at Syria was correct and well founded, and was not merely based on the public threats issued by Eshkol, Rabin and Yariv.".&lt;ref&gt;Gluska, 2007, op. cit., p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

====Against====
Some of Israel's political leaders, however, hoped for a diplomatic solution.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;  The U.S. President at the time, [[Lyndon Johnson]], said that action by Egypt was the leading cause of the war:&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19670619&amp;id=valVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JeEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5448,4112160 LBJ Pledges U.S. to Peace Effort]", ''Eugene Register-Guard'' (June 19, 1967).  See also Johnson, Lyndon.  [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=28308 "Address at the State Department's Foreign Policy Conference for Educators"] (June 19, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a single act of folly was more responsible for this explosion than any other, it was the arbitrary and dangerous announced decision that the Straits of Tiran would be closed. The right of innocent, maritime passage must be preserved for all nations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Szabo, many commentators consider the war as the classic case of anticipatory attack in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Szabo2011p147"/&gt; According to Ferris, Nasser's decisions to ask for the removal of UNEF from Sinai and to block the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping, are commonly accepted as the point where war became inevitable.&lt;ref name="Ferris2012p286"/&gt;

===Did Egypt plan a war?===

====For====
According to Shlaim &amp; Louis, in the end of May 1967, Nasser claimed in a public speech to have been aware of the Straits of Tiran closure implications: "''Taking over Sharm El Sheikh meant confrontation with Israel. It also means that we ready to enter a general war with Israel. It was not a separate operation''".&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

General Abdal Muhsin Murtaji, the commander of the Sinai front in 1967, wrote that the failed union with Syria and the debacle in Yemen forced Nasser to find an outlet for his failures, which he found through the 1967 war.&lt;ref name=Murtaji-FAO2004/&gt;

====Against====
[[Yitzhak Rabin]], who served as the Chief of the General Staff for Israel during the war stated: "I do not believe that Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent into Sinai on May 14 would not have been enough to unleash an offensive against Israel. He knew it and we knew it."

Israeli [[Foreign Minister]] [[Abba Eban]] wrote in his autobiography that he found "Nasser's assurance that he did not plan an armed attack" convincing, adding that "Nasser did not want war; he wanted victory without war".&lt;ref&gt;Eban 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubenberg 1989 pp.&amp;nbsp;107–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, Shlomo, 2005, "Scars of War; Wounds of Peace - the Israeli-Arab tragedy", Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts suggest that Nasser took actions aimed at reaping political gains, which he knew carried a high risk of precipitating military hostilities. On this view, Nasser's willingness to take such risks was based on his fundamental underestimation of Israel's capacity for independent and effective military action.&lt;ref name = "ac.il-2005"&gt;James 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==The war consequences==
{{Main article|Six-Day War}}
{{See also|Controversies relating to the Six-Day War}}
On June 1, Israel formed a National Unity Government, and on June 4 the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched [[Operation Focus]], a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six-Day War.

[[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War#Preemptive strike v. unjustified attack|Controversy remains]] as to whether Israel's attack was a preemptive strike or an unjustified attack. Many commentators consider the war as the classic case of anticipatory attack in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Szabo2011p147"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quigley2012p135"/&gt;

Historian [[Michael Oren]] writes that Rusk was "mad as hell" and that Johnson later wrote "I have never concealed my regret that Israel decided to move when it did".&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the moment he has vastly enhanced his own prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world, diminished the standing of Israel and, at least for the moment, administered a serious setback to the US. Moreover, by simply standing where he is he places the Israelis in an extremely difficult position. He keeps the crisis at high pitch, and as long as this continues the Israelis must remain mobilized. This they cannot do for long without adverse effects upon their economy.  5.

Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Murakami1995p287"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masahiro Murakami|title=Managing Water for Peace in the Middle East; Alternative Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVGo3B-82GMC|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=1995|publisher=United Nations University Press|isbn=978-92-808-0858-2|pages=287–297|quote="The book appears in: http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0m.htm . The initial diversion capacity of the National Water Carrier without supplementary booster pumps was 320 million m3, well within the limits of the Johnston Plan. ......Shortly before completion of the Israeli Water Carrier in 1964, an Arab summit conference decided to try to thwart it. Discarding direct military attack, the Arab states chose to divert the Jordan headwater......he Arab states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters.......diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk.....According to neutral assessments, the scheme was only marginally feasible; it was technically difficult and expensive......Political considerations cited by the Arabs in rejecting the 1955 Johnston Plan were revived to justify the diversion scheme. Particular emphasis was placed on the Carrier's capability to enhance Israel's capacity to absorb immigrants to the detriment of Palestinian refugees. In response, Israel stressed that the National Water Carrier was within the limits of the Johnston Plan......the Arabs started work on the Headwater Diversion project in 1965. Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. According to estimates, completion of the project would have deprived Israel of 35% of its contemplated withdrawal from the upper Jordan, constituting one-ninth of Israel's annual water budget.......In a series of military strikes, Israel hit the diversion works. The attacks culminated in April 1967 in air strikes deep inside Syria. The increase in water-related Arab-Israeli hostility was a major factor leading to the June 1967 war."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">'''Simen Skappel''' (7 March 1866 – 15 July 1945) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[historian]] and [[statistician]].

He specialized in agricultural history and agricultural statistics, and worked for [[Statistics Norway]] for 34 years, leading the Department of agricultural statistics for parts of that period.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Dødsfall|date=20 July 1945|work=Verdens gang|page=6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hired in Statistics Norway in 1902, was promoted to secretary in 1911 and department head in 1928.&lt;ref name=arbleks&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1936|volume=6|title=Skappel, Simen|encyclopedia=[[Arbeidernes Leksikon]]|editor1=[[Jakob Friis|Friis, Jakob]] |editor2=[[Trond Hegna|Hegna, Trond]] |editor3=[[Dagfin Juel|Juel, Dagfin]] |publisher=Arbeidermagasinets Forlag|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent publication was ''Om husmannsvesenet i Norge'', published in 1922.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; A ''husmann'' in Norway was a type of [[Croft (land)|crofter]]. In the book, Skappel distinguished between [[Croft (land)|crofters]] who received some land in exchange for work, often on short-term contracts, and crofters who received land in exchange for rent, often on lifetime contracts. Skappel's theory has been discussed as late as around 2000, but has been found (by historian [[Ståle Dyrvik]]) models to lack important complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyrvik|first=Ståle|authorlink=Ståle Dyrvik|title=Norsk historie 1625–1814|publisher=Samlaget|location=Oslo|date=1999|series=Volume three of ''[[Norsk historie (Samlaget)|Norsk historie]]''|pages=132, 136|isbn=978-82-521-5546-4|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent works by Skappel include ''Hedemarkens amt 1814–1914'' and ''Ringsaker Sparebank 1847–1927'', but he mostly published in journals. He died in the summer of 1945.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''Sobědruhy''', fully '''Sobědruhy u Teplic''' ({{lang-de|'''Soborten'''}}) is, now a district of [[Teplice]], [[Czech Republic]].

== Geography ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
&lt;!-- Soborten liegt am Südfuß des [[Erzgebirge]]s, unterhalb des 806 m hohen [[Komáří hůrka|Mückenberges]] an der [[Alte Dresden-Teplitzer Poststraße|Alten Dresden-Teplitzer Poststraße]]. --&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Jewish cemetery Sobědruhy 17.JPG|thumb|Jewish cemetery at Sobědruhy]]
Traditionally, Sobědruhy was a town in [[Bohemia]], whose Jewish community is probably one of the oldest in the province. The Jewish community of Sobědruhy includes parts of the Teplitz (Teplice), Dux ([[Duchcov]]), and Karbitz ([[Chabařovice]]) districts. The [[synagogue]] has a tower, with a [[clock]], and two lamps respectively bearing the dates 1553 and 1654. For a time the [[Jewish cemetery]] at Sobědruhy was used as a burial-place by the Jewish community of [[Dresden]]. Many gravestones bear the inscription ''"Mi-Geresh Prag"'', marking the graves of Jews who were driven from [[Prague]], some of whom died as [[martyr]]s. Until 1848 the Jews of Sobědruhy were confined to the [[ghetto]] - the [[Jewish street (Sobědruhy)|''Judengasse'']], as it is still called. For some time the Jewish community formed a part of the [[Leitmeritz]] district [[rabbi]]nate, but in 1883 it gained independence and elected as its rabbi [[Heinrich Galandauer|Ḥayyim (Heinrich) Galandauer]] (author of ''"Der Socialismus im Bibel und Talmud"'').

Sobědruhy has a [[Jewish population]] of 150 in 1900s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8201">'''Søren Wichmann''' (born 1964 in [[Copenhagen]]) is a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] specializing in [[historical linguistics]], [[linguistic typology]], [[Mesoamerican languages]], and [[epigraphy]]. Since June 2016, he has been employed as a University Lecturer at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, [[Leiden University]], after having worked at different institutions in Denmark, Mexico, Germany and Russia, including, during 2003-2015, the Department of Linguistics, [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]].

Wichmann's [[PhD]] dissertation, from University of Copenhagen, treated the Azoyú variety of Tlapanec spoken in Guerrero, Mexico. He has written extensively about [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] and [[Mixe–Zoquean languages]]. He has done fieldwork on [[Mixe languages|Mixe]], [[Texistepec Popoluca]] and [[Tlapanec language|Tlapanec]]. Regarding Mixe–Zoquean, he has done comparative work resulting in the currently most accepted classification of the Mixe–Zoquean language family as well as a reconstruction of its vocabulary and grammar (Wichmann 1995). He also specializes in the study of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphs]] — particularly the linguistic aspects of the deciphering of the Mayan script. Since 2007, Wichmann's work has increasingly focused on the development of quantitative methods in historical linguistics, including the development of the [[Automated Similarity Judgment Program]].

Since its inception in 2011, Wichmann has been General Editor of Language Dynamics and Change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brill.nl/language-dynamics-and-change Language Dynamics and Change (Accessed May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vico La scienza nuova.gif|right|thumb|''Principj di Scienza Nuova'' - title page of 1744 edition.]]

'''''The New Science''''' (original Italian title '''''Scienza Nuova''''' {{IPA-it|ˈʃentsa ˈnwɔːva|}}) is the major work of Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico]], published in 1725. It has been highly influential in the [[philosophy of history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and for historicists like [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Hayden White]]. The central concepts were highly original, and prefigured the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

The original full title is ''Principi di Scienza Nuova d'intorno alla Comune Natura delle Nazioni'', which may be literally translated as "Principles/Origins of New/Renewed Science About/Surrounding the Common Nature of Nations".

==Production and publication==
In 1720, Vico began work on the ''Scienza Nuova'' as part of a treatise on [[Universal rights]]. Although a full volume was originally to be sponsored by Cardinal Corsini (the future [[Pope Clement XII]]), Vico was forced to finance the publication himself after the Cardinal pleaded financial difficulty and withdrew his patronage. The first edition of the ''New Science'' (''Scienza Nuova'', rather than ''Nuova Scienza'', for which Galileo had been known) appeared in 1725, and a second, reworked version was published in 1730; neither was well received during Vico’s lifetime.

Vico himself worked on two revisited editions, that were published under new titles, the first in 1730 and the second posthumously in 1744. It was the first work by Vico to be written in Italian, while his previous ones were written in Latin.

==Approach, style and tone==
In its first section, titled "Idea of the Work" (''Idea dell'Opera''), the ''Scienza Nuova'' (1730 and 1744) explicitly presents itself as a "Science of reasoning" (''Scienza di ragionare'').  Indeed, the work (cf. most notably the section "Of the Elements") includes a dialectic between axioms (authoritative maxims or ''degnità'') and "reasonings" (''ragionamenti'') linking and clarifying the axioms.

Vico specifies that his "Scienza" reasons primarily about the function of religion in the human world ("Idea of the Work"), and in this respect the work "comes to be a civil theology reasoned from divine providence" (''vien ad essere una teologia civile ragionata della provvidenza divina'').  Reconsidering divine things (viz. "the conduct of divine providence") within a human or political context, Vico unearths the "poetic theologians" (''poeti teologi'') of pagan antiquity, exposing the poetic character of theology independently of Christianity's sacred history and thus of Biblical authority (see e.g. ''Scienza Nuova'' [1744], "Of the Elements," CXIV).  Vico's unearthing of poetic theology (anticipated already in his ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'' (1710), "On the most ancient wisdom of the Italians") confirms the philosopher's ties to the Italian Renaissance and its appeals to ''[[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]''.  With the early Renaissance, Vico shares the call for recovering a "pagan" or "vulgar" horizon for philosophy's providential agency, or for recognizing the providence of our human "metaphysical" minds/''menti'' in the world of our "political" wills/''animi'' ("Idea of the Work," par. 2). "Poetic theology" would serve as stage for an "ascent" (ibid.) to recognize the inherence or latency of rational agency in our actions, even when these are brutal (see further "Of the Method," par. 2).  This way, the particular providence of the Bible's "true God" ("Of the Elements," CXIV) would not be required for the thriving of properly human life.  All that would be needed was (A) false religions/Gods and (B) the covert work of the ''conatus'' (rational principle of constitution of experience rooted in its proper infinite form) examined at length in the ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'' and evoked again in par. 2 of the "Of the Method" section of the ''Scienza Nuova'' (1730 and 1744).

==Cyclical history (''Corsi e ricorsi''?)==
Vico is often seen as espousing a cyclical philosophy of history where human history is created by man, although Vico never speaks of "history without attributes" (Paolo Cristofolini, ''Vice Pagano e Barbaro''), but of a "world of nations".  Which is more, in the 1744 ''Scienza Nuova'' (esp. the "Conclusion of the Work") Vico stresses that "the world of nations" is made by men merely with respect to their sense of certainty (''certamente''), though not fundamentally, insofar as the world is guided by the human mind "metaphysically" independent of its makings (compare opening paragraph of the ''Scienza Nuova'').  Furthermore, although Vico is often attributed the expression "''corsi e ricorsi''" (cycles and counter cycles) of "history", he never speaks in the plural of "the cycle" or of "the counter-cycle" (''ricorso'') of "human things", suggesting that political life and order, or human creations, are oriented "backward," as it were, or called back to their constitutive "metaphysical" principle.  

On present day "constructivist" readings, Vico is supposed to have promoted a vision of man and society as moving in parallel from barbarism to civilization.&lt;blockquote&gt;As societies become more developed socially, human nature also develops, and both manifest their development in changes in language, myth, folklore, economy, etc.; in short, social change produces cultural change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 0710077467|location = London|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Vico would therefore be using an original organic idea that culture is a system of socially produced and structured elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, knowledge of any society would come from the social structure of that society, explicable, therefore, only in terms of its own language. As such, one may find a dialectical relationship between language, knowledge and social structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Relying on a complex etymology, Vico argues in the ''Scienza Nuova'' that civilization develops in a recurring cycle (''ricorso'') of three ages: the divine, the heroic, and the human. Each age exhibits distinct political and social features and can be characterized by master [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] or [[figure of speech|figures of language]]. The ''[[Gigantes|giganti]]'' of the divine age rely on [[metaphor]] to compare, and thus comprehend, human and natural phenomena. In the heroic age, [[metonymy]] and [[synecdoche]] support the development of [[feudal]] or [[monarchic]] institutions embodied by idealized figures. The final age is characterized by popular [[democracy]] and reflection via [[irony]]; in this epoch, the rise of [[rationality]] leads to ''barbarie della reflessione'' or barbarism of reflection, and civilization descends once more into the poetic era. Taken together, the recurring cycle of three ages{{spaced ndash}}common to every nation{{spaced ndash}}constitutes for Vico a ''storia ideale eterna'' or ideal eternal history. Therefore, it can be said that all history is the history of the rise and fall of civilizations, for which Vico provides evidence (up until, and including the Graeco-Roman historians).

==Ideas on rhetoric applied to history==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Vico’s humanism (his returning to a pre-modern form of reasoning), his interest in classical rhetoric and [[philology]], and his response to Descartes contribute to the philosophical foundations for the second ''Scienza Nuova''. Through an elaborate Latin etymology, Vico establishes not only the distinguishing features of first humans, but also how early civilization developed out of a ''sensus communis'' or common (not collective) sense. Beginning with the first form of authority intuited by the ''giganti'' or early humans and transposed in their first "mute" or "sign" language, Vico concludes that “first, or vulgar, wisdom was poetic in nature.” This observation is not an [[aesthetic]] one, but rather points to the capacity inherent in all men to imagine meaning via comparison and to reach a communal "conscience" or "prejudice" about their surroundings.  The metaphors that define the poetic age gradually yield to the first civic discourse, finally leading to a time characterized by "full-fledged reason" (''ragione tutta spiegata''), in which reason and right are exposed to the point that they vanish into their own superficial appearance.  At this point, speech returns to its primitive condition, and with it men.  Hence the "recurring" (''ricorso'') of life to "barbarism" (''barbarie'').  It is by way of warning his age and those stemming from it of the danger of seeking truth in clear and distinct ideas blinding us to the real depths of life, that Vico calls our attention back to a classical art of moderating the course of human things, lest the liberty enjoyed in the "Republic" be supplanted by the anarchic tyranny of the senses.

Crucial to Vico's work remains a subtle criticism of all attempts to impose universality upon particularity, as if ''ex nihilo''. Instead, Vico attempts to always let "the true" emerge from "the certain" through innumerable stories and anecdotes drawn mostly from the history of [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]] and from the [[Bible]]. Here, reason does not attempt to overcome the poetic dimension of life and speech, but to moderate its impulses so as to safeguard civil life.

While the transfer from divine to heroic to human ages is, for Vico, marked by shifts in the [[tropological]] nature of language, the inventional aspect of the poetic principle remains constant. When referring to “poets”, Vico intends to evoke the original Greek sense of “creators”. In the ''Scienza Nuova'', then, the ''verum factum'' principle first put forth in ''De Italorum Sapientia'' remains central. As such, the notion of topics as the ''loci'' or places of invention (put forth by Aristotle and developed throughout classical rhetoric) serves as the foundation for "the true", and thus, as the underlying principle of ''sensus communis'' and civic discourse. The development of laws that shape the social and political character of each age is informed as much by master tropes as by those topics deemed acceptable in each era. Thus, for the rudimentary civilization of the divine age, sensory topics are employed to develop laws applicable on an individual basis. These laws expand as metonymy and synecdoche enable notions of sovereign rule in the heroic age; accordingly, acceptable topics expand to include notions of [[Social class|class]] and division. In the final, human age, the reflection that enables popular democracy requires appeals to any and all topics to achieve a common, rational law that is universally applicable. The development of civilization in Vico’s ''storia ideale eterna'', then, is rooted in the first [[Western canon|canon]] of rhetoric, as invention via ''loci'' shapes both the creation of and discourse about civil life.

==Reception and later influence==
Vico’s major work was poorly received during his own life but has since inspired a [[En cadre|cadre]] of famous thinkers and artists, including [[Karl Marx]] and [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Reiner Grundmann]], 1991. ''Marxism and Ecology''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Later his work was received more favourably as in the case of [[Lord Monboddo]] to whom he was compared in a modern treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, Catherine, ''Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Monboddo]]'', Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] has devoted attention to Vico as a critic of the Enlightenment and a significant humanist and culture theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas'', Chatto and Windus, 1976. Redwood Burn Ltd.. {{ISBN|0-7011-2512-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder'', Pimlico, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scienza Nuova'' was included by [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] in his book ''[[The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]''.

The historical cycle provides the structure for [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] book, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. The intertextual relationship between ''Scienza Nuova'' and ''Finnegans Wake'' was brought to light by [[Samuel Beckett]] in his essay "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce” published in ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (1929), where Beckett argued that Vico's conception of language also had significant influence in Joyce's work. Vico's notion of the ''lingua mentale commune'' (mental dictionary) in relation to ''universale fantastico'' reverberates in Joyce's novel, which ends in the middle of a sentence, reasserting Vico's principle of cyclical history.&lt;ref&gt;Verene, Donald Phillip. ''Vico and Joyce''. Albany: State University of New York, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language, knowledge and society are in a dialectical relationship, which means that any study or comparison of societies must consider the specific contexts of the societies. This has clearly influenced anthropology and sociology.

'''''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective''''' is a limited-edition [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by &amp;Now Books in 2016.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective'' masquerades as a catalogue for a real retrospective of experimental films by a non-existent videographer. Author [[Lance Olsen]] and his wife, videographer Andi Olsen, stage the fake retrospective in galleries in Europe and the U.S. The result is a three-dimensional text: a real place dedicated to an unreal career of an artist named Alana Olsen. From her videos and the texts surrounding them (including this catalogue/novel), the viewer/reader is invited to treat her like a fictional character, inferring her character, development, obsessions, and relationship with her daughter, Aila, who allegedly curates the exhibit, but is in fact another fictive character. The catalogue/novel is made up of critical and biographical essays, stills, and reminiscences about Alana's small body of work (fewer than 20 videos over five decades, some of which have  gone missing) produced in relative anonymity, yet apparently a large influence on artists as varied as [[Lars von Trier]], [[Douglas Gordon]], and [[Martin Arnold]].

Thematically, ''There's No Place Like Time,'' then, forms part of a larger [[conceptual art]] installation that investigates the difficulties inherent in identity and knowledge about the past.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 543''', adopted unanimously on 29 November 1983, is a [[legislation]] that considered the report filed by the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] on the subject of the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force]]. The Council noted its efforts to establish a durable and just peace in the Middle East, but also expressed its concern over the prevailing state of [[hostility|military tension]] evident in the area.

The resolution decided to call upon the parties concerned to immediately implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|Resolution 338]] (1973), it renewed the mandate of the Observer Force for another six months until 31 May 1984 and requested that the Secretary-General submit a report on the situation at the end of that period.

'''United Slovenia''' ({{lang-sl|Zedinjena Slovenija}} or {{lang|sl|Združena Slovenija}}) is the name of an unrealized political programme of the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] national movement, formulated during the [[Spring of Nations]] in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Yugoslavia, the Former and Future|last= Akhavan|first= Payam |author2=Robert Howse  |year= 1995|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-0253-1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ia3XMdZ2bOkC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22United+Slovenia%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U1VUVYg6POEqPtHBYylVzBrYZqW5A |page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme demanded (a) unification of all the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene-inhabited areas]] into one single kingdom under the rule of the [[Austrian Empire]], (b) equal rights of the [[Slovene language]] in public, and (c) strongly opposed the planned integration of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with the [[German Confederation]]. The programme failed to meet its main objectives, but it remained the common political program of all currents within the [[Slovene national movement]] until World War I.

== Historical context ==

Following the [[Vienna Rebellion]] that forced [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] to abolish [[feudalism]] and adopt a constitution, many nations of the [[Austrian Empire]] saw a chance for strengthening their ideas. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, for the first time in centuries, all [[Slovenes]] were under the rule of one emperor. They were, however, divided between different political subdivisions, namely the provinces of [[Carniola]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Istria]], [[Trieste]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy and Venetia|Lombardy and Venetia]] (the [[Venetian Slovenia]]) and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] ([[Prekmurje]]). In such a fragmentation, a self-government on national basis was impossible.

The programme of United Slovenia was first formulated on 17 March 1848 by the [[Carinthian Slovene]] priest and political activist [[Matija Majar]], and published on 29 March in the [[national conservative]] newspaper ''[[Kmetijske in rokodelske novice]]'', edited by [[Janez Bleiweis]]. The idea advanced by Majar was elaborated and articulated by the society of Slovenes from [[Vienna]], led at this time by the notable linguist [[Fran Miklošič]], which published their manifesto on 29 April in the Slovene newspaper ''Novice'' from [[Klagenfurt]]. In the same period, the geographer [[Peter Kozler]] issued a map of all the [[Slovene Lands]] with ethnic-linguistic lines.

Janez Bleiweis presented these demands to the Austrian Emperor's younger brother [[John Baptist Joseph Fabian Sebastian von Habsburg|Archduke John]], who had been living amongst the Slovenes in [[Maribor]] for 15 years. The three key points of the programme (the creation of [[Slovenia]] as a distinct entity, recognition of the [[Slovene language]] and opposition to joining the [[German Confederation]]) were signed as a [[petition]]. 51 signed sheets still exist, showing that the programme was well-supported by the masses. The signed petition was presented to the [[Austrian parliament]]; however, due to the [[1848 revolution in Hungary|uprising]] in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the Parliament was dissolved before it could even discuss the Slovene issue.

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Yugoslavia moljevic1941 en.png|thumb|200px|During Second World War, [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] leader [[Stevan Moljević]] idealized a plan in which Serbia and Slovenia would see substantially enlarged their territories and fullfield their territorial claims after liberation from Axis forces.]]
The political aspirations of the Slovenes were suppressed by [[Bach's absolutism|Baron Alexander von Bach's absolutism]] in 1851, and [[Slovene national awakening]] was moved back to an almost purely the [[Culture of Slovenia|cultural field]]. The programme of United Slovenia, however, remained the common political programme of all currents within the [[Slovene national movement]] until World War I.  and was gaining power in the period of [[Tabori movement|tabori]] between 1868–1871. After the First World War and dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], it was partially replaced by the idea of integration with other [[South Slavs]] in the common country of [[Yugoslavia]].

After the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in October 1918, and the subsequent creation of first the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and then the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], a significant number of Slovenes, mostly in the [[Julian March]] and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], remained outside the country. Therefore, the programme of United Slovenia remained very much present in the political and intellectual debates of the interwar period. In April 1941, it was incorporated in the manifesto of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]]. After the annexation of the [[Slovenian Littoral]] to Yugoslavia in 1947 and the partition of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] between Italy and Yugoslavia in 1954, the main demand of the United Slovenia programme – the unification of the majority of [[Slovene Lands]] into a unified and autonomous political-administrative entity – saw its fulfillment.

[[Pošta Slovenije]] issued a [[postage stamp|stamp]] on the occasion of 150th anniversary of the United Slovenia movement.

'''Walter H. Breen Jr.''' (September 5, 1928 &amp;ndash; April 27, 1993) was an American [[numismatics|numismatist]], writer and convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child sex offender]], and the husband of author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]. He is known among [[Coin collecting|coin collectors]] for writing ''Walter Breen's Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins''. "Breen numbers", from his encyclopedia, are widely used to attribute varieties of coins. He is also known for activity in the [[science fiction]] [[science fiction fandom|fan community]] and for his writings in defense of [[pederasty]].

==Early life==
Breen was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the son of Walter Henry Breen Sr. and Mary Helena (Nellie) Brown Mehl.&lt;ref&gt;State of Texas, Texas Department of Health, Birth Certificate #68982&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the first several years of his life in Texas with his parents.&lt;ref&gt;US Census 1930: Precinct 1, Brooks, Texas; Enumeration District 2, Page 10B&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the time they met, both of Walter's parents were married to other people and living next door to each other in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Walter's father changed his own name from Walter H. Green to Breen after abandoning his wife and children to run away with Walter's mother. Later in life, Breen sometimes denied they were his birth parents and claimed to have been adopted by them as a [[Child abandonment|foundling]] child. In reminiscences he spoke of being raised in a variety of "institutional and foster settings."&lt;ref name="williamapercy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Walter_h._breen.pdf|title=Walter H. Breen|publisher=Williamapercy.com|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1940 census shows young Breen living in a Catholic orphanage in West Virginia, with his (by then) divorced mother living as a housekeeper in a Catholic church rectory less than two miles away. Walter's father was by that time living with another woman in Chicago; for a while after their separation his mother resumed her maiden name and young Walter went by the name William Brown.

Breen strove to distinguish himself academically from a young age, attending a Catholic high school in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and continued excelling academically throughout his postsecondary education. After being declared unfit for service by the [[Army Air Force]] in April 1946, Breen was accepted that October with a recorded [[IQ]] of 144;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v13n42a08.html|title=On Mensa And Walter Breens IQ|publisher=Coinbooks.org|accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a severe beating,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coins.ha.com/common/features/numisarticles.php?id=225|title=Numismatic Articles|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=2008-01-05|accessdate=2014-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105012350/http://coins.ha.com/common/features/numisarticles.php?id=225|archivedate=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was honorably discharged that December. 

During his recovery, he read voluminously about rare coins and initiated correspondence with various members of the [[numismatics]] community, renewing his involvement in a hobby in which he had been actively engaged a few years earlier.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Alternatively, Breen claimed that a severe head injury suffered in a World War II plane crash led to the development of his [[photographic memory]].&lt;ref name="scvhistory.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/coins/soltaylor071908.html|title=Walter Breen: Enigmatic Numismatist|publisher=Scvhistory.com|date=2008-07-19|accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1952. He later claimed he finished four years of coursework in approximately ten months, concealing the fact that as a high-IQ teenage prodigy he had already completed two years at [[Georgetown University]] during [[World War II]], followed by a brief stint at a small Catholic college in Texas. After graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]], he took a position as an auction cataloger for the New Netherland Coin Company while concurrently enrolled in pre-med courses at [[Columbia University]], where he became a protege of the controversial psychologist and numismatist [[William Herbert Sheldon]]. 

During this period, physicist [[Jack Sarfatti]] (who later sponsored guest workshops by Breen at meetings of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group at the [[Esalen Institute]] in 1976) alleges that Breen coordinated [[Sandia National Laboratories]]-funded [[parapsychological]] research studies of New York City [[gifted]] children (so-called "superkids," including Sarfatti and Robert Bashlow) in Sheldon's Constitutional Laboratory at [[Columbia Medical School]] from 1953-56.&lt;ref name="praxisforlife.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praxisforlife.org/?p=446|title=Coming Soon|publisher=Praxisforlife.org|accessdate=2014-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226135736/http://praxisforlife.org/?p=446|archivedate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sarfatti's tales are not corroborated by any reliable source, but they do mirror a longtime interest Breen had in studying high-IQ youth, which included taking out advertisements in the early 1960s for a projected private school for gifted children which Breen hoped to launch in New York City, a project which came to nothing in the end. William Sheldon worked closely with Breen on a number of coin-related projects in the 1950s, including the book ''Penny Whimsy'', and although Sheldon encouraged Breen to attend medical school, he eventually distanced himself from the scientist, allegedly, per Breen in an interview, in part due to Sheldon's professed [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

Breen eventually enrolled in the [[sociology]] graduate program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he claimed to have researched "the [[Beat Generation]] groups on both coasts but also some of the very earliest hippies, finding out incidentally that some ideas that the bunch of us had developed in science fiction fandom had gotten into the hippie subculture and were being paraded around as their own inventions."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in the sociology of music from the institution in 1966.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Writings==
In 1951, the journal ''[[Numismatist (magazine)|Numismatist]]'' published his earliest numismatics writings. Two years later he completed his first book on American coins, ''Proof Coins Struck by the United States Mint, 1817&amp;ndash;1901''.

Breen also spent considerable time compiling information on the history of [[homosexuality]] and [[pederasty]]. His research, unprecedented in its extensive treatment of the history but not adhering to the standards of scholarly research, formed the basis for his 1964 book ''Greek Love'', which he published under the pseudonym "J.Z. Eglinton".&lt;ref name="BeforeStonewall" /&gt; Breen collaborated with [[Warren Johansson]] in researching the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Warren_johannson.pdf|format=PDF|title=Warren Johannson|publisher=Williamapercy.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated the book to his wife, [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], who edited it. He also published a journal, ''The International Journal of Greek Love'', under the same pseudonym.&lt;ref name="BeforeStonewall"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dececco |first1=John |first2=Vern L |last2=Bullough|title=Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7nKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA321|date=4 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-76628-5|pages=314–315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As "Eglinton" Breen made an appearance and spoke at the founding convention of [[NAMBLA]] in 1978.

His other interests included dirty [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s and [[fortune cookie]]s. He self-published [[monograph]]s on both subjects.

==Arrests and convictions==
Breen was initially convicted of [[child molestation]] or lewd behavior in Atlantic City in 1954, resulting in a probationary sentence.&lt;ref name="scvhistory.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sff.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephengoldin.com/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradle---Timeline.html|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley: In Her Own Words|publisher=Stephen Goldin|accessdate=2016-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911223846/http://www.stephengoldin.com/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradle---Timeline.html|archivedate=2016-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During science fiction fandom's "Breendoggle" of 1963&amp;ndash;1964, Breen was banned from attending [[22nd World Science Fiction Convention|Pacificon II]] and briefly blackballed from the subculture's main [[amateur press association]] after allegations of further sex crimes surfaced.&lt;ref name="sff.net"/&gt; Nevertheless, prominent fans of the era such as [[John Boardman (physicist)|John Boardman]], perhaps unaware of Breen's prior conviction, dismissed the allegations as hearsay and "character assassination," and the scandal blew over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jophan.org/1960s/chapter8.htm |title=1960s Fan History Outline, Chapter 8 |publisher=Jophan.org |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Breen married Bradley, who was cognizant of his behavior&lt;ref name="sff.net"/&gt; but chose not to report him. A further molestation conviction may have occurred in 1964.&lt;ref name="scvhistory.com"/&gt;

Breen was again arrested on [[child molestation]] charges in 1990. He accepted a [[plea bargain]], which resulted in three years' [[probation]].&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;Serrano, Richard A. (October 3, 1991). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61504546.html?dids=61504546:61504546&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+03%2C+1991&amp;author=RICHARD+A.+SERRANO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Rare+Coins+Expert+Charged+With+Child+Molestation&amp;pqatl=google "Rare Coins Expert Charged With Child Molestation"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, he was charged with eight [[felony]] counts of child molestation involving a 13-year-old boy.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; Though diagnosed with [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in 1992, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He died in prison in [[Chino, California]] on April 27, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8556284.html?dids=8556284:8556284&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=MAY+12%2C+1993&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Walter+Breen&amp;pqatl=google "Walter Breen"] (May 12, 1993). ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Breen's daughter Moira Greyland revealed that she was one of the people who reported her father for child molestation.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=June 27, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/06/27/re-reading-feminist-author-marion-zimmer-bradley-in-the-wake-of-sexual-assault-allegations/|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 27, 2014|title=Re-reading feminist author Marion Zimmer Bradley in the wake of sexual assault allegations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In addition to his employment with First Coinvestors, Inc., where he was an officer for many years, Breen was an active member of the science fiction fan community for much of his life. He wrote for [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]], and took over editorship of the fanzine ''[[Fanac]]'' from [[Terry Carr]] and Ron Ellik.

He married [[science fiction]] writer [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] on June 3, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;State of California, Marriage Certificate #60324&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children and separated in 1979. After their separation, Breen moved to [[Oakland, California]]. Bradley remained his principal employer. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990.

He regularly wore his [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key as a zipper pull on the fly of his pants. He joined [[Mensa International|Mensa]] in 1958 or 1959, possibly the first American to do so.&lt;ref name="scvhistory.com"/&gt;

A user of [[marijuana]] and [[LSD]], Breen believed in [[reincarnation]], often [[Past life (reincarnation)|recalling putative past lives]] in [[Atlantis]], [[ancient Greece]], and other mythological and historical epochs.&lt;ref name="williamapercy.com"/&gt;

'''''Washday at the pa''''' is a 1964 illustrated children's book by [[Ans Westra]] that describes a day in the lives of a rural [[Māori people|Māori]] family.

The book was originally published by the then [[Learning Media Limited|School Publications Branch]] of the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Department of Education]], and printed by the [[Government Printing Office (New Zealand)|Government Printer]], but all 38,000 copies were withdrawn&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?ExhibitID=0x000a3eed Knowledge Net article] Te Papa&lt;/ref&gt; following a campaign by the [[Maori Women's Welfare League|Māori Women's Welfare League]] that it would have a 'detrimental effect' on Māori people - and that the living conditions portrayed within the book were atypical. The subsequent August 1964 order by the Minister of Education caused a controversy&lt;ref name="Te Ao Hau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao50TeA/c35.html|title=Te Ao Hou, No 50 (March 1965)|publisher=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all copies in schools were recalled and shredded, as were all unsold copies in the Government Bookshops chain.

Westra had the book republished the next year by the [[Caxton Press (New Zealand)|Caxton Press]] of [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="Te Ao Hau"/&gt;

The book was updated and republished in 2011 by [[Ans Westra]] and Mark Amery, to include other photos of the same family take in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1110/S00139/ans-westras-washday-at-the-pa-republished.htm |title=Ans Westra’s "Washday At The Pa" Republished |work=scoop.co.nz |year=2011 |author=Suite Gallery  |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield''', [[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]], [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]] (2 March 1705 &amp;ndash; 20 March 1793) was a British [[barrister]], politician and judge noted for his reform of [[English law]]. Born to Scottish nobility, he was educated in [[Perth, Scotland]], before moving to London at the age of 13 to take up a place at [[Westminster School]]. He was accepted into [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in May 1723, and graduated four years later. Returning to London from Oxford, he was [[called to the Bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 23 November 1730, and quickly gained a reputation as an excellent barrister.

He became involved in politics in 1742, beginning with his election as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]], and appointment as [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. In the absence of a strong [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], he became the main spokesman for the government in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and was noted for his "great powers of eloquence" and described as "beyond comparison the best speaker" in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="hew13"/&gt; With the promotion of [[Dudley Ryder (judge)|Sir Dudley Ryder]] to [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench|Lord Chief Justice]] in 1754, he became Attorney General, and when Ryder unexpectedly died several months later, he took his place as Chief Justice.

The most powerful British jurist of the century, his decisions reflected the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and moved England on the path to abolishing slavery and the slave trade. He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish the nation as the world leader in industry, finance and trade. He modernised both [[English law]] and the English courts system; he sped up the system for submitting [[Motion (legal)|motions]] and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce time and expense for the parties. For his work in ''[[Carter v Boehm]]'' and ''[[Pillans v Van Mierop]]'', he has been called the founder of English commercial law. He is perhaps best known for his judgment in [[Somerset v Stewart|Somersett's Case]] (1772), where he held that [[slavery]] had no basis in common law and had never been established by [[positive law]] (legislation) in England, and therefore was not binding law (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).&lt;ref&gt;Norman S. Poser, ''Lord Mansfield: Justice in the Age of Reason'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and educations==
Murray was born on 2 March 1705, at [[Scone Palace]] in [[Perthshire]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the fourth son of the [[David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont|5th Viscount of Stormont]] and his wife, Margaret, [[née]] Scott,&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/william-murray,-lord-mansfield|title=William Murray, Lord Mansfield|publisher=[[Westminster Abbey]]|accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of eleven children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.wlu.edu/faculty/history/brockenbrough/mansfield.htm|title=William Murray (Lord Mansfield) 1705–1793|publisher=[[Washington and Lee University]]|accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shaw1"&gt;Shaw (1926) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents were strong supporters of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause,&lt;ref name="hew1"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;Plunkett (1956) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; and his older brother [[James Murray (Jacobite Earl of Dunbar)|James]] followed "[[James Francis Edward Stuart|The Old Pretender]]" into exile.&lt;ref name="fif1"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobite sympathies of Murray's family were glossed over by contemporaries, who claimed that he had been educated at [[King Edward VI School (Lichfield)|Lichfield Grammar School]] with many other members of the English judiciary.&lt;ref name="fif1"/&gt; This was incorrect, as Murray was educated at [[Perth Grammar School]],&lt;ref name="shaw1"/&gt; where he was taught [[Latin language|Latin]], English grammar, and essay writing skills.&lt;ref name="hew1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foss1"/&gt; He later said that this gave him a great advantage at university, as those students educated in England had been taught Greek and Latin, but not how to write properly in English.&lt;ref name="hew2"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; While at Perth Grammar School, it became apparent that Murray was particularly intelligent, and in 1718, his father and older brother [[James Murray (Jacobite Earl of Dunbar)|James]] decided to send him to [[Westminster School]], as James knew the Dean, [[Francis Atterbury]].&lt;ref name="hew2"/&gt; The distance from Perth to London was around {{convert|400|mi|km}}, and the journey took Murray 54 days.&lt;ref name="cr1"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Murray flourished at Westminster and was made a [[King's Scholar]] on 21 May 1719.&lt;ref name="cr1"/&gt;

After an examination in May 1723, Murray was accepted into [[Christ Church, Oxford]], having scored higher in the examination than any other King's Scholar that year.&lt;ref name="foss1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hew3"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted as a [[commoner]] on 15 June 1723, and [[Matriculation|matriculated]] on 18 June; the records say that he came from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] rather than Perth, because the person recording the names of the new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent.&lt;ref name="hew3"/&gt; His older brother James was a [[barrister]] in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish [[Bar association|Bar]] at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive.&lt;ref name="hew4"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the patronage of [[Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley (1673–1733)|Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley]], who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 23 April 1724.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hew4"/&gt;

After [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] died on 11 June 1727, Murray entered and won a competition to write a Latin poem titled "The Death of the King".&lt;ref name="hew5"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His actions were seen as a show of support for the [[House of Hanover]] and the political ''[[status quo]]'', something odd considering the strong [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies of his family.&lt;ref name="hew5"/&gt; He probably did this because, having no private income, he wished to secure patronage to help him advance politically.&lt;ref name="hew5"/&gt; Another entrant was [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], who was a constant rival to Murray until Pitt's death in 1778.&lt;ref name="fif2"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little information about Murray's time at Oxford; it is known that he studied ancient and modern history, became fluent in French and gained a good understanding of [[Roman Law]].&lt;ref name="hew6"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He also became fluent in Latin, translating [[Cicero]]'s works into English and then back into Latin.&lt;ref name="fif2"/&gt; He gained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1727, and travelled to London to train as a barrister.&lt;ref name="hew6"/&gt;

==Family life==
Murray married Elizabeth Finch. They did not have children and took on care of their niece, [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]] (b. 1760), after her mother died. When Mansfield's nephew [[John Lindsay (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Sir John Lindsay]] returned to Britain in 1765 following the [[Seven Years' War]] and his assignment in the West Indies, he brought his natural daughter ''Elizabeth''. Of half African descent, she was born into slavery in 1761, the daughter of Maria Bell, an enslaved woman. Lindsay asked Murray to take on her care and education, and Elizabeth was baptized [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] in 1766 in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/people-and-places/the-slave-trade-and-abolition/slavery-and-justice-exhibition-at-kenwood-house/ ''Slavery and Justice Exhibition at Kenwood House''], English Heritage, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the English bar==
Murray's first contact when he moved to London was William Hamilton, a Scottish-born barrister who was said to be the first Scot to practise at the English Bar, and one of the few people who was qualified to act as a barrister in both England and Scotland.&lt;ref name="hew7"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton had been one of Murray's sponsors when he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1724, and when Murray came to London, Hamilton helped find him a set of [[chambers (law)|chambers]] at No. 1 Old Square.&lt;ref name="hew7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fif3"/&gt; At this time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be [[called to the Bar]] was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward.&lt;ref name="hew8"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, most of Murray's practical training came from reading the papers in Hamilton's chambers and listening to [[Robert Raymond, 1st Baron Raymond|Lord Raymond]] speak in court,&lt;ref name="hew8"/&gt; along with tutoring by [[Thomas Denison]] on how to write [[Special pleader|special pleadings]].&lt;ref name="fif3"/&gt; Murray also studied various texts, including the French ''Ordinance de la Marine'' (a predecessor to the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic Commercial Code]]), the works of [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]] and [[Thomas de Littleton|Littleton]] and "crabbed and uncouth compositions" on [[municipal law]].&lt;ref name="fif3"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray was called to the Bar on 23 November 1730, taking a set of chambers at 5 King's Bench Walk.&lt;ref name="hew8"/&gt; He was introduced to [[Alexander Pope]] around this time, and through his friendship met members of the aristocracy, some of whom later became his clients, including [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]].&lt;ref name="hew8"/&gt; Pope also taught him [[orator]]y, which helped him enormously in court.&lt;ref name="hew8"/&gt; His first two cases were in the English Court of Sessions in 1733, where he was led by [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot|Charles Talbot]] and opposed by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]].&lt;ref name="fif4"/&gt; The support of Talbot and Yorke allowed him to gain a respectable practice in the [[Court of Chancery]].&lt;ref name="fif4"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] had merged the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] into one national entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] became the highest court of appeal in both English and Scottish law, and as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the [[Court of Session (Scotland)|Court of Session]] were sent there. To deal with these cases, a barrister had to be familiar with both [[Scottish Law|Scottish]] and [[English law]], and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733.&lt;ref name="p2"&gt;Plunkett (1956) p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hew9"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; His work in ''Moncrieff v Moncrieff'' in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Cowper]] and [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Parker]].&lt;ref name="hew9"/&gt; After ''Moncrieff'', Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.&lt;ref name="hew9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foss2"&gt;Foss (1870) p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elizabeth Finch painting.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth Finch, wife of William Murray]]
In 1737, Murray acted as Counsel for the [[City of Edinburgh]] in the aftermath of the death of [[Captain John Porteous]]. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the execution. Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely.&lt;ref name="hew10"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, and because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's execution.&lt;ref name="hew10"/&gt; When a man attempted to cut Wilson's body down after the execution, Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed.&lt;ref name="hew10"/&gt; Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder, and when the execution was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and [[lynched]] him.&lt;ref name="hew10"/&gt;

As a result, a bill was proposed in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchising]] the city.&lt;ref name="hew11"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the [[House of Lords]], and eventually whittled down the bill so much that by the time it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]].&lt;ref name="hew11"/&gt; In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the [[Freedom of the City]] and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family.&lt;ref name="foss2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hew11"/&gt; Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.&lt;ref&gt;Heward (1979) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 1738, he married Lady Elizabeth Finch, the daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]], at [[Raby Castle]] in [[Durham, England|Durham]].&lt;ref name="hew12"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Mary was married to [[Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham]]. Murray's connection with the Marquess had a positive, significant influence on his future career.&lt;ref name="hew12"/&gt; After a short holiday, Murray returned to his work as a barrister.&lt;ref name="hew12"/&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
Murray had repeatedly refused to become a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]], saying he had no interest in politics.&lt;ref name="hew13"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1742, however, the government of [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]] fell, and Murray's brother-in-law, the [[Daniel Finch, 8th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Nottingham]], became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in the new [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. With this added political influence, Murray hoped to be appointed to a government office, and when [[John Strange (English politician)|Sir John Strange]] resigned as [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], Murray was made a Member of Parliament for [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]] on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as Solicitor General.&lt;ref name="hew13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p2"/&gt;

Although the Solicitor General was the lowest legal appointment, a successful one could be appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], and by custom, the Attorney General was allowed to become [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]] if a vacancy arose.&lt;ref name="hew13"/&gt; Although many barristers were not good politicians, Murray became a successful Member of Parliament, and one noted for his oratorical skills and logical arguments.&lt;ref name="hew13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foss2"/&gt;

In 1745, Murray defended the actions of the government in hiring 16,000 [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverian]] troops to help fight in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name="hew14"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; His argument (that it was the prerogative of the King to decide how a war should be fought, and he should not be second-guessed by politicians with no experience of warfare) defeated the motion to cease employing the Hanoverian troops by 231 votes to 181.&lt;ref name="hew14"/&gt; Murray became popular with both the government and [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] as a result, and in the absence of a strong Attorney General, Murray spoke for the government in most matters.&lt;ref name="hew14"/&gt; In 1747, he helped [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]] write and pass an act to abolish the old hereditary positions in Scotland.&lt;ref name="hew14"/&gt; In 1751 he drafted the government response to an attempt by the King of [[Prussia]] to frustrate neutral shipping, which [[William Scott, 1st Baron Stowell|Lord Stowell]] called "the foundation of the modern law of neutrality", and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] described it as a "résponse sans réplique" (response without a reply).&lt;ref name="fif5"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]], the heir to the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused constitutional chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], as Regent (since the heir apparent, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Princess Augusta]].&lt;ref name="hew15"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity.&lt;ref name="hew15"/&gt; Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not convinced that a council was necessary.&lt;ref name="hew15"/&gt;

On 6 March 1754, the Prime Minister [[Henry Pelham]] died, and this necessitated a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] reshuffle. The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Dudley Ryder (judge)|Sir Dudley Ryder]], became [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], and Murray became Attorney General in his place.&lt;ref name="p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foss2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hew16"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later the [[Master of the Rolls]] died, and Murray was asked to replace him; he declined, however, as he "did not want to leave His Majesty's service".&lt;ref name="hew16"/&gt; After Ryder died unexpectedly on 25 May 1756, however, Murray could not turn down the opportunity, and immediately applied to replace him as Lord Chief Justice.&lt;ref name="p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hew16"/&gt;

He was accepted, and although his appointment delighted Murray, the government was very concerned at the loss of a good Attorney General.&lt;ref name="hew17"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]] offered him the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a [[peerage]].&lt;ref name="hew17"/&gt; It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General.&lt;ref name="hew17"/&gt; Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.&lt;ref name="hew17"/&gt;

This was seen as an excellent result by Murray, who had no interest in politics except as a stepping stone to become a member of the judiciary.&lt;ref name="fif5"/&gt; Murray was not suited to politics, as he was far too calculating and independent of thought to accept any one party's doctrine.&lt;ref name="fif6"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; His Scottish and Jacobite roots also allowed for endless insinuation and controversy&amp;mdash;in 1753 he was accused by the Bishop of Gloucester of "having drunk the health of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] on his knees".&lt;ref name="fif6"/&gt; Although the story was proven to be false, it embarrassed Murray, and was used to taunt him as late as 1770.&lt;ref name="fif6"/&gt; His rivalry with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] highlighted his unsuitability for politics—unlike such other politicians as [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]] and [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Edward Thurlow]], he did not have the temperament to resist "the vehemence of Pitt's invective".&lt;ref name="fif6"/&gt; It was widely felt that he could have become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] after the death of [[Henry Pelham]], but it would have "set [his genius] in a false environment", and he declined all opportunities to return to politics except as Lord Chief Justice.&lt;ref name="fif6"/&gt;

==Lord Chief Justice==
[[File:Mansfield Old.jpg|thumb|left|Murray in his [[Privilege of peerage#Parliament robes|parliamentary robes]] as an Earl, by [[John Singleton Copley]] 1783]]
Anyone wishing to become a judge was required to be a [[Serjeant-at-law]], which Murray was not; as such, he left [[Lincoln's Inn]] to join [[Serjeant's Inn]].&lt;ref name="hew18"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He qualified as a Serjeant-at-law on 8 November 1756, and was sworn in as Lord Chief Justice at the house of the [[Lord Chancellor]] that evening.&lt;ref name="hew18"/&gt; Immediately afterwards he was created Baron Mansfield.&lt;ref name="hew18"/&gt;

On 19 November, he was sworn in as a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Counsellor]].&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/19655?docPos=6|title=Oxford DNB article: Murray, William (subscription needed)|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suspended his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], due to an old custom that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when it was empty. He only served until 8 April, and there is no evidence of his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties.&lt;ref name="hew18"/&gt; He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform===
Mansfield first sat in court on 11 November 1756, and at the time had "a very low estimate of the Common Law of England which he was to administer".&lt;ref&gt;Lowry (1973) p. 605&lt;/ref&gt; The legal system had been put together in the period immediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], and was completely unsuited to the 18th century, when Britain was "the greatest manufacturing and commercial country in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Lowry (1973) p. 606&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield immediately began to reform the way the law and courts worked. One of his first acts as Lord Chief Justice was to change the system for submitting [[Motion (legal)|motions]].&lt;ref name="hew19"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Every day the court was in session, all barristers were invited to submit motions, in order of their seniority as barristers.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; Because they were allowed to submit as many motions as they wanted, by the time junior [[barrister]]s were allowed to submit their motions, it was normally the end of the day.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; This meant that almost all the work went to the senior barristers, who were so overworked that they often did not have time to prepare properly before going to court.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; In addition it meant that work for junior barristers was scarce, hindering their careers.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; Mansfield changed the system so that barristers were allowed to submit only one motion a day, and if not all barristers had been heard by the end of the day, they could continue where they left off the next morning.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt;

At the time it was also traditional for all judgments to be [[Reserved decision|reserved]].&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; Although in a small number of cases this was useful, in the majority of cases it simply made coming to court more expensive and wasted time.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; As soon as Mansfield became Lord Chief Justice, he changed the rules so that, unless the court had doubts over the evidence presented to them, a judgment was to be made immediately.&lt;ref name="hew19"/&gt; This had a far-reaching effect on the English courts. Judges from the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and [[High Court of Justice]] now give reserved judgments in only a minority of cases.&lt;ref&gt;Heward (1979) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; His reforms led to the Court of King's Bench becoming one of the most active courts, at the expense of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], which was described as the "sleepy hollow".&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2002) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercantile law changes===
In the eighteenth century, English [[commercial law|merchant law]] was still based on the ''[[Lex mercatoria]]'', a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading.&lt;ref name="hew20"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries.&lt;ref name="hew20"/&gt; A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.&lt;ref name="hew20"/&gt;

Mansfield made a great effort to bring English merchant law up to the same standards as that of other European nations, defining his position by saying that "the daily negotiations and property of merchants ought not to depend on subtleties and niceties, but upon rules easily learned and easily retained because they are dictates of common sense drawn from the truth of the case".&lt;ref name="hew21"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, the principle was that a merchant was bound by his promises, not just his signed legal documents, while English lawyers maintained that a merchant could only be legally bound by documents that he signed.&lt;ref name="hew21"/&gt; The European principle was based on the assumption of good faith on the part of the merchants, or ''[[uberrima fides]]'', something completely lacking in English law.&lt;ref name="hew21"/&gt; In {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Carter v Boehm|link=Carter v Boehm|reporter=ER|year=1746|num=89|volume=96|firstpage=342|parallelcite=3 Burr 1905}},  Mansfield got a chance to reform the law relating to the assumption of good faith. Carter was the Governor of [[Fort Marlborough]] (now [[Bengkulu]]), which was built by the [[British East India Company]] in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="hew22"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; He took out an insurance policy with Boehm against the fort's being taken by a foreign enemy.&lt;ref name="hew22"/&gt; A witness called Captain Tryon testified that Carter knew the fort was built to resist attacks from natives but not European enemies, and the French were likely to attack. The French did attack, and Boehm refused to fulfil the insurance claim.&lt;ref name="hew22"/&gt;

Mansfield decided in favour of Boehm, saying that Carter had failed his duty of ''uberrima fides''. In his judgment Mansfield said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Insurance is a contract based upon speculation. The special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary.&lt;ref name="hew23"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law,&lt;ref name="hew23"/&gt; and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use ''uberrima fides''), it is still used in insurance contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldjudgmt/jd010118/manife-1.htm|title=House of Lords - Manifest Shipping Company Limited v. Uni-Polaris Shipping Company Limited and Others|publisher=House of Lords Information Office|accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably knows more about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual "good faith," the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher (2008) p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earlier case of {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Pillans &amp; Rose v Van Mierop &amp; Hopkins|link=Pillans v Van Mierop|reporter=ER|year=1765|num=40|volume=97|firstpage=1035|parallelcite=3 Burr 1663}}, Mansfield had tried to challenge the doctrine of [[Consideration in English law|Consideration]].&lt;ref name="hew24"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In English law, "Consideration" is a vital part of the contract; without valid consideration, almost any contract is void.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick (2007) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; But, Mansfield argued in his judgment that it should only be treated as evidence of a contract, not as a vital element.&lt;ref name="hew24"/&gt; Mansfield failed to make clear that he was referring only to consideration in commercial contracts, not general contracts, and as a result his judgment read that consideration was not required for ''any'' contract.&lt;ref name="hew24"/&gt; His judgment has been much criticised by legal academics,&lt;ref name="hew24"/&gt; and was effectively overruled by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Rann v Hughes'' [1778] 7 T. R. 350.

Mansfield also enforced a previous judgement of the Court of King's Bench made in 1645, in which they allowed a special jury of merchants to sit in cases involving commercial law.&lt;ref name="law1"&gt;Lowry (1973) p. 609&lt;/ref&gt; He built up a special corps of these jurymen, some of whom, such as [[Edward Vaux]], became noted experts on commercial law. "Lord Mansfield's jurymen" acted as an effective liaison between the merchants and the courts.&lt;ref name="law1"/&gt; Mansfield was personally a supporter of [[free trade]] who was heavily influenced by [[Roman law]] and ancient Roman and Greek writers such as [[Cicero]] and [[Xenophon]].&lt;ref name="law1"/&gt;

In 1783, Mansfield heard the case of {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Gregson v. Gilbert|link=Gregson v. Gilbert|reporter=ER|year=1783|num=85|volume=99|firstpage=629|parallelcite=3 Doug 232}}, regarding the payment of an insurance claim for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship &amp;mdash; an event now known as the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Mansfield, in summing up the jury's verdict, said "The Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board", and endeavoured to uphold the notion that slaves were property which could be destroyed in situations of "absolute necessity". But, new information was introduced in the case, and he ruled against the owners of the ship. In doing this, he achieved his aim of preventing maritime insurance law from becoming more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Krikler (2007), pp. 36-7, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright law===
Mansfield made another notable judgment in {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Millar v Taylor|link=Millar v Taylor|reporter=ER|year=1769|num=44|volume=98|firstpage=201|parallelcite=4 Burr 2303|date=20 April 1769}}, in relation to copyright law.&lt;ref name="hew25"/&gt; [[Andrew Millar]] was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the publishing rights to [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s poem "[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]". After the term of the exclusive rights granted under the [[Statute of Anne]] expired, Robert Taylor began publishing his own competing publication, which contained Thomson's poem. Mansfield, sitting with three other judges, concluded that despite the Statute of Anne there was a perpetual [[common law copyright]], and therefore that no works can ever be considered [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="hew25"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; This was a massive victory for booksellers and publishers, as it meant that they could effectively make it impossible for new companies to compete, as in the absence of new texts, there was nothing they could print.&lt;ref name="hew25"/&gt; Mansfield's judgment was finally overruled by the House of Lords in ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' in 1774.&lt;ref name="hew25"/&gt;

Mansfield's judgment has been criticised as being unusually short-sighted because he failed to see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers.&lt;ref name="hew25"/&gt; This was one of only a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court.&lt;ref name="penn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/about/history/medallions/mansfield/index.html|title=History of Penn Law - medallions and inscriptions|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=25 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024124321/http://www.law.upenn.edu/about/history/medallions/mansfield/index.html|archive-date=24 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]], he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish (2009) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junius===
In 1695 Parliament failed to renew the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Acts]], and as a result, the press were free to print material attacking the government.&lt;ref name="hew26"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded.&lt;ref name="hew26"/&gt; Despite the freedom of the press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for [[seditious libel]] if they printed material attacking the government.&lt;ref&gt;Heward (1979) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of [[Junius]] were published in the ''[[Public Advertiser]]'', a London newspaper run by [[Henry Sampson Woodfall]].&lt;ref name="hew27"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby|Lord Granby]] and Mansfield. As his letters were wildly popular, the circulation of the ''Public Advertiser'' doubled in just five months.&lt;ref name="hew27"/&gt;

On 19 December 1769, Junius wrote a letter attacking the King, and incensed at this, the government ordered several people to be arrested and tried for seditious libel, including Woodfall for publishing the letters, [[John Almon]] for selling them, and John Miller for republishing them.&lt;ref name="hew27"/&gt; Almon's case was heard at [[Westminster Hall]] by Mansfield and a jury on 2 June 1770. He was found guilty, although it is unclear in what fashion he was punished, if at all.  Woodfall was tried on 13 June 1770, by Mansfield and a jury. While Mansfield believed that the language used was libellous, the jury disagreed, and held that he was "guilty of printing and publishing only", and innocent of seditious libel.&lt;ref name="hew28"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was tried on 13 July 1770, and after six hours of discussion, the jury found him innocent.&lt;ref name="hew28"/&gt; As a result of these two trials, it became clear that no jury would convict a printer for printing these letters, leaving Junius free to continue publishing them.&lt;ref name="hew28"/&gt;

On 14 November 1770, a letter by Junius directed at Mansfield was published by the ''Public Advertiser'' and the ''[[London Evening Post]]'', a newspaper run by John Miller.&lt;ref name="hew29"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Junius attacked Mansfield, first for being Scottish, then for being a lapsed [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], and finally for attempting to suppress the freedom of the press.&lt;ref name="hew29"/&gt; In a response to Junius' letter dated 16 November 1770, Mansfield made the following threat:
:"Sir, if in future you indulge the ill-founded asperity of your Pen, [you] may be called to answer for your Conduct, in a way that may cause you to regret that ever you was born, or, at least, that Nature has given you Abilities, which, if guided by Discretion, would have made you as much a Blessing, as you are now a Curse to Mankind."&lt;ref&gt;William Lord Mansfield, "An Answer to the Letter Signed Junius, in the Public Advertiser of Wednesday, 14 November 1770", (London 1770) 25 (available on eighteenth-century collections online).&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[William de Grey, 1st Baron Walsingham|William de Grey]], advised that the publishers should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, saying that if they failed to respond to Junius, he would become bored and stop writing.&lt;ref name="hew29"/&gt; Mansfield was evidently correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the beginning of 1772.&lt;ref name="hew29"/&gt;

===Somersett's Case===
[[File:FrancisHargrave.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Hargrave]], who represented James Somersett in this case]]
Mansfield is best known for his judgment in [[Somersett's Case]] on the legality of keeping [[slave]]s in England.&lt;ref name="hew30"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foss3"/&gt; The English had been involved in the slave trade since 1553, and by 1768, ships registered in Liverpool, Bristol and London carried more than half the slaves shipped in the world.&lt;ref name="hew30"/&gt; [[James Somersett]] was a slave owned by [[Charles Stewart (customs official)|Charles Stewart]], an American customs officer who sailed to Britain for business, landing on 10 November 1769.&lt;ref name="hew30"/&gt; A few days later Somersett attempted to escape. He was recaptured in November and imprisoned on the ship ''Ann and Mary'', owned by Captain John Knowles and bound for the British colony of [[Jamaica]]. Stewart intended to sell him there.&lt;ref name="hew30"/&gt; However, three people claiming to be Somersett's godparents, John Marlow, Thomas Walkin and Elizabeth Cade, made an application before the Court of King's Bench for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and Captain Knowles was ordered to produce Somersett before the Court of King's Bench, which would determine whether his imprisonment was legal.&lt;ref name="hew30"/&gt;

Mansfield ordered a hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, the case was not heard until 7 February 1772.&lt;ref name="hew30"/&gt; In the meantime, the case had attracted a great deal of attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument.&lt;ref name="hew31"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; An activist layman, [[Granville Sharp]], who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May.&lt;ref name="hew31"/&gt; These lawyers included [[William Davy (lawyer)|William Davy]] [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]], [[John Glynn]] SL,&lt;ref name="vc1"&gt;Van Cleve (2006) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Mansfield]] and [[Francis Hargrave]], who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case.&lt;ref name="hew31"/&gt; Charles Stewart was represented by [[John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton|John Dunning]] and [[James Wallace (British politician)|James Wallace]].&lt;ref name="vc1"/&gt;

On behalf of Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither the common law of England, nor any law made by [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] recognised the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal.&lt;ref name="hew31"/&gt; Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles.&lt;ref name="hew31"/&gt; A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery.&lt;ref name="hew31"/&gt; When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract for the sale of a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.&lt;ref name="hew31"/&gt;

After the attorneys for both sides had given their arguments, Mansfield called a recess, saying that "[the case] required ... [a] consultation ... among the twelve Judges".&lt;ref&gt;Van Cleve (2006) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 22 June 1772 Mansfield gave his judgment, which ruled that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force, and concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only [[positive law]], which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.&lt;ref name="hew32"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was not an end to slavery, as this only confirmed it was illegal to transport a slave out of England and Wales against his will.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 51-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery also persisted in the rest of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="hew32"/&gt; As a result of the reporting of Mansfield's decision, public opinion and some newspapers gave the impression that slavery had been abolished by the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 51-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe that between 14,000 and 15,000 slaves were immediately freed in England, some of whom remained with their masters as paid or unpaid employees.&lt;ref name="hew32"/&gt; However, it is questionable whether that many black people lived in England at the time, and most of them were already free men and women, or were runaway slaves who had evaded the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' London: Open University, 2014), pp. 20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was vague enough to allow Africans to still be hunted and kidnapped in London, Liverpool and Bristol to be sold elsewhere. (Such an incident was recounted by Olaudah Equiano in 1774 in his autobiography, ''An Interesting Narrative'' (1789).)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 51-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansfield believed that his decision meant that slavery continued, because his "[[mulatto]]" great-niece [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] remained a slave in his household, until his 1793 will allowed her to be considered a free woman.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' London: Open University, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; (She had been born into slavery as the illegitimate daughter of his nephew in the West Indies but lived with him and his wife for 30 years.)&lt;ref name="hew32"/&gt; In addition, advertisements from the 1770s show that slaves continued to be bought and sold in England. Mansfield referred to slaves in his judgment in a later case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/rights/slave_free.htm|title=The National Archives - Exhibitions - Black presence - rights|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although slavery was not completely abolished in the British Empire until 1834, Mansfield's decision is considered to have been a significant step in recognising the illegality of slavery.&lt;ref name="hew32"/&gt;

==Lord Mansfield's Rule==
Lord Mansfield's name is frequently mentioned in modern legal settings as the originator of "Lord Mansfield's Rule", in his own words: "...the law of England is clear, that the declarations of a father or mother, cannot be admitted to bastardize the issue born after marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 851 (Fifth Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://njlegallib.rutgers.edu/journals/docs/journal.mb.3.1.110.pdf Recent Cases - Evidence - Divorce - Competency of Spouse to Testify as to Non-Access], ''Mercer Beasley Law Review'' Vol. III, No. 1, January 1934, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/l/lord-mansfields-rule/ Lord Mansfield's Rule] USLegal Legal Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200306025 GN 00306.025 Lord Mansfield Rule] United States Social Security Administration Program Operations Manual System (POMS) Compilation of the Social Security Laws&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1287807 Prohibiting Nonaccess Testimony by Spouses: Does Lord Mansfield's Rule Protect Illegitimates?], ''Michigan Law Review'' Vol. 75, No. 7 (June 1977), pp. 1457–1487&lt;/ref&gt; This quote comes from Mansfield's appellate decision in {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Goodright v Moss|link=|reporter=ER|year=1777|num=38|volume=98|firstpage=1257|pinpoint=592|parallelcite=2 Cowp 591|date=}}. The primary legal question in the case was not this preexisting principle, which applies only to children "born after marriage", but rather whether the child had been born before the marriage. The question was whether statements the child's parents allegedly made before their deaths could be introduced as evidence that the child had been born before their marriage and was thus illegitimate. Mansfield ruled to admit the testimony against the child's legitimacy and grant a new trial. The term "Lord Mansfield's Rule" is often used in a slightly different sense to denote the principle still applied in several jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;[http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200306026 GN 00306.026 State Laws on Applicability of Lord Mansfield Rule], United States Social Security Administration Program Operations Manual System (POMS) Compilation of the Social Security Laws&lt;/ref&gt; that marriage creates a conclusive presumption of a husband's paternity of his wife's child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterschool.ed.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2002/reports/essentials/c8.html "Essentials for Attorneys in Child Support Enforcement"] 3rd. ed. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Support Enforcement; Ch. 8, Section: "Disestablishment of Paternity", at note 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==House of Lords==
After the formation of the [[Fox-North Coalition]], Mansfield agreed to act as [[Speaker of the House of Lords]], taking up his post in February 1783.&lt;ref name="hew33"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the [[East India Bill]], which provoked bitter arguments in both the [[House of Lords]] and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="hew33"/&gt; In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the [[Woolsack]] the next day.&lt;ref name="hew33"/&gt; The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.&lt;ref name="hew33"/&gt;

Mansfield had been made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, on 31 October 1776. He attended the Lords as Lord Speaker, and the last record of him attending (other than his presence at the state opening of Parliament on 23 March 1784)&lt;ref name="hew34"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; was in December 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
[[File:Kenwood House front with extensions 2005.jpg|thumb|Kenwood House]]
Despite failing health, Mansfield refused to officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] was opposed to the appointment of Mansfield's protégé [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]] to the position after Mansfield resigned.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foss4"&gt;Foss (1870) p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the time instead suggested [[Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon|Lloyd Kenyon]] as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) in the hope that the government would fall before he was forced to retire.&lt;ref name="hew35"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.&lt;ref name="p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hew35"/&gt;

Mansfield spent the remainder of his life at [[Kenwood House]].&lt;ref name="hew36"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his time was spent maintaining the grounds. In the summer, he was visited by groups of [[barrister]]s who informed him of the goings-on at court.&lt;ref name="hew36"/&gt; On 1 August 1792 he was made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref&gt;Heward (1979) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 1793, he complained of feeling sleepy, and although he recovered the next day, by 12 March, he was again complaining of a need for sleep.&lt;ref name="hew36"/&gt; He went to bed early and remained asleep until 18 March, when he finally died.&lt;ref name="hew36"/&gt; His body was buried in the North [[Transept]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="west"/&gt; Mansfield left a large amount of money after his death, including land worth £26,000. He gave £2,000 to [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]].&lt;ref&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[English law]] saw significant changes during Mansfield's career.&lt;ref name="hew37"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; As Lord Chief Justice, Mansfield had done much to reform the way the courts worked, making it easier for people to gain access to legal aid, and also making the process much less expensive.&lt;ref name="hew37"/&gt; He was also noted for his insistence that [[equity (law)|equity]] should be applied by all courts, not just the [[Court of Chancery]], a view that provoked much disagreement during his lifetime, but was eventually confirmed by Parliament in the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]], which allowed all courts to take cases of equity.&lt;ref name="hew37"/&gt; He also established the principle that rather than blindly following precedent, judges should seek to find loopholes in rules that were no longer applicable, something that later received the support of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], who said, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is more revolting still if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past."&lt;ref name="hew38"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He made his judgements on the principle that "as the usages of society alter, the law must adapt itself to the various situations of mankind", leading [[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] to describe him as "one of the boldest of judicial spirits".&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2002) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sir [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]], whom Mansfield tried to make [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench|Lord Chief Justice]] after his retirement.]]
His most important contributions were to commercial, merchant and common law.&lt;ref name="hew38"/&gt; Mansfield spent much time bringing the law of England on par with that of other countries, particularly in cases such as ''[[Pillans v Van Mierop|Pillans &amp; Rose v Van Mierop &amp; Hopkins]]'' [1765] 3 Burr 1663, and ''[[Carter v Boehm]]'' [1766] 3 Burr 1905.&lt;ref name="hew38"/&gt; As a result of his work, he was described by a later judge as "the founder of the commercial law of this country".&lt;ref name="hew25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foss3"&gt;Foss (1870) p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

He was, however, criticised for his resistance to the [[freedom of the press]] and his refusal to go against the King,&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; as well as for blatant [[nepotism]]&amp;mdash;highlighted by his attempts to have [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]] made [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench|Lord Chief Justice]] after his retirement.&lt;ref name="foss1"/&gt; He was also criticised as a politician for his support of a government antagonistic to the colonies; in 1829 [[John Quincy Adams]] described him as "more responsible for the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] than any other man".&lt;ref&gt;Waterman (1934) p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[John Chipman Gray]] have questioned his reputation as a universally successful judge, saying that "the reputation of Lord Mansfield as a commercial lawyer should not blind us to the fact that he was not equally great in the law of [[real property]]".&lt;ref&gt;Waterman (1934) p. 557&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion over Mansfield's intention in his ruling in [[Somerset's Case]] is mixed, with the current prevailing view being that he did not intend to free the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Van Cleve (2006) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment was particularly narrow, as it ruled only that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force, not that slaves who came to England were emancipated. This is seen as particularly telling because this was the primary argument of Davy and Hargrave.&lt;ref name="vc2"&gt;Van Cleve (2006) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; If Murray had wanted to emancipate the slaves completely, there were various bits of judicial precedent he could have based his decision on, such as ''[[Smith v Gould]]'' or ''[[Shanley v Harvey]]'', but he did not.&lt;ref name="vc2"/&gt; Various comments he made before and during the case also suggest that complete emancipation was not his intent; in a preliminary judgment he said that "the setting 14,000 or 15,000 men at once free loose by a solemn opinion, is much disagreeable in the effect it threatens”, which one modern legal scholar interprets as indicative of his reluctance to make a decision for fear of economic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (2006) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Various comments he made to Thomas Hutchinson in private letters, along with his comments about the ''Somersett'' decision in [[R v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton]] also suggest that emancipation was not his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ceve (2006) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785, Lord Mansfield expressed the view in R v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton that his ruling in the Somerset case decided only that a slave could not be forcibly removed from England against his will.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hSdFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=1785+%22Lord+Mansfield%22+%22Thames+Ditton%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aKrYY0iW3Z&amp;sig=PdIkoOQAQKxSFXPoX2U5pdciSpU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=1785%20%22Lord%20Mansfield%22%20%22Thames%20Ditton%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansfield's marriage to Lady Finch was barren. His title, which succeeds to this day, passed to his nephew, [[David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield]].&lt;ref name=west/&gt;

==Honours==
Mansfield is immortalised in [[St Stephen's Hall]], where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.&lt;ref name=ssstat&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/ parliament.uk: "Architecture of the Palace - St Stephen's Hall"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=illus&gt;''The Illustrated London News,'' illustration accompanying "The New Houses of Parliament", 2 Feb 1856, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 1801 a marble monument to him by [[John Flaxman]] was installed in [[Westminster Abbey]]; it shows Murray flanked by the personifications of [[Wisdom]] and [[Lady Justice|Justice]],&lt;ref name="west"/&gt; with an inscription that reads:

{{Quote|"'Here Murray long enough his country’s pride is now no more than [[Cicero|Tully]] or than [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Hyde]]'. Foretold by [[Alexander Pope|Ar. Pope]] and fulfilled in the year 1793 when William Earl of Mansfield died full of years and of honours: of honours he declined many: those which he accepted were the following: he was appointed Solicitor General 1742, Attorney General 1754, Lord Chief Justice and Baron Mansfield 1756, Earl of Mansfield 1776. From the love which he bore to the place of his early education, he desired to be buried in this cathedral (privately) and would have forbidden that instance of human vanity, the erecting a monument to his memory, but a sum which with the interest has amounted to two thousand five hundred pounds was left for that purpose by A. Bailey Esqr. of Lyon’s Inn, which at least well meant mark of esteem he had no previous knowledge or suspicion of and had no power to prevent being executed. He was the fourth son of David, fifth Viscount Stormont, and married the Lady Elizabeth Finch, daughter to Daniel, Earl of Nottingham by whom he had no issue. Born at Scone 2nd March 1704. Died at Kenwood 20th March 1793."&lt;ref name="west"/&gt;

*Mansfield has been portrayed as a character several times in television and film - in ''The Fight Against Slavery'' (1975) by [[John Richmond (actor)|John Richmond]], ''The British'' (2012) by [[Timothy West]], ''[[Belle (2013 film)|Belle]]'' (2013) by [[Tom Wilkinson]] and ''The Scandalous Lady W'' (2015) by [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0516705 "Lord Mansfield (Character)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
[[File:Cameo of William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Cameo of William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]]
Mansfield was noted at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|Bar]], in Parliament, and while sitting as a judge, for his eloquence and skill as a speaker; in particular [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] described him as "beyond comparison the best speaker" in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="hew13"/&gt; He was also a hard worker; he would sometimes do court paperwork himself, as well as do his judicial duties, in an attempt to speed up the legal process.&lt;ref name="hew39"&gt;Heward (1979) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

He was summarised by [[Gareth Jones (lawyer)|Gareth Jones]] as "Conservative, urbane, silver-tongued, energetic, cultivated and well read; a highly imaginative lawyer who looked to reason and was not overawed by the legacy of the past".&lt;ref&gt;Jones (198) p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], a contemporary, said that "he had some superiors in force, some equals in persuasion; but in ''insinuation'' he was without a rival. He excelled in the statement of a case. This, of itself, was worth the argument of any other man".&lt;ref&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The comment by [[Samuel Johnson]] that "Much may be made of a [Scotsman], if he be caught young" was directed at Mansfield,&lt;ref&gt;Jones (198) p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; and Johnson also described him as "more than a mere lawyer", while [[Edward Coke]], who is considered one of the most important lawyers in the history of English law, was "only a lawyer".&lt;ref&gt;Jones (198) p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other barristers, Mansfield was noted for always keeping a cool head and being "prudent to the point of timidity".&lt;ref name="fif5"/&gt; He was criticised for being "moderate and dispassionate", unlike more aggressive barristers such as [[Edward Coke]]; when asked about this he replied that "I would not have made Sir Edward Coke's speech to gain all Sir Edward Coke's estates and all his reputation".&lt;ref name="fif5"/&gt; There are conflicting reports about his temperament and attitude as a judge; [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] described him as "a very bad judge, proud, haughty to the Bar and hasty in his determinations", and [[Charles Yorke]] said he was "offensive and unpopular".&lt;ref name="fif7"&gt;Fifoot (1936) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Both opinions are suspect, however; Pitt's because he was a constant rival to Mansfield and Yorke's because he was attempting to beat Mansfield to the position of [[Lord Chancellor]] at the time.&lt;ref name="fif7"/&gt; [[Edward Foss]] said that "there has never been a judge more venerated by his contemporaries, nor whose memory is regarded with greater respect and affection", and described him as "the great oracle of law".&lt;ref name="foss1"&gt;Foss (1870) p. 469&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansfield has been called "the legal genius of his generation",&lt;ref name="les"/&gt; and compared favourably with [[Joseph Story]], a judge of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] noted for his brilliance.&lt;ref name="les"&gt;Leslie (1957) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Other Americans such as Julian S. Waterman, the founder of the [[University of Arkansas School of Law]], described him as "not only the greatest common law judge but the greatest judge in Anglo-American legal history", while Joseph Story himself said that Mansfield "broke down the narrow barrier of the common law, redeemed it from feudal selfishness and barbarity" and that "he was one of those great men raised up by Providence, at a fortunate moment, to effect a salutary revolution in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Waterman (1934) p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's studies''' is an academic field that draws on [[Feminism|feminist]] and interdisciplinary methods in order to place women’s lives and experiences at the center of study, while examining [[Social constructionism|social and cultural constructs]] of [[gender]]; systems of privilege and oppression; and the relationships between power and gender as they intersect with other identities and social locations such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Social class|socio-economic class]], and [[Disability studies|disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions: classic and contemporary readings|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M. |last2=Lee|first2=Janet|isbn=978-0078027000|edition=Sixth|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular theories within the field of women's studies include [[feminist theory]], [[standpoint theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[multiculturalism]], [[transnational feminism]], [[social justice]], [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] studies, [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[biopolitics]], [[materialism]]s, and embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0190872823|oclc=1002116432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research practices and methodologies associated with women's studies include [[ethnography]], [[autoethnography]], [[focus group]]s, surveys, community-based research, discourse analysis, and reading practices associated with [[critical theory]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist research practice: a primer|last=Hesse-Biber|first=Sharlene Nagy|isbn=9781412994972|edition=Second|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|oclc=838201827|date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field researches and critiques societal norms of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and other [[social inequalities]].

== History ==
In 1956 [[Australian]] feminist Madge Dawson took up a lectureship in the Department of Adult Education at [[Sydney University]] and began researching and teaching on the status of women. Dawson's course, "Women in a Changing World," focused on the socio-economic and political status of women in western Europe, becoming one of the first women's studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/30/1059480406739.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first accredited women's studies course in the U.S was held in 1969 at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDF5Ic-DL1wC&amp;pg=PA388|title=The Encyclopedia of Stress and Stress-related Diseases|last=Kahn|first=Ada P.|publisher=Facts on File|year=2006|isbn=978-0816059379|edition=2nd|page=388|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of intense organizing of women's [[consciousness raising group]]s, rallies, petition circulating, and operating unofficial or experimental classes and presentations before seven committees and assemblies, the first women's studies program in the United States was established in 1970 at [[San Diego State University|San Diego State College]] (now [[San Diego State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal|last=Salper|first=Roberta|date=November 2011|title=San Diego State 1970: The Initial Year of the Nation's First Women's Studies Program|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/issues/vol-30-39/37-3.html|journal=[[Feminist Studies]]|volume=37|issue=3|pages=658–682|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/wsweb/|title=SDSU Women's Studies Department|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918042623/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/wsweb/|archivedate=18 September 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with [[Women's liberation movement|National Women's Liberation Movement]], students and community members created the AD HOC Committee for women's studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womensstudies.sdsu.edu/history.htm|title=History :: Department of Women's Studies at San Diego State University|website=womensstudies.sdsu.edu|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The second women's studies program in the United States was established in 1971 at Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas. It was mostly formed though efforts by women in the English department, administration and community.&lt;ref&gt;Chinyere Okafor citing from The Center for Women's Studies' papers at WSU&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974 SDSU faculty members began a nationwide campaign for the integration of the department. At the time, these actions and the field were extremely political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boxer|first=Marilyn J.|date=Fall 2002|title=Women's studies as women's history|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Women's Studies then and Now|volume=30|issue=3–4|pages=42–51|jstor=40003241|postscript=.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these early days of women's studies, before formalized departments and programs, many courses were advertised unofficially around campuses and taught by women faculty members—for free—in addition to their established teaching and administrative responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Triumphs, Controversies, and Change: 1970s to the Twenty-First Century|title=The Evolution of American Women's Studies: Reflections on Triumphs, Controversies, and Change|last=Ginsberg|first=Alice E.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60579-4|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, as in many cases today, faculty who teach in women's studies often hold faculty appointments in other departments on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming Scholarship: Why Women's and Gender Studies Students Are Changing Themselves and the World|last=Berger|first=Michele Tracy|last2=Radeloff|first2=Cheryl|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-83653-1|location=New York|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scholarly journal in interdisciplinary women's studies, ''Feminist Studies'', began publishing in 1972.&lt;ref name="FSAboutUs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/aboutfs/history.html|title=History|publisher=Feminist Studies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Women's Studies Association]] (of the United States) was established in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/content.asp?pl=19&amp;contentid=19|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s saw the growth and development of women's studies courses and programs across universities in the U.S., while the field continued to grapple with backlash from both conservative groups and concerns from those within the women's movement about the white, [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]], and [[heterosexual privilege]] of those in the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=16|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political aims of the feminist movement that compelled the formation of women's studies found itself at odds with the institutionalized academic feminism of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Studies on the Edge|last=Wiegman|first=Robyn|chapter=Feminism, Institutionalism, and the Idiom of Failure|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8223-4274-8|editor-last=Scott|editor-first=Joan Wallach|location=Durham|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "woman" as a concept continued to be expanded, the exploration of social constructions of gender led to the field's expansion into both gender studies and sexuality studies.

The field of women's studies continued to grow during the 1990s and into the 2000s with the expansion of universities offering majors, minors, and certificates in women's studies, gender studies, and feminist studies. The first Ph.D. program in Women's Studies was established at [[Emory University]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/program_pages/gender.html|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there were 16 institutions offering a Ph.D. in Women's Studies in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwsa.org/AF_institution_Directory.asp|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisguide.com/|title=Artemis Guide to Women's Studies in the U.S|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, UC Santa Cruz (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/|title=UC Santa Cruz – Feminist Studies|website=feministstudies.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Kentucky-Lexington (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gws.as.uky.edu/phd-program-gws|title=PHD Program {{!}} Gender &amp; Women's Studies|website=gws.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stony Brook University (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wgss/|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|website=www.stonybrook.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oregon State University (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/school-language-culture-and-society/wgss/phd-women-gender-and-sexuality-studies|title=PhD in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies! {{!}} College of Liberal Arts {{!}} Oregon State University|website=liberalarts.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced a Ph.D. in the field.

==  Theoretical traditions and research methods  ==
[[File:Students of Women and Gender Studies University of Haifa on training in writing in Wikipedia (1).jpg|thumb|300px|Students of Women and Gender Studies [[University of Haifa]]]]
Early women's studies courses and curricula were often driven by the question "where are the women?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's Studies – The Early Years: When Sisterhood Was Powerful|last=Rothenberg|first=Paula|title=The Evolution of American Women's Studies|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60579-4|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|location=New York|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, as more women were present in higher education as both students and faculty, questions arose about the male-centric nature of most courses and curricula. Women faculty in traditional departments such as history, English, and philosophy began to offer courses with a focus on women. Drawing from the women's movement's notion that "the personal is political," courses also began to develop around sexual politics, women's roles in society, and the ways in which women's personal lives reflect larger power structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=69|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, scholars of women's studies have taken [[post-modern]] approaches to understanding gender as it intersects with race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, age, and (dis)ability to produce and maintain power structures within society. With this turn, there has been a focus on language, subjectivity, and social hegemony, and how the lives of subjects, however they identify, are constituted. At the core of these theories is the notion that however one identifies, gender, sex, and sexuality are not intrinsic, but are socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/Files/Resources/WS_Integrative_Learning_Levine.pdf|title=Questions for A New Century: Women's Studies and Integrative Learning|last=Levin|first=Amy K.|date=2007|website=www.nwsa.org|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major theories employed in women's studies courses include [[feminist theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[standpoint theory]], [[transnational feminism]], and [[social justice]]. Research practices associated with women's studies place women and the experiences of women at the center of inquiry through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Feminist researchers acknowledge their role in the production of knowledge and make explicit the relationship between the researcher and the research subject.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Feminist theory ===

[[Feminist theory]] refers to the body of writing that works to address gender discrimination and disparities, while acknowledging, describing, and analyzing the experiences and conditions of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist theory: a reader|last1=Kolmar|first1=Wendy K.|last2=Bartkowski|first2=Frances|year=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=9780073512358|edition=4th|location=New York|page=2|oclc=800352585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists and writers such as [[bell hooks]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir,]] [[Patricia Hill Collins]], and [[Alice Walker]] added to the field of feminist theory with respect to the ways in which race and gender mutually inform the experiences of women of color with works such as ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' (hooks), ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'' (Walker), and ''[[Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment|Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment]]'' (Collins). Alice Walker coined the term [[womanism]] to situate black women's experiences as they struggle for social change and liberation, while simultaneously celebrating the strength of black women, their culture, and their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Womanist reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|last=Phillips|first=Layli|isbn=9780415954112|location=New York|oclc=64585764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Hill Collin's contributed the concept of the "[[matrix of domination]]" to feminist theory, which reconceptualizes race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression that shape experiences of privilege and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment|first=Patricia Hill|last=Collins|isbn=9780415964722|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=245597448|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===

Associated with the third wave of feminism, [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]]'s theory of [[intersectionality]] is an approach to understanding how institutional structures mutually shape an individual's gendered, racial, and social status. Intersectional theory posits that these relationships must be considered in conversation with each other in order to understand hierarchies of power and privilege and they ways in which they manifest in an individual's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carastathis|first=Anna|date=2014-05-01|title=The Concept of Intersectionality in Feminist Theory|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=304–314|doi=10.1111/phc3.12129|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standpoint theory ===

[[Standpoint theory]] developed in the 1980s as way of critically examining the production of knowledge and its resulting effects on practices of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The feminist standpoint theory reader: intellectual and political controversies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|last=Harding|first=Sandra G.|isbn=978-0415945004|location=New York|page=2|oclc=51668081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory operates from the idea that knowledge is socially situated and, as a result, underrepresented groups and minorities have historically been ignored or marginalized when it comes to the production of knowledge. Emerging from Marxist thought, standpoint theory argues for analysis that challenges the authority of political and social "truths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hekman|first=Susan|date=1997|title=Truth and Method: Feminist Standpoint Theory Revisited|jstor=3175275|journal=Signs|volume=22|issue=2|pages=341–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transnational feminist theory ===

[[Transnational feminism]] is concerned with the flow of social, political, and economic equality of women and men across borders, particularly in response to globalization, neoliberalism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women worldwide: transnational feminist perspectives on women|last=Moghadam|first=Valentine M.|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Janet|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Susan M.|year=|isbn=9780073512297|location=New York, NY|pages=15|chapter=Transnational Feminisms|oclc=436028205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies began incorporating transnational feminist theory into its curricula as a way to disrupt and challenge the ways knowledge is prioritized, transmitted, and circulates in the field and academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking women's and gender studies|last=Parisi|first=Laura|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|editor1-last=Orr|editor1-first=Catherine Margaret|editor2-last=Braithwaite|editor2-first=Ann|editor3-last=Lichtenstein|editor3-first=Diane Marilyn|isbn=9780415808316|location=New York|pages=326|chapter=Transnational|oclc=738351967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===

Since its inception and connection with the women's movement, activism has been a foundation of women's studies. Increasingly [[social justice]] has become a key component of women's studies courses, programs, and departments. Social justice theory is concerned with the fight for just communities, not on the individual level, but for the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements|last1=Capeheart|last2=Milovanovic|first2=Dragan|first1=Loretta|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813541686|location=Piscataway|page=2|oclc=437192947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies students engage in social justice projects, although some scholars and critics are concerned about requiring students to engage in mandated activism or social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jennifer L. |first2=Susanne |last2=Luhmann |title=Social Justice for (University) Credit? The Women's and Gender Studies Practicum in the Neoliberal University. (Report) |journal=Resources for Feminist Research |volume=34 |issue=3–4 |year=2016 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Pedagogies  ==
In most institutions, women's studies courses employ [[feminist pedagogy]] in a triad model of equal parts research, theory, and praxis. The decentralization of the professor as the source of knowledge is often fundamental to women's studies classroom culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrewsbury|first=Carolyn M.|date=Fall 1987|title=What is feminist pedagogy?|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Feminist Pedagogy|volume=15|issue=3–4|pages=6–14|jstor=40003432|ref=harv}}

Women's studies courses focus on a variety of topics such as media literacy, sexuality, race and ethnicity, history involving women, queer theory, multiculturalism and other courses closely related. Faculty incorporate these components into classes across a variety of topics, including popular culture, women in the economy, reproductive and environmental justice, and women's health across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Scholarship|last1=Berger|first1=Michele Tracy|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|edition=Second|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's studies programs are involved in social justice work and often design curricula that are embedded with theory and activism outside of the classroom setting. Some women's studies programs offer internships that are community-based allowing students the opportunity to experience how institutional structures of privilege and oppression directly affects women's lives. Women's studies curricula often encourage students to participate in [[service-learning]] activities in addition to discussion and reflection upon course materials. However, [[Daphne Patai]], from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has criticized this aspect of women's studies programs, arguing that they place politics over education, stating that "the strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions."&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/fem_overhaul.html|title=Why Not A Feminist Overhaul of Higher Education?|last=Patai|first=Daphne|date=January 23, 1998|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since women's studies students analyze identity markers such as gender, race, class, and sexuality, this often results in dissecting institutionalized structures of power. As a result of these pedagogies, women's studies students leave university with a toolset to make social change and do something about power inequalities in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bubriski |first1=Anne |last2=Semaan |first2=Ingrid |year=2009 |title=Activist Learning vs. Service Learning in a Women's Studies Classroom |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women's studies scholars include [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Patricia Hill Collins]], [[bell hooks]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Adrienne Rich]], and [[Barbara Ransby]].

'''Đorđe Branković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Ђорђе Бранковић}}, {{lang-la|Georgius Brankovich}}, {{lang-ro|Gheorghe Brancovici}}; 1645&amp;nbsp;– 19 December 1711) was a [[Transylvania]]n Serb diplomat, writer, and self-proclaimed descendant of the medieval Serbian [[Branković dynasty]]. He served as the agent representing the ruler of Transylvania at the [[Ottoman Porte]]. In 1680, he moved to [[Wallachia]], whose ruler sent him as an emissary to the [[Habsburg Empire|Habsburg Emperor]] [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold&amp;nbsp;I]] in 1688. That year, the emperor conferred the title of [[Imperial Count]] on Branković. After Habsburg troops captured parts of Serbia from the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Great Turkish War]], Branković attempted to restore the medieval Serbian state with him as its hereditary ruler. His venture failed in its inception, and Habsburg authorities arrested him in 1689. He lived on as a captive in [[Vienna]] and [[Cheb]], though he was not held in a prison. He wrote the ''Slavo-Serbian Chronicles'', which was influential in the development of early modern Serbian historiography.

==Life==
===Transylvanian phase===
Đorđe Branković was born in 1645 in the town of [[Ineu]] ({{lang-sr|Jenopolje}}) in [[Arad County]], at the western border of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], which was a [[Vassal States (Ottoman Empire)|vassal state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=rad51&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 51–54&lt;/ref&gt; The Branković family owned large estates, and it had produced several notable soldiers and ecclesiastics since the end of the 16th century, becoming the most prominent among the Serb families of Arad County.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Čuljak 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Đorđe, who was the youngest of Jovan Branković's four sons, lost his father and two brothers to the plague when he was less than ten years old. His mother then became a nun and retreated into a monastery. Đorđe was taken to raise by his brother Simeon, who became the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[protopope]] of Ineu.&lt;ref name=rad51/&gt; In December 1656, Simeon was consecrated Orthodox [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Transylvania; he changed his name to Sava when he took his monastic vows. Metropolitan Sava&amp;nbsp;II moved to the capital of the principality, [[Gyulafehérvár]], taking his brother Đorđe with him.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 55–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Sava developed the idea that the Brankovićs of Arad County descended from the medieval [[Branković dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty in Serbia before the Ottoman conquest. He passed this idea to Đorđe, with whom it would remain all his life. The metropolitan planned a diplomatic and political career for his younger brother, who learned Turkish, Hungarian, Romanian, and Latin. In 1663, during the government of Prince [[Michael&amp;nbsp;I Apafi]], Đorđe was employed as [[dragoman]] for the ''kapı kâhyası'' (agent) representing the ruler of Transylvania at the [[Ottoman Porte]].&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 73–78&lt;/ref&gt; After the agent died in December 1663, Đorđe served as the acting ''kapı kâhyası'' until October 1664.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 88–95&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at the Porte until 1667, participating in several diplomatic missions.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 98–117&lt;/ref&gt; In 1668, Metropolitan Sava&amp;nbsp;II travelled to the [[Russian Empire]] accompanied by eleven men, Đorđe Branković among them. The metropolitan had an audience with [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexis]], and informed him that the Orthodox Serbs, Bulgarians, and Wallachians were ready to liberate themselves from the Turks, with Russia's military help.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 128–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he returned from Russia, Branković was again in the service of Prince Apafi, who entrusted him with diplomatic and intelligence assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 145–148&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the Transylvanian ''kapı kâhyası'' at the Porte from 1675 to 1677.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 205–210&lt;/ref&gt; In 1680, Metropolitan Sava&amp;nbsp;II was [[Canon law|uncanonically]] deposed and imprisoned, because he had contacts with political opponents of Prince Apafi. Sava also had a fierce enemy in the [[Calvinist]] [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent]] of Transylvania, who saw him as an obstacle towards the intended conversion of the Orthodox into Calvinism. The latter denomination was dominant in Transylvania. Đorđe Branković was briefly imprisoned for having the same contacts of which his brother was accused.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wallachian phase===
After his release from prison, Branković left Transylvania and moved to [[Bucharest]], the capital of [[Wallachia]], another vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. He kept close relations with the lord of Wallachia, [[Șerban Cantacuzino]],&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; who persuaded Apafi to release Sava from prison. Sava died shortly afterwards, at the end of 1681.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Čuljak 1998, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of Apafi's opponents in Transylvania, Count Ladislaus Csáky, kept contacts with Cantacuzino and Branković. In 1683, when the [[Great Turkish War]] was about to start, Cantacuzino sent him to the [[Habsburg Empire|Habsburg Emperor]] [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in [[Vienna]]. Csáky communicated to the Emperor that Cantacuzino and Branković were willing to become his allies. Csáky also gave to the emperor a letter in which Đorđe Branković presented himself as a descendant of the Branković dynasty, and requested the title of Hungarian [[Baron]], which had been born by members of the dynasty. On 7&amp;nbsp;June 1683, Branković was given the requested title, and recognized as the hereditary lord of [[Herzegovina]], [[Syrmia]], and Ineu.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 262–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallachia was predominantly Orthodox, as was its ruler Cantacuzino. Letters from Cantacuzino and Serbian Patriarch [[Arsenije&amp;nbsp;III Čarnojević]] were sent in 1688 from Bucharest to the Russian Tsar. He was called to intervene militarily in the Balkans, to liberate the Orthodox from the Turks, and to prevent the Habsburgs from forcibly converting the Orthodox into Catholicism if they succeeded in taking the Balkans from the Turks. The Serbian Patriarch wrote his letter after Branković informed him through an emissary about Cantacuzino's intention to contact the tsar. The emissary brought from Čarnojević an additional letter, specifically for Branković, in which the patriarch confirmed Branković's descent from the Serbian dynasty. The latter paper had most likely been written by Branković himself, and the patriarch only put his signature on it.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 315–18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Becoming a count===
[[File:Count Đorđe Branković, Franz Schilhabel, 1849.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait by Franz Schilhabel, {{circa|1849}}]]
At the end of May 1688, Cantacuzino sent Đorđe Branković and two more emissaries to Emperor Leopold, to relate his support for the Christian fight against the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Preparing for this journey, Branković composed a [[Petition|memorial]] which he would present at the Habsburg court. The memorial stated that leaders of peoples of the "Illyrian Kingdom"—Bosnians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Rascians, Thracians, Albanians, and Macedonians—proclaimed Đorđe&amp;nbsp;II Branković, a descendant of "[[Đurađ Branković|Đorđe&amp;nbsp;I Branković]]", as their hereditary ruler. The Illyrian Kingdom, which would be reestablished after the expulsion of the Turks from Europe, would include most of the Balkans and some lands belonging to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Branković should be raised to the rank of [[Imperial Prince]].&lt;ref name=rad336&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 336–49&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all, the text of the memorial was confused and unrealistic. However, the Habsburg Empire was at that time in a difficult position: it was about to wage a war with France, in addition to the Great Turkish War; and its finances were greatly diminished. Leopold's counsellors regarded that Branković could be used to motivate the Serbs south of the Danube and Sava Rivers to join the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Army]] after its deeper advances into the Ottoman Empire. Any help was welcome, and the [[Banat]] Serbs had recently proved helpful.&lt;ref name=rad336/&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;September 1688, two weeks after [[Belgrade]] was [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|captured from the Turks]], Branković was given the title of [[Imperial Count]].&lt;ref name=rad352&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 352–54&lt;/ref&gt; He was referred to in Latin as ''Comes Georgius Brankovich de Podgoricza''.&lt;ref&gt;Freiherr von Czoernig 1857, [http://texts01.archive.org/stream/ethnographiedero03czoe#page/76/mode/1up p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt; His alleged ancestor, [[Vuk Branković]], was thought to hail from the town of [[Podgorica]] in Montenegro.&lt;ref name=rad352/&gt;

===Towards Serbia===
Count Branković went to Wallachia and set about gathering men whom he would lead against the Turks. He proclaimed Captain Novak Petrović from Banat as the commander of his army. With his help, he gathered 800 armed men, with whom he went to the town of [[Orșova]] on the left bank of the Danube, across the area of [[Kladovo]] in eastern Serbia. Serb insurgents were already active in western and central Serbia anticipating an offensive of the Imperial Army. Branković intended to raise an insurgency in eastern Serbia. On 12&amp;nbsp;June 1689, "Đorđe&amp;nbsp;II" issued a proclamation to his alleged subjects, the "peoples of eastern and northern [[Illyria]], [[Thrace]], [[Moesia]], and other countries", calling them to rise up against the Turks. He sent two monks across the Danube to spread his proclamation, and to call Serb elders to muster around him in Orșova. The monks were well received by the elders, but none of them appeared in Orșova; Branković was practically unknown among the Serbs outside Transylvania. After this failure, Branković went to a monastery in Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 377–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mean time, counsellors of Emperor Leopold learned of the correspondence between Cantacuzino, Čarnojević, and the Russian Tsar. The Habsburgs were apprehensive of a Russian involvement in the Balkans, and the role which Branković played in that correspondence made them suspicious of him. They then checked historical records and concluded that his claim of descent was unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 371–75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]], who was in command of the Habsburg troops fighting in Serbia, gathered information on Branković's activities, and he concluded that they were against the interests of the Empire. In a letter dated 5 August 1689, Emperor Leopold instructed the Margrave to coax Branković into visiting him, and, if necessary, to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 387–92&lt;/ref&gt; On 24&amp;nbsp;September, Louis William captured [[Niš]] with the help of Serb insurgents under Pavle Nestorović Deak, and then he returned toward the Danube.

===Captivity===
[[File:Brankovićeve Hronike (stranica).png|thumb|A page from the manuscript of the ''Slavo-Serbian Chronicles'' written by Branković during his captivity]]
Branković, who was still staying at the monastery, was invited in October to visit Louis William at his camp near Kladovo. As soon as he came there, Branković was arrested and after an interrogation sent to a prison in [[Sibiu]], Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cul14&gt;Čuljak 1998, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; An independent state in the Balkans, as apparently Branković's ambition was to create, was not wanted by the Habsburgs.&lt;ref&gt;Fine 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEF5oN5erE0C&amp;pg=PA542 p. 542]&lt;/ref&gt; They intended to take Transylvania, Wallachia, Moldavia, Bosnia, Serbia, and Bulgaria from the Ottomans, and to annex these lands to the Kingdom of Hungary as part of their empire.&lt;ref name=rad352/&gt; In June 1690, Branković was transferred to [[Vienna]], where he was placed under civilian supervision, and accommodated in a [[poorhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, pp. 404–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cul14/&gt;

By the end of 1690, the Ottomans recaptured Serbia, and many Serbs, including Patriarch Arsenije&amp;nbsp;III, emigrated to the Habsburg-held southern Hungary. Branković became more widely known among the Serbs after a Serbian bishop met with him in Vienna in August 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1691, Serb elders assembled in [[Buda]] to discuss formation of the [[Serbian Militia]] in Hungary. The elders elected Count Branković by acclamation as the Chief of the Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; As he was confined, [[Jovan Monasterlija]] was elected as his deputy, which was confirmed by Emperor Leopold on 11 April 1691.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1692, Branković was moved from the poorhouse and accommodated at an inn named ''Zum goldenen Bären'',&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained until the end of 1703. From then on, he was kept at a house in the [[Bohemia]]n town of [[Cheb]].&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cul17&gt;Čuljak 1998, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; The Habsburg authorities refused all petitions for his release. He died on 19&amp;nbsp;December 1711.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; In 1743, his remains were transported from Cheb and buried at the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] [[Krušedol Monastery|Monastery of Krušedol]].&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;

Đorđe Branković's title was passed on to his relative Jovan Branković, who was born in around 1675 in the town of [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]], Arad County, Principality of Transylvania. He was Đorđe's personal attendant from at least 1700 until the count's death.&lt;ref name=cul17/&gt; [[Branković family of the Military Frontier|Jovan Branković and his descendants]], Counts of Podgorica, mostly served as officers in the Habsburg army in the [[Military Frontier]]. The last Count of Podgorica died in 1856, ending the male line of Jovan Branković.&lt;ref&gt;Čuljak 1998, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
While he resided in Bucharest, Branković wrote ''Istoriile domnilor Ţării Româneşti'', a world history in the Romanian language with a special emphasis on Wallachia, [[Moldavia]], and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt; During his captivity in Vienna and Cheb, Branković composed his main work—''Slavo-Serbian Chronicles'' in five volumes—written in the Serbian recension of the [[Church Slavonic language]] (Serbo-Slavonic). It is a history of [[Southeast Europe]], primarily focusing on the Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually and methodologically, this work belongs to medieval historiography; in its intentions, however, it is a political text. It was influential in the development of early modern Serbian historiography, especially through its influence on 18th-century historian [[Jovan Rajić]].&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 617&lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced Serbian folk tradition: Branković claimed in the ''Chronicles'' that Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]] was crowned tsar, and the prince is to this day known among the Serbs as Tsar Lazar.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 2001, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; As a historical source, only the last volume of the ''Chronicles'' is of a certain value.&lt;ref&gt;Radonić 1911, p. 731&lt;/ref&gt;
