{{Spanish name|Foppa|Falla}}'''Alaíde Foppa'''  (1914 &amp;ndash; ''c.'' 1980?) was a poet, writer, feminist, art critic, teacher and translator. Born in [[Barcelona]], Spain she held Guatemalan citizenship and lived in exile in Mexico. She worked as a professor in both Guatemala and Mexico. Much of her poetry was published in Mexico and she co-founded one of the first feminist publications, [[Fem (magazine)|''Fem'']], in the country. After her husband's death, she made a trip to Guatemala to see her mother and renew her passport. She was detained and disappeared in [[Guatemala City]] on 19 December 1980, presumed to be murdered. Some sources note the date of her disappearance as 9 December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Foppa, A., &amp; Franco, J. (1981). [Alaide Foppa de Solórzano]. Signs, 7(1), 4-4.

==Biography==
María Alaíde Foppa Falla was born 3 December 1914 in Barcelona, Spain to Tito Livio Foppa and Julia Falla.

Foppa served on the faculty of the humanities department at the [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]] (University of San Carlos of Guatemala) and was a founder of the Italian Institute of Culture in the Central American country.&lt;ref name="teleSUR-Prensa (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guatemala recuerda a Alaíde Foppa desaparecida hace 34 años|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/news/Guatemala-recuerda-a-Alaide-Foppa-desaparecida-hace-34-anos-20141219-0036.html|accessdate=22 April 2015|publisher=teleSUR-Prensa|date=19 December 2014|location=Caracas, Venezuela|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband were forced to flee the country in 1954 when the presidency of [[Jacobo Árbenz]]&lt;ref name="CNN (2014)" /&gt; was overthrown by a [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|CIA-backed military coup]].

Foppa lived in exile in Mexico, working as a professor at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM),{{sfn|Agosín|1994|p=168}} where she taught Italian at the School of Philosophy and Letters and offered the first-ever course at a [[Latin American]] university on the sociology of women.&lt;ref name="NY Review (1981)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Person|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1981/dec/17/missing-person/|website=The New York Review of Books|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=23 April 2015|location=New York|date=17 December 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lectured at other institutions, published columns and served as an art critic in local newspapers,&lt;ref name="Zamora Márquez (2014)" /&gt; and she wrote much of her poetry in [[Mexico City]].{{sfn|Agosín|1994|p=168}} It is believed that other than a volume called ''Poesías'' printed in [[Madrid]] and ''La Sin Ventura'' published in Guatemala, all her other poetic works were published in Mexico, though she wrote and edited some of them at her family's farm in the [[Sacatepéquez Department]], while visiting her mother.&lt;ref name="Cien Años (2014)" /&gt;

In 1972, she created the radio program ''"Foro de la Mujer"'' (Women's Forum) which was broadcast on ''Radio Universidad'', to discuss inequalities within Mexican society, violence and how violence should be treated as a public rather than a private concern, and to explore women's lives. In 1975, she co-founded with [[Margarita García Flores]] the publication ''[[Fem (magazine)|Fem]]'', a magazine for scholarly analysis of issues from a [[Feminism in Mexico|feminist]] perspective.&lt;ref name=ParraToledo2005&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parra Toledo|first1=Alejandra|title=Fem publicación feminista pionera en América Latina se convierte en revista virtual|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/03/informacion/86_fem.htm|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=''La Jornada''|language=Spanish|date=3 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foppa financed the publication from her own funds.&lt;ref name="Zamora Márquez (2014)" /&gt; Important Mexican journalists and intellectuals aided in the co-founding of the magazine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mariscal, Sonia.

Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7c7114jz&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent Latin Americans in the early 1980s did not identify with "Feminism" but rather with "Humanism", as in the case of [[Griselda Álvarez|Griselda Alvarez]] when asked by ''Fem''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Foppa was also a regular participant in events with [[Amnesty International]] and the International Association of Women Against Repression (AIMUR).&lt;ref name="Zamora Márquez (2014)" /&gt; With others of the Guatemalan intellectual community, Foppa denounced the government for human rights violations and her name began appearing on published lists of "subversives".&lt;ref name="Elbein (2012)" /&gt;

==Disappearance==
When her husband Solórzano was struck and killed by a car, Foppa went to Guatemala,&lt;ref name="Poniatowska (2012)" /&gt; ostensibly to visit her mother&lt;ref name="Vargas (2014)" /&gt; and renew her passport,&lt;ref name="Cien Años (2014)" /&gt; but it was believed she had decided to work for the guerrillas. By one account, she had engaged in a guerrilla courier mission to Guatemala City, where she was promptly captured by government security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Looking for history : dispatches from Latin America|last=Guillermoprieto|first=Alma|date=2002|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=030742667X|location=New York|pages=83|oclc=712672478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of her sons Mario and Juan Pablo, though born in Mexico, had returned to fight with the guerrilla forces in Guatemala and were killed. Her daughter, Silvia, who also supported the rebels, had been in hiding in Cuba for a while&lt;ref name="Poniatowska (2012)" /&gt; and at the time of Foppa's disappearance was back in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Vargas (2014)" /&gt;

Foppa's daughter Laura was a dancer and was performing in a production at the Covarrubias Theatre that was to open on 21 December 1980. When she called to verify that her mother would be returning for the performance, she learned from her grandmother of her mother's disappearance with the chauffeur, Leocadio Axtún Chiroy. Oldest son, Julio Solórzano Foppa, got a phone call from Laura who imparted the news to him and oldest daughter, Silvia learned of her mother's disappearance on the radio in a guerrilla camp in the mountains of [[Quiché Department|El Quiché]].&lt;ref name="Vargas (2014)" /&gt;

Foppa had apparently gone to buy flowers and pick up her passport&lt;ref name="Vargas (2014)" /&gt; in [[Guatemala City]] on 19 December 1980.{{sfn|Agosín|1994|p=168}} She was accompanied by her mother's driver, Leocadio Axtún, who had taken her to the Plaza El Amate, where they were intercepted, and never heard from again.&lt;ref name="Vargas (2014)" /&gt; Rumors were that she was tortured by a death squad of a high-ranking minister and killed the same day she was captured.&lt;ref name="Elbein (2012)" /&gt; Initially the newspapers carried a report that she had been abducted by members of the G-2 intelligence unit, beaten, and forced into a car, which sped away, but fearful of retaliation witnesses would not come forward.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International (2012)"&gt;{{cite web|title=City of the Disappeared – three decades of searching for Guatemala's missing|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2012/11/city-disappeared-three-decades-searching-guatemalas-missing/|website=Amnesty International|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=23 April 2015|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When news of the disappearance reached friends and family, they mobilized. Daughter Laura, who had won a grant to study dance in New York, used the trip to visit both the [[United Nations]] and the office of human rights of the [[Organization of American States]]. Julio, flew to [[Paris]] and with the help of friends secured an audience with the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] in an attempt to put international pressure on the Guatemalan government.&lt;ref name="Vargas (2014)" /&gt; Friends wrote letters and formed committees to demand action from the Guatemalan authorities.&lt;ref name="NY Review (1981)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PEN&gt;{{cite web|title=1980: Alaíde Foppa de Solorzano|url=http://www.pen-international.org/campaign/past-campaigns/because-writers-speak-their-mind/because-writers-speak-their-minds-50-years-50-cases/1980-alaide-foppa-de-solorzano/|website=PEN International|publisher=PEN International|accessdate=23 April 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julio returned to Mexico and met with [[Jorge Castañeda y Álvarez de la Rosa]], Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Mexican president [[Jose Lopez Portillo]] authorized a commission of legal scholars, journalists and Foppa's children to go to investigate the disappearance; however, right before the group was to leave, a veiled threat was received telling them they were welcome to come but that "international communism, in its efforts to make the Guatemalan government look bad, may cause harm… to come to them." The group decided the risk was too great, since Foppa was probably not still alive.&lt;ref name="Elbein (2012)" /&gt;

On 2 December 1999, Foppa's children requested that the [[Audiencia Nacional de España]] open an inquiry. Though a case was opened, Guatemalan authorities did not respond.&lt;ref name=IFEX&gt;{{cite web|title=CERIGUA demands inquiry into journalist's disappearance|url=http://www.ifex.org/guatemala/2010/11/23/donde_esta_alaide_foppa/|website=IFEX network|publisher=International Free Expression Network|accessdate=23 April 2015|location=Toronto, Canada|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, an explosion at an obscure police station on the outskirts of Guatemala City revealed an archive of records going back to the creation in 1880 of the National Police. Forensic teams began examining the documents in the [[Guatemala National Police Archives]], and Julio Solórzano wanted to ensure that the documents remained accessible. He contacted Karen Engle at the University of Texas’ Rapoport Center for Human Rights and persuaded them to digitize the records. He is hopeful that within the archive is information on his mother's case.&lt;ref name="Elbein (2012)" /&gt;

In 2010, Foppa's family, ''Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo'' (GAM) (Mutual Support Group) and the ''Centro de Reportes Informativos sobre Guatemala'' (CERIGUA) (Center of Informative Reports on Guatemala) and other organizations demanded that an inquiry into Foppa's disappearance be launched by Guatemalan authorities.&lt;ref name=IFEX /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dore, A., Asher, A., Bernikow, L., Chevigny, B., &amp; Christ, R. et al.

Count '''Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy''', often referred to as '''A. K. Tolstoy''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Константи́нович Толсто́й}}) ({{OldStyleDate|September 5|1817|August 24}} – {{OldStyleDate|October 10|1875|September 28}}), was a Russian poet, novelist and playwright, considered to be the most important nineteenth-century Russian historical dramatist, primarily on the strength of his dramatic trilogy ''[[The Death of Ivan the Terrible]]'' (1866), ''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]'' (1868), and ''[[Tsar Boris (drama)|Tsar Boris]]'' (1870). He also gained fame for his satirical works, published under his own name (''[[History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev]]'', ''[[The Dream of Councillor Popov]]'') and under the collaborational pen name of [[Kozma Prutkov]].&lt;ref name="elizabeth_jones"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Aleksey_Konstantinovich_Tolstoy.aspx| title = Tolstoy, Aleksey Konstantinovich |first =Elizabeth Jones |last =Hemenway | publisher = Encyclopedia of Russian History |year = 2004 | accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fictional works include the novella ''[[The Family of the Vourdalak]]'', ''[[The Vampire (novella)|The Vampire]]'' (1841), and the historical novel ''[[Prince Serebrenni]]'' (1862).

Aleksey was a member of the [[Tolstoy family]], and a second cousin of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Due to his mother's closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s childhood entourage and became "a comrade in games" for the young Crown Prince. As a young man Tolstoy traveled widely, including trips to Italy and Germany, where he met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. Tolstoy began his education at home under the tutelage of his uncle the writer [[Antony Pogorelsky]], under whose influence he first became interested in writing poetry, and a number of other teachers. In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a student. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the [[University of Moscow]].

Throughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He also spent many years in state service as a bureaucrat and diplomat. In 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy one of his personal aide-de-adjutants. Tolstoy served as an infantry major in the [[Crimean War]]. He eventually left state service in the early 1860s to pursue his literary career. He died in 1875 of a self-administered lethal dose of morphine at his Krasny Rog estate in the [[Chernigov Governorate]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy was born in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the famed family of [[Tolstoy family|Tolstoy]]. His father, Count Konstantin Petrovich Tolstoy (1780–1870), a son of the army general, was a Russian state assignation bank councilor. His mother, Anna Alekseyevna Perovskaya (1796–1857), was an illegitimate daughter of Count Aleksey Kirillovich Razumovsky (1784–1822), an heir of the legendary [[Ukrain]]ian [[hetman]] [[Alexey Razumovsky]].&lt;ref name="az"&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0220.shtml| title = Lib.ru/Classics: А. K. Tolstoy: A Brief Record of his Life and Work| publisher = az.lib.ru| language=Russian| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. K. Tolstoy's uncle (on his father's side) was [[Fyodor Petrovich Tolstoy|Fyodor Tolstoy]] (1783–1873). His uncle on his mother's side was Aleksey Perovsky (1787–1836), an author known under the pen name of [[Antony Pogorelsky]]. Aleksey Konstantinovich was a second cousin of [[Leo Tolstoy]]; Count [[Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy]] was their common great-grandfather.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"&gt;{{cite web| author = Yampolsky, I. G. | year = 1964 | url = http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0020.shtml| title =  А.К. Tolstoy. Collected Works in 4 volumes. V 1. Poems. Biography. Ch. 1. pgs. 13–52| publisher  = Moscow. Zhudozhestvenaya Literatura | language=Russian| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slovo"/&gt;

Konstantin Tolstoy and Anna Perovskaya's marriage was short-lived; they divorced in October 1817. With her six weeks old son, Anna moved first to her own Blistava estate in [[Chernigov Governorate]], then to Krasny Rog, an estate belonging to her brother Aleksey Perovsky, who became Aleksey Konstantinovich's tutor and a long-time companion. Common knowledge has it that Pogorelsky's famous fantasy fairytale ''The Black Chicken or The People of the Underground'' was premiered at home, his young nephew being the only member of Pogorelsky's audience. It was under the latter's influence that Aleksey started to write poetry, as early as 1823, inspired by some old books he found at home. Aleksey had good teachers and at the age of six he fluently spoke French, German and English. Later he learned Italian as well.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt;

As for the Tolstoys, Anna Perovskaya stopped seeing them altogether, only sending them postcards on major dates and holidays.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zhukov"&gt;{{cite web | author =Zhukov, Dmitry| year = 1982| url  = http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0250.shtml| title = Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy. Biography | publisher  = The Lives of Distinguished People (ЖЗЛ) series. Book 14 (631) Moscow. Molodaya Gvardiya publishers, 1982 | accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering those happy years, Aleksey later wrote:  {{quote|I was brought up by Aleksey Perovsky… I spent the first years of my life at his estate and that is why I regard [[Malorossia]] as my true homeland. My childhood, which was very happy, left me the most cloudless memories. My mother's only child, without any friends to play with but endowed with a lively imagination, from an early age I was a dreamer, a quality which soon transformed into distinct poetic inclinations. In many ways the local surroundings were conducive to that: the air itself, the huge forests I fell passionately in love with, all this impressed me so much as to completely form my present character.&lt;ref name="complete_IV_422"/&gt;}} 
In early 1826 Anna Perovskaya returned to Saint Petersburg with her brother and son. Here, due to his mother's closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s childhood entourage and in August became what was officially termed "a comrade in games" for the young Crown Prince. Aleksey's duties were not many: he had to visit the Crown Prince in Saint Petersburg and [[Tsarskoye Selo]], take walks with him on [[Yelagin Island]] and participate in games, many of which were, in effect, small scale military exercises.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; They became friends and this friendship lasted for several decades, ending in the mid-1860s.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGraw"&gt;McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama, Vol 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn of 1826 Aleksey met [[Aleksander Pushkin]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="bib_spr"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0270.shtml| title  = Tolstoy, А.К. Biography and Bibliography | publisher  = Russian Writers. Biobibliographical dictionary. Vol. 2. Edited by P.A.Nikolayev | accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1827 the family visited Germany where in [[Weimar]] young Aleksey met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]. The great man greeted the boy very warmly and left him a fragment of a [[mammoth]] tusk with his own drawing (depicting a [[frigate]]) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: "Only his magnificent features and the way he took me upon his lap," according to his autobiography.&lt;ref name="complete_IV_422"&gt;А.К. Tolstoy. Works in 4 volumes. Moscow. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura publishers. 1964. Vol. 4. Diaries and Letters. No. 274. A letter to A.Gubernatis (translated from French). Pp. 422–428.&lt;/ref&gt; The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. "Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried me off to this Paradise lost," he wrote in his autobiography decades later.&lt;ref name="complete_IV_422"/&gt; In Italy the family met [[Karl Bryullov]]. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: "Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album." The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Zhukov, the author of Tolstoy's comprehensive biography, humorously described the way Perovsky and Pushkin were in rivalry over Bryullov's attention (the latter wanted to have the "Natalie" portrait) and how the artist, locked inside Perovsky’s house, got sick of working on his host's portrait and had to escape.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a "student", where he got his first taste of working with real historical documents.&lt;ref name="bib_spr"/&gt; In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics)&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; at the [[University of Moscow]] for the formal 1st Grade State Bureaucrat certificate. He soon embarked on a career in the Economic Affairs and Statistics Department in Saint Petersburg. Before that, in July 1835, he had buried his uncle Aleksey Perovsky (who died in [[Warsaw]] of [[tuberculosis]]) and had become heir to his Krasny Rog estate.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; Also in 1835 Aleksey showed some of his new poems to [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], who praised them. There's evidence that Pushkin also approved of the young poet's early works, giving him full moral support.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; Tolstoy wrote a lot, refining his technique, but wasn't eager to get published. "My first experiments were, no doubt, absurd, but at least metrically they were flawless. I went on training thus for many years, before I debuted... as a prose writer, not a poet," he remembered later.&lt;ref name="complete_IV_422"/&gt;  
[[File:Tolstoy aleksey konstantinovich.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aleksey K. Tolstoy in the late 1830s|In the late 1830s Tolstoy developed a passion for hunting which he himself described as bizarre.&lt;br&gt;"While serving at the Court of Tsar Nikolai I, and leading a most fashionable life which in a way appealed to me, I still used to run away (from the Palace) and spend weeks in the forests, occasionally with friends, but more often than not, alone. Submerging myself headlong into such a life, which corresponded as little with my artistic inclinations as it did with my official position in Court, I got quite a reputation among our best shooters as a bear-hunter! This hobby, I think, somehow affected my poetry which has always had a rather upbeat quality."&lt;br&gt;– From his 1874 autobiography.&lt;ref name="complete_IV_422"/&gt;]]
In January 1837 Tolstoy became attached to the Russian Embassy in [[Frankfurt]] where he spent the next two years. The assignment was rather formal; it did not demand Tolstoy's presence in Germany and he spent most of his time in Saint Petersburg, leading a merry life, spending up to three thousand rubles per month,&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; often traveling to Italy and France. It was during one of these visits that he wrote his first two "gothic" novellas – ''[[The Family of the Vourdalak]]'' and ''Three Hundred Years On'' (originally in German, later translated into Russian by [[Boleslav Markevich]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Tolstoy, А.К. | url= http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0190.shtml | title = Three Hundred Years On (Vstrecha tcherez trista let) | publisher  = az.lib.ru| accessdate= 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In French, according to I. Yampolsky's biography.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy showed great interest in all things macabre, influenced, again, by his late uncle who "was obsessed with mysticism in every possible form"&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; and who, in turn, was influenced by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] whom he was personally acquainted with.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt;

In late 1840 Tolstoy was transferred back to Russia to a position in the Tsar's Imperial State Chancellery 2nd Department where he continued to work for many years, slowly rising in the hierarchy. As time went by, though, he showed less and less enthusiasm, for the demands of his position had come to feel like a major hindrance to his literary aspirations.&lt;ref name="McGraw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bib_spr"/&gt; In  May 1841 Tolstoy  debuted with ''[[The Vampire (novella)|The Vampire]]'' (a novella published under the pen name of "Krasnorogsky", a reference to Krasny Rog, his residence). Complicated in structure, multi-layered and rich in counterpoints, featuring both the element of "horror" and political satire, it instantly caught the attention of [[Vissarion Belinsky]] who praised its "obviously still very young, but undoubtedly gifted author," totally unaware of the latter's real identity.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="belinsky"&gt;{{cite web|author=Belinsky, Vissarion |year=1841 |url=http://www.alekseytolstoy.org.ru/lib/ar/author/594 |title=The Vampire by Krasnorogsky |publisher=www.alekseytolstoy.org.ru |accessdate=2011-01-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60p4ppr4V?url=http://www.alekseytolstoy.org.ru/lib/ar/author/594 |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |9=&lt;!--DashBotWC--&gt; |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy himself saw the story as insignificant and made no attempt to include it in any of the subsequent compilations; it was only in 1900 that ''The Vampire'' was re-issued. In the autumn of 1843 Tolstoy debuted as a poet: his poem "Serebryanka" was published in the No.40 edition of ''Listok Dlya Svetskikh Lyudey'' (The Paper for  Fashionable People).&lt;ref name="vengerov"/&gt;

It took another two years for him to see his second short story, "Artyomy Semyonovich Bervenkovsky", a homage to the so-called '[[natural school]]' apparently written under the influence of [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[Dead Souls]]'',&lt;ref name="complete_III"&gt;{{cite book |title=Collected Works, Vol 3. Commentary by I. G. Yampolsky |last=Tolstoy |first=Aleksey |year=1964 |publisher=State Publishing House |location=Moscow |pages= 566–567 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the 1st volume of Count [[Vladimir Sollogub]]'s ''Yesterday and Today'' almanac.&lt;ref&gt;''Yesterday and Today'' anthology. Compiled by Count Vladimir Sollogub. Book 1. Saint Petersburg, 1845&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd volume featured ''Amena'', a novella, described as an extract from a novel called ''Stebelovsky'' which remained unfinished.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; Belinsky responded negatively to this publication, describing the piece as "rather dull", and an "unfortunate manifestation of mental irritation picked from [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]]" (meaning apparently ''Les Martyrs'', 1809).&lt;ref name="complete_III"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Works by V.G.Belinsky. Moscow. 1955. p.587&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He was described as "a handsome young man with blonde hair and a freshly coloured face" and was renowned for his physical strength, "bending spoons, forks and horse-shoes and driving nails into walls with one finger."&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; One notable business trip to [[Kaluga]] in 1850 led to a close friendship with Nikolai Gogol (whom he first met in Frankfurt and then in [[Rome]]). Tolstoy recited to Gogol many of his yet unpublished poems and fragments from what later became the novel ''Prince Serebryany''. Gogol read him the second part of his novel ''Dead Souls''.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt; Among other friendships he struck up in the forties were those with [[Ivan Aksakov]], [[Pavel Annenkov]], [[Nikolai Nekrasov]], [[Ivan Panaev]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]].&lt;ref name="vengerov"&gt;{{cite web | author = Vengerov, S.A.| year = 1903| url  =http://az.lib.ru/w/wengerow_s_a/text_0150.shtml| title = Tolstoy, А.К.| publisher  = Brokhaus &amp; Efron encyclopedic dictionary (1890–1907).| accessdate= 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1850s, in collaboration with the Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, Tolstoy created the fictional writer [[Kozma Prutkov]], a petty bureaucrat with great self-esteem who parodied the poetry of the day and soon became famous for his utterly banal aphorisms.&lt;ref name="elizabeth_jones"/&gt; In 1851 Prutkov debuted with ''The Fantasy'' a comedy which was signed "Y" and "Z" and written by Tolstoy and [[Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov]]. The play, mocking the then popular "nonsense" vaudeville premiered on January 8 in the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]]. This spectacular farce (featuring at one point a dozen small dogs running about on stage) caused a huge scandal, was promptly banned by [[Nikolay I]] (who was among the audience) and remained unpublished until 1884.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

It was also in 1851 that Tolstoy first met Sophia Andreyevna Miller (1827?–1892), the wife of a cavalry colonel (whom she later divorced with great difficulty) and an impressively well-educated woman who knew fourteen languages, at a [[Bolshoy Theater]] masquerade. Tolstoy fell in love with her but had to wait for another twelve years before they were able to marry. Miller had, apparently, a perfect artistic taste and Tolstoy later referred to her as his harshest and most objective critic, as well as the best friend he'd ever had. All of his love lyrics from 1851 onwards were written for and about Sophia.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt; Many of his poems ("My dear bluebells", "Amidst the ball uproar", "Brighter than the  skylark's singing", "The wind from high up, it is not...") have been set to music by renowned composers and have become famous Russian romances.&lt;ref name="knyaz"/&gt;

In 1854 ''[[Sovremennik]]'' magazine published several of Tolstoy's verses ("My bluebells", "Oh you haystacks..." and others), which instantly got critics talking, and also the first of Kozma Prutkov's humorously pompous poetic exercises. The latter was not so much a collective pseudonym, as a character who was making quite a point of coming across as a "real" creature, performing, among other things, obnoxious pranks, one of which involved a messenger visiting all the leading Saint Petersburg architects late at night with the urgent news of the [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|Isaakiyevsky Cathedral]] having fallen down and urging them to appear early next morning at the court of Tsar Nikolay I, which they hastily did, to the Tsar's utter annoyance.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt;

As the [[Crimea War]] broke out, Tolstoy's first intention was to gather a partisan fighting unit and lead it to the [[Baltic Sea]], should the English decide to land there. Along with Count Aleksey Bobrinsky (future Minister of transport) he started to finance and equip two partisan squads, forty fighters each. He bought some ammunition from [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and traveled all along the Baltic coastline, examining what was supposed to be his future theater of war, the Crown Prince being totally unaware of his plans.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; On 2 September the allies landed at [[Yevpatoria]] and Tolstoy headed South, to join the Imperial infantry regiment (under the command of Lev Perovsky, another of his uncles) as an army major, in March 1855. The regiment went only as far as [[Odessa]] where a thousand men were lost from [[typhoid]]. In February 1856 Tolstoy became one of the casualties. In Odessa he was nursed back to health by Sophia Miller.&lt;ref name="McGraw"/&gt; Alexander II was telegraphed daily on the subject of his old friend's condition, at his personal request. In May 1855 Tolstoy was back on his feet, but the war was over for him; he instead embarked upon a Crimean journey with Sophia.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt;

After the War, in 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy as one of his personal aide-de-camp. It was only three years later that Tolstoy managed to get rid of this tiresome privilege which implied regular duties in the Palace, interfering with his now burgeoning literary career. "You cannot imagine what a storm of rhymes rages in me, what waves of poetry are sweeping through me, longing to break free," he wrote in a letter to Sophia Miller. Two thirds of Tolstoy's poetic legacy was created in the late 1850s. 1857 saw the publication of a large poem called ''The Sinner''. It was followed by the more significant ''[[Ioann Damaskin]]'', first published in ''[[Russkaya Beseda]]'' January 1859 issue. The poem, dealing with the nature of poetry and the poet's position in society, but also hinting at the author's personal plight, caused scandal. The head of the 3rd Department Prince [[Vasily Andreyevich Dolgorukov|Vasily Dolgorukov]] ordered the printing of the magazine to be stopped and for the poem to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Commentaries. P.774.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Education Evgraf Kovalevsky personally permitted the publication, his rather daring decision causing a serious rift between the two departments.&lt;ref&gt;The Central State Archives, Leningrad/ The Chief Censorship Department file, 1859, No.152130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dolgorukov, N.V., The Petersburg Sketches, 1934, Pp.178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy's poems were appearing in virtually all the major Russian magazines of the time, regardless of their ideological inclinations. Yet, in 1857 his relationship with the leftist ''Sovremennik'' group became strained. Tolstoy drifted towards the [[Slavophile]]s and their ''[[Russkaya Beseda]]'' magazine, becoming a close friend of Ivan Aksakov and [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], but this liaison was short-lived too.&lt;ref name="complete_I_13"/&gt; In the 1860s he found himself in a strange position of being a highly popular author, criticized fiercely both from the left and from the right.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt; As to the reasons for this, A.K. Tolstoy was never in doubt. In an autobiographical letter to [[Angelo de Gubernatis]] he wrote: {{quote|On the one hand I loathe the repressive hand of power, on the other, pseudo-liberalism having for its aim not the raising up of the low, but the tearing down of high things. These two aversions easily fall into one general hatred of despotism, whatever form it takes. And there is another thing I am averse to: the didactic platitudes of our so-called progressives who preach [[utilitarianism]] in poetry. I am one of only two or three authors here who carry the banner of the principle of ''Art for art's sake''. For I am totally convinced that a poet's mission is not presenting the common people with some kind of illusory favours or profits, but trying to raise their morality level; to imbue into them the love for beauty; the love that is the means in itself which will always find its end without any propaganda being involved. This point of view directly clashes with the one that is dominant in our journals. So, giving me great honour by regarding me as the major representative of the ideas they oppose, these people keep scolding me with a fervor worthy of a better cause. Our press is mostly in the hands of socialist theoreticians. Of this vast clique which is busy serving its own slogans and keeping its own proscription lists, I am the target. And all the while the reading public gives me nothing but their approval. And one more curious detail: while the journals label me "retrograde", the authorities consider me "a revolutionary."&lt;ref name="complete_IV_422"/&gt;}}
Tolstoy caused much controversy with his scathing remarks aimed at contemporary government officials (Alexander Timashev, Vladimir Butkov, Ivan Veillot) whom he – a supporter of the monarch – considered real enemies of the State. He also criticized the activities of the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|3rd Department]], and in the wake of the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising]] was one of the very few people in the Court to openly denounce [[Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky|Muravyov the Hangman]]'s draconian methods of political repression.&lt;ref name="complete_I_bio"&gt;Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Commentaries. P.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fierce opponent of [[xenophobia]], he saw Russia as a European country, and Russians as Europeans. This clashed with the Slavophile doctrine of maintaining Russia's "special place" in the world. "[Speaking] of slavophiles, Khomyakov sickens me when he places [Russia] above the West just on the strength of our being [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]," Tolstoy wrote in a letter.&lt;ref name="complete_I_bio"/&gt; All the while, well-publicized was his dispute with Turgenev, who saw the French state as Russia's potential guiding light. "What France is moving towards is the dictatorship of mediocrity," Tolstoy argued.&lt;ref name="complete_I_bio"/&gt; Being neither a [[westernizer]] nor a slavophile, Tolstoy annoyed both parties by his infatuation with pre-Tatar Russian society which he idealized whole-heartedly, seeing it as an Eastern strain of European knighthood, based on the cult of the nobleman. Also causing controversy were Tolstoy's critique of the West's amoral pragmatism and socialist ideas, his dismissal of the Russian imperial ideals which he saw as tragically flawed, and his own doctrine of a centralized Russia, the vile [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscovia State]] being, in his view, at the root of all Russian political evil. This eclectic "political romanticism"&lt;ref name="complete_I_bio"/&gt; appeared to be in conflict with every political and social trend of the time.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knyaz"/&gt;

Tolstoy rejected some [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] teachings, calling them the "church's argo" and believed in God as a "higher being" and cosmic mind. "I believe God gave us the power of emotion so we could go further than our mind leads us. As a leading force, human emotion is preferable to a thought, just as music is more perfect than a spoken word," he wrote.&lt;ref name="zhukov"/&gt;

====1861–1875====
[[File:The facade of house of Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy.jpg|thumb|right|350px|House of Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy at Krasny Rog]]
In 1861 Tolstoy quit the Court. "For quite some time I was under the illusion that I'd be able to suppress my artistic nature but life taught me different; this struggle was futile. Service and the arts are incompatible," he wrote in a letter to disappointed Alexander II. "Tolstoy represented a rare type of man who not only evaded by every possible means the favours and laurels that came his way, but had to go through painfully tedious battles with people who, driven by the best of intentions, were imposing every opportunity of making a brilliant career on him," wrote literary historian and [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary|BEED]] biographer [[Semyon Vengerov]] in 1903.&lt;ref name="vengerov"/&gt;

From then on the writer's visits to the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an opportunity to "speak the truth regardless," as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who'd been banned from editing his ''Den'' (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the "London propagandists", as [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Nikolay Ogarev]] were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned [[Chernyshevsky]]. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: "The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done..." - "No, Tolstoy, I beg you never to remind me of Chernyshevsky, please," the monarch hastily retorted.&lt;ref name="knyaz"&gt;{{cite web | author = Kuleshov, V.I.| url = http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0030.shtml| title = Prince Serebrenny by Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy. Foreword.| publisher = az.lib.ru| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aborted conversation, as it happened, brought to an end a friendship that had lasted for forty years.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

Tolstoy's historical novel ''[[Prince Serebrenni]]'' (1862, ''Russky Vestnik''), set during the time of [[Ivan the Terrible]], was widely popular and was translated into many languages.&lt;ref name="McGraw"/&gt; The novel premiered at a recital evening in the Palace, and brought its author a book-trinket from the [[Empress consort]] [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Maria Aleksandrovna]], who greatly admired Tolstoy, both as writer and a person. His poetic drama ''[[Don Juan (drama)|Don Juan]]'', published the same year, was less successful: even if not officially banned, it wasn't staged in its author's lifetime and made its theatrical debut only in 1905, severely cut by censors.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; 
 
Kozma Prutkov aside, Tolstoy wrote satirical verses under his own name, the best known of which was the [[Karamzin]]-inspired ''[[History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev]]'' (1868), a parody on Russian history that focused on the vicious characteristics of Russian monarchs.&lt;ref name="elizabeth_jones"/&gt; Another satirical poem, ''[[The Dream of Councillor Popov]]'', written in the summer of 1873, spread across Russia in hand-written form and became hugely popular. Both [[Leo Tolstoy]] and Ivan Turgenev expressed their delight at this personal swipe at the Interior Minister [[Pyotr Valuyev]], and a mockery in general of a conservative bureaucrat trying to come across as a liberal. The poem came out in 1878, in [[Berlin]], as a brochure, then six years later was reprinted by ''[[Russkaya Starina]]'' (No.12, 1884).&lt;ref&gt;Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Commentaries. P.768.&lt;/ref&gt; 1867 saw the release of ''Poems'', the vast collection of Tolstoy's verse (all in all, 131 pieces), the only such compilation published in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

Tolstoy's lasting contribution to Russian literature was a trilogy of historical [[drama]]s (modelled after [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Boris Godunov (drama)|Boris Godunov]]''): ''[[The Death of Ivan the Terrible]]'', ''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]'', and ''[[Tsar Boris (play)|Tsar Boris]]''.&lt;ref name="Guest"&gt;''Dracula's Guest'', ed. Michael Sims: Walker &amp; Company, 2010), p.136. {{ISBN|978-0-8027-1971-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Death of Ivan the Terrible'', published in 1866 in ''[[Otechestvennye Zapiski]]'' magazine, was staged the following year in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and some provincial theaters and enjoyed massive success,&lt;ref name="slovo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slovo.ws/bio/rus/Tolstoi_Aleksei_Konstantinovich/index.html|title=Tolstoy, Alexey Konstantinovich | publisher=Surmina, I.O., Usova, Yu.V.

''Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich'' (1868, ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'') was banned from being produced on stage personally by Interior minister Timashev; as late as 1907 censors deemed the play "inappropriate." ''Tsar Boris'' (1870, ''Vestnik Evropy'') received no official ban, but the Directorial council of the Imperial Theatres refused to sanction its production.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; In 1871 Tolstoy started his fifth and final play called ''Posadnik''  (set in the times when the [[Novgorod Republic]] prospered), which remained unfinished. Parts of it were published in ''Skladchina'', an 1874 charity almanac, the rest appeared in ''Vestnik Evropy'' in 1876, after the author's death.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolsky, Igor.

===Later life===
[[File:A.K.Tolstoy by Repin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tolstoy in his later years. Portrait by [[Ilya Repin]], 1896.]]
Tolstoy was lenient land-owner, admired by his Krasny Rog peasants who were permitted to use his fields as common pastures and given free timber and primary education for their children in a school he built for them in 1859. In 1861 he personally gathered all of his peasants together, read them the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] decree, gave money to everybody present and participated in the grandiose drinking spree that followed.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; Being a lavish spender and having no knowledge of the practical side of life, by the end of the 1860s he found himself on the verge of bankruptcy, but loathed the idea of returning to the Tsar's Court.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

Ever since the mid-1860s Tolstoy had fallen more and more out of sync with Russian cultural life, feeling acutely his ideological and spiritual isolation. Referring to himself as an '[[anchorite]]', he spent most of his time in Pustynka (near Saint Petersburg) and his Krasny Rog estate, worsening financial situation and deteriorating health adding to his troubles.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt; Tired of fighting his many opponents, totally disillusioned with what he saw around him, A. K. Tolstoy wrote to his friend [[Boleslav Markevich]] in 1869:{{quote|I've come to the conclusion that we do not deserve a Constitution. No matter how barbaric our rulers are, they are still better than the ones they rule. The Russian nation doesn't amount to much at all nowadays... Yet we, who should be deeply ashamed of ourselves, try and show our back to Europe instead; proclaim some "new beginnings" and dare speak of "the rotting West"!... Should God decide to give me another birth today and ask me which nationality I'd like to be born into, I'd tell him: "Your Majesty! Stick me into wherever you want, but not Russia again." When I think of the beauty of our language and of how gorgeous our history was before the accursed [[Golden Horde|Mongols]] came, I want to fall to the ground and writhe in desperation, mad at what we've done with all the talent that God has given us.&lt;ref name="complete_IV_280"&gt;Yampolsky, Igor.

A.K.Tolstoy entered the 1870s as a very sick man, suffering from [[asthma]], [[angina pectoris]], [[neuralgia]]s and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking [[morphine]]. "Now I'm feeling much better, at least the neuralgia's gone. But never before have I been so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous," he complained in a letter to poet [[Karolina Pavlova]] (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolsky, Igor. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.4. Letters and diaries. A letter to Karolina Pavlova, July 8, 1875. P. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy died on September 28, 1875, in Krasny Rog, [[Chernigov Governorate]], after having given himself a lethal injection of morphine. He was buried in the family vault in the Uspenskaya Church in Krasny Rog.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGraw"/&gt;

Tolstoy represented the later period of [[Romanticism]] in Russian literature; art for him was a mystic link between the human world and the higher spheres where "eternal ideas dwell." Along with [[Afanasy Fet]], his artistic and spiritual ally, he saw Art as a higher science, man's only instrument for a true and comprehensive understanding of the world. Romantic tendencies were best realised in Tolstoy's poetry and in some of his dramas, notably ''Don Juan'' where the hero is on quest for a romantic ideal, looking everywhere for love "that helps one penetrate into the wonderful universal laws, our world's hidden beginnings," as he put it.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"&gt;{{cite web | author = Yampolsky, I.G. | year = 1964 | url = http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0020.shtml| title = Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.1. Biography. Parts 3–8. Pp.18–56. | publisher  = Moscow, Khudozhestvennaya Literatura | accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Art can only be a 'means' – all of the 'ends'... it contains in itself," Tolstoy wrote in 1870, in the course of long dispute with those whom he labeled "utilitarianists in literature".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Markevich, January 11, 1870. Works by A.K.Tolstoy in 4 Volumes. 1964. Vol.4 Pp.342–43&lt;/ref&gt; Such views automatically made him a "conservative" in the eyes of the revolutionary democrats who formed a large majority in the Russian literary circles of the 1850s and 1860s. Unlike Fet, though, Tolstoy insisted on the artist's total independence from ideology and politics, and felt himself totally free to criticize and mock authorities, a trait that snubbed many people in high places.&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

Tolstoy's poetry had certain qualities that made it unusual and even unique, one being the "half-spoken" nature of the verse. "It's good for poetry when a thought is only half-fulfilled, so that readers can complete it – each in their own way," he explained in a letter to Sophia Miller in 1854. This view translated into a technique of writing. One of the things Tolstoy was criticized and even jeered for were "bad rhymes" which he used consciously, as part of his "poetic system". "Imperfect rhyming, if kept in bounds of course, can be seen as corresponding to the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] in painting which with little imperfections, or should I say, carelessnesses, could achieve the kind of effects which [[Raphael]] wouldn't dream of for all of his precision," Tolstoy wrote in 1859.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt; In fact, Tolstoy, as I. Yampolsky pointed out, was a master of versification. Consciously imposed "careless" rhyming gave his poems an improvisational tone (with "an impression of thoughts being put to paper exactly in the form they were born") but behind it there was hard work and much editing. "Tolstoy's verse is so simple it hardly rises above prose, yet the poetic impression it carries is perfectly full," critic [[Nikolay Strakhov]] wrote in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Notes. ''Otechestvennye Zapiski''. 1867, No.6, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Another unusual feature of Tolstoy's poems was the fact that, while rather salon-like and graceful both in nature and form, they were full of 'simplistic' bits borrowed freely from common talk and traditional Russian folklore. Kept in perfect balance, these tinged his verse with a peculiar, musical quality. More than half of Tolstoy's poems have been put to music by leading Russian composers like [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaykovsky]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Modest Musorgsky|Musorgsky]], [[Mily Balakirev]], [[Cesar Cui]], [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Sergey Rakhmaninov]] and others.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt; "Tolstoy is the unfathomable well of poems crying for music. For me he is one of the most attractive poets," wrote Tchaykovsky.&lt;ref&gt;Tchaykovsky, P.I. Correspondence with N.F. Von Mekk, Vol.2, 1935, P.360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing Tolstoy's poetry as a whole, [[D.S.Mirsky]] wrote: {{quote|Tolstoy, like [[Apollon Maykov|Maykov]] and [[Yakov Polonsky|Polonsky]], was an eclectic, but his eclecticism was not the result of a compromise between inner impulse and outward influence (that of "new trends"), it came rather from inner poise and harmony. He represented the "golden middle", mediocritas in the best, classical sense of the word. Multifacetedness and an all-embracing placid clarity based on Plato's idealism are the basic features of Tolstoy's poetry. He is the least tragic, lest disharmonious of the Russian poets, but his harmony has nothing to do with complacency or self-righteousness. It is clean and noble. In poetry, as in life, Tolstoy is a gentleman from head to toe.&lt;ref name="mirsky"&gt;{{cite web | author = Svyatopolk-Mirsky, D.P. | url   =http://az.lib.ru/t/tolstoj_a_k/text_0240.shtml | title = А.К.Tolstoy | publisher  = The History of Russian Literature From the Ancient Times Up To 1925 / Translated from English by R.Zernova. – London: Overseas Publications Interchange Ltd, 1992. – P. 351-355.| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} "Even if they suffer from sentimentality and are occasionally banal, his lyrics retain their freshness and even now taste like a delightful morning dew," the critic wrote.&lt;ref name="mirsky"/&gt;

[[Innokenty Annensky]] saw Tolstoy's poetry as being the perfect expression of "pure love", the "human soul's inner beauty" being the poet's ideal. "Tolstoy never wrote for children but his crystal clear idealism, tinged with mysticism, made his poetry resonate well with the period in adolescence when the human soul reaches out to something high and indescribable," Annensky wrote.&lt;ref name="annensky"&gt;{{cite web | author =Annensky, I.F. | url  =http://az.lib.ru/a/annenskij_i_f/text_0790.shtml| title = Works by A.K.Tolstoy as Pedagogical Material.

Pp. 212–230.| accessdate  = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentioning Nekrasov, who in his latter works created a strong image of the Russian mother, Annensky argued that what Tolstoy managed to create was an equally sublime portrait of the noble woman whose "serene placidity belies unspeakable sadness… of the one who's ashamed of her own happiness fearing that she, making the most of this world's beauty, somehow takes it away from those who have no opportunity to enjoy such riches in abundance."&lt;ref name="annensky"/&gt;
[[File:Aleksey konst tolstoy.jpg|thumb|left|230px|"His idea that 'violence and suppression of free thought were contrary to God's will' was not just a pretty phrase but an innermost conviction.

Tolstoy's ballads and songs were close to traditional [[bylinas]] both in essence and form; in fact, the author himself made no distinction between the two genres. Critics argued that (unlike, say, Nekrasov) Tolstoy used folklorisms as a mere stylistic instrument, using stories from the history of the Russian Middle Ages as a means to convey his own ideas and theories (''[[Zmei Tugarin]]''), and to link historical utopias with relevant social comment (''Boryvoi'', ''[[Vasily Shibanov]]'').&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt; Tolstoy tended to greatly idealise Russia's pre-Mongol past which made the traditional bylina characters almost superheroes. "It's hard to recognize [[Alyosha Popovich]], eyes-a-jealous, hands-a-grabbin'- as a romantic youth, speaking of love and devotion to his beloved," [[Semyon Vengerov]] remarked. Likewise, the fearsome [[Ilya Muromets]] who came across as a rather violent, dangerous and often sacrilegious type in folk bylinas, was portrayed by Tolstoy as a "benign grandfather figure," rather gracious and well-spoken.&lt;ref name="vengerov"/&gt;

Critic [[Yuly Aykhenvald]] derided Tolstoy's insistence on continuing with his "nationalistic masquerade" and quoted [[Anton Chekhov]] as commenting: "[Tolstoy] has put the opera costume on and forgotten to take it off before leaving the theatre."&lt;ref name="aikhenvald"/&gt; According to Aykhenvald, Tolstoy failed to see that "the national values, when taken to the extreme, become alien-looking." For Aykhenvald, though, it was Tolstoy's humour that prevented him from turning into an "archeology worshipper". The critic saw Tolstoy's romanticism as universal and in a certain way religious (resulting in the fact that his most memorable character, Tsar Fyodor was "an epitome of Christian meekness and grace"). Yet, "[Tolstoy]  worshipped that kind of God who was devoid of stiffness... he was a free spirit and valued freedom most."&lt;ref name="aikhenvald"/&gt;

Tolstoy's sense of humour was best realised in [[Kozma Prutkov]]'s extraordinary aphorisms, as well as in his own satirical poems. "Tolstoy... without any doubt, is Russia's greatest absurdist poet," wrote Mirsky. ''[[The Dream of Councillor Popov]]'' and ''[[History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev]]'', his best known satires, were spread across Russia in manuscript, gaining huge popularity amongst all social strata. According to Mirsky, ''The Dream'' is "the acme of Russian humorous poetry, mixing sharp, poignant satire...  and pure delight in cheerful absurdity". It's ''The Dream'' that can be seen as Aleksey Tolstoy's most solid claim for immortality," the critic argued, mentioning ''The Uproar in the Vatican'' as another of his humorous masterpieces.&lt;ref name="mirsky"/&gt;

Tolstoy's anti-leftist, pro-conservative sarcasm, on the other hand, received much stick from the 'democratic' press. His "Ballad With a Tendency" was bitterly criticised by [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin|Saltykov-Schedrin]]&lt;ref&gt;Otechestvennye Zapiski, 1872, No.2, р. 286&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[:ru:Искра (журнал)|Iskra]]'' magazine parodied it in 1872 with a verse entitled "A Ballad with a Pro-Police Tendency".&lt;ref&gt;Iskra (The Spark) magazine, 1872, No., Pp.120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Shchedrin, describing the current state of Russian literature as a "kingdom of scoundrels", in a letter to [[Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov]] wrote: "Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking 'free artists' like Count A. K. Tolstoy who makes... our obscurantists' hearts beat faster with delight. I don't know about you, but I find it painful to see how people whom I though honest, even if not very far-seeing, fight on the side of obscurantism, employing pseudo-folklorism as a weapon."&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Works of М.Е.Saltykov-Shchedrin. 1937. Vol.XVIII. Pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy was a master of prose; both his novella ''The Vampire'' (praised by [[Vissarion Belinsky]])&lt;ref&gt;The Complete A.K.Tolstoy, Vol.V. 1954, pp.473–474&lt;/ref&gt; and his novel ''[[Prince Serebrenni]]'' received a lot of good press. The latter, though, was criticised for being tendentious; many argued that both the main character and Yelena Morozova looked very much like people of the 19th, rather than 16th century. On the other hand, Ivan Grozny and the [[oprichnina]] horrors were depicted with great vividness and passion; the novel's masterfully built structure, its rich musical language made it a perfect [[Walter Scott]]-type of book for adolescents, according to Vengerov.&lt;ref name="vengerov"/&gt; "The novel is highly involving… finely structured and well-written," [[Ivan Turgenev]] wrote, recommending it to a French publisher.&lt;ref&gt;M.Parturier. Une amitie litterature, Paris, 1952, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, as a prosaic Tolstoy made much less of an impact than as a poet. He’s been lauded as a classic of the 19th century Russian historical drama.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt; D. S. Mirsky regarded Tolstoy as a dramatist superior to [[Aleksander Ostrovsky]], describing his plays as "full of intriguing ideas and brilliantly crafted characters. They impress us with intelligence and insight rather than  with flights of imagination, but in ''Tsar Fyodor'' Tolstoy managed to create one of the most interesting characters in Russian literature: that of a kind and weak ruler who has a keen sense of justice but is unable to make his evil aids implement his good will."&lt;ref name="mirsky"/&gt;
[[File:Fyodor Ivanovich by A K Tolstoy.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A scene from Act V of ''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]'' ]]
Critics noted, though, that history as such was secondary to Tolstoy; he was driven mostly by his own personal views and feelings, tending to judge his 16th century characters using mid-19th century moral values. "The life of today seeps through everywhere," Tolstoy himself admitted, speaking of his ballads. According to the author, historical drama had to be "true" only in a "humanist way". "A poet... has just one responsibility: to his own poetic self... human truth is his one law. Historical truth is something he is not bound to. If it fits into the concept, very good, if not, he can easily do without it," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, А.К. The Project of theatrical production of the play The Death of Ivan the Terrible. (Recommendations for future theater producers).&lt;/ref&gt; So on the one hand, Tolstoy's dramatic trilogy- ''[[The Death of Ivan the Terrible]]'', ''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]'' and ''[[Tsar Boris (drama)|Tsar Boris]]''- was not historical in the strict sense of the word; on the other hand, it was far from being the brand of "patriotic drama" produced by [[Nestor Kukolnik]] or the imitation of the French ''tragedie des allusions'' which [[Aleksander Pushkin]] ridiculed. In fact, Pushkin's attitude was the closest approximation to that of Tolstoy. The latter's plays had their "second levels", directly corresponding to contemporary political situations, but were driven mostly by the author's historical views and theories which involved the glorifying of Russian "noble men" (he associated them with the [[boyar]]stvo) and the vilification [[Ivan Grozny]] whom the boyarstvo had fallen victim to.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt;

[[Pavel Annenkov]] considered Ioann and Fyodor as "loosely based upon" characters, being perfectly fine but only in representing their era, not their own historical selves. "They are as loose as [[King Lear]] or [[Hamlet]] were and, if they do belong more to Russian history than those two belong to English history, that is because no other reality than that of our Old Russia could have inspired [Tolstoy] in such a way, bringing him such colors, such an essence to freely draw from,"&lt;ref&gt;...Они столь же свободные создания, как, например, король Лир или Гамлет, и если гораздо более принадлежат русской истории, чем те – английской или датской, то благодаря одному обстоятельству: никакая другая жизнь, кроме старой русской, не могла бы навеять автору подобных образов, ни из какой другой не мог бы он почерпнуть такого содержания и таких красок для своих созданий. – Annenkov's original text in Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; the critic wrote. It was the generic closeness of Tolstoy's plays to the Russia of old, Annenkov argued, that made them historic in the truest sense of the word, for "their significance as living testimony to the spirit those people and their times is beyond doubt".&lt;ref name="annenkov"&gt;{{cite web | author =Annenkov, P.V. | url  = http://az.lib.ru/a/annenkow_p_w/text_0310.shtml| title =The Latest word in the Russian historical drama.

Common to the trilogy was a somewhat morbid look at the history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: "God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!" (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), "I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!" (Tsar Fyodor), "What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else." (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to [[Nestor Kotlyarevsky]], were "united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia,"&lt;ref&gt;Kotlyarevsky, Nestor. Ancient Portraits. Saint Petersburg, 1907. P. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the [[1917 Revolution|Revolution]], in [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] the public reacted to ''Tsar Boris'' in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left "supported" boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt;
All three plays became part of the repertoire of the leading Russian and Soviet theaters, notably the [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]], with stars like [[Ivan Moskvin]], Pavel Olenev, Stepan Kuznetsov and [[Nikolai Khmelyov]] in the leading roles. According to I. Yampolsky, Tolstoy the dramatist, even if not on par with Pushkin, was high above his contemporaries; he created complex, multi-dimensional historical figures. "In the arts, to be wary of showing weaknesses in your favourite characters is to pay them bad service... Thus one can only succeed in creating faceless dummies whom nobody would believe in," Tolstoy wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Diaries, Vol.4, 1928, Pp.73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century Tolstoy was not taken very seriously, but his reputation started to grow after his death in 1875. [[Vladimir Korolenko]] called ''Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich'' "a gem of Russian drama," that's been shining especially bright next to "the totally dismal theater repertoire of the late 19th century".&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt;

Tolstoy was highly valued by [[Aleksander Blok]] and [[Valery Bryusov]]; [[Ivan Bunin]], otherwise harsh in his comments on fellow writers, rated him very high; [[Velemir Khlebnikov]] mentioned him among his all-time favourites and, most surprisingly (according to [[Korney Chukovsky]]), [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] knew his poetry by heart and often recited it in public. Both Tolstoy's poetry (the larger part of which has been transformed into classic romance) and his historical drama trilogy are regarded as an intrinsic part of the classic Russian literature of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="complete_I_18"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">'''Arnold Kramish''' (June 6, 1923  &amp;ndash; June 15, 2010) was an American [[nuclear physicist]] and author who was associated with the [[Manhattan Project]]. While working on the project, he was nearly killed in an accident at  the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]] where a prototype thermal diffusion isotope separation device was being constructed. The priest of the Philadelphia Naval Yard offered last rites to Kramish, who refused, as he was Jewish. After World War II, he wrote numerous books on  nuclear issues.  He is perhaps best known for his book ''The Griffin - the greatest untold espionage story of World War II'', about [[Paul Rosbaud]], who passed important scientific and military information from Germany to the Allies.

==Education==
Kramish was born on June 6, 1923, in [[Denver]] and received his undergraduate degree in 1945 from the [[University of Denver]]. He moved on to [[Harvard University]], where he majored in physics and was awarded a master's degree in 1947.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Hoffman, Jascha. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/us/15kramish.html "Arnold Kramish, Expert on Nuclear Intelligence, Dies at 87"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 15, 2010. Accessed July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Manhattan Project==
While still in college, Kramish was assigned to work on the Manhattan Project, working in the special engineering division at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] and at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. While working on a test in Philadelphia on September 2, 1944, Kramish was critically injured in the explosion of [[uranium enrichment]] equipment. Two chemists were killed immediately and two soldiers received severe burns in the accident, which occurred while they were trying to unclog an enrichment device which exploded, releasing steam laced with [[uranium hexafluoride]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Kramish would later call the blast "perhaps then the largest release in history of radioactive materials".&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

Severely injured and losing consciousness, Kramish declined the assistance of a priest who was offering to administer [[Last Rites]]. While recuperating from the severe burns from the incident at a Philadelphia naval hospital, his mother came to visit him by train from Denver, carrying with her a jar of [[chicken soup]] on the three-day trip, which she fed him upon her arrival at the hospital, which Kramish would credit for his unexpected recovery.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Despite wartime censorship of any details of the incident and secret classification after the war ended, Kramish lobbied the government to memorialize the victims of the accident.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Post-war activities==
After World War II, Kramish worked for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] as a liaison to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] providing intelligence estimates on Soviet nuclear capabilities and worked with [[Edward Teller]] on the design and development of the [[Hydrogen bomb]]. Physicist [[Samuel T. Cohen|Samuel Cohen]] credited Kramish with being one of the first to obtain accurate information about Soviet efforts and making his best efforts to pass on that knowledge to senior officials. He assisted in the interrogation of [[David Greenglass]], who was one of the [[atomic spies]] for the [[Soviet Union]] together with [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. He was later employed as a nuclear weapons research strategist by the [[RAND Corporation]].

During the 1970s, Kramish was an adviser to the [[United States Department of State]] in [[Paris]], and during the 1980s he served as the chair of a study for the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] that recommended pursuing the development of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] as a means to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He was also an advisor to [[UNESCO]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] on nuclear arms control and security issues.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

Kramish became a historian of the atomic era, writing ''The Griffin - The greatest untold espionage story of World War II'', about a spy who passed information to the British about the [[German nuclear energy project]] to develop an atom bomb for [[Nazi Germany]], using information he gathered from some 500 interviews.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; In a review of the book, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reviewer expressed his regret that "it is an ironic tribute to this bookish spy's mastery of his trade that the Griffin remains a surprisingly shadowy figure".&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; Though he was frequently contacted as a source for history about the Manhattan Project and the history of the [[nuclear arms race]], Robert Norris of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] regretted that he was not "more forthcoming and generous in sharing what he knew".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Death==
A resident of [[Reston, Virginia]], Kramish died at age 87 on June 15, 2010, at [[George Washington University Hospital]] due to [[normal pressure hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name=RecordObit&gt;Brown, Emma. [http://www.northjersey.com/obituaries/arnold-kramish-87-atomic-bomb-physicist-1.948533 "Arnold Kramish, 87, atomic bomb physicist"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 11, 2010. Accessed October 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Vivian Raker, a daughter, a son, a sister, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The '''Balbo Monument''' consists of a column that is approximately 2,000 years old dating from between 117 and 38 BCE and a contemporary stone base. It was taken from an ancient port town outside of Rome by [[Benito Mussolini]] and gifted to the city of Chicago in 1933 to honor General [[Italo Balbo]]'s trans-Atlantic flight to the [[Century of Progress]] Worlds Fair.&lt;ref name="Chicago Park District"&gt;{{cite web|title=Balbo Monument|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/burnham-park/balbo-monument/|website=Chicago Park District|publisher=Chicago Park District|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Balbo Monument includes a column that was taken from a site about 200 meters outside of Porta Marina in [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]].  The building that the column originated from is called the Prospetto a Mare which translates to the Prospectus to Sea.&lt;ref name="A Column from Ostia in Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Column from Ostia in Chicago|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/past/chicago.htm|website=Ostia Harbour City of Ancient Rome|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to extensive renovation that was done during the second century AD, many of the buildings throughout the settlement of Ostia were repurposed or built over.&lt;ref name="Ostia Introduction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ostia Introduction|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/intro.htm#23|website=Ostia Harbour City of Ancient Rome|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this building endured through years of change and innovation, there are very few records still in existence that pertain to the building's original purpose.  Not far from Rome, Ostia is a harbor town that was founded by a king of Rome who ruled in the late seventh century BC.  Knowledge of this first settlement did not arise from archaeological finds but texts written by sources such as Ennius, Livius, Cicero and Dionysius of Halicarnassus.  In antiquity, the settlement sat at the mouth of the River Tiber but has since receded from the shoreline due to silting that occurred throughout the centuries.&lt;ref name="Ostia Introduction" /&gt;

While it may have started off as a colonial outpost, Ostia has been rebuilt and reinvented many times.  In the 3rd century BC it was a naval base which participated heavily in the [[Punic Wars]].  Commercialization occurred later on in the 2nd century BC when grain became the main commodity that was transported through the port.  There is little information about the town from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC due to rebuilding but it is known that well to do merchant families began to rule over Ostia in the latter half of the 1st century BC.  This carried on well into the 2nd century AD after which Rome retook control over the city and began renovations that would cause Ostia's rise in popularity.  The city rapidly became densely populated with a large international population and many types of buildings were erected.  According to archaeological reports of the sites, there was a large variety of structures ranging from three-story apartment buildings, [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|brothels]], bars, shops and [[Ancient Roman cuisine|bakeries]] to [[Ancient Roman bathing|baths]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|temples]], shrines and [[Ancient Roman sculpture|sculptures]].&lt;ref name="Wrigley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wrigley|first1=Amanda|title=From Ancient Rome to Chicago: Mussolini's Gift of the Balbo Column|url=http://classicizingchicago.northwestern.edu/files/2015/02/Wrigley-2010-FromAncientRometoChicago-1kdnakm.pdf|publisher=Northwestern|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built the structure and column from [[breccia]]&lt;ref name="Chicago Park District" /&gt; which is a type of stone created from the combination of angular gravel and the fragments of boulders.&lt;ref name="Breccia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breccia|url=https://flexiblelearning.auckland.ac.nz/rocks_minerals/rocks/breccia.html|website=Geology Rocks and Minerals|publisher=Auckland University|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillar is a greenish color, thirteen feet tall and three feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mussolini to Give Chicago an Ancient Roman Column|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1933/07/23/page/18/article/mussolini-to-give-chicago-an-ancient-roman-column#text|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two Italian architects named Capraro and Komar created the base of the monument&lt;ref name="Chicago Park District" /&gt; out of [[travertine]],&lt;ref name="A Column from Ostia in Chicago" /&gt; which is a type of lightly colored limestone that is formed when river and spring waters evaporate.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Travertine|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/travertine|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They inscribed a message in Italian from the Italian people of Fascist Italy.  In English the message reads:

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;center&gt;{{small caps|
This column 
twenty centuries old
erected on the beach of Ostia 
port of Imperial Rome 
to safeguard the fortunes and victories 
of the Roman triremes. 
Fascist Italy, by command of Benito Mussolini 
presents to Chicago 
exaltation symbol memorial 
of the Atlantic Squadron led by Balbo
that with Roman daring, flew across the ocean 
in the 11th year 
of the Fascist era.&lt;ref name="A Column from Ostia in Chicago" /&gt;
}}&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Controversy==
This object's purpose and meaning has experienced drastic transformations throughout the centuries. It went from being a piece of a building that had a very functional purpose in a thriving community to a ruin that a dictator pilfered. Benito Mussolini removed the pillar from its original place in order to create a monument that produced mixed emotions from people in the U.S. and abroad.  The monument represents a portion of history but it is also valued as a piece of art and it stands as a symbol that has very different meanings for different groups of people.&lt;ref name="A Column from Ostia in Chicago" /&gt;

After Benito Mussolini had the pillar removed from its original place in Ostia, he had it converted into a monument that he gifted to the City of Chicago.  It was transported by boat to America and arrived in Chicago in 1934 during the [[Century of Progress]] World's fair and placed in front of the Italian Pavilion.  While the fair was eventually disassembled, the column was left standing in its original place just a short distance from the shores of Lake Michigan in an often overlooked area of [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]].&lt;ref name="A Column from Ostia in Chicago" /&gt;  This token was a tribute to the first transatlantic crossing made by the Italian air force and their general, [[Italo Balbo]].&lt;ref name="A Column from Ostia in Chicago" /&gt;  At the time of this celebration, many Italians and Americans thought that this gift was a symbol of growing positive relations between Italy and America.  For others, it was seen as proof that the U.S. was condoning terrorism and murder.  After WWII, The Italian ambassador to the U.S. recommended that all symbols of admiration for Fascist Italy be removed.  As is evident from its current existence, Balbo's pillar endured in spite of intermittent objections.&lt;ref name="Wrigley" /&gt;  There are still mixed emotions that survive to this day.  Some believe the monument to be a controversial link to Fascism while older Chicago residents hold on to fond memories of an age of progress.&lt;ref name="Chicago Park District" /&gt;

'''Belton Richard''' (October 5, 1939 – June 21, 2017) was an American [[Cajun music|Cajun]] [[Cajun accordion|accordionist]] and vocalist known for his baritone vocal range.&lt;ref name="LSUE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/music/brichard.htm|title=Belton Richard|accessdate=2011-03-18|author=David Simpson}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Richard was born in [[Rayne, Louisiana]] in 1939.  He began to play the accordion at age seven, and at 12 he started playing with 'Neg Halloway and the Rayne Playboys.&lt;ref name="LSUE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acadianmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acadianmuseum.com/legends.php?viewID=129|title=Living Legends - Belton Richard|accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded The Musical Aces in 1959 after a stint playing rock and roll and swamp pop.&lt;ref name="LSUE" /&gt;  During his tenure, he released many popular songs, including "Un Autre Soir Ennuyant," "Pardon Waltz," and "Waltz of No Return." Another notable song is "Cajun Streak," an inspired translation of [[Ray Stevens]]' novelty hit.&lt;ref name="flattown" /&gt; He died on June 21, 2017 at the age of 77 after being hospitalized with [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2017/06/22/cajun-music-legend-belton-richard-dies/418555001/|title=Cajun music legend Belton Richard dies|accessdate=2017-06-22|last=Fuselier|first=Herman|date=2017-06-21|website=[[The Daily Advertiser (Lafayette)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The 1995 [[Festivals Acadiens et Créoles]] was dedicated to Richard.&lt;ref name="LSUE" /&gt; Richard was inducted into the [[Cajun French Music Association]]'s Hall of Fame in 1997, its inaugural year.&lt;ref name="cfma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cajunfrenchmusic.org/halloffame.html|title=Cajun French Music Association - Hall of Fame|accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he was inducted into the Acadian museum's 'Living Legends' list.&lt;ref name="acadianmuseum" /&gt; He also won the Cajun French Music Association's 'Male Vocalist of the Year' in 2004.&lt;ref name="flattown" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23324">'''Child health and nutrition in Africa''' is concerned with the [[health care]] of [[children]] through [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in the various [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|countries of Africa]]. The right to health and a nutritious and sufficient diet are internationally recognized fundamental [[human rights]] protected by international treaties and conventions on the [[right to life]], as well as in charters, strategies and declarations. [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 1, 4, 5 and 6 highlight, respectively, how [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[child mortality]], [[maternal health]], the eradication of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases are of particular significance in the context of child health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=170–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these commitments and ideals, however, the reality is that high mortality among young children, particularly in [[Africa]], continues to be a cause for concern. Children born in developed countries such as [[Sweden]] have a less than 1 per cent risk of dying before the age of 1 year, whereas for children born in [[Developing country|developing countries]], the risk is closer to 10 per cent or higher. Within developing countries, there are significant disparities between rich and poor and [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2008. ''The State of the World’s Children: Child Survival''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Extent and gravity of child health and nutrition in Africa ==
Worldwide, substantial progress has been made in the effort to reduce child mortality. The number of under-5 deaths in the world has declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011; and the global under-five mortality rate has dropped 41 per cent since 1990 – from 87 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 51 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. 2012. ''Levels and Trends in Child Mortality''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading causes of death among children under age 5 are [[pneumonia]] (18 per cent), preterm birth complications (14 per cent), [[Diarrhea|diarrhoea]] (11 per cent), complications during birth (9 per cent), and malaria (7 per cent). Globally, more than one third of under-5 deaths are attributable to undernutrition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Africa, some progress has also been registered over the decades. Compared to other regions, [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has experienced a faster rate of reduction in under-5 deaths, with the annual rate of decline doubling between 1990-2000 and 2000-2011.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2013. ''The State of the World’s Children: Children with Disabilities''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; However, child mortality figures in sub-Saharan Africa are still sobering. The region alone accounts for 3,370,000 deaths of children under 5 in 2011 (WHO, 2012) which corresponds to 9,000 children dying every day, and six children dying every minute.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Out of 3 million [[neonatal]] deaths worldwide, approximately 1.1 million are found in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2012).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The highest rates of child mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, where 1 in 9 children dies before age 5; and 1 in 16 children in Southern Asia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Deficiency in essential nutrients and micronutrients ==
Given that [[vitamin A]] is critical for proper functioning of the [[visual system]] and for maintaining [[Immune system|immune defences]], its deficiency remains a public health issue. An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children deficient in vitamin A become [[Visual impairment|blind]] every year, half of them dying within 12 months of losing their sight. This deficiency accounts for 350 million cases of blindness and 670,000 deaths globally (WHO, 2001).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Africa alone, it contributes to 23 per cent of child deaths. In 2009, the prevalence of low [[serum retinol]], associated with vitamin A deficiency, was 37.7 per cent in [[Ethiopia]], 49 per cent in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], and 42 per cent in [[Madagascar]]. The immediate causes of this deficiency are the low rates of consumption of animal products, the poor bioavailability of vitamin A in cereal-based diets, the consumption of green leaves with low [[lipid]] content, and an increased bodily demand for vitamin A owing to the infections that frequently affect African children (Manga, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Manga, L. D. 2011. ''Evaluation of Vitamin A Status and its Determinants in Senegalese Children aged 12 to 59 Months''. Master’s thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are equally disturbing levels of [[zinc]] deficiencies and this has seriously adverse effects on growth, the risk and severity of infections, as well as the level of immune function. Although the actual prevalence is unclear, zinc deficiency is recognized as one of the main risk factors for [[morbidity]] and mortality. It contributes to over 450,000 deaths per year among children under 5 years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It affected 57 per cent of children under 5 in [[Senegal]], 72 per cent in [[Burkina Faso]], and 41.5 per cent in [[Nigeria]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beye, M. F. 2011. ''Evaluation of the Status of Zinc and its Food and Health Determinants in Boys and Girls aged 12 to 59 Months''. Master’s thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes of this deficiency in children are a lack of zinc-rich easily absorbed foodstuffs (such as meat, poultry, seafood) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs that inhibit zinc absorption, such as cereals, roots and [[tuber]]s, which are among Africa’s staples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inadequacies in [[iodine]] intake on the other hand impair the synthesis of [[thyroid hormones]], which are critical for normal development and proper functioning of the brain and nervous system as well as the conservation of body heat and energy. Iodine deficiency causes endemic [[goitre]] and [[cretinism]] as well as [[Stunted growth|stunting]] of mental and physical development. Globally, 1.6 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders and 50 million children affected by them. About 100,000 children are born each year with [[Intellectual disability|mental retardation]], most of them in Africa. This is due to the low consumption of iodine-rich foodstuffs (e.g. marine products) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs causing goitre, particularly bitter [[cassava]], which is a staple in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kupka, R., Ndiaye, B., Sall, M. G., Camara, B. 2012. ''Senegal Struggles to Control Iodine Deficiency''. International Council for Control of Iodine De ciency Disorders (ICCIDD) Newsletter, Vol. 40, No. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anemia|Anaemia]] is quite prevalent in Africa especially among young children due mainly to a diet that is low in animal-based foodstuffs and high in  fibre-rich cereals, [[tannin]]s and [[Phytic acid|phytates]] which inhibit [[iron]] absorption. In 2006, about 67.6 per cent of children under 5, and overall 83.5 million children were anaemic.&lt;ref&gt;Sy, M. 2011. ''Evaluation of the Status of Iron and its Determinants in Senegalese Children aged 12 to 59 Months''. Master’s thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; Through its effects on metabolic processes such as [[oxygen transport]], [[oxidative metabolism]] and cell growth, iron deficiency also retards growth and development. It impairs the immune response and increases susceptibility to infection, delays [[motor development]], and diminishes concentration (impairing cognitive and behavioural capacities). It therefore prevents 40-60 per cent of African children from attaining their full mental capacities. Moreover, of the 26 health risks reported by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[Global Burden of Disease Study|Global Burden of Disease]] project, iron deficiency is ranked ninth in terms of years of life lost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Preventive interventions ==

=== Breastfeeding ===
[[Breast milk]] is the ideal natural food for optimal growth and safe psychomotor development. This is due to its rich nutrients and protective factors, as well as its biospecificity (the kinetics of its composition change during lactation) and impact on mother-child relationships. These key advantages reduce child mortality rate by 13 per cent in areas where over 80 per cent of women breastfeed exclusively.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bellagio Study Group on Child Survival. 2003. ''Child survival: The unfinished revolution''. The Lancet. Child Survival Series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Habimana, Ph. 2009. ''The Regional Situation regarding Child Health in Africa''. Brazzaville, Congo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;The Lancet. 2003. Child Survival Series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Supplementary feeding ===
Undernourished children have lowered resistance to infection and are at greater risk of common childhood diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, recurring sickness and faltering growth, often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For current and future generations, good nutrition is a cornerstone for survival, health and development. Well-nourished children set off on a better developmental path (both physically and mentally), perform better in school, grow into healthier adults and are able to give their own children a better start in life. Supplementary feeding, when properly implemented, helps to reduce the mortality rate of children under 5 by 6 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) ===
The prevention of malaria through the use of [[Long-lasting insecticidal nets|LLINs]] is a key strategy for rolling back malaria in Africa. According to model-generated estimates based on the number of LLINs supplied by the manufacturers, the number distributed by national malaria control programmes and data from household surveys, the percentage of households with at least one LLIN in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 3 per cent in 2000 to 50 per cent in 2011. Coverage rates of more than 80 per cent can reduce Africa’s child mortality rate by 7 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vaccination against Haemophilusinfluenzae type b (Hib) ===
[[Hib]], meningitis and respiratory infections are frequent and serious on account of their high mortality rates and potential consequences, which include [[Sensorineural hearing loss|sensorineural]] damage. These infections can be prevented by [[vaccination]] to reduce child mortality by 4 per cent. Hib vaccination is part of the [[Expanded Program on Immunization|Expanded Programme on Immunization]] (EPI) together with vaccines against tuberculosis, [[poliomyelitis]], [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[hepatitis B]], [[measles]] and [[yellow fever]]. EPI is a key preventive intervention in reducing infant morbidity and mortality; together with the monitoring and promotion of growth, it is a fundamental pillar in child health and development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV ===
The 25 per cent prevalence of HIV in some eastern and [[southern Africa]]n countries is a matter of concern. African countries that showed more than 20 per cent adult HIV prevalence in 2011 included [[Botswana]] (23.4 per cent), [[Lesotho]] (23.3 per cent) and [[Swaziland]] (26 per cent) (UNICEF, 2013). Globally, the number of new HIV infections continues to fall annually, although there is considerable regional variation. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most of those newly infected with HIV live, it is estimated that 1.9 million (1,700,000 – 2,100,000) people were infected in 2010. According to estimates, this represents a 16 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections with HIV in 2001, which was 2.2 million (2,100,000-2,400,000), and a 27 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections between 1996 and 1998, when the incidence of HIV infection in the region peaked.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF. 2011. ''Global HIV/AIDS Response: Epidemic Update and Health Sector Progress towards Universal Access - Progress Report''. Geneva, WHO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. unaidsrstesa.org/sites/default/ les/who_2011_report_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The vast majority of children are infected before birth, during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding (if the mother is seropositive). The course of HIV and AIDS is particularly aggressive in children. Without care and treatment, the [[virus]] multiplies and destroys the child’s immune system, lowering resistance to infections such as pneumonia and other common childhood diseases. Almost half of all children infected by their mothers die before the age of 2.Thanks to a decrease in the price of drugs, increased awareness, the introduction of fixed-dose combinations of [[anti-retrovirals]] (ARVs) and more reliable forecasts of demand for paediatric ARVs, several countries have been able to distribute them for use in children, but the coverage rate remains extremely low in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. 2011. ''Global HIV-AIDS Response: Epidemic Update and Health Sector Progress towards Universal Access''. Geneva, WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Food fortification ===
Food fortification is a cost effective way of ensuring that a population receives adequate nutrients without altering their usual dietary practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_iodine.html|title=Micronutrients|work=UNICEF|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[World Health Organization|WHO]] recommends mass fortification of salt with iodine to prevent [[iodine deficiency]] in both children and adults&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/elena/titles/guidance_summaries/salt_iodization/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Iodization of salt for the prevention and control of iodine deficiency disorders|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fortification of other foods such as flour and cooking oil has been suggested and implemented in some countries, but salt iodization has been the most successful in terms of implementation and benefits in Sub Saharan Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nutritionintl.org/what-we-do/by-programs/salt-iodization/|title=Salt Iodization - Nutrition International|work=Nutrition International|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Micronutrient powders (MNPs) for point of use fortification, contain a mixture of [[Vitamin|vitamins]] and minerals. They are added on to ready to eat semi solid foods such as porridge, without altering the original taste. This intervention reduces [[Iron-deficiency anemia|iron deficiency]] [[Anemia|anaemia]] in children between six and twenty-three months of age&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De-Regil|first=Luz Maria|last2=Suchdev|first2=Parminder S.|last3=Vist|first3=Gunn E.|last4=Walleser|first4=Silke|last5=Peña-Rosas|first5=Juan Pablo|date=2011-09-07|title=Home fortification of foods with multiple micronutrient powders for health and nutrition in children under two years of age|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD008959|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008959.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21901727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinc supplements ===
The role of zinc in strengthening immune defences cannot be underestimated and in areas where effective preventive supplementation campaigns have been implemented, particularly in Africa, the child mortality rate has been lowered by 4 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vitamin A supplement ===
Biannual vitamin A supplements can help to reduce mortality among young children by 23 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Curative interventions ==

=== Oral rehydration solutions ===
[[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral rehydration]] is considered one of the greatest revolutions in improving child health and managing diarrhoea. With new oral rehydration solutions containing zinc, child mortality can be reduced by 15 per cent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Therapeutic feeds ===
[[F-75 (food)|F75]] and [[F-100 and F-75 (foods)|F100]] are types of therapeutic milk that is used in inpatient management of [[Severe Acute Malnutrition|severe acute malnutrition]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherchildnutrition.org/malnutrition-management/info/feeding-formulas-f75-f100.html|title=Feeding formulas: What are F-75 and F-100? - Diarrhoea - Mother, Infant and Young Child Nutrition &amp; Malnutrition - Feeding practices including micronutrient deficiencies prevention, control of wasting, stunting and underweight|website=motherchildnutrition.org|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They differ in concentrations of ingredients and amount of energy&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. [[Ready-to-use therapeutic food|Ready to use therapeutic foods]] (RTUF) are semi-solid foods for outpatient management of [[malnutrition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/malnutrition/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Malnutrition|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These may be used as part of a community based food and nutrition program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5030e/y5030e05.htm#P69_5412|title=Community-based food and nutrition programmes|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Antibiotics to treat pneumonia ===
The improved availability of [[antibiotics]] to treat pneumonia, particularly in remote areas and among deprived populations, has contributed to reducing the child mortality rate by 6 per cent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other curative interventions which can help to reduce child mortality include antibiotics to treat [[sepsis]] (6 per cent), the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria (5 per cent) and antibiotics to treat [[dysentery]] (2 per cent).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These interventions are highly beneficial to child health and development. However, coverage rates remain low due to underdevelopment and poverty, poor health care systems with limited access to health services (less than 40 per cent in most African countries), a lack of qualified human resources resulting in part from the brain drain to [[Western world|Western]] and [[Arab world|Arab countries]], inadequate equipment, an inconsistent supply of medications and basic products with frequent shortages, a poorly structured and barely functioning programme of health promotion, and limited budgets for health (less than the 15 per cent recommended by WHO for most African countries) combined with often unorthodox financial governance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Main strategies  ==
The strategies outlined below are recommended by WHO and adopted by all African countries as part of a bolder approach to serious child health problems. Their strengths reside in the complementarity of components integrated into strategies, the effectiveness in reducing child mortality and morbidity, and the positive long-term impact generated for children, such as enhanced school performance, well-being and life chances. These strategies offer an immediate return while having a significant impact on the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) ===
[[Integrated Management of Childhood Illness|IMCI]] is a strategy that integrates various programmes for the survival of children under 5 with a view to improving the practices that are likely to have the greatest impact on their health, growth and development. This is the overarching strategy for achieving [[Millennium Development Goals|MDG]] 4 (reduction of child mortality), and it is recommended by WHO and [[UNICEF]], particularly in countries with a high child mortality rate. The strategy is simple and, according to the [[World Bank]], cost-effective. It aims to address the main causes of child mortality in settings characterized by (1) a low level of health coverage, with little or no access to diagnostic equipment and treatment, (2) a low level of health monitoring, and (3) weak links between healthcare facilities and communities. IMCI has three components: (1) improving the skills of health care workers, (2) strengthening the health care system, and (3) improving family and community practices.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. 1992. ''IMCI: A Strategy for Reducing Infant and Child Mortality''. Geneva, WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC) ===
Maternal and neonatal mortality in the Africa region accounts for more than half (51 per cent) of the world’s total maternal deaths, with a neonatal mortality rate of approximately 40 per thousand. The causes of these deaths could be prevented or avoided by the proper implementation of strategies for skilled care at birth and emergency [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] and neonatal care services. With the assistance of WHO, UNICEF, [[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]] and the World Bank, various African countries have developed roadmaps for accelerating the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality by improving the skills of service providers, standardizing treatment protocols, and developing quality criteria for [[Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care|EmONC]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

While effective interventions and strategies for improving the health and nutrition status of young children are available, the financial resources required to implement them in Africa are inadequate. It is essential that African governments, their domestic partners (the private sector and [[civil society]]) and their partners abroad (bilateral and multilateral cooperation) invest more heavily in mobilizing resources for early [[Child development|childhood development.]] The focus should be on optimal governance of financial resources with transparent management rules and particular emphasis on equity of care and guaranteed access for the poor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Cleve Jones''' (born October 11, 1954) is an American [[AIDS]] and [[LGBT rights]] activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aldrich |first=Robert |author2=Garry Wotherspoon |title=Who's who in contemporary gay and lesbian history |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2001 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCpMNSGhXy0C&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=0-415-22974-X }}
&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt]] which has become, at 54 tons, the world's largest piece of community [[folk art]] as of 2016. In 1983, at the onset of the [[AIDS pandemic]] Jones co-founded the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] which has grown into one of the largest and most influential [[People with AIDS]] advocacy organizations in the United States.

==Early life==
[[File:Cleve jones NEM.jpg|thumb|Cleve Jones marching at the [[National Equality March]], 2009]]
Jones was born in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. He moved with his family to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], when he was 14, and was a student at [[Arizona State University]] for a time.&lt;ref name="whenwerise"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Cleve|title=When We Rise: My Life in the Movement|date=2016|publisher=Hachette Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones claimed, however, he never really accepted the Phoenix area as his home.&lt;ref name="whenwerise"/&gt; His father was a psychologist. His mother was a Quaker, a faith she held at least in part to benefit her son in the era of the draft for the Vietnam war.&lt;ref name="whenwerise"/&gt; He did not reveal his sexual orientation to his parents until he was 18.&lt;ref name=FreshAir /&gt;&lt;ref name="whenwerise"/&gt;

His career as an activist began in [[San Francisco]] during the turbulent 1970s when, as a newcomer to the city, he was befriended by pioneer gay-rights leader [[Harvey Milk]]. Jones worked as a student intern in Milk’s office while studying political science at [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Leff |first=Lisa |title=At 54, Cleve Jones is ready for his comeback |newspaper=[[AZ Central]] |date=July 12, 2009 |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/07/12/20090712ActivistsNextAct.html |accessdate=March 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Laird |first=Cynthia |title=News in brief: Jones to speak at UC Berkeley |newspaper=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |date=January 22, 2009 |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=3665 |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1978, [[Dan White]] assassinated Harvey Milk, recently elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, along with San Francisco’s Mayor [[George Moscone]], and Jones was one of the first people to see Milk's body after the assassination. Jones went to work in the district office of State Assemblyman [[Art Agnos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: Cleve Jones |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |date=December 7, 2004 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/interviews/jones.html |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, when [[AIDS]] was still a new and largely underestimated threat, Jones co-founded the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Harmanci"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Harmanci |first=Reyhan |title=''Milk'' actors and the people they play |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 23, 2008 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/23/PKRT141R2J.DTL&amp;type=printable |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones conceived the idea of the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|AIDS Memorial Quilt]] at a candlelight memorial for Harvey Milk in 1985 and in 1987 created the first quilt panel in honor of his friend Marvin Feldman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wilson |first=Craig |title=The man who sewed together the stories of thousands |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=December 7, 1987 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/doc/305968946.html |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AIDS Memorial Quilt has grown to become the world’s largest community arts project, memorializing the lives of over 85,000 Americans killed by AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Merkle |first=Karen Rene |title=The Cathedral of St. Paul has been displaying the AIDS Memorial Quilt |newspaper=[[Erie Times-News]] |date=November 20, 2000 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_text_direct-0=0EB92E59D8A303B5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones ran for a position on the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in the November 3, 1992 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | access-date = 2016-12-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in San Francisco, Jones took part in a documentary, ''Echoes of Yourself in the Mirror'', about the [[HIV]]/AIDS epidemic, speaking during [[World AIDS Day]] in 2005. In the documentary he talks about the idea behind the AIDS Memorial Quilt, as well as the activism of San Francisco citizens in the 1970s and '80s to help people affected by AIDS and to figure out what the disease was. The film also looks at the impact HIV/AIDS is having in communities of color, and the young.

Jones has been working with [[UNITE HERE]], the hotel, restaurant, and garment workers' [[trade union|labor union]] on homophobia issues.&lt;ref name="Harmanci"/&gt; He is a driving force behind the Sleep With The Right People campaign, which aims to convince [[LGBT]] tourists to stay only in hotels that respect the rights of their workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kerr |first=Bob |title=The Quilt has taught us for 20 years |newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]] |date=October 31, 2007 |url=http://www.projo.com/news/bobkerr/Kerr_column_31_10-31-07_FL7LM1K_v14.31581ed.html |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of Jones's work with UNITE HERE is making the labor movement more open to LGBT members.

In an interview in November 2016 with [[Terry Gross]] on [[NPR]] [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] [[Fresh Air]], Jones described his status as [[List of HIV-positive people#AIDS activists|HIV+]], and said while he first learned of his status when tests for infection came out the 1980s, he was likely infected with the virus around the winter of 1978 or 1979, based on blood samples collected from him as part of a study he volunteered for.&lt;ref name=FreshAir&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/29/503724044/lgbtq-activist-cleve-jones-im-well-aware-how-fragile-life-is |title=LGBTQ Activist Cleve Jones: 'I'm Well Aware How Fragile Life Is' |publisher=NPR Fresh Air |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same interview, Jones also talked about the time when he became seriously ill, and how he responded rapidly to the [[Management of HIV/AIDS|"cocktail"]] of drugs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/news/493/attacking-aids-with-a-cocktail-therapy--drug-combo-sends-deaths-plummeting |title=Attacking AIDS with a 'Cocktail' Therapy: Drug Combo Sends Deaths Plummeting |date=July 1, 1999 |publisher=FDA HIV/AIDS News |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fought the virus, in the earliest trials of it. He described his present health as good.&lt;ref name=FreshAir/&gt; The interview was based on Jones's book, ''When We Rise: My Life in the Movement'', and the television program ''[[When We Rise]]'', broadcast in February and March 2017 on ABC in the USA.&lt;ref name=FreshAir /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When We Rise: My Life in the Movement |last=Jones |first=Cleve |publisher=Hachette |date=29 November 2016 |isbn=978-0316315432}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme of the interview was that activism saved his life, as he was in the early drug trials, part of the group pushing the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) to stop doing double-blind trials as soon as it was clear that the cocktail of drugs saved lives.

==Film, theatre and major parades==
Jones is portrayed by actor [[Emile Hirsch]] in ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'', director [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2008 [[biopic]] of [[Harvey Milk]].&lt;ref name="Harmanci"/&gt;

Jones is prominently featured in ''[[And the Band Played On]]'', [[Randy Shilts]]'s best-selling 1987 work of non-fiction about the AIDS epidemic in the United States. Jones was also featured in the 1995 [[documentary film]] ''The Castro''.

Jones was one of the Official [[Grand Marshal (parade dignitary)|Grand Marshals]] of the 2009 [[NYC LGBT Pride March]], produced by [[Heritage of Pride]] joining [[Dustin Lance Black]] and [[Anne Kronenberg]] on June 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycpride.org/march.html |title=NYC LGBT Gay Pride - March |publisher=[[New York Pride]] |date=June 24, 2014 |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227205534/http://www.nycpride.org/march.html |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Jones was an official Grand Marshal of the [[Vancouver Pride Festival|Vancouver Pride Parade]].

Jones participated as an actor in the Los Angeles premiere of ''[[8 (play)|8]]'', a condensed theatrical re-enactment of the ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry|Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' trial's closure, on March 3, 2012.

Jones is portrayed by actors [[Austin P. McKenzie]] and [[Guy Pearce]] in the 2017 ABC television miniseries ''[[When We Rise]]'', directed by [[Gus Van Sant]].

Jones had a cameo appearance playing himself in ''[[Looking: The Movie]]'' in 2016.

'''Daniel Joseph Berrigan''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} (May 9, 1921{{snd}}April 30, 2016) was an American [[Jesuit]] priest, [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] activist, [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]], playwright, poet, and author.

==Early life==
Berrigan was born in [[Virginia, Minnesota|Virginia]], Minnesota, the son of Frieda Berrigan (née Fromhart), who was of German descent, and Thomas Berrigan, a second-generation [[Irish Americans|Irish]] Catholic and active trade union member.&lt;ref name="FamilySearch-USCensus-1930"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Berrigan – United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X4RN-QQL|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six sons.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Obit-2016" /&gt; His youngest brother was fellow peace activist [[Philip Berrigan]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-PhilipBerrigan-Obit-2002"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Daniel|title=Philip Berrigan, Former Priest and Peace Advocate in the Vietnam War Era, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/us/philip-berrigan-former-priest-peace-advocate-vietnam-war-era-dies-79.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=May 1, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berrigan was devoted to the [[Catholic Church]] throughout his youth. He joined the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood on June 19, 1952.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Obit-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NatlCatholicReporter-Obit-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Tom|title=Daniel Berrigan, poet, peacemaker, dies at 94|url=http://ncronline.org/news/people/daniel-berrigan-poet-peacemaker-dies-94|accessdate=May 1, 2016|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, he won the [[List of winners of the James Laughlin Award#Lamont Poetry Selections (1954–1975)|Lamont Prize]] for his book of poems, ''Time Without Number''. He developed a reputation as a religious radical, working actively against poverty and on changing the relationship between priests and lay people. While at Le Moyne, he founded its International House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinsonline.org/s/445/index-1Col.aspx?sid=445&amp;gid=43&amp;pgid=15&amp;cid=292&amp;ecid=292&amp;ciid=0&amp;crid=0&amp;newsid=78|title=International House – Alumni News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on a sabbatical from Le Moyne in 1963, Berrigan traveled to Paris and met French Jesuits who criticized the social and political conditions in Indochina. Taking inspiration from this, he and his brother Philip founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, a group which organized protests against the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/daniel-berrigan-priest-and-peace-activist-dies-aged-94|title= Daniel Berrigan, priest and anti-Vietnam war peace activist, dies|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 1965, Berrigan, along with the Rev. [[Richard John Neuhaus]] and Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], founded an organization known as Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV). The organization, founded at the Church Center for the United Nations, was joined by the likes of Dr. [[Hans Morgenthau]], Dr. [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], Rev. [[William Sloane Coffin Jr.]], and the Rev. [[Philip Berrigan]], among many others. The Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who delivered his 1967 speech ''[[Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence]]'' under sponsorship from CALCAV, served as the national co-chairman of the organization.

From 1966 to 1970, Berrigan was the assistant director of the [[Cornell University]] United Religious Work (CURW), the umbrella organization for all religious groups on campus, including the Cornell Newman Club (later the [[Cornell Catholic Community]]), eventually becoming the group's pastor.&lt;ref name="CornellChron-Cornell-2006"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Daniel|last1=Aloi|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/berrigan.0406.html|title=From Vietnam to Redbud Woods: Daniel Berrigan launches events commemorating five decades of activism at Cornell|date=April 4, 2006|work=[[Cornell Chronicle]]|accessdate=December 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berrigan, his brother and [[Josephite Fathers|Josephite]] priest [[Philip Berrigan]], and [[Trappists|Trappist]] monk [[Thomas Merton]] founded an interfaith coalition against the [[Vietnam War]] and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. In 1967, Berrigan witnessed the public outcry that followed from the arrest of his brother Philip, for pouring blood on draft records as part of the [[Philip Berrigan#The Baltimore Four|Baltimore Four]].&lt;ref Name=Four&gt;''Religion and War Resistance in the Plowshares Movement'' (2008) Sharon Erickson Nepstad, Cambridge University Press, p48 {{ISBN|978-0-521-71767-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was sentenced to six years in prison for defacing government property.

Although much of his later work was devoted to assisting AIDS patients in New York City,&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Obit-2016"/&gt; Berrigan still held to his activist roots throughout his life. He maintained his opposition to American interventions abroad, from Central America in the 1980s, through the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the [[Kosovo War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He was also an opponent of capital punishment, a contributing editor of ''[[Sojourners]]'', and a supporter of the [[Occupy movement]].&lt;ref name=streetpriest&gt;{{cite news|url=http://truth-out.org/news/item/9712-daniel-berrigan-americas-street-priest-stands-with-occupy|title=Daniel Berrigan, America's Street Priest, Stands With Occupy |author=Chris Hedges|date=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatlCatholicReporter-ProfileAt75-1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Tom|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,cpid&amp;custid=nypl&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=9603156461&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Soon 75, Berrigan's is still an edgy God|journal=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=January 26, 1996|volume=32|issue=13|accessdate=May 1, 2016|issn=0027-8939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider 2013 p. 117"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schneider | first=N. | title=Thank You, Anarchy: Notes from the Occupy Apocalypse | publisher=University of California Press | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-520-95703-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOIQc_ALD8YC&amp;pg=PA117 | accessdate=7 May 2017 | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clark-Bax-Wood.jpg|thumb|300px|Clark (l) with [[Arnold Bax]] and [[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]], 1934]]
'''Thomas Edward Clark''' (10 May 1888{{spaced ndash}}30 April 1962) was an English conductor and music producer for the [[BBC]]. Through his positions in leading new music organizations and his wide-ranging contacts with British and European composers, he had a major impact on making contemporary classical music available to the British public for over 30 years. He was a leading figure in the BBC's Concerts of Contemporary Music between 1926 and 1939, and he played a significant role in the founding and early development of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=04vDuG_pElwC&amp;pg=PT247&amp;lpg=PT247&amp;dq=edward+clark+BBC+bartok&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aArhjhzfKE&amp;sig=SH0kQcXMOF26kVEk0-VbVxm3bK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QI4MUe73MoetiQerqICIAQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=clark&amp;f=false Paul Griffiths, ''The Penguin Companion to Classical Music'']&lt;/ref&gt; He held prominent positions in the [[International Society for Contemporary Music]] (ISCM) from its inception in 1922, and was its President from 1947 to 1955.

He was responsible for producing a number of important world and British premieres (some of which he also conducted), and he was associated with most of the important European and British composers, such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[William Walton]], [[Arthur Bliss]], [[Arnold Bax]], [[Peter Warlock]], [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]], [[Constant Lambert]], [[Arthur Benjamin]], [[Humphrey Searle]], [[Denis ApIvor]], [[Alan Rawsthorne]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Benjamin Frankel]], [[Roberto Gerhard]], [[Luigi Dallapiccola]], [[Christian Darnton]] and others.

Edward Clark was described by some as [[Mephistopheles|Mephistophelean]].&lt;ref name=ivor&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/apivor/warlock_circle.htm Music Web International: Denis ApIvor, ''Memories of the Warlock Circle'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was outspoken, immensely erudite, and a visionary. But he was also a loose cannon when it came to administrative matters, tending to ruffle feathers with his too-individual approach, brooking no interference, and being distrustful of those who did not share his vision but often inadequately communicating that vision to them. In 1936 these matters contributed in large part to his premature departure from the BBC, and from the inner sanctum of the contemporary music scene, which he had helped to create as much as anyone, and more than most. His personal integrity in regard to the use of official funds also came under question more than once, in one instance leading to a public scandal and court case in which he sued Benjamin Frankel for slander.

Clark's ex-wife Dorothy Eckersley was jailed in 1945 for making anti-British broadcasts over a German radio station during World War II; their teenage son James Clark was also involved in this. His second wife was the composer [[Elisabeth Lutyens]], with whom he had another child.

==Early life==
Thomas Edward Clark was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] on 10 May 1888. His father, James Bowness Clark (1863&amp;ndash;1934), was a coal exporter and amateur musician who supported his son's musical interests and for two decades was the secretary of the Newcastle and Gateshead Choral Union. He and his wife Elizabeth née Thirlaway (1858&amp;ndash;1939) had three children.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40709 Jennifer Doctor, 'Clark, (Thomas) Edward (1888–1962)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004], accessed 31 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Clark was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]]. Studying in Paris in 1907 and 1908, he met [[Claude Debussy]], [[Albert Roussel]] and [[Maurice Ravel]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt; He returned to Newcastle and presented a paper called "Paper on a Modern French Composer: Claude Debussy"; at that time he formulated a strong desire to encourage British audiences "to understand this music of to-day before it becomes the music of the day before yesterday".&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; In 1909 he studied conducting with [[Oskar Fried]] in Berlin while employed as the Berlin correspondent for ''[[The Musical Times]]''.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Meeting with Schoenberg and his circle==
Clark's first exposure to the music of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] was at a performance of his symphonic poem ''[[Pelleas und Melisande (Schoenberg)|Pelleas und Melisande]]'' on 31 October 1910 at a concert by the [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/1634 David Lambourn, ''Henry Wood and Schoenberg'']{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was profoundly impressed by this music, and he was introduced to Schoenberg and [[Anton Webern]] after the concert.&lt;ref name=chad&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/eblj/1985articles/pdf/article3.pdf Nicholas Chadwick, ''Alban Berg and the BBC'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fried&gt;[http://www.delius.org.uk/images/journals/pdfs/journal86.pdf ''Delius Society Journal'', April 1985, Oskar Fried issue]&lt;/ref&gt; He became Schoenberg's champion and, along with people like [[Artur Schnabel]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], Oskar Fried and others, he convinced him to move from Vienna to Berlin, because of the greater opportunities and contacts there.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt; From 1910 until 1912 Clark studied with Schoenberg in Berlin, the only British student he ever had.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt; At first Clark was his sole pupil, then he was joined by [[Eduard Steuermann]], and others later. Clark arranged for Schoenberg to give a series of ten public lectures at the [[Stern Conservatory]] ("10 Lectures on the Aesthetics of Music and the Rules of Composition"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11132007-113712/unrestricted/Johnson_dis.pdf Barrett Ashley Johnson, Dissertation]&lt;/ref&gt; which he also attended.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt; He helped raise funds for Schoenberg, and played a part in having his ''[[Five Pieces for Orchestra]]'' published in a cheap edition, which sold out quickly. One of the purchasers was Sir [[Henry Wood]].

On 3 September 1912, Wood conducted the world premiere of the ''Five Pieces for Orchestra'' at a [[The Proms|Promenade Concert]] at the [[Queen's Hall]] in London. At Wood's suggestion, Clark invited Schoenberg to make his British conducting debut, and on 17 January 1914 he conducted the same work at the same venue.&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1014&amp;Itemid=726&amp;lang=en Arnold Schönberg Center, ''Herr Schönberg in London.

Clark was hired by the [[BBC]] in August 1924 as Musical Director for their Newcastle station. His imagination, creativity and innovative approaches to programming were soon noted, attracting praise from local Newcastle musical circles; but so too were his administrative shortcomings.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; In December 1924, in Newcastle, Clark conducted the world premiere of the orchestral version of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Verklärte Nacht]]''.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt; The Newcastle station orchestra was disbanded at the end of 1926, and Clark transferred to London in January 1927 as a programme planner, at the request of [[Percy Pitt]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt;&lt;ref name=chad /&gt;

Although he was employed full-time by the BBC for only another seven years, it was primarily through his influence that the BBC became established as an international patron of new music.&lt;ref name=naxos&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.555068&amp;catNum=555068&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English naxos]&lt;/ref&gt; He also did a considerable amount of conducting during this period, sometimes of the works he was producing for the BBC, and sometimes on a free-lance basis.

On 19 June 1927 he conducted the British premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments (Stravinsky)|Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments]], with the composer (in his British radio debut)&lt;ref name=gareth&gt;[http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/260/1/Thomas05PhD_A1a.pdf Gareth James Thomas, ''The Impact of Russian Music in England 1893–1929'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the Wireless Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=gazz2 /&gt; On 10–12 July 1927 he conducted three fully staged performances of ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' at the Arts Theatre Club; they were sung in English and the third performance was broadcast.&lt;ref name=gareth /&gt; Clark had also performed this work in its British premiere in the autumn of 1926 in Newcastle.&lt;ref name=gareth /&gt;

In November of that year he was able to secure [[Oskar Fried]] his first British conducting engagement (the programme included Weber, Brahms and Liszt).&lt;ref name=fried /&gt; Clark invited Schoenberg to London to conduct the first British performance of his ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' on 27 January 1928, and assisted with the rehearsals.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=McFbqFNXrHAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=edward+clark+1888+1962&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=anPjXT1Hjm&amp;sig=J31BoMFrNtwXzQZLhV-uVVezPNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ww8JUffBA-aziQfYrIDQBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%201888%201962&amp;f=false Joseph Henry Auner, ''A Schoenberg Reader: Documents of a Life'']&lt;/ref&gt; (He had tried to have the premiere the previous year, on 14 April 1927, but these plans fell through.)&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt;

In April 1929, Edward Clark along with [[Julian Herbage]] of the BBC's Music Department devised a plan for a 114-piece orchestra that was especially suited to broadcasting, and one that could be split into four different smaller groups as required. This was the original workable concept for the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] after some earlier ideas from Sir [[Thomas Beecham]] foundered. Beecham was the first choice for chief conductor, but he withdrew and [[Adrian Boult]] directed the orchestra for the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Beecham and the BBC Symphony Orchestra: A Collaboration that Never Happened|last=Kenyon|first=Nicholas|journal = The Musical Times|pages =625–628|date = 1 October 1980|jstor = 961148|volume=121}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boult did not always support Clark's choices of repertoire, however. He refused to play the music of [[Alexander Scriabin]] that Clark programmed, calling it "evil music", and even issued a ban on Scriabin's music from broadcasts in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/569022/Defining_Moments_Vicissitudes_in_Alexander_Scriabins_Twentieth-Century_Reception Lincoln Ballard, ''Defining Moments: Vicissitudes in Scriabin's Twentieth-Century Reception'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that he had no personal sympathy with the music of the [[Second Viennese School]], describing [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' as "a Kensington drawing room apology for what Berg really meant", but Clark's influence was such that he was at least prepared to participate in performances of this music.&lt;ref name=gareth /&gt;

It was Clark who suggested to [[William Walton]] that he invite [[Paul Hindemith]] to be the soloist at the premiere of his [[Viola Concerto (Walton)|Viola Concerto]] in 1929, when the dedicatee [[Lionel Tertis]] declined. Tertis also claimed to have suggested Hindemith in his place, but Walton confirmed it was Clark's idea.&lt;ref name=lloyd /&gt; Walton was initially somewhat reluctant to invite Hindemith, as he felt he had modelled the concerto too closely after the latter's style, which he would quickly recognise; but thanks to Edward Clark, the invitation was sent and accepted, the premiere took place on 3 October, and the two composers became lifelong friends (they had met briefly in 1923).&lt;ref name=viola&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G4ze19aicmAC&amp;pg=PA497&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;dq=edward+clark+iscm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rjg4uh1Frr&amp;sig=qOB7dyqlcV7VCaOXavyByU0uRHc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TPsIUf7TCYuviQe2g4DoCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%20iscm&amp;f=false Michael Steinberg, ''The Concerto: A Listener's Guide'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reed&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iKR339tIo-4C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=edward+clark+iscm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q4Js8dRod2&amp;sig=2Mx5Qwl1dixYzwkRYoCIj9WHvXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TPsIUf7TCYuviQe2g4DoCg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%20iscm&amp;f=false Philip Reed, ''On Mahler and Britten'': Essays in Honour of Donald Mitchell on His Seventieth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark played an even greater role in Walton's ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'': he was its progenitor. On 21 August 1929 he asked Walton for a work suitable for broadcasting, written for a small choir, soloist, and an orchestra not exceeding 15 players. Walton later thanked Clark for bringing ''Belshazzar's Feast'' to the attention of [[Sergei Prokofiev]], who showed some interest in it.&lt;ref name=lloyd /&gt;

His friend [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] introduced [[Alan Bush]] to Clark, who was responsible for having many of Bush's works broadcast between 1929 and 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanbushtrust.org.uk/articles/article_rohiggins3.asp?room=Articles Alan Bush Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553889&amp;catNum=553889&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English Naxos]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 1930, Edward Clark played a major part in the first complete broadcast (18 poems) of Walton's ''[[Façade (entertainment)|Façade]]'', at the Central Hall, Westminster, with [[Edith Sitwell]] and [[Constant Lambert]] (speakers), [[Leslie Heward]] conducting.&lt;ref name=lloyd /&gt;

On 9 January 1931, Schoenberg conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the British premiere of ''[[Erwartung]]''.&lt;ref name=chad /&gt; Clark was able to use the prestige and contacts he had by now built up to secure the [[ISCM]] Festival for London and Oxford in July 1931.&lt;ref name=chad /&gt;

As well as Schoenberg, Clark invited [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]] to visit England several times to conduct their own works. Berg was very reluctant, insisting he was no conductor. Clark nevertheless made sure his major works received performances in England: the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' and [[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]] (21 April 1933); the ''[[Wozzeck]]'' fragments (13 May 1932), and complete in concert performance (14&amp;nbsp;March 1934); ''Der Wein''; the Symphonic Pieces from ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (20 March 1935; this was the first time Berg had ever heard this music (by radio broadcast); he was not to hear a live performance of it until 11&amp;nbsp;December in Vienna, a fortnight before his death); and, posthumously, the [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]].&lt;ref name=chad /&gt;

Between November 1932 and January 1933, while staying in Barcelona, Schoenberg wrote a transcription for cello and orchestra of the Keyboard Concerto in D by [[Georg Matthias Monn]]. He wrote it for [[Pablo Casals]], to whom he offered the first performance, but Casals declined. It received its first public airing on 3 February (or 5 February) 1933 in an afternoon studio broadcast from London by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Edward Clark, with the soloist [[Antoni Sala]].&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold Schonberg Center"&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=331&amp;Itemid=510&amp;lang=en Arnold Schonberg Center]&lt;/ref&gt; There was no announcement of this world premiere and there is no extant documentation of the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;The Cello Concerto had its first concert performance with [[Emanuel Feuermann]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Sir [[Thomas Beecham]] on 7 November 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Schoenberg was probably in attendance; he was in London to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra's world premiere (broadcast) performance of the Variations, Op. 31.&lt;ref name=keller /&gt;

On 1 March 1933, just four weeks after [[Adolf Hitler]] had become German Chancellor, Schoenberg resigned from his teaching post in the face of imminent dismissal for being part of what Hitler had described as "the Jewish stranglehold on Western music".&lt;ref name=macca&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VsaFwzCMNa4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22EDWARD+CLARK%22+BUSONI&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VwRtxScsI4&amp;sig=W25hXZJs1gJRYYJj_v4JOWc7Ask&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_9MRUceEAcSZiQecxYGACQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=CLARK&amp;f=false Malcolm MacDonald, ''Schoenberg'']&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Paris on 16 May,&lt;ref name=whit&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/339 Arnold Whittall, ''Schoenberg and the English: Notes for a Documentary'']{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; intending to remain there, but he had no luck in securing a French publisher or any conducting opportunities.&lt;ref name=macca /&gt; He wrote to Edward Clark by postcard later that month, asking him to use his contacts to get him some performances of the [[Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra]], and a British publisher for that work and the Cello Concerto.

Edward Clark may have suggested [[Benjamin Britten]]'s name to [[Alberto Cavalcanti]] of the GPO Film Unit as a young composer he should consider for film scores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.anglia.ac.uk/mpa/pj/GPO.pdf GPO Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Britten's score for ''[[Night Mail]]'' (1936). Clark had planned to have the world premiere of Britten's ''Cantique d'amour'' presented by the BBC in 1936, but perceptions about Britten's personal morality led to the plan being shelved, to Clark's chagrin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iKR339tIo-4C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=benjamin+britten+%22edward+clark%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gkUOUYc9yoqbBavpgZAJ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=clark&amp;f=false Philip Reed, ''On Mahler and Britten: Essays in Honour of Donald Mitchell on His Seventieth ..''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of Edward Clark and [[Constant Lambert]], some of [[Bernard van Dieren]]'s larger works were performed by the BBC in the composer's last years, and just after his death in 1936.&lt;ref name=ivor /&gt;

On 19 January 1936, Hindemith travelled to London, intending to play the British premiere of his viola concerto ''[[Der Schwanendreher]]'', with Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Queen's Hall on 22 January. However, just before midnight on 20 January, [[George V|King George V]] died. The concert was cancelled, but Boult and Clark still wanted Hindemith's involvement in any music that was broadcast in its place. They debated for hours what might be a suitable piece, but nothing could be found, so it was decided that Hindemith should write something new.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wR8EdYaprOAC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=walton+viola+concerto+queens+hall+october+1929&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FP8OUZDdLu72mAWuuIGwBQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=clark&amp;f=false Hindemith's letter of 23 January 1936 to Willy Strecker, in ''Paul Hindemith: Selected Letters'']&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, from 11 am to 5 pm, Hindemith sat in an office made available to him by the BBC and wrote ''[[Trauermusik]]'' in homage to the late king. It, too, was written for viola and orchestra. It was performed that evening in a live broadcast from a BBC radio studio, with Boult conducting and the composer as soloist.

===Resignation from the BBC===
[[File:Arnold schönberg man ray.jpg|thumb|upright|Arnold Schoenberg, 1927, by [[Man Ray]]]]
Clark resigned angrily and abruptly from the BBC on 16 March 1936. The immediate cause of this protest was some alterations to the concert programmes for the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]'s forthcoming European tour, in which he had invested much time and great care. These changes were made without his knowledge and while he was on sick leave, and they included the complete removal of [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''Four Orchestral Pieces'' from the Budapest programme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SIK1vk2c6A0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=edward+clark+BBC+bartok&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1wPw78ibNl&amp;sig=a18jKr0d9eBACUB5CDK_PxcgbEo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pY0MUYTZKsmQiQfw3YGQBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%20BBC%20bartok&amp;f=false Lisa Hardy, ''The British Piano Sonata 1870–1945'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/736466?uid=3737536&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101760091587 jstor, Douglas Jarman, review of Malcolm Gillies, ''Bartók in Britain'']&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this parting of the ways suited many people in the BBC, as it came in the wake of very strong criticism that had been building over a long time about Clark's poor work habits, his general inefficiency, his unpunctuality and missing of important deadlines, his administrative bungling and his unwillingness to communicate with his colleagues about what he was doing, thinking or planning. His dismissal had been considered more than once. His conducting was also the subject of criticism, on the basis that he could not quickly establish rapport with or give strong and unambiguous directions to his players, and he was discouraged from this activity. His personal integrity had also come under question: He took sick leave in 1928 due to severe [[rheumatism]] that necessitated having his affected arm in a sling, but while on leave he conducted orchestras in both London and Prague. Then there was a trip to Europe to negotiate with [[Arturo Toscanini]] about his involvement in the forthcoming BBC Symphony Orchestra's appearances at the [[Florence May Festival]]; Clark changed his travel arrangements at the last minute, he stayed a week longer than he was scheduled to, he still did not complete the task he was sent to do, and the rocky relationship Toscanini already had with the BBC was further soured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=McFbqFNXrHAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=edward+clark+1888+1962&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=anPjXT1Hjm&amp;sig=J31BoMFrNtwXzQZLhV-uVVezPNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ww8JUffBA-aziQfYrIDQBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%201888%201962&amp;f=false Christopher Dyment, ''Toscanini in Britain'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Boult]] backed Clark to the hilt, saying he had done a very good job in very difficult circumstances; but it was too late.

Clark never worked in a steady job again, although he was a consultant to the BBC on certain projects, and continued to conduct on a free-lance basis for a few years until the work dried up.

==After the BBC==
Edward Clark's departure had the effect of relegating [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]] and other members of the Second Viennese School to fringe composers as far as British audiences were concerned, and they were not brought back into the mainstream until [[William Glock]]'s appointment in 1959.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt; The [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]'s repertoire was similarly affected; it became more focused on the works of Romantic and post-Romantic composers for the next 25 years, leaving contemporary music to struggle for limited hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bbc-symphony-orchestra-mn0000231500 allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt; "Tonality had returned to the airwaves", to the relief of many.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/how-avant-garde-got-popular-or-not?page=show Richard Beck, ''How the Avant-Garde Got Popular (or Not)'', ''The Harvard Advocate'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But Clark himself remained busy with the [[ISCM]] and other activities. On 19 April 1936 he was at the ISCM Festival in Barcelona for the world premiere of Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]], played by [[Louis Krasner]]. He arranged for Krasner to come to Britain for the local premiere; in the event, it was a private studio performance on 1 May, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. [[Anton Webern]], who had gone to Barcelona to conduct the world premiere but withdrew at the last minute, fortunately proved up to the task on this occasion.&lt;ref name=krasner&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/1535 Louis Krasner, ''Some Memories of Anton Webern, the Berg Concerto and Vienna in the 1930s'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark's influence was not confined to Britain and Europe. The [[Australia]]n pianist and composer [[Roy Agnew]] heard some of Clark's broadcasts while he was in Britain in the 1920s. He was part of the network of like-minded people who spread the word about emerging compositions throughout the English-speaking world. Between 1937 and 1942 Agnew broadcast his own radio programme, "Modern and Contemporary Music", for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]. This was no doubt strongly influenced by Clark's programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/music/CHOMBEC/chombec-news-4.pdf Kate Bowan, Some Early 20th-Century Australian Music in Context, University of Bristol, CHOMBEC News, Winter 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark produced concert versions of [[Ferruccio Busoni]]'s ''[[Doktor Faust]]'' (1937) and ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (1939), many years before the British stage premiere of either work.&lt;ref name=ivor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/apivor/biog2.htm Music Web International: Denis ApIvor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elisabeth Lutyens==
In 1938 Edward Clark met the composer [[Elisabeth Lutyens]]. In quick succession they became lovers, she left her husband Ian Glennie, she and Clark had a child (her fourth), and they married in 1942. They spent the war years in Newcastle, where he founded the North East Regional Orchestra (NERO).&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

Lutyens was equally well connected with the musical establishment, and was also a friend of [[Igor Stravinsky]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Clark's influence may have been a decisive factor in her adopting [[serialism|serial techniques]].&lt;ref name=riley /&gt; It is certainly the case that her first truly serial composition, the Chamber Concerto No. 1, was completed in 1939, the year after she and Clark became partners, and she dedicated it to him.&lt;ref name=classarch&gt;[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/896757.html#tvf=tracks&amp;tv=about Classical Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

But because he was mostly unemployed now, this meant that Lutyens was the main bread winner for the family of six, and she took on certain commissions she might otherwise have declined. These included her [[film score]]s, which have received latter-day recognition as among her finest creations. She was also prepared to scrub floors to help make ends meet; but Clark would consider nothing but conducting, even though all offers dried up early. He was essentially unemployed for the last 23 years of his life.&lt;ref name=blume&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=e-L5VgUY_0oC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=elisabeth+lutyens+four+children&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2Wq0nSkBxM&amp;sig=NTuD9hB_p26LLsADGijwtn4cCx8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8xsTUaX0Maq6iQfUo4GYDg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=elisabeth%20lutyens%20four%20children&amp;f=false Mary Blume, ''A French Affair: The Paris Beat, 1965–1998'']&lt;/ref&gt; Lutyens said that she hated writing her 1972 autobiography ''A Goldfish Bowl'', and only did so to record Clark's earlier achievements.&lt;ref name=blume /&gt;

In 1945, [[William Walton]] was able to repay Clark's good work from the [[Viola Concerto (Walton)|Viola Concerto]] premiere in 1929. Elisabeth Lutyens approached Walton for an introduction to [[Muir Mathieson]] with a view to getting some film music work. He readily agreed to pass on her name, but he went a step further. He invited Lutyens to write any work she liked, dedicate it to him and he would pay her £100 sight unseen. The work she wrote was ''The Pit''.&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxM_3gNVFUC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=benjamin+britten+%22edward+clark%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gkUOUYc9yoqbBavpgZAJ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=benjamin%20britten%20%22edward%20clark%22&amp;f=false Stephen Lloyd, ''William Walton: Muse of Fire'']&lt;/ref&gt; Clark conducted ''The Pit'' at the 1946 ISCM Festival in London, along with her ''Three Symphonic Preludes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/soundarch/saplayback/playback19.pdf playback, ''The Bulletin of the National Sound Archive'', Summer 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
If not a communist, Clark was always a dedicated socialist, and he was a member of the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR (now the Society for Co-operation in Russian and Soviet Studies, SCRSS). It was in this capacity that in March 1940 he approached firstly [[Clifford Curzon]], who declined, and then [[Moura Lympany]], who agreed, to be the soloist at the UK premiere of [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Khachaturian)|Piano Concerto in D-flat]]. The work was still in manuscript, and there was only one month in which to learn it. The concert was at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 13 April 1940, and the orchestra was conducted by Clark's friend and committed communist [[Alan Bush]].&lt;ref name=ivory /&gt;&lt;ref name=jkach&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/922919?uid=3737536&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101762446497 jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945–46 he presented three concerts at the [[Wigmore Hall]] in London, of music by British and European composers.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; He organised the 1946 London ISCM Festival, a year before being elected the organisation's third President. He been active with the ISCM since its inception in 1922, as Chairman of the British Chapter.&lt;ref name=quad10 /&gt; He was also associated with the London Contemporary Music Centre 1947–52 (where the Australian composer [[Don Banks]] was his secretary),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-ism.org/Papers/graham_MIMS.pdf Graham Hair, ''Musical Ideas, Musical Sounds: A Collection of Essays'']&lt;/ref&gt; and music adviser to the Institute for Contemporary Arts from its inception in 1948.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; [[Humphrey Searle]] became the ISCM's General Secretary with Clark's support.

In 1946 Clark attended the first performance of [[Denis ApIvor]]'s ''Lorca songs'' at a concert for the [[Society for the Promotion of New Music]]. He was impressed, and included these songs in a London Contemporary Music concert at the [[Wigmore Hall]] in 1947. Later that same year, Clark produced ApIvor's Violin Sonata, Op. 9 played by [[Antonio Brosa]] and [[Kyla Greenbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwickmusic.com/Main-Catalogue/Composers/A---C/Denis-ApIvor Warwick Music]&lt;/ref&gt; It was through Clark that ApIvor became interested in [[serialism]].&lt;ref name=routh&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/routh/tradition.htm Music Web International , ''Routh III. The Development of a Tradition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

His administrative skills never improved. In 1947, [[Peggy Glanville-Hicks]], President of the United States branch of the ISCM, was forced to write sharply to him to protest about unanswered correspondence in which the Americans had asked that the ISCM Festival scheduled for June 1948 in Amsterdam be held as late as possible in the month, in order to allow them the chance to attend, given their existing university teaching commitments. In the event, the US branch withdrew from the festival, but Glanville-Hicks attended in her personal capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MZ50ojGMfKYC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=edward+clark+iscm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L_hez0gXNn&amp;sig=phQOfrvlfuK_dW9_6ngN63TLSuU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0PIIUfn2LMmBiQfHwIDQDw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%20iscm&amp;f=false James Murdoch, ''Peggy Glanville-Hicks: A Transposed Life'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, for the BBC's Third Programme, Clark presented "Turning Points in Twentieth-Century Music", a series of eight programmes of his own creation, which looked at the composers [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

He gave the Commemoration Speech before the London Opera Guild's 'Arnold Schoenberg Memorial Concert' on 16 December 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/1503] Letter from [[Hans Keller]] to the ''Music Review'', 17 December 1951. Retrieved 4 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 Sir [[William Walton]] used his contacts to secure a Civil List pension for Clark.&lt;ref name=lloyd /&gt;

In 1955, [[Benjamin Frankel]] succeeded Clark as Chairman of the ISCM. That year issues arose about certain expenses Clark had claimed while he was Chairman. Clark alleged that Frankel had falsely accused him of fraud. Frankel denied he had ever made any such claim, but nevertheless said that such a claim, had he made it, would have been true. This amounted to slander as far as Clark was concerned, and he sued Frankel in the High Court. As part of the arguments, various allegations of communist sub-plots were given an airing. While Frankel's alleged slander itself was unproven, the jury exonerated Clark of any wrongdoing and he felt this meant his integrity was intact.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; Elisabeth Lutyens ever after referred to Frankel as "composer and ex-colleague".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NSQQx-D2EO0C&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=edward+clark+iscm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oxq734r5Xn&amp;sig=DH3SVUhzk4jTx7Gx3ufCmXqdBR8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lvUIUabmKaWjiAeW0YCgAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK David Huckvale, ''Hammer Film Scores and the Musical Avant-Garde'', p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 and 1961 he used his influence to have Denis ApIvor's opera ''Yerma'' broadcast by the BBC after the Sadler's Wells Theatre refused to mount the production (even though it had been commissioned by the Sadler's Wells Trust).&lt;ref name=routh /&gt; It was conducted by [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Sir Eugene Goossens]].

Edward Clark died suddenly of a [[coronary thrombosis]] in London on 30 April 1962, aged 73. Stravinsky wept on hearing of Clark's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/apivor/warlock_circle.htm ''Memories of The Warlock Circle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 1951 the [[Internationale Gesellschaft für Neue Musik]] (IGNM) awarded Edward Clark the Arnold Schoenberg Medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rs5.loc.gov/service/music/eadxmlmusic/eadpdfmusic/2003/mu003012.pdf Moldenhauer Archives at the Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Dorothy Stephen===
On 10 August 1921 he married Frances Dorothy ("Dolly") Stephen (18 December 1893 – 1971),&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=stan /&gt; who was related to the literary Stephen family (including Sir [[Leslie Stephen]] and his daughter [[Virginia Woolf]]).&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt; Clark's and Dolly's son James Royston Clark was born in 1923. Dolly left him in the summer of 1925, taking James with her.

====The Eckersley affair====
Dolly later went to work for the BBC as a secretary,&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt; and had an affair with Clark's colleague, the engineer [[Peter Eckersley (engineer)|Peter Eckersley]]. This seemed to have Clark's blessing, as on one occasion he even arranged for Eckersley to visit Germany on BBC business, and for Dolly to accompany him.&lt;ref name=BBC90&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/in-depth/reith_6.shtml BBC Celebrating 90 Years]&lt;/ref&gt; Eckersley was married, but although he and Dolly made no secret of their liaison, his wife Stella was unaware. It was Muriel Reith, the wife of the BBC Director-General [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], who broke the news to her.&lt;ref name=BBC90 /&gt; John Reith was strictly puritanical about such matters (although his own private life was questionable), and he was most unwilling to have a senior staff member on the payroll who was known to be conducting an adulterous affair or in the process of divorcing his own wife. Top level conferences were held; the Archbishop of Canterbury was even consulted.&lt;ref name=johns&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r1656j5sqRAC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Dorothy+Eckersley+fascist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aOlh4UDCDE&amp;sig=bPCkUSqBrq0cPDg_wjgTZqHXq50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OeoNUfegN7C0iQeJ_oCgAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Dorothy%20Eckersley%20fascist&amp;f=false Adrian Johns, ''Death of a Pirate: British Radio and the Making of the Information Age'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eckersley was not sacked immediately, as he undertook to end the affair with Dolly Clark and return to his wife. But nature took its course, he and Dolly reunited, and he resigned in April 1929.&lt;ref name=stan /&gt; The Eckersley affair prompted a public enquiry into the BBC's personnel practices.&lt;ref name=doctor /&gt;

Dolly Clark and Peter Eckersley were married on 25 October 1930.&lt;ref name=stan /&gt;

====Dolly Eckersley's German sojourn====
She had always been very much pro-Nazi in her politics.&lt;ref name=wire /&gt; She was known as a strongly pro-German fascist and a fanatical admirer of [[Adolf Hitler]]. She was a friend of [[William Joyce]] ("Lord Haw-Haw") and [[Unity Mitford]], and a member of [[Arnold Leese]]'s [[Imperial Fascist League]].&lt;ref name=wire&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nvRNx6YM7LIC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=james+clark+william+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lkcHPdkU0Y&amp;sig=IbS787TWdl8nidb7STJxrQEYUH8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C18MUeOKBI2tiQfQ-ICQDA&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=clark&amp;f=false Martin Doherty, ''Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the ...'']&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Eckersley himself held similar opinions. After they met Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], he became involved in his [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], chairing its London Central Committee. He travelled throughout Europe constantly in a quest to expand the reach of international radio broadcasts; he claimed there were no sinister political motives behind his activities, but that they were simply his attempt to make himself very rich. From November 1939 the transmitter he had arranged to put in place at Osterloog became the vehicle for William Joyce's broadcasts to Britain and Europe. Joyce was later hanged for treason, and Eckersley has been described as "at best a foolish Fascist fellow traveller and at worst a traitor".&lt;ref name=johns /&gt; As for Dolly, she joined Mosley's [[British Union of Fascists]], but outdid Mosley in her enthusiasm for the Nazi concept of fascism.&lt;ref name=johns /&gt; She also joined the National Socialist League, which had been founded by William Joyce after he was expelled by Mosley for being too anti-semitic.&lt;ref name=johns /&gt;

The Eckersleys took their holidays in Germany a number of times, and attended the Nuremberg rallies in 1937 and 1938.&lt;ref name=stan /&gt; In July 1939 Dorothy took her and Edward Clark's 16-year-old son James to a Nuremberg rally, and also attended the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;ref name=wire /&gt; She had a chance encounter with William Joyce in August and got him a job as a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When Britain declared war in September, she felt no need to return to her own country but decided to stay. James was enrolled in a German school, and gained "a very favourable impression of Germany under Nazi rule".&lt;ref name=wire /&gt; In December 1939 she commenced work for the radio station [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]] (RRG), a propaganda machine for [[Joseph Goebbels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8bitmode.com/mosleynotes/mosleynotespt5.pdf Mosleynotes]&lt;/ref&gt; She was initially employed as an English-language announcer and later on office duties. James, although only aged 16, was taken out of school to also be a newsreader there. He changed his name to Richard, to sound less Jewish and more [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]].&lt;ref name=johns /&gt; He worked there on and off until July 1942; she continued until January 1943. For obscure reasons they were arrested by the Gestapo in December 1944 and incarcerated till the end of the war.&lt;ref name=johns /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Murphy, ''Letting the Side Down: British Traitors of the Second World War'', Stroud, 2006, PP 70-2&lt;/ref&gt; They were liberated by the British, but promptly re-arrested. They were both tried in London in October 1945 for assisting the enemy by broadcasting. Dorothy was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison. James, still only 22, pleaded he had been hypnotised as an impressionable youth by the trappings and tricks of Nazi propaganda; this was accepted, and he was [[binding over|bound over]] for two years.&lt;ref name=wire /&gt;

Dorothy Eckersley died in 1971.&lt;ref name=stan&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I29172&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; James Clark became an editor and translator&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/james-clark-james-royston-clark-b-1923-son-of-dorothy-eckersley-traitor-and-second-in-command-in-berlin-to-nazi-collaborator-'lord-haw-haw'-william-joyce/page-1/ abebooks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsburyauctions.com/detail/35884/298.0 Bloomsbury.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and died in 2012.

===Elisabeth Lutyens===
In 1938 Edward Clark met the composer [[Elisabeth Lutyens]], who was married to the baritone Ian Glennie. She and Clark quickly became lovers,&lt;ref name=riley&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IBRzav2pL9AC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=peter+warlock++edward+clark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p_qnmQV6sD&amp;sig=Vzq33jexnO-2dpb3LpnMWzg7A8k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=foQMUbqLOpGViAe-u4DoBA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=clark&amp;f=false Matthew Riley, ''British Music and Modernism, 1895–1960'']&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year she left Glennie for Clark, taking her and Glennie's three children (a son and twin daughters) with her. In 1941 Clark gave her a fourth child (a son, Conrad) before marrying her on 9 May 1942.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

Their son Conrad Clark became a sculptor, designer and painter; he moved to [[Australia]] and now lives in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://conradclark.com.au/profile.htm Conrad Clark website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2591305610/lutyens-elisabeth-19061983.html Encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Frank Aubrey Newsam''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|GCB|KBE|CVO|MC}} (13 November 1893 – 25 April 1964) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|civil servant]] notable for his service as [[Permanent Secretary|Permanent Under-Secretary of State]] to the [[Home Office]] from 1948 to 1957, although he had been a central figure for many years previously. His strong leadership abilities had a dominating effect on the character of his department, in which he served for all but a few months of his career. His principal interest during this time was the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|Police service]], for which he created the [[Police Staff College, Bramshill|Police Staff College]] at Bramshill. At his best in a crisis, his contribution to the recovery after the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] was particularly praised.

A man of great energy and drive, Newsam's tendency to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant that he was not automatically popular with the [[Home Secretary|Home Secretaries]] under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer things in life. His eventual successor [[Philip Allen, Baron Allen of Abbeydale|Philip Allen]] regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.&lt;ref name="Character"&gt;A. W. Brian Simpson, "In the Highest Degree Odious", [[Oxford University Press]], 1992, p. 41-2. Simpson quotes a memorable [[clerihew]] about Newsam written by J. M. Ross of the Home Office:&lt;p&gt;Sir Frank Newsam&lt;br&gt;Affected to look gruesome,&lt;br&gt;Which carried great weight&lt;br&gt;With successive Secretaries of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and war service==
Newsam was born in [[Barbados]], where his father William Elias Newsam held a post in the British [[Colonial Service]]. He went to school at [[Harrison College (Barbados)|Harrison College]] in Barbados, and then won an open [[scholarship]] in [[classics]] to [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1911. Newsam graduated in 1915 with second classes in each of [[Honour Moderations|Mods]] and [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]],&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB"&gt;[[Philip Allen, Baron Allen of Abbeydale|Allen of Abbeydale]], "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35219 Newsam, Sir Frank Aubrey] (1893–1964)", [[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edn., January 2008, accessed 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; his failure to take a first being later ascribed to his desire to enjoy life while at university.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Austin Strutt, "Newsam, Sir Frank Aubrey (1893–1964)", [[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1961–1970, [[Oxford University Press]], 1981, p. 791-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam (who had been a member of the Inns of Court [[Officer Training Corps]]) was then commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]].&lt;ref name="Commissioned"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29317 |date=5 October 1915 |page=9857 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw active service in Ireland and was wounded during the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916; during the [[First World War]] he served in Belgium, France, the Punjab and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; In September 1918, while a [[Lieutenant]], he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]; the citation referred to him going "forward collecting all stragglers and reorganising the line when one of the companies commenced to retire", so restoring the offensive capability of his unit.&lt;ref name="MC award"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30901 |date=13 September 1918 |page=10994 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the war, Newsam served with the first battalion of the [[16th Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|30th Punjabis]] in India&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; (in October 1919 he was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Indian Army (1895–1947)|Indian Army]] Reserve of Officers).&lt;ref name="Captain"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31891 |date=7 May 1920 |page=5252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served again in Ireland after the [[armistice]], but after demobilisation in 1919&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; he joined the teaching staff at [[Harrow School]] under Dr [[Lionel Ford]].&lt;ref name="Times obituary"&gt;"Sir Frank Newsam" (obituary), ''The Times'', 27 April 1964, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam was at Harrow for only a brief period while waiting for the result of the Class I Competition for the Home Civil Service.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; In July 1920 he was informed that he had passed, and he then joined the Children's Division of the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

Newsam made his mark in the division, and in 1924 was picked by the then [[Permanent Secretary]] Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], as Anderson's own private secretary. Having come to trust Newsam's abilities, Anderson retained him in this post despite Newsam's promotion to principal in 1925.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; There were some who saw him as a "power behind the throne" in assisting Anderson.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; In 1927, Anderson placed Newsam in an even more pivotal post as Principal Private Secretary to the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State for Home Affairs]] ([[Home Secretary]]) – responsible for administering the office of the political head of the department. Newsam held this key position for over five years, assisting Home Secretaries [[William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford|William Joynson-Hicks]] ('Jix'), [[J. R. Clynes]], Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], and [[Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Gilmour]]. Especially after Anderson left in 1932 (his successor Sir [[Russell Scott (civil servant)|Russell Scott]] came from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] with little knowledge of the operation of the Home Office), no other civil servant rivalled his experience.&lt;ref name="Times obituary" /&gt; For his part, Newsam learned a great deal about the operations of senior politicians and of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

==Assistant Secretary==
A round of changes in civil service appointments at the Home Office in June 1933 saw Newsam, now promoted&lt;ref name="Changes at Home Office"&gt;"Changes At The Home Office", ''The Times'', 8 June 1933, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; to Assistant Secretary, take charge of a new division. His first responsibility was to guide into law the [[1934 Betting and Lotteries Act|Betting and Lotteries Act 1934]],&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; but he soon began to handle other sensitive matters.  He was also appointed [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] in the 1933 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33946|supp=y|page=3805|date=2 June 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam sat on a departmental committee of inquiry into [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom|Firearms]] in 1934,&lt;ref name="Firearms"&gt;"Definition Of Firearms", ''The Times'', 3 February 1934, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and this was followed by the problem of addressing the disorder caused by fighting between members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and its opponents. Newsam played a large role in devising and then implementing the [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned all political uniforms and was seen as effective in returning order to the streets.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

==World War II==
1938 saw Newsam moved to take charge of the criminal division, where he began preparations for a major Criminal Justice Bill; however the advancing threat of war led to it being put off (in the event, most of the provisions were enacted in the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]]).&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; Late in 1938, Newsam was selected as Principal Officer in the South Eastern Civil Defence region; this role meant that should war break out, he would be Chief of Staff to the Regional Commissioner.&lt;ref name="Times obituary" /&gt; He duly took up his post in September 1939 but after only a few months in [[Tunbridge Wells]], he was recalled to London to take charge of the criminal and aliens divisions,&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; now with the rank of Assistant Under-Secretary of State.&lt;ref name="Times obituary" /&gt;

In April 1941 Newsam's appointment to Deputy Under-Secretary of State was announced.&lt;ref name="Dep Sec"&gt;"The Home Office", ''The Times'', 21 April 1941, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He was now the second most senior civil servant in the Home Office&lt;ref name="Guy Liddell diaries"&gt;See, e.g., [[Guy Liddell]]'s diary entry for 4 August 1943 in which Liddell arranges to inform Newsam about [[United Kingdom Security Service|MI5]]'s 'Plan Bunbury', involving blowing up a decoy power station – vol. II, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a special responsibility for security. Newsam negotiated with the [[United States]] how to handle criminal offences committed by American soldiers in the United Kingdom, the agreement being enacted in the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942. With the Home Office responsible for relations with the [[Crown Dependencies]], Newsam drew up plans for the restoration of life in the [[Channel Islands]] once [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation]] was ended.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; Newsam's plans were subsequently put into effect in 1945, and led to a long association with the islands where he helped reform constitutions and develop their legal and administrative systems.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

Having been in charge of [[internment]] of enemy aliens and suspected fascist sympathisers under [[Defence Regulation 18B]], Newsam had in 1944 to consider the vexed question of what to do with the 'Red Book' containing the membership list from [[Archibald Maule Ramsay]]'s 'Right Club', after Ramsay was released from detention. After discussing the question with a colleague, the idea came up that it may be necessary to illegally destroy the book and then take the chance that Ramsay would get only token damages out of any legal action that might ensue. In the end, the book was returned to Ramsay.&lt;ref name="Red Book"&gt;Richard Griffiths, "Patriotism Perverted", Constable, 1998, p. 309-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam became Sir Frank in 1943 when he was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name="KBE"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35841 |date=29 December 1942 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policing===
It was towards the end of the war that Newsam's particular interest in the police force began to take shape. His first task was to reform the large number of very small police forces, as many [[municipal borough]]s that were not especially large had a separate constabulary. Wartime powers had forced some to amalgamate, but Newsam needed to go further.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; Conscious that a Whitehall takeover was feared, in May 1945 he spoke to the conference of the Chief Constables' Association to reassure them that there would be no regional or national police forces.&lt;ref name="No regional"&gt;"News in brief", ''The Times'', 1 June 1945, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually drafted the [[Police Act 1946]] which abolished nearly all the borough police forces outside [[County borough]]s, and allowed for more amalgamations.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; Once the Act was passed, Newsam again reassured the police that there was no question of regionalisation or nationalisation because "such an idea is an anathema to the Home Office".&lt;ref name="Anathema"&gt;"No State Police Force", ''The Times'', 27 September 1946, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Newsam also looked into the whole policing service from 1944, and became personally committed to the idea of establishing a national staff college for the police.&lt;ref name="Staff college"&gt;See the [[white paper]] "Higher Training for the Police Service in England and Wales" ([[Command paper|Cmnd.]] 7070), published 20 March 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw that the project found the land needed for its buildings (at Bramshill, near [[Hartley Wintney]] in [[Hampshire]]), and became the founder chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[Police Staff College, Bramshill|Police Staff College]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Chairman, Board of Governors"&gt;"Police College Board Of Governors", ''The Times'', 25 August 1947, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He retained this role for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

==Permanent Secretary==
On 10 August 1948 it was announced that Sir [[Alexander Maxwell (civil servant)|Alexander Maxwell]] was to retire at the end of September, and that Newsam had been appointed to follow him as Permanent Secretary at the Home Office.&lt;ref name="Appointed Permanent Secretary"&gt;"Sir Alexander Maxwell To Retire", ''The Times'', 11 August 1948, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect this was a delayed promotion; Newsam was already 54, and might easily have reached the rank earlier.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; At first he had to deal with [[James Chuter Ede|Chuter Ede]] as Home Secretary, with whom he had an uneasy relationship (Ede was believed not to trust Newsam's judgment).&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; With Ede maintaining control over the department, Newsam had to deal with routine matters including presenting evidence to the [[Royal Commission]] on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming.&lt;ref name="Betting Commission"&gt;"Growth Of Pool Betting", ''The Times'', 21 July 1949, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

However Newsam did make an important contribution to British relations with [[Northern Ireland]] after [[Taoiseach]] [[John A. Costello]] revealed his government's intention to declare [[Ireland]] a Republic. In discussions in December 1948, Newsam first suggested passing a law declaring that Northern Ireland could not be removed from the [[United Kingdom]] without the consent of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]]. Such a provision was included in the [[Ireland Act 1949]].&lt;ref name="Stormont guarantee"&gt;Ronan Fanning, "The Response of the London and Belfast Governments to the Declaration of the Republic of Ireland, 1948–49", ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'', vol. 58 no. 1 (Winter 1981-2), pp. 95–114, esp. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1950 New Year Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38797|supp=y|page=3|date=30 December 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservative government==
After the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, Newsam's activity and knowledge of his department enabled him to assert himself and he was thought to have almost eclipsed the Home Secretaries who were nominally superior. Newsam preferred to deal direct with the Home Secretary, eschewing even the junior Ministers in the department.&lt;ref name="Eclipse"&gt;[[Anthony Seldon]], "Churchill's Indian Summer", Hodder and Stoughton, 1981, pp. 107, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Newsam accepted the invitation to write a book explaining the work of the Home Office for "The New Whitehall Series", a series intended "to provide authoritative descriptions of the present work of the major Departments of the Central Government" published by [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd]]; his was the first to appear.&lt;ref name="New Whitehall Series"&gt;Sir Frank Newsam, "The Home Office", George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1954, frontispiece.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital punishment===
One of Newsam's principal concerns was the operation of [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]]. While Deputy Under-Secretary he had strongly advised against reprieving [[John Amery]], son of a leading Conservative politician who had pleaded guilty to treason during [[World War II]];  he believed that reprieving Amery would be a weak move that would look like a political fix.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kenny, "Germany Calling", New Island, Dublin, 2003, p. 238. Note that Kenny mis-spells Newsam's surname as 'Newsum'.&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed a reprieve for [[William Joyce]] (nicknamed [[Lord Haw-Haw]]), convicted of treason for propaganda broadcasting during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kenny, "Germany Calling", New Island, Dublin, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Newsam gave evidence for the Home Office at the [[Royal Commission]] on Capital Punishment under Sir [[Ernest Gowers]], largely defending the established system.&lt;ref name="Gowers commission"&gt;"Death Penalty Inquiry", ''The Times'', 5 August 1949, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he became Permanent Secretary, Newsam had personal involvement in the process whereby the Home Secretary decided whether to reprieve those condemned to death; for instance, he signed the letters informing the prisoners' families of the Home Secretary's decision.&lt;ref name="Reprieve letter"&gt;William George Bentley, "My Son's Execution", W.H. Allen, 1957, p. 147-9. William Bentley protests at the callousness and inhumanity of the Home Office sending the letter by ordinary post (rather than by special messenger) on a Saturday so that it arrived on Monday, only two days before the date fixed for execution of the death sentence; he also notes that the family were receiving thousands of letters at this point and that the '[[O.H.M.S.]]' envelope was lost among them. However he does not identify Newsam personally with this treatment.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also received the families and legal representatives of those condemned to death while they pleaded for a reprieve from the Home Secretary. On 12 July 1955, Newsam was summoned back from [[Ascot Racecourse]] to meet [[Ruth Ellis]]' solicitor who wished to present new evidence.&lt;ref name="Ascot"&gt;[[Jonathan Goodman]] and Patrick Pringle, "The Trial of Ruth Ellis" (Celebrated Trials Series), David &amp; Charles, 1974, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In another murder case, William Bentley wrote that Newsam spent an hour with him and his daughter while they related the difficult medical history of his condemned son [[Derek Bentley case|Derek Bentley]], and that "Sir Frank listened sympathetically, but made no comment".&lt;ref name="William Bentley"&gt;William George Bentley, "My Son's Execution", W.H. Allen, 1957, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Material released by the [[Public Record Office]] in 1992 revealed that Newsam had argued for a reprieve with the words "My own view is towards leniency".&lt;ref name="Leniency"&gt;[[John Mullin (journalist)|John Mullin]], Richard Norton-Taylor, "Home Secretary ignored officials' reprieve advice", ''The Guardian'', 2 October 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Allen, Baron Allen of Abbeydale|Philip Allen]] later wrote that Newsam was "gravely concerned" when Home Secretary [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]] disregarded his recommendation and refused to reprieve Bentley.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

As a civil servant, Newsam's own views on capital punishment were not public. Long after Newsam's death, an academic journal article reported three separate views of people who knew Newsam well, all of whom believed that he supported retaining capital punishment.&lt;ref name="Retentionist"&gt;Victor Bailey, "The Shadow of the Gallows: The Death Penalty and the British Labour Government, 1945–51", ''Law and History Review'', University of Illinois Press, vol. 18 no. 2 (Summer 2000), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his career, Newsam developed the important distinction between capital and non-capital murder, which was enacted in the [[Homicide Act 1957]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

===Emergency planning===
[[Image:TB 1953 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sea defences are breached at [[Erith]] during the 1953 flood.]]
The Home Office had the responsibility of dealing with any civil emergency matter which might arise, and Newsam took personal charge as chairman of the official committee on emergencies. In 1953 the storm tide of the [[North Sea]] caused severe [[North Sea flood of 1953|flooding along the East coast]]; Newsam controlled the direction of all the resources of the government in repairing sea defences and homes, including taking charge of very large numbers of troops who provided an emergency workforce.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; [[Rab Butler]] wrote that he "had almost literally taken charge of the country" and "secured achievements that would have surprised [[Cnut the Great#Ruler of the waves|Canute]]".&lt;ref name="1953 Floods"&gt;[[Rab Butler|Lord Butler]], "The art of the possible: the memoirs of Lord Butler, K. G., C.H.", Hamish Hamilton, 1971, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main business of the emergencies committee was to cope with strikes, and here Newsam was cautious that the Government should not intervene incorrectly or excessively (particularly if asked to call out troops), because the likely effect would be to cause the strike to spread.&lt;ref name="Strikes"&gt;Keir Thorpe, "'Rendering the Strike Innocuous': The British Government's Response to Industrial Disputes in Essential Industries, 1953–55", Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 35 no. 4 (October 2000), pp. 577–600, especially p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam was thought to have been at his best in an emergency when he had to be decisive and authoritative.&lt;ref name="Emergency"&gt;[[Anthony Seldon]], "Churchill's Indian Summer", Hodder and Stoughton, 1981, p. 123; Newsam's anonymous obituarist in ''The Times'' says the same.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1955 he was appointed [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40529|page=3881|date=5 July 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Possibly this was related to his efforts in the wake of the floods --&gt;

===Other issues===
In 1954 Newsam was caught up in a diplomatic incident over Antoni Klimowicz, a 24-year-old [[Poland|Polish]] man who stowed away on the ship ''Jarosław Dąbrowski'' and attempted to go ashore in London and claim [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. Klimowicz was spotted by the crew and detained on the ship.&lt;ref name="Klimowicz background"&gt;"Poles Seek Freedom For Stowaway", ''The Times'', 31 July 1954, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam sent Home Office lawyers to obtain a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and then arranged for 120 police officers, led in person by the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis]] (Sir [[John Nott-Bower]]) to board the ship and rescue Klimowicz&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; on 31 July.&lt;ref name="Klimowicz rescued"&gt;"Police Search Of Polish Vessel", ''The Times'', 2 August 1954, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Embassy protested,&lt;ref name="Polish protest"&gt;"Protest By Poland", ''The Times'', 5 August 1954, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  but Klimowicz was allowed to stay.&lt;ref name="Klimowicz to stay"&gt;"Pole To Remain In Britain", ''The Times'', 7 August 1954, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

However Newsam's intervention in another matter was less successful: in late 1956 Home Secretary [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]] accepted Newsam's advice and authorised the [[telephone tapping]] of [[Billy Hill (gangster)|Billy Hill]], a known criminal. At the time gang warfare had broken out in London between Hill and rival gangster [[Jack Spot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], ''Bench Of The Honourable Society Of Lincoln's Inn Charges Against Barrister In Re Marrinan'', 28 June 1957&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bar council]] approached the police and requested the tapes in order to provide evidence for an investigation into the professional conduct of Hill's [[barrister]], Patrick Marrinan.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

When this use of tapping powers was revealed in June 1957 (by which time [[Rab Butler]] had succeeded Lloyd George), there was a major row with the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Hugh Gaitskell]] demanding a full explanation. Butler pledged that it would not be a precedent and that he would consider withdrawing the evidence and asking the Bar council to disregard it.&lt;ref name="Gaitskell demand"&gt;"Mr. Butler's Promise On Telephone Tapping", ''The Times'', 8 June 1957, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Marrinan was subsequently [[Disbarment|disbarred]] and expelled by [[Lincoln's Inn]],&lt;ref name="Marrinan disbarred"&gt;"Mr. Marrinan Disbarred", ''The Times'', 4 July 1957, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; but Butler was forced to appoint a committee of [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Counsellors]] under [[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Sir Norman Birkett]] to look into the [[Royal prerogative|prerogative]] power of intercepting telephone communications.&lt;ref name="Birkett committee"&gt;"'Tapping' Inquiry By Privy Councillors", ''The Times'', 29 June 1957, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
When Rab Butler arrived at the Home Office, he quickly decided that his own wish to take charge and reform the department was likely to bring him into conflict with Newsam. He quietly persuaded Newsam to retire.&lt;ref name="Butler pressure"&gt;[[Anthony Howard (journalist)|Anthony Howard]], "RAB: the life of R.A. Butler", Jonathan Cape, 1987, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; For his part Newsam was well beyond normal retirement age for a civil servant&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; and accepted, fixing his last day in office as 30 September 1957.&lt;ref name="Retirement"&gt;"Sir Frank Newsam To Retire", ''The Times'', 1 June 1957, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after his retirement was announced, Newsam was promoted [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in the Queen's Birthday Honours.&lt;ref name="GCB"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=41089 |date=4 June 1957 |page=3369 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement, Newsam was commissioned by the [[British Medical Association]] to report into whether it was realistic for doctors to withdraw from the [[National Health Service]] should their pay demand be rejected.&lt;ref name="BMA inquiry"&gt;"Doctors' Claim For Higher Pay", ''The Times'', 8 January 1959, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the threat to withdraw was unrealistic, and that public opinion would not easily forgive a move on behalf of doctors to undermine the NHS. Newsam's conclusion was unwelcome to the BMA which officially dissociated itself from it.&lt;ref name="BMA report"&gt;"Health Service Report Warns B.M.A.", ''The Times'', 16 January 1959, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the police committee of the [[British Transport Commission]]. Newsam's health had begun to decline during his last years in office, and he died of [[cancer]] at his home in [[Paddington]] on 25 April 1964.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; His name lived on as the Police Staff College inaugurated the 'Frank Newsam Memorial Lectures' on criminal justice matters.&lt;ref name="Memorial lectures"&gt;"Lord Devlin On Time-Wasting Courts", ''The Times'', 10 December 1965, p. 6. The series seems to come to an end.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Newsam was described by Philip Allen, who served under him, as a "born leader" and a superb chairman of any meeting, with a strong personality which tended to drive his solutions forward. He was a good negotiator, but Allen and others agreed that Newsam could show impatience and intolerance if other people disagreed with him. While a very good professional administrator, his interest was not in organisation but in problem-solving. In speech he was said to be eloquent and able to produce surprising pieces of knowledge; and several comment on the fact that he had good looks which suggested foreign origins.&lt;ref name="Foreign"&gt;Sir Austin Strutt writing in the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] described Newsam as "good looking in a rather Latin way", which A.W. Brian Simpson states to be a reference to "supposed partially African descent". By contrast Philip Allen says Newsam had "a touch of the Caribbean".&lt;/ref&gt; Newsam enjoyed gambling on horse-racing and enjoyed high living; he was known to drink a great deal.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

Newsam's wife Janet, whom he married in December 1927, was from [[South Africa]]. She left London to live in [[Wylye, Wiltshire|Wylye]], [[Wiltshire]] during World War II, and liked the countryside so much that she never returned to live in London. Newsam saw her most weekends but remained living in London after he retired; the couple remained very friendly but did not see much of each other, and they had no children.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Zazou was born in 1954.&lt;ref name=aahram312/&gt; He holds a bachelor of arts degree in commerce from [[Ain Shams University]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=aahram312/&gt;

==Career==
Zazou began his career in the City Bank Group for five years in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=aahram312/&gt; Then he helped to establish a tourist agency in the US focusing on the Egyptian market and began to work in the tourism field. From 2004 to 2007, Zazou served as the chair of the Egyptian Tourism Federation.&lt;ref name=aahram312/&gt;

==Political career==
During the Mubarak era, in 2009, Zazou served as the first deputy of the minister of tourism.&lt;ref name=abou&gt;{{cite web|title=Zazou: The Egyptian Agenda is Eventful to Attract Arab Tourists|url=http://www.abou-alhool.com/arabic1/details.php?id=20867|publisher=Abou|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Egyptian uprising, he served as senior assistant to former tourism minister [[Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour]].&lt;ref name=aahram312&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's new economy ministers: Who's who|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/0/49287/Business/0/Egypts-new-economy-ministers-Whos-who.aspx|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=Al Ahram|date=3 August 2012|author=Ahmed Feteha|author2=Bassem Abo Al Abass|author3=Nesma Nowar}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2012, Zazou began to serve as tourism minister in the cabinet of [[Hesham Qandil]].&lt;ref name="Sworn in"/&gt; Although Zazou submitted his resignation on 1 July 2013, it was announced by the state news agency [[MENA]] on 15 July that he would continue to serve as tourism minister in the cabinet of interim prime minister [[Hazem Al Beblawi]].&lt;ref name=cnn15july&gt;{{cite news|title=Post-Morsy Egypt forging government of technocrats|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/14/world/meast/egypt-government|accessdate=15 July 2013|work=CNN|date=15 July 2013|author=Nick Paton-Walsh|author2=Schams Elazar|author3=Joe Sterling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zazou sworn in on 16 July.&lt;ref name=whoswho16&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's first post-Morsi cabinet - who's who|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/76609/Egypt/Politics-/UPDATE--Egypts-first-postMorsi-cabinet--whos-who-.aspx|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=Ahram Online|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement on tourism following attack in Sinai===

Following a [[2012 Egyptian–Israeli border attack|fatal attack]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in August 2012, in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by armed men who subsequently infiltrated into Israel and were killed by the [[Israel Air Force]], Zazou denied that there was a negative impact on tourism following the attack, and said that tourism agencies did not cancelled reservations and that he was personally calling them to make sure. Zazou stressed that tourists should feel secure in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Tourism"/&gt;

===Resignations===

In June 2013, Zazou submitted his resignation in protest at President Morsi's appointment of a member of [[Construction and Development Party|the Construction and Development party]] as governor of [[Luxor]] - this party being associated with the [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Jama'a al-Islamiya]] group, which had killed 62 tourists and local tourism-industry workers in the 1997 [[November 1997 Luxor massacre|Luxor Massacre]]. Zazou's resignation placed him at the head of a mass protest from all quarters of the [[Tourism in Egypt|Egyptian tourism industry]], a main source of foreign currency that is vital to the country's economy. Prime Minister Hisham Qandil "refused the resignation and asked him to stay at his post to review the situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.nuqudy.com/North_Africa/Egypt_Morsi_Promote-5874|title=Egypt: Morsi Promotes Man Behind Attacks Against Tourists|publisher=Nuqudy|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the new governor resigned instead.&lt;ref name=alakh19june&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt tourism minister resigns over controversial new governor|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/egypt-tourism-minister-resigns-over-controversial-new-governor|accessdate=21 June 2013|newspaper=Al Akhbar|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he and four other ministers resigned from office on 1 July due to government's reaction to mass demonstrations in the country. Then prime minister Qandil refused to accept Zazou's resignation, however, and asked him to remain in the post.&lt;ref name=ahram1july&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Egyptian ministers resign|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75402/Egypt/Politics-/Four-Egyptian-ministers-resign.aspx|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=Ahram Online|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hocine Achiou''' (born April 27, 1979) is a former [[Algeria national football team|Algerian]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] and current manager of the [[Algeria national under-20 football team]].

Achiou was a member of the [[Algeria national football team|Algeria national team]] at the [[2004 Africa Cup of Nations]] where he scored a wonderful individual goal against rivals Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3439711.stm|title=Algeria shock Egypt|author=Obayiuwana, Osasu|publisher=BBC|date=January 29, 2004|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football career==
Achiou started his playing career with ES Ben Aknoun before joining the junior ranks of [[USM Alger]]. He would eventually sign his first professional contract with the club. Achiou was an important member of the team's African Champions League run in 2003 and 2004. USM Alger made the final eight (group stage) in both those years and even made it to the semi-final in 2003 when they lost 3–2 on aggregate to eventual champions [[Enyimba FC]].

He had numerous opportunities to join European clubs but the player could not agree on financial terms with the clubs. He had trials with Premiership-sides [[Fulham FC]] and [[Portsmouth FC]] and French clubs [[CS Sedan]] and [[FC Lorient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news.php?hot_id=1808M |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402015123/http://www.dzfoot.com/news.php?hot_id=1808M |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hocine finally signed a one-year deal with Swiss club [[FC Aarau]] in the summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.maxifoot.com/info-054902_60831/football.php|title=Aarau : débuts européens pour Achiou|website=news.maxifoot.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a goal in his first league game against [[FC St. Gallen]]. In the summer of 2007, he left [[FC Aarau]] after just one season and immediately joined his former team USM Alger. In January 2009, he joined [[JS Kabylie]]. َAfter six successful months, he returned to his former team USM Alger.  In the summer of 2011, he left USM Alger definitively to join [[ASO Chlef]]. In January 2013, he joined [[MC Oran]]. In the summer of 20013, he joined [[USM Bel-Abbès]] and he led him to return to the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]]. In January 2016, he joined [[RC Arbaâ]]. In January 2017, he joined [[WA Boufarik]].

==International career==
Achiou was part of the Algerian team that finished second in their group in the first round of the [[2004 African Nations Cup]] behind [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] before being defeated by [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] in the quarter-finals. Achiou had scored an important goal against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in one of the group stage matches that was instrumental in helping Algeria reach the quarterfinals. Achiou also scored a goal against Zimbabwe which would be the difference in the tie-breaker against Egypt, and ultimately qualify Algeria to the quarter-finals. Achiou has 25 caps for the Algerian national team and has scored 3 goals.

'''John Gaston "Jack" Fox''' (March 5, 1916&amp;nbsp;– July 24, 1980) was an American nuclear physicist.  He earned his PhD from Princeton in 1941 and was soon recruited to work on the [[Manhattan Project]]. He later moved to Pittsburgh where he spent the rest of his career as a professor of physics at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He is best known for his work in the 1960s, applying the results of the [[Extinction theorem of Ewald and Oseen|extinction theorem]] to the then-current body of experimental evidence relating to both special relativity and emission theory.

==Brief biography==

Jack Fox, as he was always known, was born in Biggar, Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name=foxname&gt;His birthname was James Gaston Fox, James being the English form of "Jacques", the name of his Swiss-born jeweller father.  His parents called him Jacques, his friends called him Jack, and as a young man, Jack legally changed his name from James Gaston to John Gaston, to avoid inevitably being called "Jim".&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his mother to Victoria at age 13, and left high school two years early to attend [[Victoria College, British Columbia|Victoria College]].  He went on to the [[University of Saskatchewan]] for his MS and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] for his PhD, both in physics.  He worked briefly in industry before going to the [[Manhattan Project]] at Los Alamos for the duration of World War II.  In 1947, he married Constance Sullivan of Victoria; they moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he had joined the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (later Carnegie Mellon).  They both became U.S. citizens in 1955, and raised three children in the suburb of [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]].  Fox died in Pittsburgh in 1980.

==Special relativity and the extinction theorem==
The [[Postulates of special relativity|second postulate]] of Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]] states that the speed of light is invariant, regardless of the velocity of the source from which the light emanates.  The extinction theorem (essentially) states that light passing through a transparent medium is simultaneously extinguished and re-emitted by the medium itself.&lt;ref name=born_and_wolf&gt;M. Born and E.Wolf. Principles of Optics (6th ed.). Pergamon Press., 1986, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that information about the velocity of light from a moving source might be lost if the light passes through enough intervening transparent material before being measured.  All measurements previous to the 1960s intending to verify the constancy of the speed of light from moving sources (primarily using moving mirrors, or extraterrestrial sources) were made only after the light had passed through such stationary material&amp;nbsp;— that material being that of a glass lens, the terrestrial atmosphere, or even the incomplete vacuum of deep space.  In 1961, Fox decided that there might not yet be any conclusive evidence for the second postulate:  "This is a surprising situation in which to find ourselves half a century after the inception of special relativity."&lt;ref name=fox62&gt;{{Citation|author=Fox, J.G.|title=Experimental Evidence for the Second Postulate of Special Relativity|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=30|issue=1|year=1962|pages=297–300|doi=10.1119/1.1941992|postscript=.|bibcode=1965AmJPh..33....1F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, he remained fully confident in special relativity, noting that this created only a "small gap" in the experimental record.&lt;ref name=fox62 /&gt;

Fox suggested that better experiments were possible, in order to close that "small gap".  Since photons with higher energies will, on average, travel much farther in any material before being extinguished and re-emitted, experiments using gamma rays instead of lower-energy visible light or x-rays would be dramatically less sensitive to the extinction problem.  In 1963, along with T. A. Filippas (also of Carnegie Tech), Fox examined 68 MeV gamma rays emitted in the forward and backward directions by [[Pions|neutral pions]] moving at 0.2''c'', i.e., two-tenths the speed of light.  The classical velocities of those photons should have been 1.2''c'' and 0.8''c'', respectively, but this was not the case.  The experiment, perhaps the earliest to be considered free of extinction effects, was successful:  "We conclude that our results provide strong evidence that the velocity of radiation from a moving source is not the classical vector sum of ''c'' and the velocity of the source.  Within our accuracy, the resultant sum is ''c'' as required by special relativity."&lt;ref name=filippas_and_fox /&gt;

==Reexamination of Ritz's emission theory==

The [[emission theory]] of [[Walter Ritz]] was considered early on to be an alternative to Einstein's special relativity.  A key difference between the two is that under emission theory, the speed of light is expected to vary along with the speed of its source.  Emission theory had long been disfavored by the 1960s, but Fox realized that the effects of extinction on the measurement of the speed of light nullified much of the accepted evidence against it.
So in 1964, while still a firm believer in special relativity, Fox decided it was necessary to critically reexamine all of the evidence against Ritz's theory.&lt;ref name=fox65&gt;{{Citation|author=Fox, J.  G.|title=Evidence Against Emission Theories|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=33|issue=1|year=1965|pages=1–17|doi=10.1119/1.1971219|postscript=.|bibcode = 1965AmJPh..33....1F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he showed that most of the previous rejections of Ritz's ideas based on theoretical arguments were invalid, including all of those enumerated by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in his 1921 monograph on relativity.  In addition, most previous experimental results disfavoring emission theory could be discarded as well, once extinction effects were considered, since the light (or other radiation) whose speed was measured was all actually re-emitted somewhere other than the original moving source.  But Fox determined that his own work with Filippas,&lt;ref name=filippas_and_fox&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filippas|first=T.A.|author2=Fox, J.G.|title=Velocity of Gamma Rays from a Moving Source|journal=Physical Review|year=1964|volume=135|issue=4B|pages=B1071-1075|bibcode = 1964PhRv..135.1071F |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.135.B1071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as very current work done at the CERN laboratory &lt;ref name=alvager&gt;{{Citation|author=Alväger, T.; Farley, F.  J.  M.; Kjellman, J.; Wallin, L.|title=Test of the second postulate of special relativity in the GeV region|journal=Physics Letters|volume=12|issue=3|year=1964|pages=260–262|doi=10.1016/0031-9163(64)91095-9|postscript=.|bibcode=1964PhL....12..260A}}&lt;/ref&gt; using 6 GeV gamma rays from neutral pions moving at very close to ''c'', did, conclusively, support special relativity.  His summary: "Our general conclusion is that there is still a good case against emission theories but that the evidence is different from and less than it has been thought to be."&lt;ref name=fox65 /&gt;

==Other professional activities==

In the late 1940s and 1950s, Fox was part of the [[Carnegie Tech]] team that created the then state-of-the-art 450 MeV [[synchrocyclotron]] at the [[Saxonburg, Pennsylvania#Nuclear lab|Nuclear Research Center]] in nearby Saxonburg. (The experiment with Filippas, noted earlier, was performed at this facility.)  He served as head of Carnegie Tech's department of physics from 1955 to 1961. In 1962/63, Fox spent a sabbatical year in France at the [[:fr:Institut de physique nucléaire d'Orsay|Laboratoire Joliot-Curie de Physique Nucléaire d'Orsay]], in part because of the new synchrocyclotron installed there. In 1967/68 and 1971/72, Fox spent a total of three years living and working in India at the newly formed [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur|Indian Institute of Technology]], in Kanpur, first as a visiting faculty member, and then as administrative head of the Kanpur Indo-American Program.&lt;ref name=kiap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/infocell/iitk/history/kiap.html|title=[History of the] Kanpur Indo-American Programme (KIAP)|accessdate=August 6, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028152918/http://www.iitk.ac.in/infocell/iitk/history/kiap.html|archivedate=October 28, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox was also a consultant to the Nuclear Medicine Department of St. Francis General Hospital, in Pittsburgh.

==Further reading==

In 2004, Alberto Martínez examined the rejection of Ritz's emission theory in favor of special relativity from a historical perspective.&lt;ref name=martinez&gt;{{Citation|author=Martínez, Alberto A.|journal=Physics in Perspective|title=Ritz, Einstein, and the Emission Hypothesis|pages= 4–28|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s00016-003-0195-6|bibcode = 2004PhP.....6....4M|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That work discusses Fox's findings at some length.

'''Edwin Jacob "Jake" Garn''' (born October 12, 1932) is an American [[astronaut]] and [[Politics of the United States|politician]], a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], who served as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] representing [[Utah]] from 1974 to 1993. Garn became the first sitting member of the [[United States Congress]] to fly in space when he flew aboard the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] as a [[Payload Specialist]] during [[NASA]] mission [[STS-51-D]] (April 12–19, 1985).

==Early life==

Born in [[Richfield, Utah]], Garn earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[business]] and [[finance]] from the [[University of Utah]] in 1955, where he became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. He also attended [[East High School (Salt Lake City)|East High School]], Clayton Middle School, and Uintah Elementary School.

==Career==
Senator Garn is a former insurance executive. He served in the [[United States Navy]] as a [[Martin P5M Marlin]] pilot. He also served as a pilot of the [[151st Air Refueling Group]] of the [[Utah Air National Guard]], where he flew the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter|Boeing KC-97L]] and  [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135A]]. He retired as a Colonel in April 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Payload Specialist Astronaut Bio: Jake Garn |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/garn-j.html |date=May 1985 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to Brigadier General after his space shuttle mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newsmakers |publisher=[[Kentucky New Era]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yPsrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SG0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5307,5559881&amp;dq=jake-garn+senator+brigadier&amp;hl=en |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has flown more than 10,000 hours in [[military]] and private [[civilian]] aircraft.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Prior to his election to the Senate, Garn served on the [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] commission for four years and was elected as the [[list of mayors of Salt Lake City|mayor]] in 1971, entering office in 1972. He was the last Republican to hold that office to date. Garn was active in the [[Utah]] League of Cities and Towns and served as its president in 1972. In 1974, Garn was the first vice-president of the [[National League of Cities]], and he served as its honorary president in 1975.

Garn was first elected to the Senate in 1974, succeeding retiring Republican [[Wallace F. Bennett|Wallace Bennett]], father of later Senator [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Robert Bennett]]. Garn was re-elected to a second term in November 1980 with 74 percent of the vote, the largest victory in a statewide race in Utah history. Garn was re-elected a second time in 1986.

Though strongly [[pro-life]], Garn joined [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Henry Hyde]] of [[Illinois]] in resigning from the board of the [[United States pro-life movement|United States Pro-Life Political Action Committee]] when the executive director of the organization, [[Peter Gemma]], issued a "hit list" to target certain lawmakers who supported [[abortion]]. Garn and Hyde, the author of the [[Hyde Amendment]], which limited abortions financed by [[Medicaid]], said that "hit lists" are counterproductive because they create irrevocable discord among legislators, any of whom can be subject to a "single issue" attack of this kind by one [[interest group]] or another. Gemma said that he was surprised by the withdrawal of Garn and Hyde from the PAC committee but continued with plans to spend $650,000 for the 1982 elections on behalf of anti-abortion candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/07/weekinreview/the-nation-congressmen-draw-the-line-at-new-hit-list.html|title=THE NATION; Congressmen; Draw the Line at; New 'Hit List'|date=June 7, 1981|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garn was chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and served on three subcommittees: Housing and Urban Affairs, Financial Institutions, and International Finance and Monetary Policy. He also was a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and served as Chairman of the HUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee. He served on four other Appropriations subcommittees: Energy and Water Resources, Defense, Military Construction, and Interior. Garn served as a member of the Republican leadership from 1979 to 1984 as Secretary of the Republican Conference.

His Institute of Finance has been called a "hot tub of influence peddling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jacobsen-Wells |first1=JoAnn |title=Demo Chief Chides Owens for Defending Garn  |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/73835/DEMO-CHIEF-CHIDES-OWENS-FOR-DEFENDING-GARN.html?pg=all |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |publisher=Desert News |date=November 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garn retired from the Senate in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Laurie Snow |last=Turner |contribution=Garn, Jake |contribution-url= http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/g/GARN_JAKE.html |editor-last= Powell |editor-first= Allan Kent |year=1994 |title=Utah History Encyclopedia |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher=[[University of Utah Press]] |isbn=0874804256 |oclc=30473917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Savings and loan==
As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Garn was co-author of the [[Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]] of 1982, the law that partially deregulated the savings and loan industry and attempted to forestall the looming [[Savings and Loan crisis]].

==Spaceflight==
Garn asked to fly on the Space Shuttle because he was head of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that dealt with NASA, and had extensive aviation experience. He had previously flown a [[B-2 Spirit]] prototype and driven a new Army tank.{{r|walker20050414}}&lt;ref name="unl2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Realizing Tomorrow: The Path to Private Spaceflight |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |last1=Dubbs |first1=Chris |last2=Paat-Dahlstrom |first2=Emeline |last3=Walker |first3=Charles D. |pages=79–80 |year=2011 |isbn=0-8032-1610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[STS-51-D]] was launched from and returned to land at the [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]]. Its primary objective was to deploy two communications satellites, and to perform [[electrophoresis]] and echocardiograph operations in space in addition to a number of other experiments. As a [[payload specialist]], Garn's role on the mission was as a congressional observer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Ben |title=Space shuttle challenger: ten journeys into the unknown |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-46355-1 |oclc=131057274 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a subject for medical experiments on space motion sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lamar |first1=Jacob V., Jr. |last2=Hannifan |first2=Jerry |title=Jake Skywalker: A Senator boards the shuttle |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966871,00.html |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |newspaper=Time |date=April 22, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the conclusion of the mission, Garn had traveled over 2.5 million miles in 108 Earth orbits, logging over 167 hours in space.

The [[Space adaptation syndrome|space sickness]] he experienced during the journey was so severe that a scale for space sickness was jokingly based on him, where "one Garn" is the highest possible level of sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oral History 2 Transcript |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_5-13-99.pdf |work=Johnson Space Center Oral History Project |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 22, 2011 |pages=13–35 |date=May 13, 1999 |quote=[Dr. Robert Stevenson:] Jake Garn was sick, was pretty sick.

Upon his return, he co-authored a novel entitled ''[[Night Launch]]''. The book centers around [[terrorism|terrorists]] taking control of the Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' during the first NASA–USSR space shuttle flight. It was published in 1989.

'''Jason Warner''' (born 1975) and '''deMarco DeCiccio''' (born 1976) are a Christian musical duo (and [[life partner|life partners]]) with outreach to the [[LGBT]] community. 

== Background ==

[[Image:Rabbi Prinz.jpg|thumb|200px|Rabbi Joachim Prinz]]
'''Joachim Prinz''' (May 10, 1902 &amp;ndash; September 30, 1988) was a [[German people|German]]-[[American people|American]] [[rabbi]] who was outspoken against [[Nazism]] and became a [[Zionist]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Fowler, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D91630F932A35753C1A96E948260 Joachim Prinz, Leader in Protests For Civil-Rights Causes, Dies at 86], ''[[New York Times]], October 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; As a young rabbi in [[Berlin]], he was forced to confront the rise of [[Nazism]], and eventually emigrated to the United States in 1937. There he became vice-chairman of the [[World Jewish Congress]], an active member of the [[World Zionist Organization]] and a participant in the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 Civil Rights March on Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/marchonwashington/ig/March-on-Washington-Photos/Leaders.htm March on Washington photo Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601065538/http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/marchonwashington/ig/March-on-Washington-Photos/Leaders.htm |date=2007-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prinz was born in the village of [[Bierdzany]] (near [[Opole|Oppeln]]), in the [[Prussia]]n [[province of Silesia]].

Prinz was born to a Jewish family. Early on, he became motivated by a charismatic rabbi and Prinz took an increasing interest in [[Judaism]]. His Jewish roots grew even stronger following his mother's death. By 1917, he had also joined [[Blau Weiss]] (Blue White), the [[Zionist youth movement]].

At 21, Joachim Prinz received his Ph.D. in Philosophy, and had minored in Art History, at the [[University of Giessen]]. He was ordained as a rabbi at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in [[Breslau]]. He married Lucie Horovitz, the daughter of the seminary's most prominent professor.  She died in Berlin shortly after giving birth to their daughter Lucie.  Prinz married Hilde Goldschmidt in 1932.  They had three children, Michael (born in Berlin), Jonathan and Deborah (both born in the United States)

As his prominence grew in Germany and his fears of Hitler's reign coming to fruition, he earned the sponsorship of [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] who was a close adviser to President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. In 1937, Prinz immigrated into the United States. He immediately began lecturing throughout the U.S. for the [[United Palestine Appeal]], established in the 1920s as the fund raising arm in the United States for the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]. It was, essentially, the precursor to what became the American Jewish support base for a nation state of Israel and the [[United Israel Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1o7i04l2nkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA259&amp;lpg=RA1-PA259&amp;dq=upa+%22palestine+appeal%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iBlh7gsPeO&amp;sig=f0OmzjtKzcyM3HXVMZI4W8PjNSk ''A Clash of Heroes: Brandeis, Weizmann, and American Zionism,'' By Ben Halpern]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15361 Roosevelt's Letter to the UPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joachim Prinz settled in [[New Jersey]] as the spiritual leader of [[Temple B'Nai Abraham]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].

==Activism==
[[File:March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Joachim Prinz 1963.jpg|left|thumb|1963 march with Prinz and Martin Luther King Jr.]]

===Jewish Rights===
Within a short period, Prinz's activism helped him rise to become one of the top leaders within the Jewish organizational structure. He held top leadership positions in the [[World Jewish Congress]], as president of the [[American Jewish Congress]] from 1958–1966, and as Chairman of the [http://data.jewishgen.org/wconnect/wc.dll?jg~jgsys~ajhs_pb~r!!599 World Conference of Jewish Organizations]. Later, he was a director of the ''Conference of Jewish Material Claims Against Germany''.

Prinz's early involvement in the Zionist movement made him a close ally and friend of the founding leaders of  [[Israel|the State of Israel]]. Prinz was essential to establishing what became the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]]. Prinz was Chairman from 1965-1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joachimprinz.com/biography.htm Prinz Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broader Civil Rights===
[[File:Photograph of Meeting with Leaders of the March on Washington August 28, 1963 - NARA - 194276.jpg|thumb|Meeting with Leaders of the March on Washington]]Dr. Prinz devoted much of his life in the United States to the Civil Rights movement.  He saw the plight of African American and other minority groups in the context of his own experience under Hitler. Already in 1937, the year of his immigration, Prinz wrote in an article for the German-Jewish periodical ''[[Der Morgen (magazine)|Der Morgen]]'':

: ''Die Neger in Harlem erinnern uns immer noch an die Zeiten von Onkel Toms Hütte. Wir verstehen deshalb nicht, daß auch die Juden dort die Neger höchst gleichgültig betrachten, und daß auch sie hochmütig sind... Wir können das nicht. Wir verstehen sie zu gut, die Schwarzen im Ghetto zu Harlem.''&lt;ref&gt;http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/pageview/2907290&lt;/ref&gt;

: "The negroes in [[Harlem]] still remind us of the times of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]. Therefore we cannot understand that the Jews there, too, regard the negroes with great indifference, and that they are equally haughty... For us [immigrants from Nazi Germany], this is impossible. We understand them too well, those blacks in the ghetto of Harlem."

From his early days in Newark, a city with a very large minority community, he spoke from his pulpit about the disgrace of discrimination.  He joined the picket lines across America protesting racial prejudice  from unequal employment to segregated schools, housing and all other areas of life.

While serving as President of the American Jewish Congress, he represented the Jewish community as an organizer of the August 28, 1963, [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]]. He came to the podium immediately following a stirring spiritual sung by the gospel singer [[Mahalia Jackson]] and just before [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] delivered his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.  Dr. Prinz's address is remembered for its contention that, based on his experience as a rabbi in Nazi Germany after the rise of Hitler, in the face of discrimination, "the most urgent, the most disgraceful, the most shameful and the most tragic problem is silence."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Reston|Reston, James]] via ''[[The New York Times]]'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wJtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sVIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=the-most-urgent-the-most-disgraceful-the-most-shameful-and-the-most-tragic-problem-is-silence&amp;pg=7159%2C4993413 "The March's First Test: In The Churches"], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', August 31, 1963.

'''José María Dionisio Melo y Ortiz''' (October 9, 1800 – June 1, 1860) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] general and politician of [[Pijao]] ancestry who fought in the [[South American wars of independence]], and who in 1854 rose to power and held the [[President of Colombia|presidency of Colombia]].

== First exiles ==
Melo was banished from [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] after the dissolution of the [[Gran Colombia|Great Colombia]]. He traveled to [[Venezuela]], where he joined the military group that rose up in 1835 demanding the restoration of the Great Colombia, and political and social reforms.&lt;ref name="DOV"&gt;Ortiz Vidales, Darío 1980: ''José María Melo: la razón de un rebelde''. Tercera Edición, Editorial Producciones Géminis, Ibagué, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After their defeat, he went to Europe, in December 1836. Melo studied at the Military Academy in [[Bremen]], Saxony, and became interested in socialist ideas debated in local circles.&lt;ref name="GVM"/&gt;

== Democratic Societies ==
In 1841 Melo returned to [[Ibagué]], where he became a political leader of the county. There he participated in the foundation of the "Democratic Societies" that organized artisans and leftist intellectuals.&lt;ref name="DOV"/&gt;

In August 1850, the artisans demanded protection and the creation of a national workshop supported by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Gaviria Liévano, Enrique 2002: ''El liberalismo y la insurrección de los artesanos contra el librecambio''. Universidad de Bogotá Jorge Tadeo Lozano. {{ISBN|958-9029-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 1851, New Granada approved the freedom of slaves bill, and slaveowners rebelled. President José Hilario López called Melo into the army and promoted him to general. Melo found wide acceptance among the troops, and defeated the slaveowners.&lt;ref name="DOV"/&gt;

General José María Melo assumed power in 1854 with the support of members of the Democratic Societies, a coalition of artisans and liberals who did not think that democracy and dictatorship were incompatible. After Melo was militarily defeated that same year, his soldiers and artisans were severely repressed.&lt;ref&gt;Lucía Sala de Touron, "Democracia en America Latina: liberales, radicales y artesanos a mediados del siglo XIX," Secuencia  61(2005), 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The only military survivors of the artisans revolution were 200 participants banished on foot to Panama after their property was confiscated.&lt;ref name="GVM"&gt;Vargas Martínez, Gustavo 1972: ''Colombia 1854: Melo, los Artesanos y el Socialismo''. Editorial Oveja Negra. Bogotá.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last struggles ==
Melo, sailed to [[Costa Rica]] and helped fight against the American [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name="DOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GVM"/&gt; After the victory, Melo worked as an instructor of troops.&lt;ref name="GVM"/&gt;

José María Melo also served as a general in [[Mexico]], in order to defend the government of [[Benito Juárez]], during the [[War of the Reform]] in 1860, and he was wounded and arrested in battle, and then killed.&lt;ref name="GVM"/&gt;

'''Juana Bormann''' (or '''Johanna Borman'''; 10 September 1893 &amp;ndash; 13 December 1945) was an [[East Prussian]]-born [[prison guard]] at several [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s, from 1938 and was [[capital punishment|executed]] as a [[war criminal]] at [[Hamelin]], [[Lower Saxony]], Germany, after a court trial in 1945.

==Trial and execution==
At her trial, Bormann said she had joined the [[Schutzstaffel#Auxiliary SS|Auxiliary SS]] in 1938 "to earn more money". She first served at the [[Lichtenburg (concentration camp)|Lichtenburg concentration camp]] in [[Saxony]] under SS [[Oberaufseherin]] [[Jane Bernigau]] with 49 other SS women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMiwDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Irma Grese - "The Beast of Belsen" &amp; Other Twisted Female Guards of Concentration Camps|last=Gibson|first=Tyler|date=2017-04-06|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781365237997|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, she was assigned to oversee a work crew at the new [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] women's camp near [[Berlin]]. In March 1942, Bormann was one of a handful of women selected for guard duty at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in [[Poland]]. Short in stature, she was known for her cruelty. Victims called her "Wiesel" and "the woman with the dogs".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=uk&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/nazigirls.html Bormann profile],  Capitalpunishmentuk.org; accessed 2 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1942, Bormann went to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] as an [[Aufseherin]]. Her supervisors included [[Maria Mandel]], [[Margot Dreschel|Margot Drexler (Dreschler, Drechsel, Dreschel)]], and [[Irma Grese]]. Juana was eventually moved to Budy, a nearby subcamp where she continued her abuse of prisoners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1944, as German losses mounted, Bormann was transferred to the auxiliary camp at Hindenburg (present-day [[Zabrze|Zabrze, Poland]]) in [[Silesia]]. In January 1945, she returned to Ravensbrück. In March she arrived at her last post, [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], near [[Celle]], where she served under [[Josef Kramer]], [[Irma Grese]] and [[Elisabeth Volkenrath]] (all of whom had served with her in Birkenau.) On 15 April 1945, the [[British army]] took Bergen-Belsen, finding over 10,000 [[Dead body|corpse]]s and 60,000 survivors. The liberators forced all SS personnel to carry the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bormann was later incarcerated and interrogated by the military, then prosecuted at the [[Belsen Trial]], which lasted from 17 September 1945 to 17 November 1945. The court heard testimony relating to murders she had committed at Auschwitz and Belsen, sometimes unleashing her "big bad wolfhound" [[German shepherd]] on helpless prisoners. She was found guilty and [[hanging|hanged]] (along with Grese and Volkenrath) on 13 December 1945. Her executioner, [[Albert Pierrepoint]], later wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"She limped down the corridor looking old and haggard. She was 42 [sic] years old (actual age, 52), standing only a little over five feet. She was trembling as she was put on the scale. In German she said: 'I have my feelings'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Executioner|last=Pierrepoint|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Pierrepoint|year=1974|publisher=Harrap|isbn=0-245-52070-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==NASA Watch==
''NASA Watch'' is a website blog which provides insider information and commentary about the United States space program and the U.S. government agency, NASA.&lt;ref name="RJ"/&gt; The first posting was in March, 1996. Cowing is a strong supporter of human spaceflight.&lt;ref name="SpaceStationShine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crittenden|first1=Jules|date=October 29, 2000|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/62997952.html?dids=62997952:62997952&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+29%2C+2000&amp;author=Jules+Crittenden&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=Huge+space+station+set+to+shine&amp;pqatl=google|title=Huge space station set to shine|publisher=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowing started the website when [[Daniel Goldin]] was administrator of NASA and at that time expressed harsh criticism of Goldin's policies. The inciting event for Keith was the mass layoffs in the transition from [[Space Station Freedom]] to the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowing|first=Keith|date=June 9, 2010|url=http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2010/06/space-station-f.html|title=Space Station Freedom Deja Vu All Over Again|publisher=Nasa Watch|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, NASA refused to accredit Cowing as a journalist and denied him access to NASA media events. Cowing was eventually granted full press accreditation.&lt;ref name="RJ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Godin|first=Mary Ellen|date=December 12, 1999|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=38z6pN3vtwoC&amp;dat=19991212&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|title=Keeping an Eye on NASA|publisher=The Record-Journal|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowing was a firm supporter of Goldin's successor as administrator, [[Sean O'Keefe]], appointed by [[George W. Bush]]. Cowing also obtained exclusive first-hand information about the genesis of the [[Vision for Space Exploration]], detailed in the book ''New Moon Rising'' which Cowing wrote with Frank Sietzen.&lt;ref name="NewMoon"&gt;{{cite book|title=New moon rising : the making of America's new space vision and the remaking of NASA|publisher=[[Apogee Books]]|date=2004|last1=Sietzen|first1=Frank|last2=Cowing|first2=Keith|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-moon-rising-the-making-of-americas-new-space-vision-and-the-remaking-of-nasa/oclc/56140988&amp;referer=brief_results|isbn=978-1894959124|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] was NASA administrator, the relationship between NASA Watch and NASA seemed to have been a more confrontational one. Cowing, as well as other space program insiders, commented negatively about a return to Goldin-style management practices under Griffin.&lt;ref name="CSMon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0615/p01s01-usgn.html|title=NASA changes to run deep|date=June 15, 2005|last=Sappenfield|first=Mark|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowing dubbed Monday, June 13, 2005 as ''Black Monday'' when many NASA personnel were sent reassignment letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowing|first=Keith|date=June 13, 2005|url=http://nasawatch.com/archives/2005/06/purge-update-1.html|title=Purge Update|publisher=NASA Watch|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharpe is the founder and Managing Director of Neo-Sage Group, Inc. 

==Early life and career==

He joined the [[United States Marines Corps]] at age 17,&lt;ref name="Reason VP"/&gt; and he received a Bachelor's Degree in [[Anthropology]] from the [[University of Maryland University College]].&lt;ref name="LPConvention"/&gt; After working as an [[English language|English]] teacher, Sharpe founded Prime Distribution Inc. (a trucking and distribution company which he later sold) in 2001.&lt;ref name="Meet Larry"&gt;{{Citation|author=|title=Meet Larry Sharpe|accessdate=13 August 2018|date=|url=https://larrysharpe.com/bio/|publisher=Larry Sharpe for Governor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Sharpe built an online business training company called Neo-Sage Group, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharpe|first1=Larry|url=http://www.sharpe4vp.com/issues|title=Issues|website=Sharpe4VP.com|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neo-sage-forum.com|title=Neo-Sage Forum|website=Neo-sage-forum.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he serves as Managing Director.&lt;ref name="Reason VP"&gt;[[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Doherty, Brian]] {{Citation|title=''"Meet the Libertarian Party's VP Candidates"''|accessdate=December 3, 2016|date=May 28, 2016|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/05/28/the-libertarian-partys-vice-presidential|publisher=''Reason''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LPConvention"&gt;{{Citation|author=Libertarian Party|title=Larry Sharpe|accessdate=December 3, 2016|url=http://libertarian.nationbuilder.com/sharpe|publisher=Libertarian Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
As a Libertarian Party activist, Sharpe has outlined a vision to grow the party by encouraging [[grassroots]] Libertarian Party campaigns across the country.&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;[[Matt Welch|Welch, Matt]] {{Citation|title=''"Selling Liberty"''|accessdate=19 January 2018|date=February 2018|url=http://reason.com/archives/2018/01/14/selling-freedom|publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe served on the [[Libertarian National Committee]] as the Alternate for Region 8, until his resignation in February 2018 because of an internal LNC vote that failed to oust the party's then-vice chair, [[Arvin Vohra]], following public controversial comments made by Vohra.&lt;ref name="Resigns"&gt;{{Citation|last=Doherty|first=Brian|title=''"Larry Sharpe, Libertarian Candidate for Governor of New York, Quits the Party's National Committee"''|accessdate=20 February 2018|date=7 February 2018|url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/07/larry-sharpe-libertarian-candidate-for-g|publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Libertarian National Convention]], he placed second on the first ballot with 30.4% of the vote.

{{main|New York gubernatorial election, 2018}}

Sharpe in addition was the only candidate in the race to have visited all 62 counties on the campaign trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/10/31/libertarian-larry-sharpe-has-raised-a-re|title=Libertarian Larry Sharpe Has Raised a Record $450,000 in New York Governor’s Race|author=Welch, Matt|date=October 31, 2018|accessdate=November 11, 2018|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
Sharpe supports reducing regulations such as [[occupational licensing]], as well as legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing other drugs.&lt;ref name="WAER"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Willis, Scott, Liam McMonagle, and Chris Bolt|url=http://waer.org/post/libertarian-candidate-gov-i-have-solutions-problems-two-party-system-cant-solve?__s=dbm6j6fzp8msbjcg2gyq|title=Libertarian Candidate for Gov: I have Solutions to Problems that Two Party System Can't Solve|website=[[WAER]]|date=February 19, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe has advocated for raising revenue for New York by selling naming rights to bridges and highways.&lt;ref name="Binghamton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/news/local-news/larry-sharpe-expected-to-receive-libertarian-party-endorsement-for-governor/1063155982|title=Larry Sharpe expected to receive Libertarian Party endorsement for Governor|website=Binghamton Homepage|date=March 20, 2018|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
Sharpe considers himself "[[pro-choice]]" as well as "anti-abortion". He has vowed to reduce the number of abortions in New York state by increasing availability of other options, instead of instituting regulations on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wxxinews.org/post/connections-gubernatorial-candidate-larry-sharpe|title=Coming up on Connections: Friday, September 14|author1=Mack, Megan|author2=Dawson, Evan|date=September 14, 2018|accessdate=September 14, 2018|work=WXXI News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal justice===
Sharpe favors [[marijuana legalization]], calling for [[hemp]] and marijuana to be "regulated like onions".&lt;ref name=Ithaca&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ithaca.com/news/libertarian-candidate-for-governor-larry-sharpe-visits-tompkins-county/article_bbc751b8-8116-11e8-931a-9b912d3a9938.html|title=Libertarian candidate for Governor Larry Sharpe visits Tompkins County|author=Reynolds, Nick|date=July 6, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2018|work=Ithaca.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe has said he would [[pardon]] those convicted of [[victimless crime]]s or otherwise non-violent offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waer.org/post/libertarian-candidate-gov-i-have-solutions-problems-two-party-system-cant-solve|title=Libertarian Candidate for Gov: I have Solutions to Problems that Two Party System Can't Solve|author1=Willis, Scott|author2=McMonagle, Liam|author3=Bolt, Chris|date=February 19, 2018|accessdate=August 25, 2018|work=WAER 88.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
Sharpe has supported [[deregulation]] to stimulate economic growth, ending the funding of enforcement of unnecessary regulations. In particular, Sharpe has cited [[occupational licensing]] as a hurdle to small business, describing mandatory licensing for jobs such as barbers and dog walkers as "barriers to entry and a tax on the poor."&lt;ref name= paternalgovt/&gt; Additionally, to reduce the state deficit, Sharpe has called for eliminating [[unfunded mandates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wktv.com/content/news/Larry-Sharpe-Makes-a-Stop-in-Little-Falls-490677711.html|title=Larry Sharpe Makes a Stop in Little Falls|author=Mooney, Cody|date=August 12, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2018|work=[[WKTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has vowed to follow this reduction in state spending with a reduction in [[property taxes]] and the ultimate repeal of the New York state [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelcn.com/lcn01/governor-candidate-larry-sharpe-shares-appeal-in-area-visit-20180508|title=Governor candidate Larry Sharpe shares appeal in area visit|author=Kendrick, Jim|date=May 8, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2018|work=Livingston County News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://auburnpub.com/blogs/eye_on_ny/eye-on-ny-larry-sharpe-libertarian-candidate-for-ny-governor/article_616f4e48-719c-11e8-8ca0-2f09abba22f8.html|title=Eye on NY: Larry Sharpe, Libertarian candidate for NY governor, brings message to Auburn|date=June 17, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2018|author=Harding, Robert|work=auburnpub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Sharpe has called for the [[decentralization]] of education in New York State and has proposed a "K-10" model, reducing the span of high school to ready students for the workforce and/or college.&lt;ref name=LTT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saratogatodaynewspaper.com/today-in-saratoga/education/item/8929-let-teachers-teach-with-new-york-state-governor-candidate-larry-sharpe|title=Let Teachers Teach with New York State Governor Candidate Larry Sharpe|date=August 23, 2018|accessdate=August 25, 2018|author=Mahan, Lori|work=Saratoga Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ithaca /&gt; Sharpe has also rejected [[standardized testing]] until high school.&lt;ref name=LTT /&gt; He stated, "everyone should be able to opt out of testing at any time....it puts kids who have [[special needs]] at a huge disadvantage. Kids who do not test well are labeled as dumb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Three-more-gubernatorial-candidates-to-watch-12875753.php|title=3 third-party candidates for governor to watch|author=Silberstein, Rachel|date=May 2, 2018|accessdate=August 18, 2018|work=Albany Times Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Sharpe has stated he would refuse [[Categorical grant|federal grants]] for education. He would also abolish the [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States#Regents|Board of Regents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/09/staples_bridge_libertarian_gov_candidate_says_lets_lease_naming_rights_on_state.html|title=Legal weed and decentralized education: Can a Libertarian win NY's gov race?|author=Baker, Chris|date=September 17, 2018|accessdate=September 17, 2018|work=Syracuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun laws===
Sharpe vowed to repeal the NY SAFE Act by 2020 and pardon those convicted under its provisions.&lt;ref name= paternalgovt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adirondackdailyenterprise.com/news/local-news/2018/07/sharpe-seeks-a-less-paternal-government/|title=Sharpe seeks a less paternal government|author=Crowley, Peter|date=July 7, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2018|work=Adirondack Daily Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe supports allowing school teachers and staff to carry firearms on school grounds, on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oswegocountynewsnow.com/news/ny-gov-long-shot-larry-sharpe-visits-oswego/article_feeef2dc-6e7b-11e8-ba2e-c7e21490836f.html|title=NY Gov long shot Larry Sharpe visits Oswego|author=Wallace, Lexie|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2018|work=Oswego County News Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">[[Saint]] '''Lazaros of Mount Galesios''' ({{Lang-gr|Λάζαρος ὁ Γαλησιώτης}}, ''Lazaros ho Galēsiōtēs''; {{circa|972/981}} – 7 November 1053) was an 11th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] monk and [[stylite]], who founded a monastic community at [[Mount Galesios]] near [[Ephesus]].

==Life==
Lazaros was born near [[Manisa|Magnesia]] to a peasant family, and his original name was Leo (Λέων). The exact date of his birth is unknown; traditionally it has been calculated at {{circa|972}}, but a reference in a manuscript (''Moscow, Hist. Mus.'' 369/353, fol. 220) records that he died at the age of 72, hence that he was born in {{ca|981}}.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1198}}

After finishing his elementary schooling, he left his home and went to [[Attaleia]] to become a monk. Later he went to the famed [[Lavra of Saint Sabas]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], before returning to his home region.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1198}} He founded three monasteries at [[Mount Galesios]] near [[Ephesus]], while he himself became a [[stylite]] and lived in a pillar. The monks in the monastic communities Lazaros founded lived in individual cells, rather than the [[cenobitic monasticism]] of most monasteries; they were even allowed to earn their own income through practicing a handicraft.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1198}}

==Hagiography==
Lazaros's [[hagiography]] was written by his disciple, the ''kellarites'' Gregory; and reworked by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Gregory II of Cyprus]], in the late 13th century.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1198}} According to the description of [[Alexander Kazhdan]], the hagiography "has few supernatural miracles but many vignettes rich in everyday details: the young Lazaros escaped sexual seduction in the house of a girl whom he accompanied to [[Chonae]]; Lazaros's corpse, with the help of the monk Cyril, signed the ''[[diatyposis]]'' for the monks; many thefts and quarrels, travels, and visits are described. Gregory focuses on local events, while [[Constantinople]] is depicted as a remote city teeming with danger".{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1198}}

{{Dynamic list}}
This is a partial list of confirmed '''famous people who were or are [[gay]], [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]]'''. Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.

The historical concept and [[definition]] of [[sexual orientation]] varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word "gay" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term "sexual orientation" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shively |first=M.G. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=DeCecco |first3=J.

Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. See [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual ([[LGBT|LGB]]) people.

The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to [[societal attitudes towards homosexuality]]. The [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided&amp;nbsp;– a thin majority (51&amp;nbsp;percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42&amp;nbsp;percent disagree."&lt;ref name="pewreport"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=185 |format=.PDF |date=June 2003 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; The Press | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madame Xanadu''' is a [[comic book]] [[mysticism|mystic]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character is identified with [[Lady of the Lake|Nimue]], the [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] from [[Arthurian mythology]] made popular by [[Thomas Malory|Sir Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
The character debuted in ''Doorway to Nightmare'' #1, (February [[1978 in comics|1978]]). The character was designed by cover artist [[Michael William Kaluta]] at the request of [[Joe Orlando]] (editor), based on Kaluta's unnamed host character (later known as Charity in the pages of ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'') from the [[DC Comics]] mystery title ''Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion'' (seen only on that title's indicia page) and the person of [[Cathy Ann Thiele]]. The original storyline was developed by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Val Mayerik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 176|quote = Writer David Michelinie and artist Val Mayerik introduced Madame Xanadu.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doorway_to_Nightmare_1_(1978).jpg|thumb|left|Doorway to Nightmare #1]]

''Doorway to Nightmare'', introduced in 1978, was the last of the DC "Mystery" line of titles in the 1970s that became the forerunner of [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]].  It did not have a consistent creative team—the intent was to create writer-artist pairings that had never occurred before, except for the cover art of [[Michael William Kaluta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doorway to Nightmare'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Xanadu, the star of the series, was not a host but an active participant, albeit never the main character in her stories. The [[Phantom Stranger]] was criticized heavily in letter columns for taking a similar approach.&lt;ref&gt;Letter columns in ''The Phantom Stranger'' vol. 2, issues 31-41&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Doorway to Nightmare'' strip lasted for ten issues: five in its own series, four in ''[[The Unexpected]]'' issues 190, 192, 194 and 195, and one issue of ''Madame Xanadu'', which was DC's second direct sales only comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=2586|title=''Madame Xanadu''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Michael Catron|last=Catron|first=Michael|title=DC Taps Fan Market for ''Madame Xanadu''|work= [[Amazing Heroes]]|number=1 |date=June 1981|page= 25|quote= ''Madame Xanadu'', a 32-page/$1.00 comic that marks DC's first attempt at marketing comics specifically to fans and collectors, went on sale in early April. The book contains a 25-page tale by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers entitled 'Dance for Two Demons' ... The tale was originally commissioned for ''Doorway to Nightmare'' but was put into DC's inventory when that title was cancelled.}} &lt;!--''Madame Xanadu'' was the first DC Comics publication exclusive to the direct market but the second overall due to a ''Superboy Spectacular'' release a year earlier. As explained by Paul Levitz: "In a further effort to find new distribution, a ''Superboy Spectacular'' was produced for [[Random House]]'s in-school book club program and offered to comic shops but not newsstands." [[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]] ''75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking'' [[Taschen|Taschen America, LLC]] 2010 ISBN 978-3-8365-1981-6 p. 454--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The first issue of ''Madame Xanadu'' bore little difference from an issue of ''Doorway to Nightmare''.  There were several requests to reprint it {{Specify|date=September 2011}} in letter columns of ''The Spectre'', but they were refused because that issue gave little background as to her character, although it did introduce [[Ishtar]] to the DC Universe, who dated [[Destruction (DC Comics)|Destruction]].

Madame Xanadu was a regular supporting cast member in volumes 2 and 3 of ''The Spectre'', those versions written by [[Doug Moench]] (31 issues, 1987–1989) and [[John Ostrander]] (62 issues, 1993–1998).

A ''Madame Xanadu'' [[ongoing series]] from Vertigo was announced at the [[2007 in comics|2007]] [[San Diego Comic Con International|San Diego Comic Con]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brendan |last=McGuirk |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=122740 |title=SDCC '07: Matt Wagner Talks Vertigo's Madame Xanadu |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and started in [[2008 in comics|2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=31172|title=''Madame Xanadu'' vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by [[Matt Wagner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Renaud |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=15960&amp;page=article |title=Wagner Saws Madame Xanadu in Half with Vertigo |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 11, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with art by [[Amy Reeder Hadley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brendan |last=McGuirk |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=126501 |title=Talking Madame Xanadu with Amy Hadley |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905080422/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=126501 |archivedate=September 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brigid |last=Alverson |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6528712.html?nid=2789 |title=From Manga to Madame Xanadu |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410075529/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6528712.html?nid=2789 |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series also featured art stints by Kaluta, [[Joëlle Jones]], [[Marley Zarcone]], [[Laurenn McCubbin]], [[Chrissie Zullo]], Celia Calle, and Marian Churchland.  The series was concluded after 29 issues, the final one dated January 2011.  The series dealt with Madame Xanadu's early life from Arthurian times until the 1960s.  Starting with issue 9, the book coincided with the events of the Golden Age DC Universe.

==Story structure==
The ''Doorway to Nightmare'' stories were typically structured around a protagonist stumbling upon Madame Xanadu's shop (stated to be on "[[Chrystie Street|Christy Street]]" in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]) (changed to [[Greenwich Village]] in ''The Unexpected'' #192) and deciding to enter.  She (usually) or he would tell a story of [[romance (love)|romance]] that was frustrated by an outside element.  Xanadu, through a [[tarot reading]], always determined this element to be of an [[occult]] nature, then sent the protagonist to do some task in which she would intervene with the use of her powers.  Upon concluding the story, the occult element would wind up in a [[mason jar]] in her back room.  In the first issue, she apparently became trapped in a burning building.  The central couple returns to her shop for nostalgia's sake and discovers her to be quite alive.  This was a hint at the extent of her powers.  The primary variation in the stories was what the occult threat actually was, be it demonic forces, Asian mummies, [[vampire]]s, [[incubus|incubi]], or other supernatural threats.  In one story, she fought [[Azazel]], but he looked nothing like in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #1/''[[The Unexpected]]'' #190.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the title was moved from its own series to a revamped, 68 page and ad-free version of ''The Unexpected'' (the stories were actually expanded from 17 to 22 pages with the move, part of the [[DC Implosion]]), she was shown to be friendly with [[Cain and Abel (comics)|Abel]] in the inside front covers, which may or may not have been in continuity.  She never met Abel in an actual story until ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #21, when she and the [[Phantom Stranger]] arrive at the [[House of Mystery]] with [[Christmas]] [[gift|presents]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Madame Xanadu's origins were explored in the first few arcs of her  [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] series.  According to these stories, her full name was once Nimue Inwudu and she is the youngest sister of Morgana (to become [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine Le Fay]]) and Vivienne, the [[Lady of the Lake]]. The sisters are descendants of the Elder Folk, survivors of [[Atlantis]] who evolved into the race known as the ''[[Homo magi]]''.

Madame Xanadu is the same [[Nimue]] who casts an imprisoning spell on her former lover [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]], blaming him for manipulating [[Camelot]] and the course of history for his own gain. Merlin has the last laugh, though, as he succeeds in stripping her magic away from her, forcing her to use potions to maintain her immortality. The mysterious [[Phantom Stranger]] influences her betrayal of Merlin and the two continue to meet throughout the centuries, sharing an ambivalent relationship.  Shortly after this, either she or the Lady of the Lake (regardless, called "Nimue") bore a son to Kon-Sten-Tyne, an ancestor of [[John Constantine]].  The child was left with Kon-Sten-Tyne, who sacrificed the boy as a teenager to [[List of characters in The Sandman#Eve|Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hellblazer]] Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimue wanders around the world for some time, becoming an advisor to many great rulers. She spends time in [[Kublai Khan]]'s court at [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], leading to her assumed name of "Madame Xanadu." Again she meets the Phantom Stranger. It does not go as expected, for she learns the Stranger walks outside of the timestream. During the [[French Revolution]], she attempts to advise [[Marie Antoinette]]. During this era, she is able to regain her immortality by besting [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] in a card game. Other incidents in her long years of life include a doomed [[lesbian]] love affair during the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

In the 1940s, she has a sexual relationship with John [[Zatara]], who wishes to marry her, but she foresees his true love, and the later existence of his daughter, [[Zatanna]], "a love with whom she could never compete." Despite this, she uses Zatara to trap and ensnare the Phantom Stranger, preventing him from witnessing, and affecting, the supernatural origins of the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].  This, in turn, prevents Madame Xanadu from interfering, despite having foreseen the potential menace the unchecked Spectre would have brought on Earth.  It is revealed that Xanadu's later behavior stems from this earlier fault, her magic parlor being devised as a way to control the supernatural being, ultimately hoping to restrain and quell his rage.

Eventually, Madame Xanadu decides that she wants to atone for her sins and begins operating the [[fortune-telling]] parlor out of [[Greenwich Village|"the Village"]]. She however remains without any real magic might of her own, which has led her to manipulate various forces in order to gain power.  Having developed herself as an advisor, she now meets clientele plagued by supernatural problems.  Although she can advise them, some force prevents her from directly interfering in solving their troubles.  If one of her clients manages to conquer a supernatural force, she can contain that entity in jars within her fortune parlor to prevent it from causing any further trouble.

===Later history===
[[File:Madame xanadu01.jpg|right|180px|thumb|''Madame Xanadu'' #1 (1981) cover, art by Michael Kaluta.]]
When the Spectre is destroyed by the [[Anti-Monitor]], Madame Xanadu performs a magic ritual that brings him back to existence. From that day forward she acts as the Spectre's spiritual advisor while he is bound to the soul of [[Jim Corrigan]]. At first, Xanadu tries to lead Corrigan astray in order to use the Spectre-Force for her own agendas.  She is depicted in a nude love scene with the Spectre in the form of mist, although readers in the letters column did not find this clear and Xanadu's nudity gratuitous.  Subsequent issues made clear that this was a romantic relationship, but no more nudity was used.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #9, which was controversial and continues to be cited in ''[[Overstreet]]'' because of its lack of a mature readers labeling with Xanadu's [[nipple]]s clearly visible in more than one panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of their affiliation however, a strange form of friendship grows between Corrigan and Madame Xanadu. Over time, Madame Xanadu is instrumental in ensuring the safety of Corrigan's soul, stopping the various rampages of the Spectre, and ultimately shows up at Jim Corrigan's funeral not as an advisor or enemy, but as his friend. She even sheds a tear as Jim Corrigan's soul leaves the mortal plane to go to Heaven.

She is also consulted by the [[Suicide Squad]] about the increasing difficultly of dealing with [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]]. She provides the Squad with a ring and necklace that can harm the Enchantress if she tries to use her powers against the ring-bearers' wishes.

Madame Xanadu also gives [[Timothy Hunter]] a reading, helping him along his path as an emerging sorcerer. She also confronts Tim's companion [[John Constantine]], whom she believes stole a magic artifact called the Wind's Egg from her.

Although Madame Xanadu, among others, has no great love for or trust in the [[Phantom Stranger]], she is a member of the [[Sentinels of Magic]], a loose group of mages and mystics that are called upon to thwart [[Asmodel]]'s uprising in Hell. Nonetheless, she prefers to operate alone and is one of the few heroes who outright refuses to ally herself with the Stranger.

In order to gain more power, Madame Xanadu bartered her soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], who gave her three loyal demons named [[Bathopet, Maw and Atopeh]] to do her commands. At first, the demons responded to her every whim and almost raged out of her control. Over time, as she controlled her own emotions, she became able to control the demons as well.

===''Day of Vengeance''===
{{Main|Day of Vengeance}}
In ''Day of Vengeance'' #2, an ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' tie-in, the Spectre, then unstable and believing that magic equaled evil, disabled Madame Xanadu and took her eyes.

In the ''Day of Vengeance'' special it is revealed that Madame Xanadu is still blind. She has regrown her eyes 14 times, only for them to be burned out again, because the Spectre's powers are beyond hers. However, Madame Xanadu's abode would be the rallying point of the offense against the Spectre, gathering the Phantom Stranger, [[Zatanna]], and [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Nabu]].

Xanadu has also found a way around the Spectre's curse by training an adept, Daena, to read the cards for her. Through Daena, she sees the destruction of the world with the Spectre winning and destroying everything. It is at her place that Nabu begins his offense against the Spectre as well as the strategy for restoring the [[Rock of Eternity]].

===''One Year Later''===
{{See also|One Year Later}}
Madame Xanadu's standing in the new magic order has yet to be explored in detail. However, it is known that she is still trying to cure her blindness. She assists the [[Shadowpact]] when members of their team were temporarily blinded by the mystical powers of the villains known as 'the Congregation.' It is the mystical aspect that allows her to help, though some of the group are able to heal the blindness on their own.

Madame Xanadu appears in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #50, operating out of "Hokus &amp; Pokus Occult Curiosities" in [[Greenwich Village]]. She is unable to help [[Mary Marvel]] locate [[Captain Marvel Jr.]]  She does advise Mary to avoid [[Gotham City]], because "it isn't safe for magic."

===The New 52===
{{Main|The New 52}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Madame Xanadu has resurfaced as the result of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s unintentional tampering with the timestream and the merging of the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]], [[WildStorm]] and DC Universes.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new continuity Xanadu is no longer blind, and despite her past as Nimue still applying, she seems to have taken a more proactive stance during the Fall of Camelot. Instead of quietly observing like she did in her core miniseries, she staunchly opposed the surrendering of [[Excalibur]] to the [[Lady of the Lake]], and then started traveling with [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]], meeting other [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]-based heroes and villains as [[Vandal Savage]] and the [[Shining Knight (Sir Ystin)|Shining Knight]]. Furthermore, the Dark Ages Madame Xanadu is seen in a relationship with both Etrigan and Jason Blood, each one believing she was humoring the other for the sake of their forced merging.&lt;ref&gt;''Demon Knights'' #1 (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The present-day Madame Xanadu is featured in the DC Universe reboot, in ''[[Justice League Dark]]'', resuming her role as the keystone and supporter of the magical community in the DCU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MILLIGAN: DCnU JUSTICE LEAGUE Spin-off 'Emotionally Dark' |publisher=NEWSarama |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Dark'' #1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Xanadu assists the 'Dark League' in various incidents, such as Zatanna vanishing&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Dark'' #15 (Feb. 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[House of Mystery]] letting loose demonic threats in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Dark'' #19 (June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  She is at length revealed to be the mother of the supervillain [[Doctor Destiny]].

''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]'' was announced on April 6, 2012, as a revival of the anthology title, to be launched in July 2012 and to expand upon the New 52 universe by presenting single-issue stories about different DC characters, each by a different creative team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=38045 |title=DC Comics' "National Comics" Series to Explore the New 52 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes ''Madame X'' #1 by [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]]  and drawn by [[Trevor Hairsine]] and [[Fiona Staples]].

==Powers and abilities==
Madame Xanadu has a supernatural sensitivity to occult activities and mystic phenomena. She uses tarot cards to interpret what she senses, and is also able to tell the future of others. Xanadu can levitate objects, teleport herself, and banish demons. Madame Xanadu's parlor is full of magical books and objects, as well as jars containing the essences of malevolent entities. She rarely uses these objects of power, merely acting as a guardian of them.

Madame Xanadu is immortal, never aging and unable to die of natural causes thanks to her deal with Death. In the DC Universe, she may be outright unkillable even by beings such as the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].

==Other versions==

'''Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar''' (born 19 September 1940), is a [[crossbencher|crossbench]] member of the [[House of Lords]], an elected [[hereditary peer]], the holder of the original [[Earl of Mar|Earldom of Mar]], the oldest peerage title in the United Kingdom, and a farmer and former specialist [[Goat cheese|goats]] [[cheesemaker]] in [[Great Witley]], [[Worcestershire]]. She is the only ''[[suo jure]]'' [[countess]] in the House of Lords.

==Early life==
She was born '''Margaret Alison Lane''', the daughter of Millicent Mary Salton and James Clifton Lane, later [[James of Mar, 30th Earl of Mar]], the heir presumptive of [[Lionel Erskine-Young, 29th Earl of Mar]], his first cousin once removed (both were descended from a sister of [[John Goodeve-Erskine, 27th Earl of Mar]]).

Margaret had two younger siblings: [[David of Mar, Master of Mar]], and Lady Janet of Mar. In 1959, her father was officially recognised in the style ''of Mar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/the-%E2%80%98sheep-dip-lady%E2%80%99-vows-to-keep-up-the-fight-on-organophosphates/30774.article |title=The ‘sheep dip lady’ vows to keep up the fight on organophosphates |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901090959/http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/the-%E2%80%98sheep-dip-lady%E2%80%99-vows-to-keep-up-the-fight-on-organophosphates/30774.article |archivedate=1 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from that year his three children were also styled ''of Mar'', the name ''Lane'' being abandoned.

==Mistress of Mar==

When Margaret's father succeeded as 30th Earl of Mar in 1965 she became Lady Margaret of Mar, and her brother became The Master of Mar, Lord [[Garioch]]. When Lord Garioch died in 1967, Margaret became ''The Mistress of Mar'' as the elder heir-portioner presumptive in general of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hereditarypeerage.com/margaret-mar-31st-countess-of-mar/ |title=Margaret Mar, 31st Countess of Mar |work=Peers, the UK Peerage Magazine |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2016 |author=Nizinskyj, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countess of Mar==
When in 1975 her father the 30th Earl died, Lady Margaret became the 31st holder of the Mar earldom, the Premier Earldom of Scotland, and entered the House of Lords,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=THE LORD BISHOP OF NORWICH (Hansard, 28 October 1975) |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1975/oct/28/the-lord-bishop-of-norwich#S5LV0365P0_19751028_HOL_4 |house=House of Lords |date=28 October 1975 |column=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; making her maiden speech in April 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=TRAINING FACILITIES FOR INDUSTRY (Hansard, 7 April 1976) |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1976/apr/07/training-facilities-for-industry#S5LV0369P0_19760407_HOL_98 |house=House of Lords |date=7 April 1976 |column=1684}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the passing of [[House of Lords Act 1999]], Lady Mar was elected to serve as one of the ninety-two hereditary peers retained in the House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Lords Hansard text for 29 Oct 1999 (191029-02) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo991029/text/91029-02.htm#91029-02_head0 |house=House of Lords |date=29 October 1999 |column=510}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she sits as a [[cross-bencher]], meaning she is not aligned with any particular political party.

As Countess of Mar she is also [[Duke of Mar|titular 11th Duchess of Mar]] in the [[Jacobite Peerage]] (in which Peerage she is numbered as 33nd Countess of Mar, as the attainder of 1716–1824 is not recognised by the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]).

Lady Mar has held a number of positions within the House of Lords:
* Deputy Chair of Committees 1997–2007
* Select Committee on European Communities Sub-Committee C (Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection) 1997–1999
* Deputy Speaker 1999–2007
* Select Committee on European Union Sub-Committee D (Environment, Agriculture, Public Health and Consumer Protection / Environment and Agriculture) 2001–2005

==Illness==
In the summer of 1989, while [[Sheep dip|dipping her sheep]] through a tank of [[Organophosphate#Pesticides|organophosphorous chemicals]], Lady Mar was subjected to a splash of chemicals on her foot, and three weeks later developed headaches and muscular pains. She was eventually diagnosed with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booker |first=Christopher | authorlink=Christopher Booker |date=December 1995 |title=Poisoned by Order: Plight of Our Sheep Farmers |journal=[[Reader's Digest]] |location=UK |volume=147 |issue=884 |pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Lords Hansard text for 17 Jun 200917 Jun 2009  (pt 0010) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90617-0010.htm#090617108000019 | house=House of Lords |date=17 June 2009 |column=1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Julia |last=Hinde |title=Sick countess rounds on 'impartial' advisers |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=103449&amp;sectioncode=26 |work=Times Higher Education |location=UK |date=25 July 1997 |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then Lady Mar has used her seat in the [[House of Lords]] almost exclusively to press the government to provide suitable care and support for patients with similar long-term and poorly understood medical conditions, and to better regulate the use of organophosphates. This also led to her membership on the EU sub-committees listed above.

As a consequence of her illness, Lady Mar founded the organisation ''[http://www.forward-me.org.uk/ Forward-ME]'' to co-ordinate the activities of a fairly broad spectrum of charities and voluntary organisations working with patients with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], which is also known as [[Myalgic Encephalomyelitis|myalgic encephalomyelitis]] (ME).

==Family==
Lady Mar has married three times: first to Edwin Noel Artiss, then to John Salton, and finally to John Jenkin. From the first marriage she had a daughter: [[Susan of Mar, Mistress of Mar|Susan Helen of Mar, Mistress of Mar]] (born 1963), the heiress presumptive to her mother's peerage. Lady Susan is married to Bruce Alexander Wyllie, and has two daughters, Isabel and Frances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p8460.htm#84598 |title=Margaret Alison of Mar, Countess of Mar |work=The Peerage |date=28 December 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venerable Nikita [[Stylite]]s''', a [[saint]] of 12th century [[Russia]], led a dissolute life in his youth.  However, upon entering a [[Church (building)|church]] on a certain occasion he heard the words of the Prophet [[Isaiah]] (1:16) 'Wash you (of your [[sin]]s), make you clean;' with this a profound [[Religious conversion|conversion]] was effected in his [[soul]].

Thus converted Nikita left all he possessed and entered upon the [[ascetic]] life near [[Pereslavl-Zalessky|Pereyaslavl]].  His discipline led him to bind himself in chains and enclose himself within a pillar, thus the title 'stylite'.  He became well known as a healer.

Nikita Stylites was killed on May 16, 1186 during a robbery, the thieves having believed the hermit to have been bound by [[silver]] chains.

[[Venerable]] Nikita is commemorated [[May 24 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|May 24]] by the [[Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.orthodox.net/menaion-may/24-our-holy-father-nikita-stylites.html Our Holy Father Nikita Stylites].''

McCan was born at Prospect Lodge, Ballyanne Desmesne, [[County Wexford]],&lt;ref name=mcC&gt;Anthony McCan, [http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/m/c/c/Anthony-Mccan-Co-Cork/PDFBOOK1.pdf "The McCan family"], accessed 22 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Francis McCan, a land agent, and Jane Power. He was nephew of [[Patrick Joseph Power]], MP for [[East Waterford (UK Parliament constituency)|East Waterford]] from 1885 to 1913.&lt;ref name=IT&gt;Irish Times, 10 March 1919, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Clongowes Wood College]].&lt;ref name=IT/&gt; He resided at Ballyowen House, Dualla, [[Cashel, County Tipperary]], was an "extensive farmer" and was a member of the Tipperary Hunt.&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

He was a founder member of Sinn Féin in 1905. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} He joined the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] in 1909 and was a member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] from 1914 onward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

After more than 2,000 German and Austrian prisoners were imprisoned at Richmond Barracks, [[Templemore]] following the first battles of [[World War I]] in 1914, he plotted to engineer a mass escape but was thwarted when the prisoners were removed to Leigh, [[Lancashire]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John P. Walsh, ''A History Of Templemore And Its Environs'', JF Walsh (Roscrea) Ltd., 1991, p 106.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interned in 1916 after the [[Easter Rising]] for several months in [[Richmond Barracks]], Dublin, and [[Knutsford]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;&lt;ref name=adams&gt;[http://www.adams.ie/BidCat/SearchResults.asp?keywords=countermanding Notes from Adam's "Independence" auction catalogue], accessed 22 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1918, he was arrested under the [[German Plot (Ireland)|German Plot]] and detained in [[Gloucester (HM Prison)|Gloucester Jail]].&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

McCan was president of the East Tipperary executive of [[Sinn Féin]]. While incarcerated, he elected as a [[Sinn Féin]] MP for the [[East Tipperary (UK Parliament constituency)|East Tipperary]] constituency at the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]].&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1073|title=Pierce McCan|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs refused to recognise the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and instead assembled in the [[Mansion House, Dublin]] as a revolutionary parliament called [[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]. McCan never sat in Dáil Éireann, dying in prison in 1919 during the [[1918 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; On 9 March 1919, McCan was buried in Dualla, [[Cashel, County Tipperary]].&lt;ref name=mcC/&gt;

===Vacancy===
No by-election was called to replace him in the UK constituency. After 1 April 1922, the [[Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922]] prohibited any by-election,&lt;ref&gt;"Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922", sec.1(4) "No writ shall be issued after the passing of this Act for the election of a member to serve in the Commons House of Parliament for a constituency in Ireland other than a constituency in Northern Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt; and the constituency was abolished when parliament was dissolved on 26 October 1922 for [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|the general election]] on 15 November.

The First Dáil also considered how to fill the vacancy; a [[select committee]] in April recommended that the local Sinn Féin organisation which nominated him should nominate his replacement; a June proposal to postpone action, either for six months or until a Westminster by-election was held, was referred to another committee, which recommended that "in view of the circumstances which occasioned the vacancy, it was due to the memory of the late Pierce McCann that his place should not be filled at present".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1919061700018|title=East Tipperary Vacancy|date=17 June 1919|work=First Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1919061800007|title=Report of Select Committee on East Tipperary Vacancy|date=18 June 1919|work=First Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribute on death==
On 10 April 1919, [[Cathal Brugha]] told the [[First Dáil]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.F.O.191904100004.html|title=Dáil Éireann – Volume 1|work=Oireachtas Historical Debates|date=10 April 1919|accessdate=1 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607105722/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.F.O.191904100004.html|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Before I formally move the motion, as I have mentioned the name of Pierce McCan, I would ask the Members of the Dáil to stand up as a mark of our respect to the first man of our body to die for Ireland, and of our sympathy with his relatives. We are sure that their sorrow is lightened by the fact that his death was for the cause for which he would have lived, and that his memory will ever be cherished in the hearts of the comrades who knew him, and will be honoured by succeeding generations of his countrymen with that of the other martyrs of our holy cause." The [[McCan Barracks]] in [[Templemore]], [[County Tipperary]], is named after him.

==Family==
In the [[Irish general election, 1933|general election of January 1933]], McCan's brother, Joseph, a member of the National Farmers' and Ratepayers' Association, stood unsuccessfully for the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in the [[Tipperary (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1865 Joseph McCann], Elections Ireland, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell David''' "'''Russ'''" '''Roberts''' (born September 19, 1954) is an [[economist]] and a research fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hoover.org/profiles/russell-roberts | title = Russell Roberts profile | publisher = Hoover Institution, Stanford University | access-date = August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cafehayek.com/2012/09/joining-hoover-full-time.html | title = Joining Hoover full-time | author = Russ Roberts | publisher = Cafe Hayek | date = 5 September 2012 | accessdate = 24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for communicating economic ideas in understandable terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Editorial staff | title = In Praise of . . .

Weekly interviews with guests ranging from small business owners to Nobel Laureates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts categorizes himself as a proponent of [[Classical liberalism|classical economic liberalism]]. He has said, "I believe in [[limited government]] combined with [[personal responsibility]]. So I am something of a [[libertarian]], but . . . that term comes with some baggage and some confusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kenney | first = Allen | title = Russ Roberts Applies Adam Smith to Modern-Day Issues | publisher = REIT.com and Real Estate Investment Trusts magazine | date = March 16, 2015 | url = https://www.reit.com/news/reit-magazine/march-april-2015/russ-roberts-applies-adam-smith-modern-day-issues | access-date = July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Roberts was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in economics in 1975 from the [[University of North Carolina]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1981 for his thesis on the design of [[Transfer payment|government transfer programs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/303039469 ''A positive analysis of the design of government transfer programs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Russ_Roberts_CV.pdf | title = Russ Roberts' CV | publisher = Mercatus Center, George Mason University | accessdate = 29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/12/chris_anderson_2.html | title = Chris Anderson on Makers and Manufacturing | publisher = [[EconTalk]] | quote =  I remember when Gary Becker, my adviser in graduate school wrote a book | accessdate = 1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://cafehayek.com/2014/05/gary-becker-rip.html | title = Gary Becker, RIP  | publisher = [[Cafe Hayek]]| accessdate = 5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Roberts has taught at George Mason University, Washington University in St. Louis (where he was the founding director of what is now the Center for Experiential Learning), the University of Rochester, Stanford University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. He is a regular commentator on business and economics for [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Noguchi | first = Yuki | title = Solving The 'Wage Puzzle': Why Aren't Paychecks Growing? | publisher = ''National Public Radio'' | date = August 2, 2018 | url = https://www.npr.org/2018/08/02/634754091/solving-the-wage-puzzle-why-aren-t-paychecks-growing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has written for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

Roberts also blogs at ''[[Cafe Hayek]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cafehayek.com/ ''Cafe Hayek'']&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Donald J. Boudreaux]] at George Mason University in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://economics.gmu.edu/people/rrobert2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books about Economics===

Roberts has written a number of books which illustrate economic concepts in unconventional ways.

In 2001 he published the novel ''The Invisible Heart: An Economic Romance'', which conveys economic ideas through conversations between two fictional teachers at an exclusive high school in Washington, D.C.: one is a [[market oriented]] economics instructor, and the other is an English teacher who wants governmental protections that curb the excesses of [[Laissez-faire|unrestrained capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Book review of ''The Invisible Heart: An Economic Romance'' | publisher = Publisher's Weekly | date = February 1, 2001 | url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-262-18210-2 | access-date = July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Roberts released another novel, ''The Price of Everything: A Parable of Possibility and Prosperity'', which focuses on the experiences of Ramon Fernandez, a university student and star tennis player who, as a child, accompanied his mother to the U.S. after she fled from [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]]. Like ''The Invisible Heart'', ''The Price of Everything'' uses conversations between its main characters to address economic concepts (in this case ideas such as the [[price system]], [[spontaneous order]] and the possibility of [[price gouging]] in crisis situations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Steelman | first = Aaron | title = Bringing Life to the Dismal Science: Book review of ''The Price of Everything'' | publisher = Region Focus ("The economics magazine of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond") | date = Fall 2008 | url = https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/region_focus/2008/fall/pdf/book_review.pdf | access-date = July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Roberts offered an uncommon perspective on [[Adam Smith]] in his book, ''How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness''. The book does not discuss Smith's well known 1776 work, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''; it instead examines Smith's 1759 precursor to [[behavioral economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = David | title = Book review of 'How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness', by Russ Roberts | newspaper = Financial Times | location = London | date = November 23, 2014 | url = https://www.ft.com/content/25389abe-70a2-11e4-9129-00144feabdc0 | access-date = July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gregoire | first = Carolyn | title = Before 'The Wealth Of Nations,' Adam Smith Penned The Ultimate Guide To A Moral Life | publisher = Huffington Post | date = September 9, 2014 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/09/before-he-wrote-a-manifes_n_5772360.html | access-date = August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

===Policy positions===
Roberts generally opposes [[Keynesian economics]] - particularly [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus spending]] - saying that "it's very hard to argue in logical terms that spending money unwisely is the way to get wealthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people = Interview of Russ Roberts by Nick Gillespie |title = Russ Roberts: Why Keynesians Always Get it Wrong (and Most Economists Too) |medium = video {quote is at 3 min. 2 sec.} |publisher = ''Reason'' magazine |date = October 11, 2012 |url = http://reason.com/reasontv/2012/10/11/russ-roberts-on-the-economic-fallicies-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011 he initiated a lively, extended conversation with the [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] over the effectiveness of Keynesian policies by declaring that "Krugman is a Keynesian because he wants [[Big government|bigger government]]. I'm an anti-Keynesian because I want [[Small government|smaller government]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cafehayek.com/2011/10/the-evidence-for-keynesian-economics.html | title = The evidence for Keynesian economics | author = Russ Roberts | website = ''Cafe Hayek (blog)'' | date = October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman quoted this statement in his response and then said that "Keynesianism is not and never has been about promoting bigger government," and also that "you find conservative economists promoting quite Keynesian views of [[stabilization policy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/i-am-not-your-mirror-image/ | title = I Am Not Your Mirror Image | author = Paul Krugman | website = ''The Conscience of a Liberal (blog)'' | date = October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent posts, the two economists disagreed on many things, but neither one contested one central idea: Krugman was content to be characterized as a Keynesian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/06/why-am-i-a-keynesian/ | title = Why Am I A Keynesian? | author = Paul Krugman | website = ''The Conscience of a Liberal (blog)'' | date = June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Roberts, most definitely, was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cafehayek.com/2015/06/krugman-is-human-just-like-me.html | title = Krugman is human, just like me | author = Russ Roberts | website = ''Cafe Hayek (blog)'' | date = June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts has urged those who formulate [[public policy]] and the economists who advise them to be more skeptical of the findings of [[Empirical research|empirical studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-15/how-to-restore-faith-in-economics | title = How to Restore Faith in Economics: Mathematical theories didn't predict the Great Recession. Research grounded in data should hold up better. | last = Smith | first = Noah | date = March 15, 2017 | publisher = Bloomberg View | access-date = August 4, 2017 | quote = [S]keptics [like Roberts] are telling us to discount the empirical evidence now pouring out of the economics profession. [They] note that many empirical studies disagree with each other, and others are later proven wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he views ultra-specific claims by politicians that their promoted policies will produce a certain number of [[Employment|jobs]] or a certain amount of [[Economic growth|growth]] as inherently unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Kyle | title = When All Economics Is Political: The dismal science has too much junk science, says Russ Roberts, an evangelist for humility in a discipline where it is often hard to find. | newspaper = Wall Street Journal | date = May 13, 2016 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-all-economics-is-political-1463178093 | access-date = August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of the '''sexuality of Jesus''', the traditional understanding of [[Christian]] churches is that [[Jesus]] did not marry and remained [[celibate]] until his death. That has not prevented speculation about alternative theories of his sexuality. The [[Gospels]] and the [[New Testament]] reveal little on the subject.

==Heterosexuality==

===Mary Magdalene===

{{See also|Mary Magdalene#Relationship with Jesus}}

[[File:TINTORETTO - Magdalena penitente (Musei Capitolini, Roma, 1598-1602) - copia.jpg|thumb|''The Penitent Magdalene'' by [[Domenico Tintoretto]]]]

The non-canonical  [[Gospel of Philip]] (dating from around the third century&lt;!-- see article --&gt;) describes Jesus's relationship with [[Mary Magdalene]] using [[Coptic language|Coptic]] variants of the Greek κοινωνός (''koinōnos''). That work uses cognates of ''koinōnos'' and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse, but also metaphorically, referring to a spiritual partnership, and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marjanen|first=Antti|title=The Woman Jesus Loved: Mary Magdalene in the Nag Hammadi Library and Related Documents|year=1996|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004106588|pages=151–60 et passim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TalC9sUIgE0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Magdalene is mentioned as one of three Marys "who always walked with the Lord" and as his companion (Philip 59.6–11). The work also says that the Lord loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often (63.34–36).&lt;ref name="KingFrontline"&gt;King, Karen L. "Women In Ancient Christianity: The New Discoveries".  ''Frontline'': The First Christians. Web: 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[John Dickson (author)|John Dickson]] argues that it was common in early Christianity to kiss a fellow believer by way of greeting,{{Bibleref2c|1Peter|5:14|ESV|1 Pet. 5:14}} thus such kissing would have no romantic connotations.&lt;ref name="dickson95"&gt;''The Christ Files: How Historians Know What They Know About Jesus'', John Dickson, p. 95 (Sydney South: Blue Bottle Books, 2006). {{ISBN|1-921137-54-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kripal writes that "the historical sources are simply too contradictory and simultaneously too silent" to make absolute declarations regarding Jesus' sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey John Kripal, ''The Serpent's Gift: Gnostic Reflections on the Study of Religion'', p. 52 (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2007). {{ISBN|0-226-45380-4}} {{ISBN|0-226-45381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bart Ehrman concludes that historical evidence tells us nothing at all about Jesus' sexuality—"certainly nothing to indicate that Jesus and Mary had a sexual relationship of any kind". Ehrman (a scholar of the Greek New Testament and Early Christianity) says that the question people ask him most often is whether Mary Magdalene and Jesus of Nazareth married each other: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not true that the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] contained Gospels that discussed Mary and Jesus. (...) Nor is it true that the marriage of Mary and Jesus is repeatedly discussed in the Gospels that didn't make it into the New Testament. In fact, it is never discussed at all—never even mentioned, not even once. (...) It is not true that the Gospel of Philip calls Mary Jesus' spouse."&lt;ref&gt;B. D. Ehrman, ''Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend.'' New York: Oxford, 2006. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Homosexuality==

===The Disciple Whom Jesus Loved===

{{Main article|Disciple whom Jesus loved}}

The [[Gospel of John]] makes references to the ''[[disciple whom Jesus loved]]'' (John &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||John|13:23}}&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||John|19:26}}&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||John|21:7–20}}&lt;/span&gt;), a phrase which does not occur in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. In the text, this ''beloved disciple'' is present at the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], with [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Jesus' mother, Mary]].

The ''disciple whom Jesus loved'' may be a self-reference by the author of the Gospel (John 21:24), traditionally regarded as [[John the Apostle]]. Rollan McCleary, author of ''Signs for a Messiah'', thinks this identification would make the phrase highly significant.&lt;ref&gt;Crosswalk: ''[http://www.crosswalk.com/1202502 Gay Jesus' Claim Draws Fire]'' by Patrick Goodenough, Pacific Rim Bureau Chief, CNSNews.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valentin de boulogne, John and Jesus.jpg|thumb|''Jesus and John at the Last Supper'', by [[Valentin de Boulogne]]]]

In subsequent centuries the reference was used by those who implied a [[homosocial]] or [[homoerotic]] reading of the relationship. For example, Saint [[Aelred of Rievaulx]], in his work ''De spiritali amicitia'' ("Spiritual Friendship"), referred to the relationship of Jesus and John the Apostle as a "marriage" and held it out as an example sanctioning friendships between clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James I of England]] may have been relying on a pre-existing tradition when he defended his relationship with the young [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]: "I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had his son John, and I have my George."&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Panoply, Brief Lives Of The English Monarchs'', Carrolly Erickson, St. Martin's Press (May 2, 2006). {{ISBN|0-312-31643-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who have given voice to this interpretation of the relationship between Jesus and John have been the philosophers [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other researchers reject the theory.

[[Gene Robinson]] discussed the possible homoerotic inclinations of Jesus in a sermon in 2005. Robinson's claim has been widely criticized, most notably by David W. Virtue, who called it an "appalling [[deconstruction]]ism from the liberal lobby which will spin even the remotest thing to turn it into a hint that Biblical figures are gay".&lt;ref name="Gene Robinson"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Day, Elizabeth |title= Jesus might have been homosexual, says the first openly gay bishop |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1487002/Jesus-might-have-been-homosexual-says-the-first-openly-gay-bishop.html |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= April 3, 2005 |location= London |accessdate= January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Goss]] the author of ''Jesus Acted Up, A Gay and Lesbian Manifesto'' and ''Queering Christ, Beyond Jesus Acted Up'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Jamie|title=Goss challenges traditional Christian beliefs|url=http://media.www.webujournal.com/media/storage/paper245/news/2002/12/05/Culture/Goss-Challenges.Traditional.Christian.Beliefs-336580.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070810074838/http://media.www.webujournal.com/media/storage/paper245/news/2002/12/05/Culture/Goss-Challenges.Traditional.Christian.Beliefs-336580.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 August 2007|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; said of the interaction between Jesus and John, it "is a [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationship between an older man and a younger man. A Greek reader would understand." (see [[Pederasty in Ancient Greece]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hank Hyena, [http://www.salon.com/feature/1998/04/cov_10feature.html "Was Jesus Gay: A search for the messiah's true sexuality leads to a snare of lusty theories", p.2, 1998–04] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217080422/http://www.salon.com/feature/1998/04/cov_10feature.html |date=February 17, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the writer Robert Gagnon has argued that the Greek word translated as "loved" is [[agape]] (used, for example, in John &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||John|3:16}}&lt;/span&gt;; "for God so loved the world"), rather than the Greek word referring to sexual love, ''{{transl|el|ISO|[[eros]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, ''The Bible and homosexual practice'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Naked Youth===

The Gospel of Mark (14:51–53), describes how in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], "A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they [the Temple guards] seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind."

The text of the [[naked youth]] is puzzling for conventional interpreters because it associates an unnamed and suggestively erotic youth very closely with Jesus. Moreover, the text only appears in Mark which has led to the tradition that Mark wrote himself into the text.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Myles, ''[http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume4/number2/pp66-81 Dandy Discipleship: A Queering of Mark’s Male Disciples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701040943/http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume4/number2/pp66-81 |date=2013-07-01 }}'' JMMS 4:2 (2010), p. 66–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The separate and non-canonical "[[Secret Gospel of Mark]]"—fragments of which were contained in the controversial [[Mar Saba letter]] by [[Clement of Alexandria]], which [[Morton Smith]] claimed to have discovered in 1958—states that Jesus during one night taught ''the mystery of the kingdom of God'' alone to a youth wearing a linen cloth. This has been linked to the views of an ancient group called the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]]. Some modern commentators interpret it as a baptism, others as some form of sexual initiation, and others as an [[allegory]] for a non-sexual initiation into a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Miller |title=The Complete Gospels: annotated Scholars Version |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |year=1994 |page=411 |isbn=9780060655877}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authorship of "Secret Mark" is still a matter of debate&lt;ref name="Charlesworth"&gt;Pheme Perkins, [https://books.google.it/books?id=GZOtAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA663 "Apocryphal Gospels and the Historical Jesus"], in [[James H. Charlesworth]], Brian Rhea, Petr Pokorny (editors); ''Jesus Research: New Methodologies and Perceptions'' (2014), pp. 663-664, [[Eerdmans]], [[Grand Rapids]]: [[Michigan]], {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6728-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and many scholars consider it to be Smith's [[forgery]],&lt;ref name="Charlesworth" /&gt; while others believe it to be a modern [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphon]].&lt;ref name="Charlesworth" /&gt;

==Celibacy==

===Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven===

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]], Jesus is reported to have referred to the behaviour of [[eunuchs]] to illustrate an approach to sexuality: "For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake." (Matthew {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:3–12}})

The term "eunuch" normally referred to a [[castrated]] man. Several [[theologians]] and Bible commentators have interpreted this passage as indicating Jesus's support for [[celibacy]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;In the ancient Middle East and Asia, eunuchs often served as officials overseeing harems, or in other Royal positions. See &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/eunuch.htm Encyclopaedia of the Orient]&lt;/span&gt; for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christian writer [[Origen]] interpreted Jesus' words literally and so physically castrated himself as an act of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;J. David Hester (2005). ''Eunuchs and the Postgender Jesus: Matthew 19:12 and Transgressive Sexualities''. Journal for the Study of the New Testament, Vol. 28, No. 1, 13–40 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  The early [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] wrote that Jesus himself lived as a "eunuch",&lt;ref group=note&gt;Note: There is some controversy in this statement as in context, ''spado'', which in most cases means "eunuch", is generally translated as "virgin" as in [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Tertullian: Part Fourth/On Monogamy/Chapter 3|here]] and a fuller explanation can be found &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zV0jVQK0K14C&amp;pg=PA85 here]&lt;/span&gt;. e.g. Tertullian, On Monogamy, 3: "...He stands before you, if you are willing to copy him, as a voluntary ''spado'' (eunuch) in the flesh." And elsewhere: "The Lord Himself opened the kingdom of heaven to eunuchs and He Himself lived as a eunuch. The apostle [Paul] also, following His example, made himself a eunuch..."&lt;/ref&gt; likewise encouraged people to adopt this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Adversus Marcionem i.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bride of Christ===

The [[Bride of Christ]] is a [[metaphor]] for the [[Ecclesia (church)]], likening the relationship between [[Christians]] and [[Jesus]] to a [[betrothal]] pointing to a future wedding, when Christians are re-united with Jesus. In the [[Gospel of John]] (&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||John|3:22–36}}&lt;/span&gt;), [[John the baptist]] speaks in terms of himself as a "[[best man]]" with the implication that Christ the bridegroom (see also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|9:15}}&lt;/span&gt;) is coming to meet his bride, although there is nothing specific to identify the bride. [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Cyprian]] applied the image to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian of Carthage, De Ecclesiae Catholicae Unitate, 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polygamy==

===Latter Day Saints===

Early Latter Day Saint Apostle [[Orson Hyde]] taught that Jesus was a [[polygamy|polygamist]] who was married to Mary Magdalene, [[Martha]], and [[Mary of Bethany]], and fathered children with them. He also taught that the [[marriage at Cana]] was Jesus' own wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Orson Hyde, Conference message, October 6, 1854, Journal of Discourses 2:82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Today's Mormonism'' by Richard Abanes 2007 {{ISBN|0-7369-1968-6}} page 239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Disparity in Doctrine and Theology'' by E Roberts 2011 {{ISBN|1-4497-1210-X}} page 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cky J.

Smith]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [http://www.mrm.org/files/images/was-jesus-married-letter.jpg Handwritten note responding to letter from J. Ricks Smith], 1963.{{better source|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction, art, and imagination==
The ''[[Children of God (Cult)|Children of God]]'' Christian group actively promotes the view that a sexual relationship with Jesus would be desirable, encouraging devotees to imagine during sexual activity that it is Jesus who is having sex with them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/lj.htm The "Loving Jesus" Revelation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429093717/http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/lj.htm |date=2009-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and equate prophecy with Jesus' [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Golden_seeds Golden seeds]&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Christian figures have also been accused of similar thoughts. [[Saint Teresa of Avila|Teresa of Avila]]'s description of her most famous vision has been interpreted by secular writers, such as [[Dan Brown]], as "a metaphor for some serious sex";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Dan|author-link=Dan Brown|year=2000|title=Angels &amp; Demons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXznEnKwTdAC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=New York, NY|publisher=Washington Square Press|page=285|isbn=978-1-4165-8082-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view of Teresa having a sexual relationship with Jesus, in her visions, is exemplified by the poster art for ''[[Theresa: The Body of Christ]]'', a 2007 film by [[Ray Loriga]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Due to copyright restrictions, see ''[[Theresa: The Body of Christ]]'' article for poster.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional poem ''[[The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name]]'' speculated what it would have been like if Jesus had had several sexual encounters with other men—including with [[Pontius Pilate]], and a graphic description of Jesus' sexual encounter with a Roman soldier; Christian opposition to the poem's suggestions resulted in the ''[[Whitehouse v Lemon|Whitehouse v. Lemon]]'' court case, a famous [[blasphemous libel]] trial.&lt;ref name="Pink News Blasphemy"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Staff Writer|title=The gay poem that broke blasphemy laws|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/01/10/the-gay-poem-that-broke-blasphemy-laws/|website=pinknews.co.uk|publisher=Pink News|accessdate=25 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603121627/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/01/10/the-gay-poem-that-broke-blasphemy-laws/|archivedate=3 June 2012|date=10 January 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sadomasochistic]] undertones of the [[death of Jesus|crucifixion]] have been commented upon, and occasionally portrayed explicitly in modern art; for [[satirical]] reasons, this was depicted in the controversial ''Jesus with erection'' poster, a concept which has also been depicted for serious reasons in sculpture by [[Terence Koh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/art.religion | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Cock and bull | first=Julian | last=Baggini | date=September 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spark Master Tape'''  is the [[pseudonym]] of an anonymous rapper. He has released five [[mixtape]]s since 2012 with an announced sixth tape releasing sometime in the future. These albums have garnered interest from blogs and music websites such as ''[[Mass Appeal Magazine]]'', passionweiss.com, The Daily Dot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/who-is-spark-master-tape/|title=Spark Master Tape finds a voice under the mask|date=25 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Noisey.Vice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/4xxgd3/the-legend-and-mystery-of-spark-master-tape-grows-ever-larger-noisey-raps|title=The Legend and Mystery of Spark Master Tape Grows Ever Larger: Noisey Raps|date=13 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Complex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/03/spark-master-tape-new-video-premiere-tenkkeys|title=Premiere: Spark Master Tape and His Crew Get Into Some Mischief in the "Tenkkeys" Video|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;, DJBooth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2016-08-30-spark-master-tape-kkallabassass|title=First Listen: Spark Master Tape Delivers Trunk-Rattling "KKALLABASSASS"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and The Fader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Payne|first=Michael|title=Who is Spark Master Tape and What Does He Do?|url=http://passionweiss.com/2013/05/03/who-is-spark-master-tape-and-what-does-he-do/|publisher=passionweiss.com|access-date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few. All of his beats are produced by Paper Platoon, which is also the name of his unique collective that includes visual artists and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Payne|first=Michael|title=Questions in the Form of an Answer: An Interview with Spark Master Tape|url=http://passionweiss.com/2013/08/23/question-in-the-form-of-an-answers-an-interview-with-spark-master-tape/|publisher=passionweiss.com|access-date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spark Master Tape’s second mixtape, 2013’s ''The #SWOUP Serengeti'', was described by [[Mishka NYC]] as, “enough bump and 808s to satisfy y’all that think Juicy J is god and enough verbal dexterity to have everyone that misses the old days of rappity rapping.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spark Master Tape|url=http://mishkanyc.com/bloglin/2013/08/06/spark-master-tape-the-swoup-serengeti-free-album-download/|publisher=Mishka|access-date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Masking his voice by pitching it down and sampling everything from 2pac to rare soul, Spark Master Tape has been described as “a gimmick, a sonic choice, or something in-between.”

In 2014, Spark Master Tape became unresponsive. His Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram had been abandoned. There was no information about Spark's whereabouts. The rest of the Paper Platoon collective were also gone. Rumors circulated that he may be in prison - this was completely false and nothing but a rumor. No official word was given by anyone in Paper Platoon.

On January 25, 2016, after about two years since his mysterious disappearance, Spark Master Tape tweeted "#SWOUP". This was the first communication from Spark since 2014. A week or so later, a video was posted to the official Spark Master Tape YouTube and Facebook, which showed a small group of people, filmed in black and white, wearing strange masks. At the end of this video, which was titled "SUNKKEN", words appear on the screen that say "Silhouette of a Sunkken City" and "March". This is in reference to his long-awaited third album, Silhouette of a Sunkken City. He then released his first song since his return, "Livin' Lavish", on February 19. The music video for "Livin' Lavish" was released on February 23. In an interview with The Fader explaining his new video and sudden return, Spark Master Tape said, “2016 the year of that sewage and garbage, we out here militant and ignorant. Schemin’ on everybody with a hoverboard and a dream. Shout out to DJ Charlie holdin' shit down like he back to baptizing. We out the ocean, ready. In the name of Spark, the Paper Platoon and the holy #SWOUP; we shall rise.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.thefader.com/2016/02/23/spark-master-tape-livin-lavish|title = Spark Master Tape Returns With Menacing "Livin' Lavish" Video|website = The FADER|access-date = 8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, after a short period of silence, fans received a brand new #SWOUP visual "Tenkkeys". In an interview with Complex, the Paper Platoon General said "It all started with some SWOUP and a hand grenade, five years later we swimmin' out the case like Polly Pocket lookin' for a place to park this 2106 Lada. We on that 3-6-5, cash grab with a chance of voluntary manslaughter. #SWOUP". On the same premiere, it was announced that Spark's third album would drop April 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.complex.com/music/2016/03/spark-master-tape-new-video-premiere-tenkkeys|title = Premiere: Spark Master Tape And His Crew Get Into Some Mischief In The "Tenkkeys" Video|website = Complex|access-date = 29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in October 2016 that Spark Master Tape would be opening for Run the Jewels on their Run the World Tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/run-the-jewels-announce-first-leg-of-run-the-world-tour-w447797|title=Run the Jewels Announce First Leg of Run the World Tour|author=|date=|website=RollingStone.com|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in January 2017 it was announced that they would have to pull out of the remaining tour dates due to unspecified "legalities" out of their control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SparkMasterTape/status/816784157527261184|title=pic.twitter.com/P5veISG5D0|first=✖️|last=✖️ ✖️ ✖️ ✖️|date=|website=Twitter.com|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, Spark Master Tape introduced Flmmboiint Frdii, a new artist that is featured in his fifth EP "Seven Sekkonds of Silence". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SparkMasterTape/status/908505046500773888|title=✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️ on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tenderloins''' is an American comedy troupe currently composed of '''Joseph''' "'''Joe'''" '''Gatto''', '''James''' "'''Murr'''" '''Murray''', '''Brian''' "'''Q'''" '''Quinn''', and '''Salvatore''' "'''Sal'''" '''Vulcano'''. The group stars in the popular television series ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'', which premiered on December 15, 2011. The program currently airs on [[truTV]] in the U.S. and on  [[Comedy Central]] in the UK, Ireland, and India.

==Before the Tenderloins==
The comedians met in religion class during freshman year at [[Monsignor Farrell High School]] on [[Staten Island]] in 1990. They became interested in drama and improv and joined an improv club because "it was the only way to meet girls", as their private high school was only for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/entertainment/television/2016/06/09/murr-impractical-jokers-jokes-us/85351692/|title=Murr of 'Impractical Jokers': 'The joke's on us'|work=Green Bay Press-Gazette|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2016|first= Kendra |last= Meinert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/12/16/staten-island-quartet-takes-pranks-to-impractical-heights/|title=Staten Island quartet takes pranks to ‘Impractical’ heights|work=New York Post|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2016|first= Andrea |last= Morabito}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Vulcano kept a list of words that they'd be embarrassed to say in a public setting. When searching for a name for their comedy troupe, Sal's list, which included "culottes", "gargoyle", and "nougat", was used. The group eventually chose "the Tenderloins".

==Career==

===Stage===
After finishing college, James Murray worked for the Staten Island Ferry where he ran into his friend Sal. They reminisced about their enjoyment doing improv. After reuniting with Joe and another friend, Mike Boccio, they practiced improv at Joe's house three days a week, for six months. The Tenderloins began in 1999 as a live [[improv comedy]] and [[sketch comedy]] troupe.

They have performed in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and participated in the San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival and the Miami Improv Festival.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The troupe briefly consisted of five members. However, Gideon Horowitz soon left the group for personal reasons.

After the success of ''Impractical Jokers'', the Tenderloins have also taken part in several American and international tours.

===Internet success===
Following years of live shows, in 2006, the Tenderloins redirected their talents to filmed comedic sketches. Brian Quinn subsequently replaced Mike Boccio as the troupe's fourth member.

The Tenderloins' comedic sketches have accumulated millions of views on [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], [[Metacafe]], and other websites. In 2007, the troupe won the $100,000 grand prize in the [[NBC]] ''It’s Your Show'' competition for the sketch "Time Thugs".

===Television===
Following the troupe's online successes, the four were signed to develop a scripted comedy pilot for [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] based on their own lives. The pilot was shot on location in 2008 on [[Staten Island]], as well as at other locations around [[New York City]]. Spike TV ultimately passed on the series. A second pilot starring the Tenderloins was officially selected for the 2009 New York Television Festival.

On April 12, 2011, truTV announced a new series to star the Tenderloins. ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'' premiered on December 15, 2011, executive-produced by the troupe themselves. Season 1 consisted of 16  episodes. The first season was watched by over 32 million viewers.

The show's second season premiered on December 13, 2012 and consist of 28 episodes. Its third season had 31 episodes and premiered on January 2, 2014.&lt;ref name=s3&gt;{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title='Impractical Jokers' Renewed for Season 3 by truTV; New Series 'Jokers After Party' Greenlit|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/07/08/impactical-jokers-renewed-for-season-3-by-trutv-new-series-jokers-after-party-greenlit/190843/|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=July 8, 2013|date=July 8, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711221610/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/07/08/impactical-jokers-renewed-for-season-3-by-trutv-new-series-jokers-after-party-greenlit/190843/|archivedate=July 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2014, truTV announced that the series would be renewed for a 26-episode fourth season.&lt;ref name=s4&gt;{{cite news|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|title='Impractical Jokers' Renewed by TruTV; Joins Six New Series Greenlights|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/21/impractical-jokers-renewed-by-trutv-joins-six-new-series-greenlights/256054/|accessdate=April 22, 2014|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fourth season renewal, a 6-episode [[Spinoff (television)|spinoff]] series, ''Jokers Wild!'', was also announced.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt; The show was renewed for a fifth season, which began on February 2016.

After another successful season, ''Impractical Jokers'' was renewed for a seventh season that began on February 1, 2018. In March 2018 TruTV announced the Impractical Jokers was renewed for an eight season that will consist of 26 episodes and will premiere sometime in February 2019. TruTV also announced that an Impractical Jokers feature-length movie, ''[[Impractical Jokers Movie]]'', will go into production in the spring of 2018.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Otterson|first1=Joe|title=‘Impractical Jokers’ Renewed for Season 8 at truTV, Set First Feature Film|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/impractical-jokers-renewed-trutv-first-movie-1202720639/|website=Variety|accessdate=28 April 2018|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the troupe will star in a new [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] series, ''[[Misery Index (TV series)|Misery Index]]'', based on the card game "Shit Happens," created by [[Andy Breckman]], who created and wrote the popular TV series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' and the recent [[Netflix]] series ''[[The Good Cop]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deadline.com/2018/10/tbs-picks-up-comedy-game-show-misery-index-starring-the-tenderloins-to-series-from-monk-creator-1202479999/ Petski, Denise, "TBS Picks Up Comedy Game Show ‘Misery Index’ Starring The Tenderloins To Series From ‘Monk’ Creator,"] ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', October 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
In February 2017, Murr tweeted that he and the group had recorded the first episode of an upcoming limited-run show for SiriusXM Radio. On August 17, 2017, ''The Tenderloins Radio Show'' made its debut on SiriusXM Radio channel 94 (Comedy Greats). In the hour-long broadcast, the comedy troupe pranks friends and acquaintances, takes calls, answers emails from fans, and does sketches in a segment called "Tenderloins Theatre". The show airs on Thursdays at 6 p.m ET, with rebroadcasts the following day at 11 a.m ET.

===Podcast===

====''The Tenderloins Podcast''====
The group began hosting a [[podcast]] in April 2012. It is available on their official website and [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetenderloins.com/podcast-2/|title=Podcast|last=|first=|date=|website=The Tenderloins|access-date=3 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''What Say You?''====
''What Say You?'', an occasional podcast hosted by Sal and Q, was named Best New Show at the 2013 Stitcher Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2nd Annual Stitcher Awards|url=http://www.stitcher.com/blog/?p=1375|website=Stitcher Blog|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased popularity of ''What Say You'' sparked a friendly competition among the friends, spurring Joe and Murr to release their own Tenderloins podcast without the other two members. In 2015, ''What Say You?'' was nominated for the Comedy, Entertainment, and Best Produced Podcast Awards at the 10th Annual Podcast Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th Annual Winners and Nominees|url=http://www.podcastawards.com/|website=Podcast Awards|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sal and Q have stated that the podcast is their own side project, not a replacement of ''The Tenderloins Podcast''. The group explained that it was difficult to coordinate the schedules of all four members outside of work, making it challenging to produce their troupe's official podcast with any regularity.

'''Tobias Picker''' (born July 18, 1954)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobiaspicker.com/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207034128/http://tobiaspicker.com/bio.html |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[composer]] noted for his numerous works for the stage, including several operas, in addition to works for orchestra and chamber orchestra.

==Biography==
Picker was born in [[New York City]]. He began composing at the age of eight, and studied at the [[Juilliard School]] in his youth; he later attended the [[Manhattan School of Music]], where he studied with [[Charles Wuorinen]] and [[John Corigliano]]. He returned to the [[Juilliard School]] to earn his Master's in Music, and also pursued further studies at [[Princeton University]] with [[Milton Babbitt]]. By the age of thirty, Picker had been recognized with numerous awards, including the [[Joseph H. Bearns Prize]] ([[Columbia University]]), a [[Charles Ives Prize|Charles Ives Scholarship]], and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. In 1992, he received the Award in Music from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], where he was later elected to lifetime membership in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsandletters.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2012members.pdf|title=THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS ANNOUNCES NEWLY ELECTED MEMBERS |last=Bolster |first=Jane |date=March 12, 2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picker began composing music at an early age, and was quickly commissioned to compose new works, such as "Sextet No. 3", commissioned by [[Speculum Musicae]] and premiered at [[Alice Tully Hall]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/22/archives/concert-speculum-musicae-presents-old-and-new.html|title=Concert: Speculum Musicae Presents 'Old' and New|last=Schonberg|first=Harold C.|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, Picker continued to compose instrumental music, and was appointed the first composer-in-residence of the [[Houston Symphony]] from 1985-1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/arts-culture/2017/02/24/189392/picker-paganini-and-the-piano/|title=Picker, Paganini, And The Piano {{!}} Houston Public Media |last=Zinn |first=Joshua |date=2017-02-24 |work=Houston Public Media|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picker has served as composer-in-residence for such major international festivals as the [[Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival]] and the [[Pacific Music Festival]].

Picker composed his first song in 1984; throughout the early 1990s, he continued to compose music for voice. In 1994, Picker composed his first opera, ''[[Emmeline (opera)|Emmeline]]'', commissioned by the [[Santa Fe Opera]], with a libretto by [[J. D. McClatchy|J.D. McClatchy]]. Since then, he has written numerous celebrated operas, including ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (opera)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]], [[Thérèse Raquin (opera)|Thérèse Raquin,]] [[An American Tragedy (opera)|An American Tragedy]],'' and ''[[Dolores Claiborne (opera)|Dolores Claiborne]].'' In 2010, Picker composed his first ballet, ''Awakenings'', for the [[Rambert Dance Company]], inspired by the work of [[Oliver Sacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rambert.org.uk/performances/awakenings/|title=Awakenings - Rambert|last=http://palace.co|first=Palace -|work=Rambert|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picker was appointed artistic director of [[Tulsa Opera]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tulsaopera.com/about-us/artistic-director/|title=Artistic Director – Tulsa Opera|website=tulsaopera.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Picker has been diagnosed with [[Tourette's syndrome]]. He has mentioned that there are "tourettic" elements to his music. He appeared in a [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|BBC Horizon]] television documentary, titled ''Mad But Glad'', about the link between Tourette's syndrome and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/madbutglad/highlights/index_textonly.shtml |title=Horizon - Mad But Glad |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been involved in mentoring programs for children with Tourette's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsanj.org/tsanj/in-action/nl/docs/tsanj_nl6.pdf |format=PDF |title=TSANJ PARTNERS WITH RUTGERS ON TOURETTE SYNDROME CLINIC |website=Tsanj.org |accessdate=2016-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215135240/http://www.tsanj.org/tsanj/in-action/nl/docs/tsanj_nl6.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Picker has various tics which disappear when he's composing, playing the piano, or conducting. He has said, "I live my life controlled by Tourette's...but I use music to control it. I have harnessed its energy—I play with it, manipulate it, trick it, mimic it, taunt it, explore it, exploit it, in every possible way."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Sacks, ''Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain'', revised and expanded (New York: Random House, 2007), p. 252. {{ISBN|978-0-676-97979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picker was an acquaintance of neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]. According to Sacks, Picker related that he found his "problem" in his life was "congenital musicality" rather than Tourette's. Picker began to play the piano at age four, and by age seven found he could reproduce large passages of music. He "found himself overwhelmed by musical emotion." As related by Sacks, "He said that it was understood, practically from the start, that he would be a musician, and that he had little chance of doing anything else, because his musicality was all-consuming...he sometimes felt that his musicality controlled him, rather than the other way around."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Sacks, ''Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain'', revised and expanded (New York: Random House, 2007), p. 99. {{ISBN|978-0-676-97979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picker's partner since 1980 has been [[Aryeh Lev Stollman]]. He is a neuroradiologist and author, and has won a [[Lambda Literary Award]].&lt;ref name="metoperafamily.org"/&gt;

[[File:Bad guy riff.png|thumb|Theme from ''[[Mysterioso Pizzicato]]'', a [[cliché]] silent movie cue for villainy {{audio|Mysterioso Pizzicato.mid|Play}}]]

A '''villain''' (also known as, "'''baddie'''", "'''bad guy'''", "'''evil guy'''", "'''heavy'''" or "'''black hat'''") is an "[[evil]]" character in a story, whether a [[history|historical]] narrative or, especially, a work of [[fiction]]. 

The villain is a [[antagonist]] (though can be the [[protagonist]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a '''villainess'''. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as "a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/villain |website=[[Dictionary.com]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402110610/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/villain |archivedate=2014-04-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord's Orders Miniature in the Proprietaire des Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal in Paris.png|thumb|French villeins in the 15th century before going to work, receiving their Lord's Orders.]]

Villain comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] and [[Old French]] ''vilain'', which itself descends from the [[Late Latin]] word '' villanus'', meaning "farmhand",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert K. Barnhart |author2=Sol Steinmetz |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |date=1999 |publisher=Chambers |location=New York |isbn=0550142304 |page=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of someone who is bound to the soil of a ''villa'', which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a [[plantation]] in [[Late Antiquity]], in Italy or [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David B. Guralnik |title=[[Webster's New World Dictionary]] |date=1984 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0671418149 |edition=2nd college}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The same etymology produced [[villein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/villain |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] and [[Politeness|polite]]. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as [[betrayal|treachery]] or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[C. S. Lewis]] |title=Studies in Words |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107688650 |pages=120-121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xONwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic word "[[churl]]", originally meaning "a non-servile peasant" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word "[[wikt:boor#Noun|boor]]" which originally meant "farmer".

==Folk and fairy tales==
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a [[fairy tale]] had only eight ''[[dramatis personae]]'', of which one was the villain,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vladimir Propp |authorlink1=Vladimir Propp |title=Morphology of the Folk Tale |date=1968 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292783760 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family 
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

None of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

When a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Two other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the [[false hero]]: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Among these characters are [[Cinderella]]'s stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Tatar |authorlink1=Maria Tatar |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm |date=2004 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] |isbn=0393058484 |page=136 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Villainous foil==
[[File:Wicked Witch of the West W.W. Denslow.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is an example of a literary villain.]]

In fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Others point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Sisir Kumar |title=A History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn=9788172017989 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA416 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a [[characterization]] that provides a [[Base motive|motive]] for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roger Ebert |authorlink1=Roger Ebert |title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Movie Review (1982) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan-1982 |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en |date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
[[Tod Slaughter]] always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, [[evil laughter|cackling]], and [[hand-rubbing]] (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan Senn |title=Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939 |date=1996 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786401758 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffery Richards |title=The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929-39 |date=2001 |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn=9781860646287 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brad Warner]] states that "only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Brad Warner]] |title=Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye |date=2007 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=9781577315599 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bova]] recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his ''Tips for writers'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Ben Bova]] |title=Tips for writers |url=http://benbova.com/tips2.html |website=Ben Bova |accessdate=2008-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135403/http://benbova.com/tips2.html |archivedate=2009-08-21 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[David Lubar]] adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a brilliant observation that has served me well in all my writing. (The bad guy isn't doing bad stuff so he can rub his hands together and snarl.) He may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he's driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Darcy Pattinson |title=Villains Don't Always Wear Black |url=http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |website=Fiction Notes |accessdate=2018-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122183445/http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sympathetic villain===
In an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create "sympathetic" villains, the [[antithesis]] to an [[antihero]] called an '''anti-villain'''. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game ''[[Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi]]'', who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as [[racism]], as is the case in ''[[American History X]]''), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the ''[[X-Men]]'' comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as [[Jack Torrance]] being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.

'''Virginia Inman Postrel''' (born January 14, 1960) is an American political and cultural writer of broadly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], or [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Postrel |first= Virginia |url= http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/03/18/virginia-postrel/an-18th-century-brain-in-a-21st-century-head/ |title= An 18th-Century Brain in a 21st-Century Head |publisher= Cato Unbound |date= 2007-03-18 |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Virginia Inman was born and raised in [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. Her father was an engineer, while her mother was a homemaker. Inman graduated from Princeton University in 1982 with an A.B. in English literature.&lt;ref name="PBSBOONOTES"/&gt;

==Career==
Postrel was editor-in-chief of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' from July 1989 to January 2000, and remained on the masthead as editor-at-large through 2001. Prior to that, she was a reporter for ''[[Inc. Magazine|Inc.]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://vpostrel.com/about |title= Virginia Postrel's bio |publisher= vpostrel.com |date= |accessdate= 2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently serves on the Board of Directors of the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] (FIRE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thefire.org/about-us/board-of-directors-page/ |title= Board of Directors - The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education |publisher= FIRE |date= 2003-12-19 |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2006, she wrote an economics column for the ''[[New York Times]]'' and from 2006 to 2009 she wrote the "Commerce and Culture" column for ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/virginia-postrel/ |title= Virginia Postrel - Authors |publisher= The Atlantic |date= |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared on the last episode of the third season of [[Penn Jillette|Penn]] and [[Teller (magician)|Teller]]'s ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]''.

Postrel wrote the biweekly column "Commerce &amp; Culture" for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' until April 2011. Since May 2011, she has written a biweekly column for ''Bloomberg View''.

She is best known for her [[non-fiction]] books, ''[[The Future and Its Enemies]]'' and ''The Substance of Style''. In the former she explains her philosophy, "[[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]]", a forward-looking and change-seeking [[philosophy]] that generally favors unregulated organization through "[[spontaneous order]]". She contrasts it with "[[stasis (rhetoric)|stasis]]", a philosophy that favors top-down control and [[regulation]] and is marked by desire to maintain the present state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dynamist.com/tfaie/index.html |title= The Future and Its Enemies by Virginia Postrel |publisher= Dynamist.com |date= |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, she published a third book, ''The Power of Glamour'', which defined glamour as "nonverbal rhetoric" that “leads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.”&lt;ref&gt;Silber, Kenneth (2013-11-01).

==Health care, bioethics, and aesthetics==
Postrel has written several articles on health care and bioethics, including accounts of her own experiences.

In March 2006 Postrel [[Kidney transplantation|donated a kidney]] to an acquaintance, writer [[Sally Satel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Shlaes |first= Amity |url= http://www.amityshlaes.com/articles/2006/2006-03-15.php |title= I Would Give My Left Kidney to Prove I'm Right: Amity Shlaes |publisher= Bloomberg |date= 2006-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/magazine/16kidney-t.html |title= Desperately Seeking a Kidney |author= Satel, Sally |publisher= Nytimes.com |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has recounted the experience, and referred to it in several subsequent articles and blog posts, many of which are critical of legal prohibitions against compensating organ donors. In some of the pieces, she discusses strategies for working around these restrictions, such as organ donor transplant chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dynamist.com/articles-speeches/opeds/kidney.html |title= Virginia Postrel on donating a kidney |publisher= Dynamist.com |date= |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Postrel, Virginia |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/with-functioning-kidneys-for-all/7587/ |title= With Functioning Kidneys for All - Virginia Postrel |publisher= The Atlantic |date= 2009-07-09 |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her March 2009 article "My Drug Problem" in ''The Atlantic'', Postrel wrote about her own experience of being treated for [[breast cancer]] with the expensive drug [[Herceptin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/my-drug-problem/7279/ |title= My Drug Problem |publisher= Theatlantic.com |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Postrel, Virginia |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/defending-ldquo-my-drug-problem-rdquo/7389/ |title= Defending "My Drug Problem" - Virginia Postrel |publisher= The Atlantic |date= 2009-03-30 |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She questioned if such a costly treatment would be available to others and if the risky research that makes such innovative treatments possible would be profitable under the proposed health care reforms in the United States.

Postrel has also referred to her experience as a [[cancer]] patient in her writing about the importance of design aesthetics in hospitals and the competitive forces that drive them to create more attractive environments for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Postrel, Virginia |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/04/the-art-of-healing/6705/ |title= The Art of Healing - Virginia Postrel |publisher= The Atlantic |date= 2008-04-01 |accessdate= 2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties into the thesis of her second book, that [[beauty]] is more than simply a superficial, frivolous trait and can go more than skin deep. Notions of beauty and desirability, and thoughts on what makes good design good beyond the needs of [[sound engineering]], inform her work at the "Deep Glamour" blog.

'''William Bagguley''' (9 September 1866 – 18 April 1936) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] in 1905.

Bagguley was born in [[Ruddington]], the son of Robert Bagguley, a stocking framework knitter and his wife Martha. Bagguley followed his father's occupation from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;British Census 1881&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagguley made a single first-class appearance for Derbyshire, during the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1905|1905 season]], against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]. From the lower order, he scored 5 runs in the only innings in which he batted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/27/27595/27595.html William Bagguley at Cricket Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagguley died in [[Standard Hill]], [[Nottinghamshire]]. His brothers, [[Robert Bagguley|Robert]] and [[Percy Bagguley]] also played cricket, the former for [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] and the latter for Nottinghamshire Colts.
