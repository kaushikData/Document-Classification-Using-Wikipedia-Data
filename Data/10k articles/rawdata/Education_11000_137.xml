The '''2011 South Korean University Tuition Crisis''' is a socio-political dispute among the conservative [[Grand National Party]], the liberal [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2008)|Democratic Party]], and various citizen groups on reduced [[university tuition]] fees for South Korean university students. The reduced tuition is one of the main commitments during the start of the GNP-led [[Lee Myung-bak government]] in 2008. This commitment made by the GNP has not been manifested, or potentially ignored, as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Yu-jin (유진) | last = Jeong (정) | script-title=ko:한나라 지방선거·대선 공약 ‘반값 등록금’ 선거 끝나자 ‘오리발’ | date = 2011-04-03 | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201104032150595&amp;code=940401 | work = The Kyunghyan Shinmun | accessdate = 2011-12-04 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be due to the government's big business-oriented policies overshadowed the education-related domestic issues. This resulted in several university student protests across South Korea in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hyang-mi (향미) | last = Kim (김) |author2= Im A-yeong (임아영) | script-title=ko:“못참겠다, 살인 등록금” | date = 2011-04-03 | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201104031906075&amp;code=940401 | work = The Kyunghyan Shinmun | accessdate = 2011-12-04 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Lee Myung-bak government's policy of easing the expensive tuition fees is proposing the deferred payment system. But some university organizations openly oppose this as it could "silence the main commitment of the government" since 2009, a year after the Lee Myung-bak government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Seong-yong (성용) | last = Ahn (안) | script-title=ko:'삭발 눈물' 한아름씨 "벼랑끝에 선 대학생 목졸라" | date = 2009-04-13 | url = http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/show.asp?idx=1119383 | work = Nocut News | accessdate = 2011-12-04 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4-H Shooting Sports Programs''' are part of [[4-H]] in the United States, a [[youth organization]] administered by the [[National Institute of Food and Agriculture]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), with the mission of "engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development."&lt;ref name="ca4h.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca4h.org/4hinfo/md/YDPRptBk10.pdf |title=YDPRptBk10.qxd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325045433/http://ca4h.org/4hinfo/md/YDPRptBk10.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name represents four personal development areas of focus for the organization: head, heart, hands, and health.

==4-H program and philosophy==
{{Main|4-H}}
The 4-H organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States, from ages eight to eighteen, in approximately 90,000 clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourhcouncil.edu/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_67DEE17C0C72A37211E30C35209E08E396F50000 National 4-H Council], [http://www.national4-hheadquarters.gov/library/4hhq_onesheet.pdf National 4-H Headquarters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002224430/http://www.national4-hheadquarters.gov/library/4hhq_onesheet.pdf |date=2007-10-02 }}, and e-mail dated December 3, 2007 from Suzanne Le Menestrel, National Program Leader, Youth Development Research, National 4-H Headquarters&lt;/ref&gt; 

The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, and life skills of youth through mostly experiential learning programs. Though typically thought of as an agriculturally focused organization as a result of its history, 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Today, 4-H and related programs exist in over 80 countries around the world. Each of these programs operates independently, but cooperatively through international exchanges, global education programs, and communications. Clubs and related organizations now exist in many other countries as well; the organization and administration varies from country to country.

The 4-H motto is "To make the best better", while its slogan is "Learn by doing" (sometimes written as "Learn to do by doing").

The focus of all 4-H programs is the development of youth as individuals and as responsible and productive citizens. 

The National 4-H Shooting Sports Program helps  Youths learn marksmanship, the safe and responsible use of firearms, the principles of hunting and archery, and much more. The activities of the program and the support of caring adult leaders provide young people with opportunities to develop life skills, self-worth, and conservation ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-hshootingsports.org/, 4-H shooting Sports Web site, "Focusing on Youth Development"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting Sports==

4-H shooting sports programs are run by trained and certified volunteers.  Any adult over the age of 18 may become a certified volunteer to run or assist in a shooting sports program.  Youth over the age of 16 may be certified to participate as a Youth Leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-hshootingsports.org/Get_involved.php, Get Involved]&lt;/ref&gt;

To begin a 4-H shooting sports program, an adult contacts their cooperative extension service to locate a training program in their area to get certified.  Training programs are often weekend events staffed by unpaid volunteers.  Room and board are often provided and included in the cost for the training which is nominal. The weekend program is divided into multiple segments.  The core of the program is youth development.  The first part of the program, a volunteer must demonstrate proficiency to his or her instructor within the chosen discipline. This is followed by training in youth development.  Students then divide up and demonstrate their training skills by training other students and receive their certificates.  To run a program all volunteers must register and participate in orientation with their Extension Educator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-hshootingsports.org/state_contacts.php, Instructor Training Resource]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth Development==

Students from 8 to 18 are welcome to participate.  Age is less important than maturity, the ability to follow rules, and the motor skills to handle a firearm or bow safely.

The 4-H slogan is "Learn by doing".  Students are given a period of classroom training followed by hands on training.  As students develop skills they are encouraged to assist younger students as coaches.  This allows students to develop skills and confidence leading to true self-esteem.  Not all students will excel academically nor will they excel athletically, shooting sports is one area where size, physical strength and memorization skills are not necessary to achieve excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-hshootingsports.org/Youth_Development.php, Youth Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==

While 4-H provides the education, training, and support to start a program, many programs are run and financed through local gun clubs.  Gun clubs often provide ranges, rifles, bows, targets, arrows and ammunition for the program.  Many clubs are looking for qualified people to run a youth shooting sports program.

==Safety==

Safe handling of bows and firearms is a primary concern of 4-H shooting sports.  Students are drilled in safe handling procedures and are encouraged to develop at their own pace.

4-H shooting sports programs are among the safest programs run by 4-H.  Insurance costs for shooting sports are among the lowest of all 4-H programs.  The only other program with insurance costs as low as shooting sports is sewing.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

{{grading}}
In the [[Czech Republic]], primary and secondary schools use a 5-point grade system, with 1 as the best and 5 as the worst. They correspond to the following ratings: 1 = výborně (excellent), 2 = chvalitebně (commendable), 3 = dobře (good), 4 = dostatečně (sufficient), and 5 = nedostatečně (insufficient). Only whole numbers appear on report cards, but tests or oral exams are often marked with additional distinctive signs: '''3+''' is ''slightly better than 3'', '''2−''' is ''slightly lower than 2'', '''1-2''' or '''1/2''' means ''halfway between 1 and 2'', and '''1*''' means ''exceptionally excellent''.

Some universities use a 4-point grade system, in which 1 is the highest and 4 indicates failing.
They might also use the textual form of the grades in addition to the numerical form: 
1 = výborně (excellent),
2 = velmi dobře (very good),
3 = dobře (good),
4 = neprospěl (fail).
In recent years, many universities adopted another system, with the grades A to F. It maps to the previous classification in the following way:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! New classification !! Old classification !! Orientation percentage
|-
| A || 1 || 90 - 100
|-
| B || 1.5 || 80 - 89
|-
| C || 2 || 70 - 79
|-
| D || 2.5 || 60 - 69
|-
| E || 3 || 50 - 59
|-
| F || 4 || 0 - 49
|}
Some Czech universities, such as [[University of Economics, Prague]],&lt;ref&gt;http://nf.vse.cz/vyucujici/navody-isis-vyucujici/jak-zadavat-vysledky-z-predmetu/&lt;/ref&gt; map points acquired throughout the course (out of 100 acquirable) using a different ratio:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Textual classification !! Numeric classification !! Points acquired
|-
| excellent || 1 || 90 - 100
|-
| very good || 2 || 75 - 89
|-
| good || 3 || 60 - 74
|-
| (see below) || 4+ || 50 - 59
|-
| fail || 4 || 0 - 59
|}
4+, or 50 - 59 points, may enable the students retake an exam to try to get above the 60 points cutoff. If the student fails to do so, it gets changed to 4 (fail) automatically at the end of the semester. First day of the next semester the grades from each subject (where points were inserted into the system) also get converted to the ECTS scale for international use like this:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vse.cz/predpisy/250&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ECTS classification !! Portion of students
|-
| A || q10 - top 10% successful students
|-
| B || q35 - next 25% successful students
|-
| C || q65 - next 30% successful students
|-
| D || q90 - next 25% successful students
|-
| E || q100 - last 10% successful students
|-
| F || students graded 4 (fail)
|}
Private high schools or [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s may use different academic grading. A 10-point grading scale consisting of 1 (A), 2 (A-), 3 (B+) ... 10 (D) has been used in some private schools in the [[Czech Republic]].

An '''academic year''' or '''school year''' is a period of time which [[school]]s, [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] use to measure a quantity of study.

==Australia and New Zealand==

In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], academic years for primary and secondary institutions are divided into two semesters, with each semester being further divided into two terms (thus totaling four terms per year). Although historically the year was divided into three terms with an extended Easter break interrupting the first term, the year has been divided into four terms since the late 1980s (with the exception of the Australian state of [[Tasmania]] which did not change until 2013).

Following southern hemisphere seasons, the main summer holiday between academic years encompasses most of December, all of January and sometimes a few days at the beginning of February, and always encompasses [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]] as well as [[Australia Day]] on 26 January.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halftermdates.co.uk/australia/australia-school-holidays.htm Official Australian School Holidays]&lt;/ref&gt; In year 12, however, the term ends in November; for those who go on to university, the term starts in March. New Zealand celebrates [[Waitangi Day]] on 6 February; the summer holidays in New Zealand may or may not extend as far as that day, depending on the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcl.govt.nz/languages/ssnz-education.pdf  |title= Education |publisher= Wellington City Libraries|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInNewZealand/SchoolTermsAndHolidays.aspx |title= School terms and holidays |publisher= Ministry of Education |date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is typically a break of two weeks mid-semester (i.e. after Term 1 and after Term 3) and a break of three weeks in the middle of the year, although this can vary between jurisdictions. In the year 2000, due to the [[2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, the state of New South Wales extended the break after Term 3 to three weeks, compensating by reducing the break in the middle of the year to two weeks.

Historically, the Term 1 holiday have been scheduled around [[Easter]], reflecting the three-term system's notion of an extended Easter break within Term 1; although since the mid-1990s this has gradually changed, and now only [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] tie the school holidays closely to Easter; the remainder of Australia and all of New Zealand now have a fixed length to Term 1 which leads to the Easter period falling within Term 1 in some years with an early Easter, such as 2016.

Typically, the Term 1 holidays will run for two weeks within April; the mid-year holidays encompass the last week of June and the first two weeks of July; and the Term 3 holidays encompass the last week of September and the first week of October. This varies between jurisdictions, and exact dates depend on what day of the week these respective months begin, as (with the exception of the beginning and end of the academic year), terms tend to begin and end with full weeks.

==United Kingdom==

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], an academic year usually runs from September of one year through to late July of the following year, with the time split up into three [[Academic term|terms]]. Each of these is usually divided into halves with a week-long 'half-term' break between. Primary (1-11) and secondary (11-16) schools usually follow a 39-week academic year, while further (16+) and higher (18+) educational establishments often have 36 or 33-week terms, generally with no half-term break. Oxford and Cambridge have shorter terms still, usually 8 weeks each term.  

For English state schools, the year commences in the first week of September with a half-term break (1 week) at the end of October, and the term ends shortly before Christmas. After a two-week holiday encompassing New Year, the second term stretches to Easter and is of variable length to allow for that movable feast. It has a half-term break around mid-February. There are two weeks of Easter holiday, then the final term starts and lasts until the third week of July. The half-term break is at the end of May and students with exams will often finish their studies at that break and take exams during June and July.

The summer break lasts for approx 6 weeks and was designed originally to allow children to help with the harvest. In Scotland, the summer break is earlier because of the different day lengths and agricultural practices.

Private (public) schools may follow different terms, and some self-governing academies follow different termly structures.

==United States==

===Seasonal pattern===
{{further|School holidays in the United States}}

It is often believed that when the United States was a primarily agrarian society, children were needed during the Northern Hemisphere summer months for farm labor. 

However, there is little evidence supporting this, with 19th-century rural schools more typically favoring a summer academic term and more vacation time during spring and autumn. [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/debunking-myth-summer-vacation/]

Summer is still a popular time for family vacations, and most have a 2 or 3-month summer vacation.  The academic year typically runs from late August or early September until May or June, depending on the length of the year and number of the holiday, vacation, and snow days occurring during the year.  The year is divided into two [[semester]]s, three [[Academic term|trimester]] or four [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]]s, typically with a [[report card]] issued to students' parents at the end of each.

An academic year typically includes a fall and spring semester, with a shorter optional summer session.  Many also have a short optional winter session.  Some operate on a [[Academic term|trimester]] calendar.

[[Continuing education]] classes (often available at community colleges and private "boot camp" style schools) are often shorter and start throughout the year with no particular seasonality.

===Duration===

Public elementary and secondary schools averaged (at the state level) between 170 and 180 school days in the 2007-08 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/SASS/tables/sass0708_035_s1s.asp|title=Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 2007–08|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different states have different legal minimum requirements for instructional days and hours per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/01/06/68/10668.pdf|title=Number of Instructional Days/Hours in the School Year|date=March 15, 2013|author=Mikulecky, M.|publisher=Education Commission of the States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Lown''' (born June 7, 1921) is the original developer of the direct current [[defibrillator]] and the cardioverter.  Lown developed the direct current defibrillator for cardiac resuscitation and the cardioverter for correcting rapid disordered heart rhythms, and introduced a new use for the drug [[lidocaine]] to control heartbeat disturbances.

Throughout his medical career, Lown focused on two major medical challenges: the problem of sudden cardiac death and the role of psychological stress on the cardiovascular system. His investigations led to many medical break-throughs.  Among these were the coronary care unit.  His work made possible and safe much of modern cardiac surgery, as well as a host of other innovations. In 1985, Lown accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], an organization he co-founded with Soviet cardiologist [[Yevgeny Chazov]], who later was Minister Of Health of the [[USSR]].

Lown is currently Professor of Cardiology Emeritus at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]], and Senior Physician Emeritus at the [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]], Boston, Massachusetts.  He is the founder of the Lown Cardiovascular Center and Lown Cardiovascular Research Foundation.  He recently founded the Lown Institute, which aims to reform both the health care system and society.

==Early life and education==
Born to a [[Jewish]]&lt;ref name="Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Mickey S.|title=Life in the Balance: Emergency Medicine and the Quest to Reverse Sudden Death|date=1997|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://videocenter.brighamandwomens.org/files/dmfile/Lown_Bernard.pdf Bernard Lown Interviewed by Peter Tishler], September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; family in [[Lithuania]], the son of a [[rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Church in World Politics'',
By Eric O. Hanson, Princeton University Press, 14 Jul 2014, page 420&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Lown emigrated to the United States at the age of 14.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg"/&gt;

Lown graduated summa cum laude from the [[University of Maine]] and received an M.D. from [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1945.  His medical training included [[Yale-New Haven Hospital]] (Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut); [[Montefiore Medical Center]], Bronx, NY; and a cardiology fellowship at the [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] (now Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;“Bernard Lown and defibrillation,” M Eisenberg. Resuscitation, 2006; 69: 171-173&lt;/ref&gt;  His mentor in cardiology was the renowned clinical cardiologist, [[Samuel A. Levine]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;The Lost Art of Healing, B Lown (Ballantine Books, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the defibrillator==

Lown helped raise international medical awareness of [[sudden cardiac death]] as a leading cause of mortality in the developed world. Based on patient observations, Lown concluded that sudden cardiac death was reversible and survivable, and that people who were successfully resuscitated could have a near normal life expectancy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Working with his mentor [[Samuel A. Levine]], Lown realized that the high mortality of a heart attack, then 35 percent, was most likely due to rigorous bed rest.  Patients remained completely recumbent for six or more weeks.  A major complication of bed rest was [[pulmonary embolism]], which accounted for a significant part of the mortality.  Although Lown encountered enormous opposition and hostility among doctors to the so-called "chair treatment," in 81 patients so treated, mortality was reduced by two thirds.  Once the work was published, the chair treatment was rapidly adopted and hospitalizations were reduced to several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonneville|first1=Bette Jane|title=Patient Monitoring - A Nurse's View|journal=Journal of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation|date=January 1967|volume=2|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Untold lives were saved by getting patients out of bed.

Until the 1950s, [[ventricular fibrillation]] of the heart could only be treated with drug therapy. In 1956 American cardiologist [[Paul Zoll]] described resuscitations during open-heart surgery and later after sudden cardiac death by means of an alternating current (AC) electric shock, derived from a wall socket.  AC current was untested as to its safety and efficacy and could cause death.  In 1959, Lown demonstrated that AC was injurious to the heart and could be lethal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  These investigations were conducted in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.  The work was supported by Professor Frederick Stare, chairman of the Department of Nutrition.

To find a safer method of cardiac resuscitation, Lown enlisted the help of Baruch Berkowitz, an electrical engineer employed by American Optical Company (AO).  In their experimental work, Lown focused on two objectives: safety and efficacy.  Alternating current caused burns in skeletal and heart muscle also inducing atrial as well as ventricular fibrillation in a large majority of the animal experiments.

During a year of intense experimentation, in 1961 Lown and coworkers proved that a specific direct current (DC) waveform consistently reversed ventricular fibrillation, restoring a normal heart beat without injuring heart or skeletal muscle. This became widely known as the "Lown waveform." It facilitated the worldwide acceptance of the defibrillator and cardioverter and improved survival of patients with coronary heart disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The DC defibrillator provided a new approach for resuscitating patients. It also paved the way for new possibilities in cardiac surgery.  The Lown clinical group were the first to use the defibrillator and cardioverter at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.  Donald B. Effler, was the first cardiac surgeon to use the DC defibrillator in 1962 at the [[Cleveland Clinic]].  According to Effler, this advance made possible modern cardiac surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Lown. August 23, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, in 1967, Rene Favoloro performed what is regarded as the first coronary artery bypass operation in Effler’s surgical department at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/01/world/rene-favaloro-77-a-leader-in-early-heart-bypass-surgery.html|title=Rene Favaloro, 77, a Leader In Early Heart-Bypass Surgery|first=Eric|last=Nagourney|date=1 August 2000|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DC defibrillation provided a safe way to restore a normal heart rhythm during the surgical bypass of obstructed coronary arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bernardlown.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/the-coronary-artery-entrapment/|title=The Coronary Artery Entrapment|date=31 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lown went on to investigate the possibilities of the defibrillator to treat non-life-threatening tachycardias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dersiewicz |first=Bill |date=Winter 1990 |title=Bernard Lown Speaks From the Heart |journal=Harvard Public Health Review |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Harvard School of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He discovered that timing the electrical discharge outside the heart’s brief vulnerable period of 0.03 seconds in duration prevented ventricular fibrillation or sudden cardiac death.  He called this method of timed DC discharge "Cardioversion." The cardioverter and DC defibrillator were especially valuable in coronary care units, when patients are hospitalized when most susceptible to sudden cardiac death and other potentially malignant arrhythmias.&lt;ref&gt;The Lost Art of Healing, B Lown. (Ballantine Books, 1996), 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to advancing medical technology, Lown discovered new applications for two drugs that were widely used for cardiac problems: [[digitalis]] and lidocaine. Until the 1950s, digitalis poisoning was a major cause of fatality among patients with congestive heart failure. During a medical residency at the Montefiore Hospital in New York City, Lown demonstrated the critical role of potassium in determining the safe use of digitalis. His discovery led to abandonment of long acting digitalis drugs like digitoxin.  Instead, the short acting digitalis glycoside gained universal acceptance.  It also focused medical attention on potassium loss with the use of various diuretics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015072223624;seq=9;view=1up;num=5 Atrial Arrhythmias, Digitalis and Potassium], B Lown, HD Levine (Landsberger Medical Books Inc., 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Lown introduced a new use for the drug lidocaine to control ventricular disordered heart rhythms.  Lidocaine was also used in coronary units to prevent the need for resuscitation. Previously, lidocaine was used almost exclusively by dentists as an anesthetic agent.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bernardlown.org/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702181840/http://bernardlown.org/bio.html |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiber optics==

In 1957, Lown was concerned with how to visualize an atherosclerotic aortic plaque, which occurs in the big coronary vessels that supply nutrients to the heart muscle. This would, he hoped, lead to discovering how to treat and prevent heart attack and sudden cardiac death.   A discussion with a close friend, Elias Snitzer, a physicist at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] led to an introduction to Michael Polanyi, a physicist with American Optical Company.  At the time, Polanyi was working on [[fiber optics]].  Lown received a grant from the Hartford Foundation to pursue fiber optics.  However, optical technology, at the time, was inadequate.  This line of research was discontinued.  Lown’s work did show that, with fiber optics, it was possible to measure oxygen saturation in dogs, and determine the cardiac output in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Jack|title=In Vivo Monitoring with a Fiber Optic Catheter|journal=JAMA|date=14 Aug 1972|volume=221|issue=7|pages=667–73|doi=10.1001/jama.1972.03200200017005|pmid=5068265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, when Lown submitted two abstracts to the World Cardiology Conference in Mexico in 1964, one on the defibrillator and cardioversion, and one dealing with fiber optics, the former was rejected and the latter accepted.

==Peace activism==

=== Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) ===

In early 1961, Lown called together a group of physicians from Boston’s teaching hospitals to address the mounting threat of nuclear war between the USSR and the USA. This political subject had not been addressed previously by physicians in the United States.  The new organization called itself [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] (PSR).

Among the activist participants were [[H. Jack Geiger|Jack Geiger]] and [[Victor W. Sidel]].&lt;ref&gt;Prescription for Survival, B Lown (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1961, the group had drafted five research articles about the medical consequences of a ten megaton nuclear attack on the city of Boston, a magnitude considered both possible and likely by the U.S. military.  The series, "The Medical Consequences of Thermonuclear War", was published as a symposium in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in May 1962.&lt;ref&gt;http://ippnw.org/pdf/1962NEJM.pdf. New England Journal of Medicine, May 31, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

These articles encouraged anti-nuclear medical movements worldwide.  Additionally, they helped pass the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] in the US Senate.

=== Committee of Responsibility for War Injured Vietnamese Children (COR) ===

Lown was also involved in organizing COR, Committee of Responsibility to Save War Burned and War Injured Children. of which he was a leading member.  This organization aimed to bring injured and burned Vietnamese children for treatment in the United States, in order “to bring the war home.”

COR was headed by Herbert Needelman.  It arranged for several American hospitals to treat injured Vietnamese children for free.  John Constable III, from the Shriner Burn Center of the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston, was among the first physicians to participate.  He and other physicians traveled numerous times to Vietnam to choose children with injuries that could be helped.

This mission could not be accomplished without ambulance planes ferrying the very sick children. Lown led a delegation to Washington for a meeting with William F. Bundy, then Assistant Secretary of State.  He was persuaded to support the objective of COR.  In 1967 the Pentago began to transport Vietnamese children to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/committee-responsibility-save-war-burned-and-war-injured-vietnamese-children|title=Committee of Responsibility to Save War Burned and War Injured Vietnamese Children - The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) ===

In 1980, Lown called on a small number of doctors to organize against the mounting nuclear threat that followed USSR's invasion of [[Afghanistan]] and the election of the Reagan administration.  This small group of physicians, with the help largely of first year Harvard medical students, formed the [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] (IPPNW).

This IPPNW could not have been founded without the intimate friendship between Eugene Chazov and Lown.  Both cardiologists, they had collaborated in researching the issue of sudden cardiac death, sponsored by the National Heart and Lung Institute.

Lown headed the American Sudden Death Task Force, while Chazov headed the Soviet group of cardiologists.  Frequent visits to the USSR with American cardiological colleagues promoted dialogue and understanding between physicians of the two hostile countries.  It laid the groundwork and made the IPPNW possible.  These events are described in Lown's memoir, ''Prescription for Survival: A Doctor's Journey to End Nuclear Madness.''&lt;ref&gt;Prescription for Survival, B Lown (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first IPPNW annual World Congress was held at Arlie House, Virginia, in 1981. Eighty medical leaders from twelve countries attended.&lt;ref name="ippnw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippnw.org/milestones.html|title=IPPNW: International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the 2nd IPPNW Congress took place in Cambridge, England with over 400 participants.  Among the American participants were astrophysicist and science populizer, [[Carl Sagan]]; Admiral [[Noel Gayler]], formerly head of the American Pacific Fleet, Director of the [[National Security Agency]], and in charge of targeting nuclear weapons against he USSR; Howard Hiatt, Dean of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]]; and Herbert Abrams, head of Radiology at the Harvard Medical School.  Equally distinguished participants attended from the UK, Germany, and Scandinavian countries.

A major breakthrough for IPPNW was arranged by Eugene Chazov in 1982 when three Soviet physicians and three American physicians appeared on a nationwide Soviet television network.  The Soviet participants were Chazov, Michael Kuzin, and Leonid Ilyin; while the Americans were Lown, James Muller, and John Pastore.  During this unprecedented telecast an audience of 100 million Soviet viewers for the first time heard an unedited discussion of the consequences of nuclear war. The program was later broadcast in the US.&lt;ref name="ippnw.org"/&gt;

By 1985, IPPNW represented 135,000 physicians in 60 countries.&lt;ref name="ippnw.org"/&gt;

In December of that year, Lown and Chazov accepted the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of IPPNW.  Shortly thereafter, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] invited IPPNW Co-Presidents Lown and Chazov for a meeting in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name="ippnw.org"/&gt;  The lengthy discussion covered a host of issues.  Discussed was Gorbachev's unilateral moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, the arrest and detention of Nobel Laureate physicist [[Andrei Sakharov]] in the city of [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorki]], the North-South divide, and other important subjects.

==International public health work==

=== SatelLife and ProCor ===

Two organizations founded by Lown, SatelLife (1988) and ProCor (1997) were designed to aid physicians in developing countries by connecting them to relevant information on cardiovascular disease and its prevention.  Their focus was on global inequities in healthcare and leveraging technology to promote health equality.

SatelLife employed low earth-orbit satellites that circumnavigated the poles and were capable of reaching every point on earth four times daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Roberta|title=Heart Doctor With an Extra Big Heart|publisher=Harvard University Gazette|date=February 11, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They provided access to medical literature to health professionals in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellife.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922030013/http://www.satellife.org/ |archivedate=2014-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ProCor created an internet network of health workers in developing countries around the world. This internet-based community enabled physicians and health workers to access relevant and reliable medical information about cardiovascular disease.  The focus was on disease prevention. It also offered an email-based forum for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procor.org/about/about_show.htm?doc_id=693601|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222033654/http://www.procor.org/about/about_show.htm?doc_id=693601|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 February 2014|title=ProCor: What is ProCor?|date=22 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ProCor’s global outreach included The Ashanti-ProCor Project, launched in 2006, which was designed to assess cardiovascular disease knowledge and practice among health workers in the [[Ashanti Region]] of [[Ghana]], identify those who can play a key role in prevention, and explore their information needs as a way to better address the needs of physicians in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procor.org/about/about_show.htm?doc_id=697798|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222033657/http://www.procor.org/about/about_show.htm?doc_id=697798|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 February 2014|title=ProCor: Ashanti-ProCor Project|date=22 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Healthcare ===

In 1996, Lown, with [[Stephanie Woolhandler]] and [[David Himmelstein]] of the Cambridge City Hospital; [[Jerry Avorn]], head of Pharmacoepidemiology at the Harvard Medical School; and Susan Bennett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bennett, Susan Elizabeth, MD|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/doctor.aspx?id=16912|website=www.massgeneral.org|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital formed the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Healthcare.  Many health workers joined the Ad Hoc Committee, the objective of which was to promote a single-payer healthcare system in Massachusetts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defendhealthcare.org/call.html|title=The Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care: A Call to Action|first=DB|last=Lazof|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a letter signed by over 2000 Massachusetts physicians outlined the need for single-payer healthcare.  The letter was published in [[The Journal of the American Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;For Our Patients, Not for Profits: A Call to Action. JAMA. 1997;278(21):1733-1738&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ad Hoc Committee canvassed people through the state of Massachusetts to gain the 100,000 names necessary to put the issue on the ballot.

The issue was put to referendum in Massachusetts in 2000.  In spite of opposition, the referendum showed 45% of voters in favor of single-payer healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Health_Care_Council_Initiative,_Question_5_(2000)|title=Massachusetts Healthcare Council Initiative, Question 5 (2000) - Ballotpedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Lown Institute and the Right Care Alliance ===

In 2012, Lown and colleagues founded the [[The Lown Institute|Lown Institute]]. The Lown Institute addresses the growing crisis in healthcare in the USA, marked by overtreatment, undertreatment, and mistreatment through research, clinical programs, and convenings. The Institute holds an annual conference, where the newest research on overuse and underuse is presented, and where like-minded clinicians and patient advocates can share ideas. They also sponsor clinical programs to address overuse such as the Right Care Educators program, Right Care Rounds, and the Right Care Vignette Competition. The Lown Institute is currently conducting research on risk adjustment methods for evaluating patient outcomes.

Among participants in the leadership of the Lown Institute are Nassib Chamoun, Vikas Saini, Shannon Brownlee, Thomas Graboys, Professor Joseph Brain, Patricia Gabow, Elizabeth Gilbertson, James Joslin, Aretha Davis, David Bor, Michael Fine, Breck Eagle, and others.

The Right Care Alliance (RCA) is the sister organization of the Lown Institute and the advocacy wing. The Right Care Alliance brings together clinicians, patients, and community members into a grassroots movement advocating for a universally accessible, affordable, safe, and effective health care system. The RCA is organized into specialty councils and regional chapters that organize on topics specific to their specialty or region. The RCA holds a week of action every year, in which members organize activities that demonstrate compassionate, patient-centered care, such as engaging the broader community in listening and storytelling.

The Steering Committee of the RCA is chaired by Vikas Saini and Shannon Brownlee, and members include Poppy Arford, Maia Dorsett, Casey Wilson, Selwyn Rogers, Jonathan Jimenez, Jane Muir, Theresa Ojala, Stuart Fisk, Marlene Beggelman, Kim DiGioia, and Surafel Tsega.

The bridge that connects the cities of Lewiston and Auburn in Maine was renamed The Bernard Lown Peace Bridge upon an act by the state legislature that was signed into law by Governor John Baldacci in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larrygilbert.typepad.com/mayor_larry_gilbert/2008/10/mayors-corner-bernard-lown-peace-bridge-connects-lewiston-auburn.html|title=Mayor's Corner: Bernard Lown Peace Bridge Connects Lewiston-Auburn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brigham and Women's Hospital in 2009 established the Bernard Lown Educational award.  The recipient is selected by staff and students.

=== Honors from the Harvard School of Public Health ===

The Lown Scholars Program at the Harvard School of Public Health aims to assist promising health professionals who live and work in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=HSPH honors Bernard Lown |newspaper=Harvard University Gazette |location=Cambridge, MA |date=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[The program] is designed to create an international cadre of talented health professionals [...] who will use public health tools and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and promote cardiac health." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/lownscholars/|title=The Bernard Lown Scholars in Cardiovascular Health Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Lown Visiting Professor ===

In 2012, a visiting Professorship was established whose function is to coordinate the courses afforded to the Lown Scholars as well as help promote cardiovascular preventative programs in low- and middle-income countries.

'''Code Club''' is a voluntary initiative, founded in 2012, which aims to provide opportunities for children aged 9 to 13 to developing coding skills through free after-school clubs.  As of November 2015, over 3,800 schools and other public venues had established a Code Club, regularly attended by an estimated 44,000 young people across the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/03/raspberry-pi-buys-code-club|title = Raspberry Pi Foundation merges with Code Club (Wired UK)|website = Wired UK|access-date = 2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has also expanded internationally, and there are now over 6,000 Code Club operating worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.codeclubworld.org/|title = Code Club World – A worldwide network of coding clubs for children|website = www.codeclubworld.org|access-date = 2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer programmers and software developers give their time to run Code Club sessions, passing on their programming skills and mentoring the young students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/index.php/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-code-club-volunteer/ | publisher=Postcode Anywhere | work=Sponsor's Blog | title=A day in the life of a Code Club volunteer | author=Robert Bisland | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/index.php/the-regions-techies-help-to-influence-a-program-for-change-in-the-classroom/ | publisher=Postcode Anywhere | work=Sponsor's Blog | title=The region’s techies help to influence a ‘program’ for change in the classroom | author=Angela Davis | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children create their own computer games, animations and websites, learning how to use technology creatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/index.php/kindergarten-code/ | publisher=Postcode Anywhere | work=Sponsor's Blog | title=Kindergarten Code | author=Guy Mucklow | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has Scratch, HTML &amp; CSS, Python and a variety of other coding languages. 

Code club also provide free BBC Micro:bits to children above the age of 9.

The '''Concerned Alumni of Princeton''' ('''CAP''') was a group of politically [[American conservatism|conservative]] former [[Princeton University]] students that existed between 1972 and 1986. CAP was born in 1972 from the ashes of the Alumni Committee to Involve Itself Now (ACTION), which was founded in opposition to the college becoming [[coeducation]]al in 1969. Some claim that CAP was founded to bring the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) back to the Princeton campus after the ROTC building was burned down by anti-war activists and the Princeton administration refused to rebuild it. However, the ROTC had returned to campus by the time CAP was founded. The primary motivation behind CAP was to limit the number of women admitted to the university.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} CAP also opposed [[affirmative action]] designed to increase [[minority group|minority]] attendance at the [[Ivy League]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isthatlegal.org/images/cap1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217213830/http://www.isthatlegal.org/images/cap1.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAP also exhibited strong support for Princeton's [[eating club]]s, which were male-only at the time.

The existence of the organization attracted wide notice in January 2006 during the nomination of [[Samuel Alito]], who was a former CAP member, to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], as Alito included his membership in the organization on a job application to work in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/alito/8105.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; No mention of Alito has been found in CAP files, apart from his own written 1985 statement of membership. Fox News legal analyst [[Andrew Napolitano]] was a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sethi|first=Chanakya|title=Alito '72 joined conservative alumni group|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2005/11/18/13876/|accessdate=14 January 2011|newspaper=Daily Princetonian|date=18 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Senator [[Bill Bradley]], a liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was a member until 1973, when he resigned because of the tone of the organization's magazine, ''Prospect''.  Former Republican Senator [[Bill Frist]], at the time a recent Princeton alumnus, having graduated in 1974, contributed to a report that labeled the organization as [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and extremist.

==Opposition to coeducation==
{{Over-quotation|section|lengthy=y|date=April 2012}}
In 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on CAP's support for quotas guaranteeing that male students would receive most of the available admissions slots, and its earlier and continuing opposition to Princeton allowing women to attend at all.  In the following excerpt, "Mr. Bushnell" refers to CAP co-chairman [[Asa S. Bushnell (Princeton)|Asa S. Bushnell]], and "Mr. Jones" refers to T. Harding Jones, CAP's executive director.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether or not the administration satisfies CAP on the faculty issue, the recent decision by the university's Board of Trustees to eliminate sex-based admissions quotas jolted these conservative alumni, many of whom wanted Princeton to remain an all-male institution in the first place.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the trustees approved co-education in 1969, there was a widespread understanding that the male enrollment would be maintained at 800 per entering class.  The subsequent adoption of an equal-access admissions policy last Jan. 19, along with the decision to retain undergraduate population at current levels, are expected to result in a decrease in the number of males matriculating each year.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Many Princeton graduates are unhappy over the fact that the administration has seen fit to abrogate the virtual guarantee that 800 would continue to be the number of males in the graduating class," Mr. Bushnell said.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Co-education has ruined the mystique and the camaraderies that used to exist," Mr. Jones added.  "Princeton has now given into the fad of the moment, and I think it's going to prove to be a very unfortunate thing."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Alumni response to the equal-access decision may offer a reliable gauge of CAP's influence among the university's graduates.  The changing composition of the undergraduate population concerns many Princeton alumni, especially those who cherish memories of a relatively homogenous student body.  Both supporters and critics of the new policy have initiated extensive campaigns to publicize their arguments.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
CAP leaders trace this year's 10 per cent decline in gift-giving to alumni disaffection that emerged during an era of liberalization, an era that reached its culmination in the equal-access decision.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Annual giving has been hurt very substantially by the equal-access vote," Mr. Jones said.  "And it will be hurt more next year as more people find out about it.  For many alumni, it was the last straw."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&amp;ndash; ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isthatlegal.org/images/cap1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217213830/http://www.isthatlegal.org/images/cap1.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alito hearings==
During Alito's Senate confirmation hearings following his nomination to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], CAP attracted attention because of its public stance against affirmative action and co-education at Princeton. Members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] who were questioning Alito suggested that his involvement in this group could shed some light on his stance on minority and women's rights issues which might come before him if he were to be confirmed as an [[Associate Justice]] on the Supreme Court of the United States, which he subsequently was.

The result of an extensive search of CAP documentation demanded by [[Ted Kennedy]] on January 11, 2006 was that no mention of or connection to Sam Alito was found.

==Quota system for males==
CAP supported quotas preserving admission spots for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isthatlegal.org/images/cap1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217213830/http://www.isthatlegal.org/images/cap1.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction by undergraduates, faculty, and staff==
CAP appears to have been treated as a nuisance or danger by some of the Princeton community contemporaneous to its most active period. Faculty members were wary of participating in a CAP-sponsored political survey. CAP was mocked by the school's [[Princeton University Band|band]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/581gyfjg.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~puband/media/1974.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530113220/https://www.princeton.edu/~puband/media/1974.html |date=May 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the university's chaplain in 1973 defended himself against charges of radicalism for his involvement in supporting draft dodging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1973/v30-1-criticscorner1.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903151415/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1973/v30-1-criticscorner1.htm |date=September 3, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Distance Education Learning Environments Survey''' ('''DELES''') is a [[psychosocial]] learning environment survey designed specifically to measure college and university [[distance education]] learning environments. The DELES was developed in 2003.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=S. L.|title=Development and Validation of an Instrument for Assessing Distance Education Learning Environments in Higher Education: The Distance Education Learning Environments Survey (DELES)|year=2003|url=http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14269&amp;local_base=GEN01-ERA02|work=Curtin University of Technology Doctoral Theses|publisher=Curtin University of Technology|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DELES was designed to measure students' perceptions of their distance education [[social environment]] through six scales: 
# '''Instructor Support''' (Scale I, consisting of 8 items), (e.g. The instructor responds promptly to my questions).
# '''Student Interaction and Collaboration''' (Scale II, consisting of 6 items), (e.g. I collaborate with other students in the class).
# '''Personal Relevance''' (Scale III, consisting of 7 items), (e.g. I can relate what I learn to my life outside of university).
# '''[[Authentic Learning]]''' (Scale IV, consisting of 5 items), (e.g. I work on assignments that deal with real-world information).
# '''[[Active learning|Active Learning]]''' (Scale V, consisting of 3 items), (e.g. I explore my own strategies for learning).
# '''Student Autonomy''' (Scale VI, consisting of 5 items), (e.g. I play an important role in my learning.

An additional eight-item scale of student [[affect (psychology)]], designated the '''Enjoyment scale''', was included in the original DELES. An example item in this seventh scale reads, "I enjoy studying by distance education."

The 42 DELES items have response value options of: ''Never, Seldom, Sometimes, Often'', and ''Always''.

The DELES focuses on students' perceptions of the learning environment to the exclusion of technical factors such as Internet connectivity or [[learning platform]] as found in other distance education learning environment instruments.&lt;ref name="Ozkok"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ozkok|first=A|author2=Walker, S. L. |author3=Buyukozturk, S. |title=Reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the DELES.|journal=Learning Environments Journal|year=2009|volume=12|issue=3|pages=175–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of the DELES==

The DELES has been utilized in the United States to compare social work students' perceptions of their learning environments in a face-to-face class, a [[blended learning]] (hybrid) class, and an [[asynchronous learning]] distance education version of the same class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biggs|first=M. J. B.|title=Comparison of student perceptions of classroom instruction: Traditional, hybrid, and distance education.|journal=Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education|year=2006|volume=7|issue=2|url=http://tojde.anadolu.edu.tr/tojde22/articles/biggs.htm|accessdate=6 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714230729/http://tojde.anadolu.edu.tr/tojde22/articles/biggs.htm|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and used to identify motivation of Taiwanese adult distance education learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=J-S.|title=Motivations for older adults' participation in distance education: A study at the National Open University of Taiwan|journal=Doctoral dissertation.

A. J.|title=Undergraduate Learners’ Perceptions of Blended Learning and its Relationship with Some Demographic and Experiential Variables at the Arab Open University-Bahrain Branch|journal=Masters thesis. United Arab Emirates University.|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DELES has also been translated into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and used to study Turkish online learning environments—this version is referred to as the Turkish DELES (TR-DELES).&lt;ref name="Ozkok" /&gt; A [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version, referred to as the Spanish DELES (Sp-DELES) has been validated and utilized with Spanish students.&lt;ref name="Ferrer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrer-Cascales|first=R|author2=Walker, S.

==Significance of the DELES==

The DELES is significant in the realm of [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] distance education because it was the first instrument available to seek associations between the [[psychosocial]] learning environment and student satisfaction with their distance education class.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;

By statistically measuring associations between the six DELES scales and the scale of “Enjoyment,” researchers have been able to determine that ''Personal Relevance'' is the strongest positive and statistically significant contributor to student satisfaction in distance education in one setting.&lt;ref name="Walker Fraser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=S. L.|author2=Fraser, B. J.|title=Development and validation of an instrument for assessing distance education learning environments in higher education: The Distance Education Learning Environments Survey (DELES).|journal=Learning Environments Research: An International Journal|year=2005|volume=8|issue=3|pages=289–308|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/khk122/woty/ResearchMethods/Walker%202005.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish DELES (TR-DELES) researchers discovered that, with their population, student satisfaction was more closely aligned statistically with ''Instructor Support''.&lt;ref name="Ozkok" /&gt; Conversely, the Spanish determined, with the Spanish DELES (Sp-DELES), that ''Active Learning'' and ''Autonomy'' are most influential on distance education student satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Ferrer"/&gt; With the Portuguese version of the DELES it was determined that ''Student Interaction and Collaboration'' was most closely aligned with student satisfaction in Education courses.&lt;ref name="Pereira"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pereira|first=A.|author2=Gomes, R. M. |author3=Abrantes, N. |title= Psychosocial e-learning environment in Portuguese higher education by DELES. In M. H. Pedrosa-de-Jesus, C. Evans, Z. Charlesworth &amp; E.

The DELES has consistently held up well in terms of [[validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] in 27 independent studies, including studies where the DELES has been translated into Mandarin, Turkish, Arabic and Spanish. It has been modified for use in Malaysia and Palestine.&lt;ref name="Ferrer" /&gt;

==Forms==
In addition to aiding researchers in associating psychosocial aspects with student satisfaction, the DELES has three forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=S. L.|title=Development of the distance education learning environments survey (DELES) for higher education.|journal=Texas Journal of Distance Learning|year=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same scales are used and the items are parallel; however, the wording is slightly different:
* Actual form – This is the original DELES used to determine what students perceive during a class. An item would read: “In this class the instructor responds promptly.”
* Preferred form – This version is used to capture what students would like their distance learning class to be like. The same item would read: “In this class I would prefer the instructor to respond promptly.”
* Instructor form – This version is used to capture the instructor’s perception of their class. The same item would read: “In my class I respond promptly.”

Results can be studied in various ways to gain an in-depth picture of the psychosocial nature of a given distance education learning environment. For instance, the [[teacher|instructor]]'s perspective can be compared to those of the students to see how closely they are aligned or not aligned. Or, the Preferred form can be administered as a pre-test and the Actual form as a post-test and the results analysed for differences and changes.

'''Environmental education''' ('''EE''') refers to organized efforts to teach how natural environments function, and particularly, how human beings can manage behavior and [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] to [[Sustainable living|live sustainably]]. It is a multi-disciplinary field integrating disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, earth science, atmospheric science, mathematics, and geography. The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation]] (UNESCO) states that EE is vital in imparting an inherent respect for nature amongst society and in enhancing public environmental awareness. UNESCO emphasises the role of EE in safeguarding future global developments of societal [[quality of life]] (QOL), through the protection of the environment, eradication of poverty, minimization of inequalities and insurance of sustainable development (UNESCO, 2014a). The term often implies education within the school system, from primary to post-secondary. However, it sometimes includes all efforts to educate the public and other audiences, including print materials, websites, media campaigns, etc.. There are also ways that environmental education is taught outside the traditional classroom. Aquariums, zoos, parks, and nature centers all have ways of teaching the public about the environment.

== Focus ==

Environmental education focuses on:

'''1.''' 	Engaging with citizens of all demographics to;

'''2.'''	Think critically, ethically, and creatively when evaluating environmental issues;

'''3.'''	Make educated judgments about those environmental issues;

'''4.'''	Develop skills and a commitment to act independently and collectively to sustain and enhance the environment; and,

'''5.''' 	To enhance their appreciation of the environment; resulting in positive environmental behavioural change (Bamberg &amp; Moeser, 2007; Wals et al., 2014).

== Attributes ==
There are a few central qualities involved in environmental education that are useful contributions to the individual. 

Environmental education:

# Enhances real-world problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neefusa.org/nature/water/benefits-environmental-education|title=Benefits of Environmental Education|work=NEEF|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Improves communication/leadership when working in groups. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmentalscience.org/degree/environmental-education|title=Environmental Education Degree  - Bachelors, Certificates, Masters &amp; PhD Programs Online {{!}} EnvironmentalScience.org|website=www.environmentalscience.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Careers ==
There are various different career paths one could delve into within environmental education. Many of these careers require discovering and planning how to resolve environmental issues occurring in today’s world. The location of someone with these careers has an impact on the clear responsibilities each must obtain depending on what environmental issue is most prevalent in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://environmentalsciencedegree.org/careers/|title=Top 5 Environmental Science Careers|work=Environmental Science Degree|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general outlook of some careers in this field are:

'''Federal Government [[Park ranger|Park Ranger]]-''' Responsible for protecting the [[National park|national parks]], historical sites, and national seashores across the United States including the wildlife and ecosystems within them. There are many qualifications in order for one to become a park ranger and some include: obtaining a bachelor’s degree and a passing grade in the PEB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.criminaljusticedegreeschools.com/criminal-justice-careers/park-ranger/|title=How to Become a Park Ranger: Career and Salary Information|work=Criminal Justice Degree Schools|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some focuses within this field include: enforcing park rules, giving tours to groups for educational purposes, and protecting parks from forest fires. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parkrangeredu.org/what-is-a-park-ranger/|title=What is a Park Ranger|website=www.parkrangeredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outdoor Education Teacher-''' Teach students by using outdoor field and classroom work. Some invite guest speakers who are experts in their field to help teach how the basic principles of science are implemented in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Bi-Ca/Careers-in-Environmental-Education.html|title=Careers in Environmental Education - oceans, important, types, system, marine|website=www.waterencyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some requirements for this career include becoming [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] certified and having a bachelor's degree in either environmental science or a field related to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/Careers_in_Outdoor_Education_Options_and_Education_Requirements.html|title=Careers in Outdoor Education: Options and Education Requirements|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a problematic field as there is no concurrence on the central concepts that are taught as well as teachers do not agree on what constitutes an important environmental issue. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Åhlberg|first=Mauri|last2=Kaasinen|first2=Arja|last3=Kaivola|first3=Taina|last4=Houtsonen|first4=Lea|date=2001-10|title=Collaborative knowledge building to promote in-service teacher training in environmental education|journal=Journal of Information Technology for Teacher Education|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=227–240|doi=10.1080/14759390100200113|issn=0962-029X|citeseerx=10.1.1.609.1216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental education has crossover with multiple other disciplines. These fields of education complement environmental education yet have unique philosophies.

* '''[[Citizen Science]] (CS)''' aims to address both scientific and environmental outcomes through enlisting the public in the collection of data, through relatively simple protocols, generally from local habitats over long periods of time (Bonney et al., 2009).
* '''[[Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD)''' aims to reorient education to empower individuals to make informed decisions for environmental integrity, social justice, and economic viability for both present and future generations, whilst respecting cultural diversities (UNESCO, 2014b).
* '''[[Climate change education (CCE)|Climate Change Education (CCE)]]''' aims in enhancing the public's understanding of [[climate change]], its consequences, and its problems, and to prepare current and future generations to limit the magnitude of climate change and to respond to its challenges (Beatty, 2012). Specifically, CCE needs to help learners develop knowledge, skills and values and action to engage and learn about the causes, impact and management of climate change &lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. H. (2014). Climate change education: Knowing, doing and being. Rutledge.[https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-Education-Knowing-doing/dp/0415641969]&lt;/ref&gt;(Chang, 2014).
* '''[[Science Education]] (SE)''' focuses primarily on teaching knowledge and skills, to develop innovative thought in society (Wals et al., 2014).
* '''[[Outdoor Education]] (OE)''' relies on the assumption that learning experiences outdoors in ‘nature’ foster an appreciation of nature, resulting in pro-environmental awareness and action (Clarke &amp; Mcphie,2014). Outdoor education means learning "in" and "for" the outdoors.
* '''[[Experiential education]] (ExE)''' is a process through which a learner constructs knowledge, skill, and value from direct experiences" (AEE, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;5) Experiential education can be viewed as both a process and method to deliver the ideas and skills associated with environmental education (ERIC, 2002).
* '''[[Garden-based learning]] (GBL)''' is an instructional strategy that utilizes the garden as a teaching tool. It encompasses programs, activities and projects in which the garden is the foundation for integrated learning, in and across disciplines, through active, engaging, real-world experiences that have personal meaning for children, youth, adults and communities in an informal outside learning setting.
* '''[[Inquiry-based Science]] (IBS)''' is an active open style of teaching in which students follow scientific steps in a similar manner as scientists to study some problem (Walker 2015). Often used in biological and environmental settings.

While each of these educational fields has their own objectives, there are points where they overlap with the intentions and philosophy of environmental education.

==History==

The roots of environmental education can be traced back as early as the 18th century when [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] stressed the importance of an education that focuses on the environment in ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]''. Several decades later, [[Louis Agassiz]], a Swiss-born naturalist, echoed Rousseau’s philosophy as he encouraged students to “Study nature, not books.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/agassiz.html Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; These two influential scholars helped lay the foundation for a concrete environmental education program, known as [[nature study]], which took place in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The nature study movement used fables and moral lessons to help students develop an appreciation of nature and embrace the natural world.&lt;ref name="Cronon"&gt;Bill Cronon, [http://www.williamcronon.net/handouts/460_handout_15_child_in_the_garden.htm WilliamCronon.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118100712/http://www.williamcronon.net/handouts/460_handout_15_child_in_the_garden.htm |date=2010-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Botsford Comstock, the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University, was a prominent figure in the nature study movement. She wrote the Handbook for Nature Study in 1911 which used nature to educate children on cultural values.&lt;ref name="Cronon"/&gt; Comstock and the other leaders of the movement, such as Liberty Hyde Bailey, helped Nature Study garner tremendous amounts of support from community leaders, teachers, and scientists to change the science curriculum for children across the United States.

A new type of environmental education, Conservation Education, emerged as a result of the Great Depression and [[Dust Bowl]] during the 1920s and 1930s. Conservation Education dealt with the natural world in a drastically different way from Nature Study because it focused on rigorous scientific training rather than natural history.&lt;ref name="Cronon"/&gt; Conservation Education was a major scientific management and planning tool that helped solve social, economic, and environmental problems during this time period.

The modern environmental education movement, which gained significant momentum in the late 1960s and early 1970s, stems from Nature Study and Conservation Education. During this time period, many events – such as Civil Rights, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War – placed Americans at odds with one another and the U.S. government. However, as more people began to fear the fallout from radiation, the chemical pesticides mentioned in Rachel Carson’s [[Silent Spring]], and the significant amounts of air pollution and waste, the public’s concern for their health and the health of their natural environment led to a unifying phenomenon known as [[environmentalism]]. Environmental education was born of the realization that solving complex local and global problems cannot be accomplished by politicians and experts alone, but requires "the support and active participation of an informed public in their various roles as consumers, voters, employers, and business and community leaders." &lt;ref&gt;Canadian Environmental Grantmakers Network. 2006. "Environmental Education in Canada: An overview for grantmakers," Toronto: ON. http://www.cegn.org/english/home/documents/EEBrief_Eng.pdf, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first articles about environmental education as a new movement appeared in the ''[[Phi Delta Kappan]]'' in 1969, authored by [[James A. Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swan | first1 = J.A. | year = 1969 | title = The challenge of environmental education | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 26–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A definition of "Environmental Education" first appeared in ''[[The Journal of Environmental Education]]'' in 1969, written by [[William B. Stapp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapp | first1 = W.B. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1969 | title = The Concept of Environmental Education | url = http://www.hiddencorner.us/html/PDFs/The_Concept_of_EE.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Journal of Environmental Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 30–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stapp later went on to become the first Director of Environmental Education for [[UNESCO]], and then the [[Global Rivers International Network]].

Ultimately, the first [[Earth Day]] on April 22, 1970 – a national teach-in about environmental problems – paved the way for the modern environmental education movement. Later that same year, President Nixon passed the National Environmental Education Act, which was intended to incorporate environmental education into K-12 schools.&lt;ref name="EElink.net"&gt;[http://eelink.net/eetap/info110a.pdf EElink.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611235103/http://eelink.net/eetap/info110a.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1971, the National Association for Environmental Education (now known as the [[North_American_Association_for_Environmental_Education | North American Association for Environmental Education]]) was created to improve environmental literacy by providing resources to teachers and promoting environmental education programs.

Internationally, environmental education gained recognition when the UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972, declared environmental education must be used as a tool to address global environmental problems. The United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and [[United Nations Environment Program]] ([[UNEP]]) created three major declarations that have guided the course of environmental education.

In 2002, the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 2005-2014 (UNDESD) was formed as a way to reconsider, excite, and change approaches to acting positively on global challenges. The Commission on Education and Communication (CEC) helped support the work of the UNDESD by composing a backbone structure for education for sustainability, which contained five major components. The components are "Imagining a better future", "Critical thinking and reflection", "Participation in decision making" and "Partnerships, and Systemic thinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=333458c3-7455-4976-862f-82bc3305f1b6@sdc-v-sessmgr03&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=98939066&amp;db=aph|title=Learning engagement and environmental education for sustainability: EBSCOhost|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On June 9-14 2013, the seventh World Environmental Education Congress was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. The overall theme of the conference was "'''Environmental education and issues in cities and rural areas: seeking greater harmony'''”, and incorporated 11 different areas of concern. The World Environmental Education Congress had 2,400 members, representing over 150 countries. This meeting was the first time ever that it had been held in an Arab country, and was put together by two different organizations, the Mohamed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection and the World Environmental Education Congress Permanent Secretariat in Italy. Topics addressed at the congress include stressing the importance of environmental education and its role to empower, establishing partnerships to promote environmental education, how to mainstream environmental and sustainability, and even how to make universities "greener".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=7th World Environmental Education Congress - Summary|url=https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/12206/WEEC_7_Congress_summary.pdf?amp%3BisAllowed=&amp;sequence=1|journal=7th World Environmental Education Congress|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockholm Declaration===
June 5–16, 1972 - The [[Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]]. The document was made up of 7 proclamations and 26 principles "to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment."

===Belgrade Charter===
October 13–22, 1975 - The Belgrade Charter&lt;ref&gt;The Belgrade Charter, Adopted by the UNESCO-UNEP International Environmental Workshop, October 13–22, 1975. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000177/017772eb.pdf accessed 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was the outcome of the International Workshop on Environmental Education held in Belgrade, Jugoslavia (now Serbia). The Belgrade Charter was built upon the [[Stockholm Declaration]] and adds goals, objectives, and guiding principles of environmental education programs. It defines an audience for environmental education, which includes the general public.

===Tbilisi Declaration===
October 14–26, 1977 - The [[Tbilisi]] Declaration "noted the unanimous accord in the important role of environmental education in the preservation and improvement of the world's environment, as well as in the sound and balanced development of the world's communities." The Tbilisi Declaration updated and clarified The Stockholm Declaration and The Belgrade Charter by including new goals, objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education.

Later that decade, in 1977, the Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education in Tbilisi, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] emphasized the role of Environmental Education in preserving and improving the global environment and sought to provide the framework and guidelines for environmental education. The Conference laid out the role, objectives, and characteristics of environmental education, and provided several goals and principles for environmental education.

==About==

Environmental education has been considered an additional or elective subject in much of traditional [[K-12]] [[curriculum]]. At the [[elementary school]] level, environmental education can take the form of [[science]] enrichment curriculum, [[natural history]] field trips, community service projects, and participation in outdoor science schools. EE policies assist schools and organizations in developing and improving environmental education programs that provide citizens with an in-depth understanding of the environment. School related EE policies focus on three main components: curricula, green facilities, and training.

Schools can integrate environmental education into their curricula with sufficient funding from EE policies. This approach – known as using the “environment as an integrating context” for learning – uses the local environment as a framework for teaching state and district education standards. In addition to funding environmental curricula in the classroom, environmental education policies allot the financial resources for hands-on, outdoor learning. These activities and lessons help address and mitigate "[[nature deficit disorder]]", as well as encourage healthier lifestyles.

Green schools, or green facility promotion, are another main component of environmental education policies. Greening school facilities cost, on average, a little less than 2 percent more than creating a traditional school, but payback from these [[energy efficient buildings]] occur within only a few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthday.net/greenschools Earthday.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental education policies help reduce the relatively small burden of the initial start-up costs for green schools. Green school policies also provide grants for modernization, renovation, or repair of older school facilities. Additionally, healthy food options are also a central aspect of green schools. These policies specifically focus on bringing freshly prepared food, made from high-quality, locally grown ingredients into schools.

In [[secondary school]], environmental curriculum can be a focused subject within the sciences or is a part of student interest groups or clubs. At the undergraduate and graduate level, it can be considered its own field within education, environmental studies, environmental science and policy, ecology, or human/cultural ecology programs.

Environmental education is not restricted to in-class lesson plans. Children can learn about the environment in many ways. Experiential lessons in the school yard, field trips to national parks, after-school green clubs, and school-wide sustainability projects help make the environment an easily accessible topic. Furthermore, celebration of [[Earth Day]] or participation in EE week (run through the National Environmental Education Foundation) can help further environmental education. Effective programs promote a holistic approach and lead by example, using sustainable practices in the school to encourage students and parents to bring environmental education into their home.

The final aspect of environmental education policies involves training individuals to thrive in a sustainable society. In addition to building a strong relationship with nature, citizens must have the skills and knowledge to succeed in a 21st-century workforce. Thus, environmental education policies fund both teacher training and worker training initiatives. Teachers train to effectively teach and incorporate environmental studies. On the other hand, the current workforce must be trained or re-trained so they can adapt to the new green economy. Environmental education policies that fund training programs are critical to educating citizens to prosper in a sustainable society.

== In the United States ==

Following the 1970s, non-governmental organizations that focused on environmental education continued to form and grow, the number of teachers implementing environmental education in their classrooms increased, and the movement gained stronger political backing. A critical move forward came when the United States Congress passed the [[National Environmental Education Act]] of 1990, which placed the Office of Environmental Education in the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and allowed the EPA to create environmental education initiatives at the federal level.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has their own definition of what environmental education should be and it is as follows. "Environmental education is a process that allows individuals to explore environmental issues, engage in problem solving, and take action to improve the environment. As a result, individuals develop a deeper understanding of environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions." The EPA also has a list of the components of what should be gained from EE.

* Awareness and sensitivity to the environment and environmental challenges
* Knowledge and understanding of the environment and environmental challenges
* Attitudes of concern for the environment and motivation to improve or maintain environmental quality
* Skills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges
* Participation in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/education/what-environmental-education|title=What is Environmental Education? {{!}} US EPA|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29|date=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the EPA Environmental Education (EE) Grant Program, public schools, communities agencies, and NGO’s are eligible to receive federal funding for local educational projects that reflect the EPA’s priorities: air quality, water quality, chemical safety, and public participation among the communities.

In the United States some of the antecedents of environmental education were the Nature Study movement, conservation education and school camping. Nature studies integrated academic approach with outdoor exploration (Roth, 1978). Conservation education raised awareness about the misuse of natural resources and the need for their preservation. [[George Perkins Marsh]] discoursed on humanity’s integral part of the natural world. Governmental agencies such as the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and the EPA supported conservation efforts. Conservation ideals still guide environmental education today. School camping was exposure to the environment and use of resources outside of the classroom for educational purposes. The legacies of these antecedents are still present in the evolving arena of environmental education.

== Obstacles ==

A study of Ontario teachers explored obstacles to environmental education.&lt;ref name="Tan &amp; Pedretti, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=M.|last2=Pedretti|first2=E.|year=2010|title=Negotiating the complexities of environmental education: A study of Ontario teachers|url=|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education]]|volume=10|issue=1|pages=61–78|doi=10.1080/14926150903574320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an internet-based survey questionnaire, 300 K-12 teachers from Ontario, Canada responded. Based on the results of the survey, the most significant challenges identified by the sample of Ontario teachers include over-crowded curriculum, lack of resources, low priority of environmental education in schools, limited access to the outdoors, student apathy to environmental issues, and the controversial nature of sociopolitical action.&lt;ref name="Tan &amp; Pedretti, 2010"/&gt;

An influential article by Stevenson (2007) outlines conflicting goals of environmental education and traditional schooling.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. B.|year=2007|title=Schooling and environmental education: Contradictions in purpose and practice|url=|journal=Environmental Education Research|volume=13|issue=2|pages=139–153|doi=10.1080/13504620701295726}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stevenson (2007), the recent critical and action orientation of environmental education creates a challenging task for schools. Contemporary environmental education strives to transform values that underlie decision making from ones that aid environmental (and human) degradation to those that support a sustainable planet.&lt;ref name="Tanner, 1974"&gt;Tanner, R.T. 1974. "Ecology, environment and education," ''[[Lincoln, NE, Professional Educators Publications]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the traditional purpose of schools of conserving the existing social order by reproducing the norms and values that currently dominate environmental decision making.&lt;ref name= "Stevenson, 2007"/&gt; Confronting this contradiction is a major challenge to environmental education teachers.

Additionally, the dominant narrative that all environmental educators have an agenda can present difficulties in expanding reach. It is said that an environmental educator is one "who uses information and educational processes to help people analyze the merits of the many and varied points of view usually present on a given environmental issues."&lt;ref&gt;Hug, J. (1977). Two hats. In H. R. Hungerford, W. J. Bluhm, T. L. Volk, &amp; J. M. Ramsey (Eds.), ''Essential Readings in Environmental Education'' (pp. 47). Champaign, IL: Stipes Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Greater efforts must be taken to train educators on the importance of staying within the profession's substantive structure, and in informing the general public on the profession's intention to empower fully informed decision making.

Another obstacle facing the implementation of environmental education lies the quality of education itself. Charles Sayan, the executive director of the Ocean Conservation Society, represents alternate views and critiques on environmental education in his new book ''The Failure of Environmental Education (And How We Can Fix It).'' In a ''Yale Environment 360'' interview, Sayan discusses his book and outlines several flaws within environmental education, particularly its failed efforts to “reach its potential in fighting climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520265394|title=The Failure of Environmental Education (And How We Can Fix It)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that environmental education is not “keeping pace with environmental degradation” and encourages structural reform by increasing student engagement as well as improving relevance of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/green_failure_whats_wrong_with_environmental_education|title=Green Failure: What's Wrong With Environmental Education? - Yale E360|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=2011|website=e360.yale.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same critiques are discussed in Stewart Hudson’s BioScience paper, “Challenges for Environmental Education: Issues and Ideas for the 21st Century”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HUDSON|first=STEWART J.|date=2001-04-01|title=Challenges for Environmental Education: Issues and Ideas for the 21st Century|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=51|issue=4|pages=283|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0283:cfeeia]2.0.co;2|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==

A movement that has progressed since the relatively recent founding (1960s) of environmental education in industrial societies has transported the participant from nature appreciation and awareness to education for an ecologically sustainable future. This trend may be viewed as a microcosm of how many environmental education programs seek to first engage participants through developing a sense of nature appreciation which then translates into actions that affect conservation and sustainability.

Programs range from New York to California, including Life Lab at University of California, Santa Cruz, as well as Cornell University in Ithaca. [http://www.gardenmosaics.cornell.edu/]

== Environmental Education in the Global South ==
Environmentalism has also began to make waves in the development of the global South, as the “[[First World]]” takes on the responsibility of helping [[Developing country|developing countries]] to combat environmental issues produced and prolonged by conditions of poverty. Unique to environmental education in the Global South is its particular focus on sustainable development. This goal has been a part of international agenda since the 1900’s, with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO) and the Earth Council Alliance (ECA) at the forefront of pursuing sustainable development in the south.

The 1977 Tbilisi intergovernmental conference played a key role in the development of  outcome of the conference was the Tbilisi Declaration, a unanimous accord which “constitutes the framework, principles, and guidelines for environmental education at all levels—local, national, regional, and international—and for all age groups both inside and outside the formal school system” recommended as a criteria for implementing environmental education. The Declaration was established with the intention of increasing environmental stewardship, awareness and behavior, which paved the way for the rise of modern environmental education.

After the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, over 80 National Councils for Sustainable Development in developing countries were created between 1992-1998 to aid in compliance of international sustainability goals and encourage “creative solutions”.

In 1993, the Earth Council Alliance released the ''Treaty on environmental education for sustainable societies and global responsibility'', sparking discourse on environmental education. The Treaty, in 65 statements, outlines the role of environmental education in facilitating sustainable development through all aspects of democratized participation and provides a methodology for the Treaty’s signatories. It has been instrumentally utilized in expanding the field towards the global South, wherein the discourse of “environmental education for sustainable development” recognizes a need to include human population dynamics in EE and emphasizes “aspects related to contemporary economic realities and by placing greater emphasis on concerns for planetary solidarity”. Even as a necessary tool for the proliferation of environmental stewardship, environmental education implemented in the South varies and addresses environmental issues in relation to their impact different communities and specific community needs. Whereas in the developed global North where the environmentalist sentiments are centered around conservation without taking into consideration “the needs of people living within communities”, the global South must push forth a conservation agenda that parallels with social, economic, and political development. The role of environmental education in the South is centered around potential economic growth in development projects, as explicitly stated by the UNESCO, to apply environmental education for sustainable development through a "creative and effective use of human potential and all forms of capital to ensure rapid and more equitable economic growth, with minimal impact on the environment".

Moving into the 21st century, EE was furthered by United Nations as a part of the 2000 Millennium Development Goals to improve the planet by 2015. The MDGs included global efforts to end extreme poverty, work towards gender equality, access to education, and sustainable development to name a few. Although the MDGs produced great outcomes, its objectives were not met, and MDGs were soon were soon replaced by Sustainable Development Goals. A “universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity”, SDGs became the new face of global priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html|title=Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new goals incorporated objectives from MDGs yet incorporated a necessary environmental framework to “address key systemic barriers to sustainable development such as inequality, unsustainable consumption patterns, weak institutional capacity and environmental degradation that the MDGs neglected”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkiss|first=D.|date=2015-07-24|title=The Millennium Development Goals are Dead; Long Live the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Journal of Tropical Pediatrics|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=235–237|doi=10.1093/tropej/fmv048|pmid=26209862|issn=0142-6338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

One of the current trends within environmental education seeks to move from an approach of [[ideology]] and [[activism]] to one that allows students to make informed decisions and take action based on experience as well as data. Within this process, environmental curricula have progressively been integrated into governmental education standards. Some environmental educators find this movement distressing and move away from the original political and activist approach to environmental education while others find this approach more valid and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Failure of Environmental Education (and How We Can Fix It)|last=Blumstein|first=Daniel T|last2=Saylan|first2=Charlie|date=2007-04-17|journal=PLoS Biology|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050120|others=|volume=5|pages=e120|language=en|issn=1545-7885|pmc=1847843|pmid=17439304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, many educational institutions are encouraging students to take an active role in environmental education and stewardship at their institutions. They know that "to be successful, greening initiatives require both grassroots support from the student body and top down support from high-level campus administrators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Heather|last2=Brondizio|first2=Eduardo|last3=Robinson|first3=Jennifer|last4=Karpa|first4=John|last5=Gross|first5=Briana|title=Teaching Environmental Literacy|date=2010-01-11|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221506|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental Education is also being funded through the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]]. Under Title IV, Part A of ESSA, it states that Environmental Education is an enrichment activity for students which is eligible for funding under a new grants program. The program gives a “well-rounded” education as well as access to student health and safety programs. Under Title Iv, Part B, it states that environmental literacy programs are also eligible for funding through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. The funds that are available for both parts are block granted to the states using the Title I formula. In the FY2018 budget, Titles IVA and IVB were both given $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. For title IVA, this is a $700 million raise from the 2017 budget which makes the 2018-2019 school year the most availability to environmental education ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.naaee.org/sites/default/files/ee_in_essa_2018.pdf|title=Environmental Education in the Every Student Succeeds Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable Energy Education ==
[[Renewable energy]] education (REE) is a relatively new field of education. The overall objectives of REE pertain to giving a working knowledge and understanding of concepts, facts, principles and technologies for gathering the renewable sources of energy. Based on these objectives, the role of a renewable energy education programs should be informative, investigative, educative, and imaginative. REE should be taught with the world's population in mind as the world will run out of [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable resources]] within the next century. Renewable energy education is also being brought to political leaders as a means of getting more sustainable development to occur around the globe. This is happening in the hopes that it will uproot millions of people out of poverty and into a better quality of life in many countries .Renewable energy education is also about bringing awareness of climate change to the general public as well as an understanding of the current renewable energy technologies. An understanding of the new technologies is imperative to get them stream-lined and accepted by the vast majority of the public&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-06-01|title=Renewable energy education: A global status review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001762|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|language=en|volume=34|pages=300–324|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.02.039|issn=1364-0321|last1=Kandpal|first1=Tara C.|last2=Broman|first2=Lars}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Factor analysis''' is a [[statistics|statistical]] method used to describe [[variance|variability]] among observed, correlated [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called '''factors'''. For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved [[latent variable]]s. The observed variables are modelled as [[linear combination]]s of the potential factors, plus "[[errors and residuals in statistics|error]]" terms. Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables. The theory behind factor analytic methods is that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, [[psychometrics]], [[personality]] theories, [[marketing]], [[product management]], [[operations research]], and [[finance]]. Proponents of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables. It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality.

Factor analysis is related to [[principal component analysis]] (PCA), but the two are not identical.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartholomew |first1=D.J. |last2=Steele |first2=F. |last3=Galbraith |first3=J. |last4=Moustaki |first4=I. |title=Analysis of Multivariate Social Science Data |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2008 |isbn=1584889608 |edition=2nd |series=Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant controversy in the field over differences between the two techniques (see section on [[#Exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis|exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis]] below). PCA can be considered as a more basic version of [[exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) that was developed in the early days prior to the advent of high-speed computers. Both PCA and factor analysis aim to reduce the dimensionality of a set of data, but the approaches taken to do so are different for the two techniques. Factor analysis is clearly designed with the objective to identify certain unobservable factors from the observed variables, whereas PCA does not directly address this objective; at best, PCA provides an approximation to the required factors.&lt;ref name="Principal Component Analysis"&gt;Jolliffe I.T.

==Statistical model==

===Definition===
Suppose we have a set of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; '''observable random variables''', &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots,x_p&lt;/math&gt; with means &lt;math&gt;\mu_1,\dots,\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose for some unknown constants &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; unobserved random variables &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt; (called "'''common factors'''," because they influence all the observed random variables), where &lt;math&gt;i\in {1,\dots,p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j \in {1,\dots,k},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt;x_i-\mu_i=l_{i1} F_1 + \cdots + l_{ik} F_k + \varepsilon_i.\, &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are '''unobserved stochastic error terms''' with zero mean and finite variance, which may not be the same for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

In matrix terms, we have

: &lt;math&gt;x-\mu=LF+\varepsilon. \,&lt;/math&gt;

If we have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations, then we will have the dimensions &lt;math&gt;x_{p\times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_{p\times k}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_{k\times n}&lt;/math&gt;. Each column of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; denotes values for one particular observation, and matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; does not vary across observations.

Also we will impose the following assumptions on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;:

# &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; are independent.
# &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(F) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(F)=I&lt;/math&gt; (to make sure that the factors are uncorrelated).

Any solution of the above set of equations following the constraints for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ''factors'', and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as the '''''loading matrix'''''.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x-\mu)=\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Then note that from the conditions just imposed on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x-\mu)=\mathrm{Cov}(LF+\varepsilon),\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = L \mathrm{Cov}(F) L^T + \mathrm{Cov}(\varepsilon),\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = LL^T + \Psi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for any [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, if we set &lt;math&gt;L=LQ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F=Q^T F&lt;/math&gt;, the criteria for being factors and factor loadings still hold. Hence a set of factors and factor loadings is unique only up to an [[orthogonal transformation]].

===Example===
Suppose a psychologist has the hypothesis that there are two kinds of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], "verbal intelligence" and "mathematical intelligence", neither of which is directly observed. [[Evidence]] for the hypothesis is sought in the examination scores from each of 10 different academic fields of 1000 students. If each student is chosen randomly from a large [[population (statistics)|population]], then each student's 10 scores are random variables. The psychologist's hypothesis may say that for each of the 10 academic fields, the score averaged over the group of all students who share some common pair of values for verbal and mathematical "intelligences" is some [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] times their level of verbal intelligence plus another constant times their level of mathematical intelligence, i.e., it is a combination of those two "factors". The numbers for a particular subject, by which the two kinds of intelligence are multiplied to obtain the expected score, are posited by the hypothesis to be the same for all intelligence level pairs, and are called '''"factor loading"''' for this subject. For example, the hypothesis may hold that the average student's aptitude in the field of [[astronomy]] is

:{10 × the student's verbal intelligence} + {6 × the student's mathematical intelligence}.

The numbers 10 and 6 are the factor loadings associated with astronomy. Other academic subjects may have different factor loadings.

Two students assumed to have identical degrees of the latent, unmeasured traits of verbal and mathematical intelligence may have different measured aptitudes in astronomy because individual aptitudes differ from average aptitudes and because of measurement error itself. Such differences make up what is collectively called the "error" — a statistical term that means the amount by which an individual, as measured, differs from what is average for or predicted by his or her levels of intelligence (see [[errors and residuals in statistics]]).

The observable data that go into factor analysis would be 10 scores of each of the 1000 students, a total of 10,000 numbers. The factor loadings and levels of the two kinds of intelligence of each student must be inferred from the data.

===Mathematical model of the same example===
In the following, matrices will be indicated by indexed variables. "Subject" indices will be indicated using letters a,b and c, with values running from 1 to &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to 10 in the above example.  "Factor" indices will be indicated using letters p, q and r, with values running from 1 to &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to 2 in the above example. "Instance" or "sample" indices will be indicated using letters i,j and k, with values running from 1 to &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;. In the example above, if a sample of &lt;math&gt;N_i=1000&lt;/math&gt; students responded to the &lt;math&gt;N_a=10&lt;/math&gt; questions, the ''i''th student's score for the ''a''th question are given by &lt;math&gt;x_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;. The purpose of factor analysis is to characterize the correlations between the variables &lt;math&gt;x_a&lt;/math&gt; of which the &lt;math&gt;x_{ai}&lt;/math&gt; are a particular instance, or set of observations. In order for the variables to be on equal footing, they are normalized:
:&lt;math&gt;z_{ai}=\frac{x_{ai}-\mu_a}{\sigma_a}&lt;/math&gt;
where the sample mean is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a=\tfrac{1}{N_i}\sum_i x_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;
and the sample variance is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_a^2=\tfrac{1}{N_i-1}\sum_i (x_{ai}-\mu_a)^2&lt;/math&gt;
The factor analysis model for this particular sample is then:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}z_{1,i} &amp; =  &amp; \ell_{1,1}F_{1,i} &amp; + &amp; \ell_{1,2}F_{2,i} &amp; + &amp; \varepsilon_{1,i} \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
z_{10,i} &amp; =  &amp; \ell_{10,1}F_{1,i} &amp; + &amp; \ell_{10,2}F_{2,i} &amp; + &amp; \varepsilon_{10,i}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, more succinctly:
:&lt;math&gt;
z_{ai}=\sum_p \ell_{ap}F_{pi}+\varepsilon_{ai}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;F_{1,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th student's "verbal intelligence",
* &lt;math&gt;F_{2,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th student's "mathematical intelligence",
* &lt;math&gt;\ell_{ap}&lt;/math&gt; are the factor loadings for the ''a''th subject, for ''p'' = 1, 2.

In [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation, we have
:&lt;math&gt;Z=LF+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Observe that by doubling the scale on which "verbal intelligence"—the first component in each column of ''F''—is measured, and simultaneously halving the factor loadings for verbal intelligence makes no difference to the model. Thus, no generality is lost by assuming that the standard deviation of the factors for verbal intelligence is 1. Likewise for mathematical intelligence. Moreover, for similar reasons, no generality is lost by assuming the two factors are [[uncorrelated]] with each other. In other words:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i F_{pi}F_{qi}=\delta_{pq}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{pq}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] (0 when &lt;math&gt;p \ne q&lt;/math&gt; and 1 when &lt;math&gt;p=q&lt;/math&gt;).The errors are assumed to be independent of the factors:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i F_{pi}\varepsilon_{ai}=0&lt;/math&gt;
Note that, since any rotation of a solution is also a solution, this makes interpreting the factors difficult. See disadvantages below. In this particular example, if we do not know beforehand that the two types of intelligence are uncorrelated, then we cannot interpret the two factors as the two different types of intelligence. Even if they are uncorrelated, we cannot tell which factor corresponds to verbal intelligence and which corresponds to mathematical intelligence without an outside argument.

The values of the loadings ''L'', the averages μ, and the [[variance]]s of the "errors" ε must be estimated given the observed data ''X'' and ''F'' (the assumption about the levels of the factors is fixed for a given ''F''). 
The "fundamental theorem" may be derived from the above conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i z_{ai}z_{bi}=\sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{bp}+\sum_i \varepsilon_{ai}\varepsilon_{bi}&lt;/math&gt;
The term on the left is the (a,b) term of the correlation matrix (an &lt;math&gt;N_a \times N_a&lt;/math&gt; matrix) of the observed data, and its &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; diagonal elements will be 1's. The last term on the right will be a diagonal matrix with terms less than unity. The first term on the right is the "reduced correlation matrix" and will be equal to the correlation matrix except for its diagonal values which will be less than unity. These diagonal elements of the reduced correlation matrix are called "communalities" (which represent the fraction of the variance in the observed variable that is accounted for by the factors):
:&lt;math&gt;
h_a^2=1-\psi_a=\sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{ap}
&lt;/math&gt;
The sample data &lt;math&gt;z_{ai}&lt;/math&gt; will not, of course, exactly obey the fundamental equation given above due to sampling errors, inadequacy of the model, etc. The goal of any analysis of the above model is to find the factors &lt;math&gt;F_{pi}&lt;/math&gt; and loadings &lt;math&gt;\ell_{ap}&lt;/math&gt; which, in some sense, give a "best fit" to the data. In factor analysis, the best fit is defined as the minimum of the mean square error in the off-diagonal residuals of the correlation matrix:&lt;ref name="Harman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harman |first=Harry H. |year=1976 |title=Modern Factor Analysis |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=175, 176 |isbn=0-226-31652-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2 = \sum_{ab,a\ne b} \left[\sum_i z_{ai}z_{bi}-\sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{bp}\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to minimizing the off-diagonal components of the error covariance which, in the model equations have expected values of zero. This is to be contrasted with principal component analysis which seeks to minimize the mean square error of all residuals.&lt;ref name="Harman"/&gt; Before the advent of high speed computers, considerable effort was devoted to finding approximate solutions to the problem, particularly in estimating the communalities by other means, which then simplifies the problem considerably by yielding a known reduced correlation matrix. This was then used to estimate the factors and the loadings. With the advent of high-speed computers, the minimization problem can be solved iteratively with adequate speed, and the communalities are calculated in the process, rather than being needed beforehand. The [[Generalized minimal residual method|MinRes]] algorithm is particularly suited to this problem, but is hardly the only iterative means of finding a solution.

If the solution factors are allowed to be correlated (as in oblimin rotation, for example), then the corresponding mathematical model uses [[skew coordinates]] rather than orthogonal coordinates.

===Geometric interpretation===
[[File:FactorPlot.svg|thumb|350px|Geometric interpretation of Factor Analysis parameters for 3 respondents to question "a". The "answer" is represented by the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt;, which is projected onto a plane defined by two orthonormal vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;. The projection vector is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a&lt;/math&gt; and the error &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to the plane, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a=\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt;. The projection vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a&lt;/math&gt; may be represented in terms of the factor vectors as &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a=\ell_{a1}\mathbf{F}_1+\ell_{a2}\mathbf{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;. The square of the length of the projection vector is the communality: &lt;math&gt;|\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a|^2=h^2_a&lt;/math&gt;. If another data vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt; were plotted, the cosine of the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;r_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; : the (a,b) entry in the correlation matrix. (Adapted from Harman Fig. 4.3)&lt;ref name="Harman"/&gt;]]

The parameters and variables of factor analysis can be given a geometrical interpretation. The data (&lt;math&gt;z_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;), the factors (&lt;math&gt;F_{pi}&lt;/math&gt;) and the errors (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;) can be viewed as vectors in an &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space (sample space), represented as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Since the data are standardized, the data vectors are of unit length (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a\cdot\mathbf{z}_a=1&lt;/math&gt;). The factor vectors define an &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional linear subspace (i.e. a hyperplane) in this space, upon which the data vectors are projected orthogonally. This follows from the model equation 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a=\sum_p \ell_{ap} \mathbf{F}_p+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt;
and the independence of the factors and the errors: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_p\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a=0&lt;/math&gt;. In the above example, the hyperplane is just a 2-dimensional plane defined by the two factor vectors. The projection of the data vectors onto the hyperplane is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a=\sum_p \ell_{ap}\mathbf{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;
and the errors are vectors from that projected point to the data point and are perpendicular to the hyperplane. The goal of factor analysis is to find a hyperplane which is a "best fit" to the data in some sense, so it doesn't matter how the factor vectors which define this hyperplane are chosen, as long as they are independent and lie in the hyperplane. We are free to specify them as both orthogonal and normal (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_p\cdot \mathbf{F}_q=\delta_{pq}&lt;/math&gt;) with no loss of generality. After a suitable set of factors are found, they may also be arbitrarily rotated within the hyperplane, so that any rotation of the factor vectors will define the same hyperplane, and also be a solution. As a result, in the above example, in which the fitting hyperplane is two dimensional, if we do not know beforehand that the two types of intelligence are uncorrelated, then we cannot interpret the two factors as the two different types of intelligence. Even if they are uncorrelated, we cannot tell which factor corresponds to verbal intelligence and which corresponds to mathematical intelligence, or whether the factors are linear combinations of both, without an outside argument.

The data vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; have unit length. The correlation matrix for the data is given by &lt;math&gt;r_{ab}=\mathbf{z}_a\cdot\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt;. The correlation matrix can be geometrically interpreted as the cosine of the angle between the two data vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal elements will clearly be 1's and the off diagonal elements will have absolute values less than or equal to unity. The "reduced correlation matrix" is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}_{ab}=\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}_b&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal of factor analysis is to choose the fitting hyperplane such that the reduced correlation matrix reproduces the correlation matrix as nearly as possible, except for the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix which are known to have unit value.  In other words, the goal is to reproduce as accurately as possible the cross-correlations in the data. Specifically, for the fitting hyperplane, the mean square error in the off-diagonal components 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2=\sum_{a,b\ne a} \left(r_{ab}-\hat{r}_{ab}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

is to be minimized, and this is accomplished by minimizing it with respect to a set of orthonormal factor vectors. It can be seen that 
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{ab}-\hat{r}_{ab}= \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_b
&lt;/math&gt;

The term on the right is just the covariance of the errors. In the model, the error covariance is stated to be a diagonal matrix and so the above minimization problem will in fact yield a "best fit" to the model: It will yield a sample estimate of the error covariance which has its off-diagonal components minimized in the mean square sense. It can be seen that since the &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal projections of the data vectors, their length will be less than or equal to the length of the projected data vector, which is unity. The square of these lengths are just the diagonal elements of the reduced correlation matrix. These diagonal elements of the reduced correlation matrix are known as "communalities":

:&lt;math&gt;
h_a^2=\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a = \sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{ap}
&lt;/math&gt;

Large values of the communalities will indicate that the fitting hyperplane is rather accurately reproducing the correlation matrix. It should be noted that the mean values of the factors must also be constrained to be zero, from which it follows that the mean values of the errors will also be zero.

===Types of factor analysis===
[[Exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) is used to identify complex interrelationships among items and group items that are part of unified concepts.&lt;ref name=Polit&gt;{{cite book |author=Polit DF Beck CT |title=Nursing Research: Generating and Assessing Evidence for Nursing Practice, 9th ed. |year=2012 |publisher=Wolters Klower Health, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researcher makes no ''a priori'' assumptions about relationships among factors.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;

[[Confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA) is a more complex approach that tests the hypothesis that the items are associated with specific factors.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt; CFA uses [[structural equation modeling]] to test a measurement model whereby loading on the factors allows for evaluation of relationships between observed variables and unobserved variables.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;  Structural equation modeling approaches can accommodate measurement error, and are less restrictive than [[least-squares estimation]].&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;  Hypothesized models are tested against actual data, and the analysis would demonstrate loadings of observed variables on the latent variables (factors), as well as the correlation between the latent variables.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;

===Types of factor extraction===
[[Principal component analysis]] (PCA) is a widely used method for factor extraction, which is the first phase of EFA.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt; Factor weights are computed to extract the maximum possible variance, with successive factoring continuing until there is no further meaningful variance left.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt; The factor model must then be rotated for analysis.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;

Canonical factor analysis, also called Rao's canonical factoring, is a different method of computing the same model as PCA, which uses the principal axis method. Canonical factor analysis seeks factors which have the highest canonical correlation with the observed variables. Canonical factor analysis is unaffected by arbitrary rescaling of the data.

Common factor analysis, also called principal factor analysis (PFA) or principal axis factoring (PAF), seeks the least number of factors which can account for the common variance (correlation) of a set of variables.

Image factoring is based on the [[correlation matrix]] of predicted variables rather than actual variables, where each variable is predicted from the others using [[multiple regression]].

Alpha factoring is based on maximizing the reliability of factors, assuming variables are randomly sampled from a universe of variables. All other methods assume cases to be sampled and variables fixed.

Factor regression model is a combinatorial model of factor model and regression model; or alternatively, it can be viewed as the hybrid factor model,&lt;ref name="meng2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meng |first=J. |title=Uncover cooperative gene regulations by microRNAs and transcription factors in glioblastoma using a nonnegative hybrid factor model |journal=International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing |year=2011 |url=http://www.cmsworldwide.com/ICASSP2011/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=4439 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123144133/http://www.cmsworldwide.com/ICASSP2011/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=4439 |archivedate=2011-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose factors are partially known.

===Terminology===
Factor loadings: Commonality is the square of standardized outer loading of an item. Analogous to [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson's r]], the squared factor loading is the percent of variance in that indicator variable explained by the factor. To get the percent of variance in all the variables accounted for by each factor, add the sum of the squared factor loadings for that factor (column) and divide by the number of variables. (Note the number of variables equals the sum of their variances as the variance of a standardized variable is 1.) This is the same as dividing the factor's [[eigenvalue]] by the number of variables.

Interpreting factor loadings: By one rule of thumb in confirmatory factor analysis, loadings should be .7 or higher to confirm that independent variables identified a priori are represented by a particular factor, on the rationale that the .7 level corresponds to about half of the variance in the indicator being explained by the factor. However, the .7 standard is a high one and real-life data may well not meet this criterion, which is why some researchers, particularly for exploratory purposes, will use a lower level such as .4 for the central factor and .25 for other factors. In any event, factor loadings must be interpreted in the light of theory, not by arbitrary cutoff levels.

In [[Angle#Types of angles|oblique]] rotation, one may examine both a pattern matrix and a structure matrix. The structure matrix is simply the factor loading matrix as in orthogonal rotation, representing the variance in a measured variable explained by a factor on both a unique and common contributions basis. The pattern matrix, in contrast, contains [[coefficient]]s which just represent unique contributions. The more factors, the lower the pattern coefficients as a rule since there will be more common contributions to variance explained. For oblique rotation, the researcher looks at both the structure and pattern coefficients when attributing a label to a factor. Principles of oblique rotation can be derived from both cross entropy and its dual entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liou | first=C.-Y. | last2=Musicus | first2=B.R. | title=Cross Entropy Approximation of Structured Gaussian Covariance Matrices |journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=3362–3367 |year=2008 |doi=10.1109/TSP.2008.917878 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=4545272&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communality: The sum of the squared factor loadings for all factors for a given variable (row) is the variance in that variable accounted for by all the factors, and this is called the communality. The communality measures the percent of variance in a given variable explained by all the factors jointly and may be interpreted as the reliability of the indicator in the context of the factors being posited.

Spurious solutions: If the communality exceeds 1.0, there is a spurious solution, which may reflect too small a sample or the choice to extract too many or too few factors.

Uniqueness of a variable: The variability of a variable minus its communality.

Eigenvalues/characteristic roots: Eigenvalues measure the amount of variation in the total sample accounted for by each factor. The ratio of eigenvalues is the ratio of explanatory importance of the factors with respect to the variables. If a factor has a low eigenvalue, then it is contributing little to the explanation of variances in the variables and may be ignored as less important than the factors with higher eigenvalues. 

Extraction sums of squared loadings: Initial eigenvalues and eigenvalues after extraction (listed by SPSS as "Extraction Sums of Squared Loadings") are the same for PCA extraction, but for other extraction methods, eigenvalues after extraction will be lower than their initial counterparts. SPSS also prints "Rotation Sums of Squared Loadings" and even for PCA, these eigenvalues will differ from initial and extraction eigenvalues, though their total will be the same.

Factor scores (also called component scores in PCA): are the scores of each case (row) on each factor (column). To compute the factor score for a given case for a given factor, one takes the case's standardized score on each variable, multiplies by the corresponding loadings of the variable for the given factor, and sums these products. Computing factor scores allows one to look for factor outliers. Also, factor scores may be used as variables in subsequent modeling. (Explained from PCA not from Factor Analysis perspective).

===Criteria for determining the number of factors===
Researchers wish to avoid such subjective or arbitrary criteria for factor retention as "it made sense to me". A number of objective methods have been developed to solve this problem, allowing users to determine an appropriate range of solutions to investigate. Methods may not agree. For instance, the parallel analysis may suggest 5 factors while Velicer's MAP suggests 6, so the researcher may request both 5 and 6-factor solutions and discuss each in terms of their relation to external data and theory.

====Modern criteria====
[[John L. Horn|Horn]]'s parallel analysis (PA): A Monte-Carlo based simulation method that compares the observed eigenvalues with those obtained from uncorrelated normal variables. A factor or component is retained if the associated eigenvalue is bigger than the 95th percentile of the distribution of eigenvalues derived from the random data. PA is one of the most recommended rules for determining the number of components to retain,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} but many programs fail to include this option (a notable exception being [[R (programming language)|R]] ).&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | last1 = Ledesma | first1 = R.D. | last2 = Valero-Mora | first2 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Determining the Number of Factors to Retain in EFA: An easy-to-use computer program for carrying out Parallel Analysis | url = http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=12&amp;n=2 | journal = Practical Assessment Research &amp; Evaluation | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Anton Formann|Formann]] provided both theoretical and empirical evidence that its application might not be appropriate in many cases since its performance is considerably influenced by [[sample size]], [[Item response theory#The item response function|item discrimination]], and type of [[correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;Tran, U. S., &amp; Formann, A. K. (2009). Performance of parallel analysis in retrieving unidimensionality in the presence of binary data.

Velicer's (1976) MAP test&lt;ref name=Velicer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velicer|first=W.F.|title=Determining the number of components from the matrix of partial correlations|journal=Psychometrika|year=1976|volume=41|pages=321–327|doi=10.1007/bf02293557}}&lt;/ref&gt; “involves a complete principal components analysis followed by the examination of a series of matrices of partial correlations” (p.&amp;nbsp;397). The squared correlation for Step “0” (see Figure 4) is the average squared off-diagonal correlation for the unpartialed correlation matrix. On Step 1, the first principal component and its associated items are partialed out. Thereafter, the average squared off-diagonal correlation for the subsequent correlation matrix is then computed for Step 1. On Step 2, the first two principal components are partialed out and the resultant average squared off-diagonal correlation is again computed. The computations are carried out for k minus one step (k representing the total number of variables in the matrix). Thereafter, all of the average squared correlations for each step are lined up and the step number in the analyses that resulted in the lowest average squared partial correlation determines the number of components or factors to retain.&lt;ref name=Velicer/&gt; By this method, components are maintained as long as the variance in the correlation matrix represents systematic variance, as opposed to residual or error variance. Although methodologically akin to principal components analysis, the MAP technique has been shown to perform quite well in determining the number of factors to retain in multiple simulation studies.&lt;ref name="Warne, R.

==== Older methods ====
Kaiser criterion: The Kaiser rule is to drop all components with eigenvalues under 1.0 – this being the eigenvalue equal to the information accounted for by an average single  item. The Kaiser criterion is the default in [[SPSS]] and most [[statistical software]] but is not recommended when used as the sole cut-off criterion for estimating the number of factors as it tends to over-extract factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=D.L. |last1=Bandalos |first2=M.R. |last2=Boehm-Kaufman |chapter=Four common misconceptions in exploratory factor analysis |editor1-first=Charles E. |editor1-last=Lance |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Vandenberg |title=Statistical and Methodological Myths and Urban Legends: Doctrine, Verity and Fable in the Organizational and Social Sciences |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFAnkvqD8CgC&amp;pg=PA61 |year=2008 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8058-6237-9 |pages=61–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of this method has been created where a researcher calculates [[confidence interval]]s for each eigenvalue and retains only factors which have the entire confidence interval greater than 1.0.&lt;ref name="Warne, R. T. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warne | first1 = R.

Scree plot:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|first1=Raymond |last1=Cattell

|year=1966
|title=The scree test for the number of factors
|doi=10.1207/s15327906mbr0102_10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cattell scree test plots the components as the X axis and the corresponding [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] as the [[Y-axis]].  As one moves to the right, toward later components, the eigenvalues drop. When the drop ceases and the curve makes an elbow toward less steep decline, Cattell's scree test says to drop all further components after the one starting the elbow.  This rule is sometimes criticised for being amenable to researcher-controlled "[[Wiktionary:fudge factor|fudging]]".  That is, as picking the "elbow" can be subjective because the curve has multiple elbows or is a smooth curve, the researcher may be tempted to set the cut-off at the number of factors desired by their research agenda.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Variance explained criteria: Some researchers simply use the rule of keeping enough factors to account for 90% (sometimes 80%) of the variation.  Where the researcher's goal emphasizes [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] (explaining variance with as few factors as possible), the criterion could be as low as 50%.

===Rotation methods===
The unrotated output maximizes variance accounted for by the first and subsequent factors, and forces the factors to be [[orthogonal]]. This data-compression comes at the cost of having most items load on the early factors, and usually, of having many items load substantially on more than one factor. Rotation serves to make the output more understandable, by seeking so-called "Simple Structure": A pattern of loadings where each item loads strongly on only one of the factors, and much more weakly on the other factors. Rotations can be orthogonal or oblique (allowing the factors to correlate).

[[Varimax rotation]] is an orthogonal rotation of the factor axes to maximize the variance of the squared loadings of a factor (column) on all the variables (rows) in a factor matrix, which has the effect of differentiating the original variables by extracted factor. Each factor will tend to have either large or small loadings of any particular variable. A varimax solution yields results which make it as easy as possible to identify each variable with a single factor. This is the most common rotation option. However, the orthogonality (i.e., independence) of factors is often an unrealistic assumption. Oblique rotations are inclusive of orthogonal rotation, and for that reason, oblique rotations are a preferred method.  Allowing for factors that are correlated with one another is especially applicable in psychometric research, since attitudes, opinions, and intellectual abilities tend to be correlated, and since it would be unrealistic in many situations to assume otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=D.W. |title=In search of underlying dimensions: The use (and abuse) of factor analysis in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=1629–46 |date=December 2002 |doi=10.1177/014616702237645 |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/28/12/1629.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartimax rotation is an orthogonal alternative which minimizes the number of factors needed to explain each variable. This type of rotation often generates a general factor on which most variables are loaded to a high or medium degree. Such a factor structure is usually not helpful to the research purpose.

Equimax rotation is a compromise between varimax and quartimax criteria.

Direct oblimin rotation is the standard method when one wishes a non-orthogonal (oblique) solution – that is, one in which the factors are allowed to be correlated. This will result in higher eigenvalues but diminished [[interpretability]] of the factors. See below.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

Promax rotation is an alternative non-orthogonal (oblique) rotation method which is computationally faster than the direct oblimin method and therefore is sometimes used for very large [[dataset]]s.

==In psychometrics==
{{see also|G factor (psychometrics)|label 1=''g'' factor}}

===History===
[[Charles Spearman]] pioneered the use of factor analysis in the field of psychology and is sometimes credited with the invention of factor analysis. He discovered that school children's scores on a wide variety of seemingly unrelated subjects were positively correlated, which led him to postulate that a general mental ability, or ''g'', underlies and shapes human cognitive performance. His postulate now enjoys broad support in the field of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence research]], where it is known as the [[General intelligence factor|''g'' theory]].

[[Raymond Cattell]] expanded on Spearman's idea of a two-factor theory of intelligence after performing his own tests and factor analysis. He used a multi-factor theory to explain intelligence. Cattell's theory addressed alternative factors in intellectual development, including motivation and psychology. Cattell also developed several mathematical methods for adjusting psychometric graphs, such as his "scree" test and similarity coefficients. His research led to the development of his theory of [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]], as well as his [[16 Personality Factors]] theory of personality. Cattell was a strong advocate of factor analysis and [[psychometrics]]. He believed that all theory should be derived from research, which supports the continued use of empirical observation and objective testing to study human intelligence.

===Applications in psychology===
Factor analysis is used to identify "factors" that explain a variety of results on different tests. For example, intelligence research found that people who get a high score on a test of verbal ability are also good on other tests that require verbal abilities. Researchers explained this by using factor analysis to isolate one factor, often called [[crystallized intelligence]] or verbal intelligence, which represents the degree to which someone is able to solve problems involving verbal skills.

Factor analysis in psychology is most often associated with intelligence research. However, it also has been used to find factors in a broad range of domains such as personality, attitudes, beliefs, etc. It is linked to [[psychometrics]], as it can assess the validity of an instrument by finding if the instrument indeed measures the postulated factors.

===Advantages===
* Reduction of number of variables, by combining two or more variables into a single factor. For example, performance at running, ball throwing, batting, jumping and weight lifting could be combined into a single factor such as general athletic ability. Usually, in an item by people matrix, factors are selected by grouping related items. In the Q factor analysis technique, the matrix is transposed and factors are created by grouping related people: For example, liberals, [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], conservatives and socialists, could form separate groups.
* Identification of groups of inter-related variables, to see how they are related to each other. For example, Carroll used factor analysis to build his [[Three Stratum Theory]]. He found that a factor called "broad visual perception" relates to how good an individual is at visual tasks. He also found a "broad auditory perception" factor, relating to auditory task capability. Furthermore, he found a global factor, called "g" or general intelligence, that relates to both "broad visual perception" and "broad auditory perception". This means someone with a high "g" is likely to have both a high "visual perception" capability and a high "auditory perception" capability, and that "g" therefore explains a good part of why someone is good or bad in both of those domains.

===Disadvantages===
* "...each orientation is equally acceptable mathematically. But different factorial theories proved to differ as much in terms of the orientations of factorial axes for a given solution as in terms of anything else, so that model fitting did not prove to be useful in distinguishing among theories." (Sternberg, 1977&lt;ref name=Sternberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Sternberg |first=R. J. |title=Metaphors of Mind: Conceptions of the Nature of Intelligence |year=1977 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=85–111 |isbn= }}{{Verify source|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This means all rotations represent different underlying processes, but all rotations are equally valid outcomes of standard factor analysis optimization. Therefore, it is impossible to pick the proper rotation using factor analysis alone.
* Factor analysis can be only as good as the data allows. In psychology, where researchers often have to rely on less valid and reliable measures such as self-reports, this can be problematic.
* Interpreting factor analysis is based on using a "heuristic", which is a solution that is "convenient even if not absolutely true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factor Analysis |accessdate=July 22, 2004 |url=http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/Darlington/factor.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818062948/http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/Darlington/factor.htm |archivedate=August 18, 2004 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; More than one interpretation can be made of the same data factored the same way, and factor analysis cannot identify causality.

==Exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis==
{{see also|Principal component analysis|Exploratory factor analysis}}
While [[exploratory factor analysis]] and [[principal component analysis]] are treated as synonymous techniques in some fields of statistics, this has been criticised (e.g. Fabrigar et al., 1999;&lt;ref name=Fabrigar&gt;{{cite web|last=Fabrigar|title=Evaluating the use of exploratory factor analysis in psychological research.|year=1999|url=http://www.statpower.net/Content/312/Handout/Fabrigar1999.pdf|publisher=Psychological Methods|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhr, 2009&lt;ref name=Suhr&gt;{{cite web|last=Suhr|first=Diane|year=2009|title=Principal component analysis vs. exploratory factor analysis|url=http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/203-30.pdf|publisher=SUGI 30 Proceedings|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In factor analysis, the researcher makes the assumption that an underlying causal model exists, whereas PCA is simply a variable reduction technique.&lt;ref name=Sas&gt;{{cite web|title=Principal Components Analysis|url=http://support.sas.com/publishing/pubcat/chaps/55129.pdf|work=SAS Support Textbook|author=SAS Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have argued that the distinctions between the two techniques may mean that there are objective benefits for preferring one over the other based on the analytic goal.  If the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met, then factor analysis will give erroneous results. Factor analysis has been used successfully where adequate understanding of the system permits good initial model formulations. Principal component analysis employs a mathematical transformation to the original data with no assumptions about the form of the covariance matrix. The aim of PCA is to determine a few linear combinations of the original variables that can be used to summarize the data set without losing much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meglen|first1=R.R. |title=Examining Large Databases: A Chemometric Approach Using Principal Component Analysis|journal=Journal of Chemometrics |volume=5 |issue=3|pages=163–179 |date=1991 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180050305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments contrasting PCA and EFA ===
Fabrigar et al. (1999)&lt;ref name=Fabrigar /&gt; address a number of reasons used to suggest that principal components analysis is not equivalent to factor analysis:

# It is sometimes suggested that principal components analysis is computationally quicker and requires fewer resources than factor analysis. Fabrigar et al. suggest that the ready availability of computer resources have rendered this practical concern irrelevant.
# PCA and factor analysis can produce similar results. This point is also addressed by Fabrigar et al.; in certain cases, whereby the communalities are low (e.g., .40), the two techniques produce divergent results. In fact, Fabrigar et al. argue that in cases where the data correspond to assumptions of the common factor model, the results of PCA are inaccurate results.
# There are certain cases where factor analysis leads to 'Heywood cases'. These encompass situations whereby 100% or more of the [[variance]] in a measured variable is estimated to be accounted for by the model. Fabrigar et al. suggest that these cases are actually informative to the researcher, indicating a misspecified model or a violation of the common factor model. The lack of Heywood cases in the PCA approach may mean that such issues pass unnoticed.
# Researchers gain extra information from a PCA approach, such as an individual's score on a certain component – such information is not yielded from factor analysis. However, as Fabrigar et al. contend, the typical aim of factor analysis – i.e. to determine the factors accounting for the structure of the [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] between measured variables – does not require knowledge of factor scores and thus this advantage is negated. It is also possible to compute factor scores from a factor analysis.

=== Variance versus covariance ===
Factor analysis takes into account the [[random error]] that is inherent in measurement, whereas PCA fails to do so. This point is exemplified by Brown (2009),&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=J. D.|title=Principal components analysis and exploratory factor analysis – Definitions, differences and choices.|date=January 2009|url=http://jalt.org/test/PDF/Brown29.pdf|publisher=Shiken: JALT Testing &amp; Evaluation SIG Newsletter|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who indicated that, in respect to the correlation matrices involved in the calculations:

{{Quotation|"In PCA, 1.00s are put in the diagonal meaning that all of the variance in the matrix is to be accounted for (including variance unique to each variable, variance common among variables, and error variance). That would, therefore, by definition, include all of the variance in the variables. In contrast, in EFA, the communalities are put in the diagonal meaning that only the variance shared with other variables is to be accounted for (excluding variance unique to each variable and error variance). That would, therefore, by definition, include only variance that is common among the variables."|Brown (2009)|Principal components analysis and exploratory factor analysis – Definitions, differences and choices}}

For this reason, Brown (2009) recommends using factor analysis when theoretical ideas about relationships between variables exist, whereas PCA should be used if the goal of the researcher is to explore patterns in their data.

===Differences in procedure and results===
The differences between principal components analysis and factor analysis are further illustrated by Suhr (2009):&lt;ref name=Suhr /&gt;
* PCA results in principal components that account for a maximal amount of variance for observed variables; FA account for common variance in the data.
* PCA inserts ones on the diagonals of the correlation matrix; FA adjusts the diagonals of the correlation matrix with the unique factors.
* PCA minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular distance to the component axis; FA estimates factors which influence responses on observed variables.
* The component scores in PCA represent a linear combination of the observed variables weighted by [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]]; the observed variables in FA are linear combinations of the underlying and unique factors.
* In PCA, the components yielded are uninterpretable, i.e. they do not represent underlying ‘constructs’; in FA, the underlying constructs can be labeled and readily interpreted, given an accurate model specification.

==In marketing==
The basic steps are:
* Identify the salient attributes consumers use to evaluate [[product (business)|products]] in this category.
* Use [[quantitative marketing research]] techniques (such as [[statistical survey|surveys]]) to collect data from a sample of potential [[customer]]s concerning their ratings of all the product attributes.
* Input the data into a statistical program and run the factor analysis procedure. The computer will yield a set of underlying attributes (or factors).
* Use these factors to construct [[perceptual mapping|perceptual maps]] and other [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]] devices.

=== Information collection ===
The data collection stage is usually done by marketing research professionals. Survey questions ask the respondent to rate a product sample or descriptions of product concepts on a range of attributes. Anywhere from five to twenty attributes are chosen. They could include things like: ease of use, weight, accuracy, durability, colourfulness, price, or size. The attributes chosen will vary depending on the product being studied. The same question is asked about all the products in the study. The data for multiple products is coded and input into a statistical program such as [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SPSS]], [[SAS System|SAS]], [[Stata]], [[STATISTICA]], JMP, and SYSTAT.

=== Analysis ===
The analysis will isolate the underlying factors that explain the data using a matrix of associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, N. (2012). A comparison of distribution-free and non-distribution free methods in factor analysis. Paper presented at Southwestern Educational Research Association (SERA) Conference 2012, New Orleans, LA (ED529153).&lt;/ref&gt; Factor analysis is an interdependence technique. The complete set of interdependent relationships is examined. There is no specification of dependent variables, independent variables, or causality. Factor analysis assumes that all the rating data on different attributes can be reduced down to a few important dimensions. This reduction is possible because some attributes may be related to each other. The rating given to any one attribute is partially the result of the influence of other attributes. The statistical algorithm deconstructs the rating (called a raw score) into its various components, and reconstructs the partial scores into underlying factor scores. The degree of correlation between the initial raw score and the final factor score is called a ''factor loading''.

===Advantages===
* Both objective and subjective attributes can be used provided the subjective attributes can be converted into scores.
* Factor analysis can identify latent dimensions or constructs that direct analysis may not.
* It is easy and inexpensive.

===Disadvantages===
* Usefulness depends on the researchers' ability to collect a sufficient set of product attributes.  If important attributes are excluded or neglected, the value of the procedure is reduced.
* If sets of observed variables are highly similar to each other and distinct from other items, factor analysis will assign a single factor to them.  This may obscure factors that represent more interesting relationships. {{Clarify|date=May 2012}}
* Naming factors may require knowledge of theory because seemingly dissimilar attributes can correlate strongly for unknown reasons.

==In physical and biological sciences==
Factor analysis has also been widely used in physical sciences such as [[geochemistry]],  [[hydrochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Subbarao |first1=C. |last2=Subbarao |first2=N.V. |last3=Chandu |first3=S.N. |title=Characterisation of groundwater contamination using factor analysis |journal=Environmental Geology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=175–180 |date=December 1996 |doi=10.1007/s002540050091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]], as well as biological sciences, such as [[ecology]], [[molecular biology]] and [[biochemistry]].

In groundwater quality management, it is important to relate the spatial distribution of different chemical
parameters to different possible sources, which have different chemical signatures. For example, a sulfide mine is likely to be associated with high levels of acidity, dissolved sulfates and transition metals. These signatures can be identified as factors through R-mode factor analysis, and the location of possible sources can be suggested by contouring the factor scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Love |first1=D. |last2=Hallbauer |first2=D.K. |last3=Amos |first3=A. |last4=Hranova |first4=R.K. |title=Factor analysis as a tool in groundwater quality management: two southern African case studies |journal=Physics and Chemistry of the Earth |volume=29 |issue= |pages=1135–43 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.pce.2004.09.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geochemistry]], different factors can correspond to different mineral associations, and thus to mineralisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barton |first1=E.S. |last2=Hallbauer |first2=D.K. |title=Trace-element and U—Pb isotope compositions of pyrite types in the Proterozoic Black Reef, Transvaal Sequence, South Africa: Implications on genesis and age |journal=Chemical Geology |volume=133 |issue= |pages=173–199 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(96)00075-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In microarray analysis==
Factor analysis can be used for summarizing high-density [[oligonucleotide]] [[DNA microarrays]] data at probe level for [[Affymetrix]] GeneChips. In this case, the latent variable corresponds to the [[RNA]] concentration in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sepp |last1=Hochreiter |first2=Djork-Arné |last2=Clevert |first3=Klaus |last3=Obermayer |title=A new summarization method for affymetrix probe level data |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=943–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16473874 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btl033 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/8/943.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Factor analysis has been implemented in several statistical analysis programs since the 1980s:

*[[JMP (statistical software)]]
*[[Python (programming language)|Python]]: module [[Scikit-learn]]&lt;ref&gt;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FactorAnalysis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Washington Pierce''' (January 11, 1872 – August 25, 1956) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]]. He was a professor of [[physics]] at [[Harvard University]] and [[inventor]] in the development of electronic [[telecommunication]]s.

The son of a Texas cattle rancher, he distinguished himself in school at [[Taylor, Texas|Taylor]] and in the [[University of Texas]] before beginning his enduring relationship with Harvard in 1898. He wrote three innovative texts, many learned papers, and was assigned 53 patents. The most notable is the single-stage [[crystal oscillator]] circuit, which became the touchstone of the electronics communication art. Süsskind says that he was "an exceedingly warm and droll individual, much revered by his students."

==Biography==

===Youth===
G. W. Pierce was born January 11, 1872, in [[Webberville, Texas]]. He frequently recalled in later life “drawing water with leaky buckets from deep wells for thirsty mules” as a prod that motivated his intensity in study. At the University of Texas he had [[Alexander Macfarlane]] as teacher and mentor: they co-authored a paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v49/n1260/pdf/049179b0.pdf Dielectric Strength] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 48:181 (#1260)&lt;/ref&gt; for the first volume of the ''[[Physical Review]]''. He taught at Dallas High School (1896-7) and worked in the clerk’s office of the [[Bastrop County, Texas|Bastrop County]] Court before winning his 1898 scholarship to Harvard. With a thesis on measurement of wavelength of shortwaves he gained the Ph.D. in 1900. After a European study-tour that included some exposure to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], he was invited to begin instructing at Harvard. He was instrumental in forming the [[Wicht Club]] (1903–1911), a peer-group dedicated to continuing their learning even though teaching.

===Family===
G. W. Pierce was the middle son of three. He shared his name with his father, but there seems to have been no use of the traditional Sr. and Jr. appendages. In 1904 he married Florence Goodwin of [[Saxonville, Massachusetts]]. Though they produced no offspring, they enjoyed some family life with [[Walter Bradford Cannon|Cornelia and Walter Cannon]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] physiologist, who drew the Pierces to [[Franklin, New Hampshire]]. For example, Cornelia introduced George to portrait, landscape, and abstract [[painting]]. This medium became a strong method of expression for him. After Florence died in 1945, Pierce found a second companionship with Helen Russell of [[Sanbornton, New Hampshire]]. His first sign of faltering health came with a minor [[stroke]] in 1945, but he carried on until a series of major strokes killed him about a decade later. He died on August 25, 1956.

Pierce apparently was not related to the award-winning [[electronics engineer]] [[John R. Pierce]].

==Professor/Inventor==
G. W. Pierce had an eye for finding the main sticking point in physical processes. For electronics he saw that [[resonance]] was a key phenomenon. His five-part series "Experiments on resonance in wireless telegraph circuits in [[Physical Review]] (1904-7) are evidence of his leadership. By 1910 his first textbook ''Principles of Wireless Telegraphy'' was published. It is in this text, and others by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], that the term [[modulation]] is first used to describe imprinting an audio wave onto a high-frequency [[carrier wave]] by variation of amplitude of the carrier.&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Sarkar et al. (2006) ''History of Wireless'' page 104, {{ISBN|0-471-71814-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 he worked with A. E. Kennelly on motional impedance (see below). In 1914 he was assigned the directorship of the Cruft Physics Laboratory at Harvard. Then in 1917 he gained the rank of [[professor]].

The year 1920 saw two important developments: his second text ''Electric Oscillations and Electric Waves'' was published. And most significantly, he followed up on an innovation of [[Walter Guyton Cady]] of Wesleyan University, using [[quartz crystal]] to stabilise frequency of electrical oscillation. In early attempts, radio communication was severely handicapped by the lack of reliable fixed-frequency operation, and Pierce saw the potential for the quartz-governed circuit. Cady’s circuit used multiple triode [[vacuum tube]]s, and Pierce was able to reduce this to a single tube. &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Parzen (1983) ''Design of Crystal and Other Harmonic Oscillators'', Chapter 5: The Family of Pierce, Colpitts, and Clapp Oscillators, Chapter 7: Normal Pierce Oscillator, Chapter 8: Isolated Pierce Oscillator&lt;/ref&gt; Insights such as this one resulted in [[patent]] assignments, for which Pierce then sold license to use, yielding him the capital to purchase vacation homes in Franklin, New Hampshire, and [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

===Motional impedance===
In their laboratory,  Pierce and [[Arthur E. Kennelly|A. E. Kennelly]] undertook an experiment measuring the change in [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of [[telephone]] receivers over a range of audio frequencies when the diaphragm was clamped by finger or quill insert. At each frequency the receiver [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] were measured and impedance computed, then the difference of free versus clamped impedance plotted as a complex number, or point in the impedance plane. For every receiver, the range of frequencies yields a series of con-cyclic points. The phenomenon was called "motional impedance" and the circle a "motional impedance circle".&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Pierce &amp; [[Arthur E. Kennelly]] (1912) "Motional Impedance", ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 48:113-51&lt;/ref&gt; This example of circular phenomena in device-impedance became so familiar, eventually, that the [[Smith Chart]] was introduced to provide a bounded universe (or chart) for such circles.

===Later years===
In 1921 he was made Rumford Professor of Physics; in 1929 he was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor|Medal of Honor]] of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (I.R.E.). He continued to file patents, and he reported on [[crystal oscillator]]s in the ''Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' in 1923 and 1925. He retired in 1940, publishing his text ''Song of Insects'' in 1943. It made an analysis of the [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] "songs". In same year the [[Franklin Institute]] awarded him its [[Franklin Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fi.edu/laureates/george-washington-pierce Franklin Medal for George Washington Pierce] from [[Franklin Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional history ==
In 1963, approximately fifteen pioneer [[Ghana]]ian architects who had trained in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] met to officially plan and formalise the architectural practice, education and accreditation through a professional institution, the Ghana Institute of Architects (GIA) as the successor to Gold Coast Society of Architects (GCSA), a [[social club]] for [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]-based architects founded between July and August 1954 during the British colonial era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These architects included T. S. Clerk, D.K. Dawson, J.S.K. Frimpong, P.N.K., Turkson, J. Owusu-Addo, O.T. Agyeman, A. K. Amartey, E.K. Asuako, W.S. Asamoah, M. Adu-Donkor, K.G. Kyei, C. Togobo, V. Adegbite, M. Adu Bedu and E. Kingsley Osei.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; T.S Clerk was appointed the sole architect at that meeting to draft the first constitution of the Institute.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He subsequently submitted his proposals and the constitutional draft and its [[by-law]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s he authored were discussed, approved and adopted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The founding members of the erstwhile GCSA were mostly British expatriate architects who were employees of the colonial civil service and attached to the Public Works Department (P.W.D.).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This group consisted of G.S Knight (President), Arthur Lindsay (Honorary Secretary), B.A.W Trevallion, (Honorary Treasurer), Kenneth M. Scott (Hon. Public Relations Officer), E.W Williamson, A. Williamson, Max Garlach, G.C Harris, A.K Sulton, M.R. Griffiths, K. Wood, H. J. Pine, G.P Smith and L.P Williams.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The GCSA meetings were held at the International Club located on the Knutsford Avenue in [[Accra]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Concurrently, a pre-independence indigenous architectural association, the ''Space Club'' was set up by other Western-trained Ghanaian professionals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This crop of early Ghanaian architects also doubled as external examiners at the Department of Architecture at the [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]] (KNUST) in [[Kumasi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
=== Inauguration ===
The Institute’s official inaugural ceremony was on Friday 11 December 1964 at 20:30 GMT at the [[Commonwealth Hall Legon|Commonwealth Hall]] of the [[University of Ghana]], [[Legon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The first executives were inducted during the event with Theodore S. Clerk being elected the first president Ghana Institute of Architects, after which he gave his acceptance speech. Earlier, T. S. Clerk had been the president of the Gold Coast Society of Architects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other first officers of the Institute  elected include P.N.K. Turkson, (Vice-President), Victor Adegbite (Honorary Treasurer), O.T. Agyeman (Honorary Secretary), J.S.K Frimpong, John Owusu-Addo, W.S. Asamoah, E.K. Asuako, A.K. Amartey and M. Adu-Donkor as Members.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; E.K. Bensah, the then Minister of Works and Housing was the Chairman of the inaugural event, assited by Nana Kobina Nketia IV, Director, Institute of Art and Culture, [[R. P. Baffour|R.P. Baffour]], Vice-Chancellor, KNUST and G.Y. Odoi, Managing Director, Ghana National Construction Corporation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first Fellowships of the GIA were conferred on  E.K. Bensah, R.P Baffour, L. K. Apaloo and G.Y. Odoi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Ghana Police Service|Ghana Police]] Band provided music for the occasion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Governance and charter ==
The GIA has the backing of the Government of Ghana, through the edict, ''Architects Decree, NLCD 357, of 1969''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Ghana Institute of Architects is a member of the  African Union of Architects, [[Commonwealth Association of Architects]] and the [[International Union of Architects]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Institute holds Annual General Meetings (AGM) to elect its executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/849834/ghana-institute-of-architects-urged-members-to-uphold-the-tr.html|title=Ghana Institute Of Architects Urged Members To Uphold The Truth|work=Modern Ghana|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghana Institute of Architects Membership Charter states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constructionreviewonline.com/2017/05/registration-with-the-ghana-institute-of-architects/|title=Registration with the Ghana Institute of Architects|last=kiganda|first=Antony|date=2017-05-08|work=Construction Review Online|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development context ==
=== Colonial period ===
The founding of the colonial architectural society, the Gold Coast Society of Architects had ties to the establishment of the [[College of Art and Built Environment (KNUST)|School of Architecture, Building Technology and Planning]] at the KNUST in 1952 when a feasibility team made up of British, German and American architects and academics arrived in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The committee included Britons, Charles Hobbis, Tafi Evans and Miles Danby; German professor, Lutz Christians who lived and lectured at the KNUST until 1970s, and American Labelle Prussin who wrote the first book on architecture in Ghana ''“Architecture of Northern Ghana”'' and was among a group that designed the housing units for displaced communities arising from the construction of the [[Akosombo Dam]] project on the [[Lake Volta|Volta Lake]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prussin then worked with the Housing and Planning Department of the Faculty of Architecture at KNUST and later became a professor of architecture at an American university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under British rule, public building projects in the Gold Coast colony were designed by British architects. These projects include the design of the University of Ghana’s classical [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] buildings led by a [[Cyprus]]-based British [[architectural firm]]; Supreme Court of Ghana buildings, the Old Parliament House and the General Post Office in Accra.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The now demolished Ambassador Hotel, present site of the [[Mövenpick Hotels &amp; Resorts|Movenpick Hotel]] in Accra and the [[Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital]] in [[Kumasi]] were both designed by Paton, a licentiate of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the colonial period, Gold-Coast-based British architectural firms included Kenneth Scott and Partners; Nickson and Boris as well as James Cubitt, Scott and Partners that designed the Mechanical Engineering Workshop building of the KNUST. Other British architects who were practitioners of the then nascent academic field of “tropical architecture” were Jane Drew and Max Fry who designed the buildings of Bechem Teacher Training College in the [[Tano South District]] of the [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong Ahafo Region]] in addition to those at the [[Prempeh College]] and the [[Opoku Ware School]], both in Kumasi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Post-independent Ghana ===
During the [[Kwame Nkrumah]] administration in the 1950s, several architectural engineers were sent to the newly independent Ghana by [[Yugoslavia]]’s [[Josip Broz Tito]] as a sign of friendship between the two nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These architects from the former [[Eastern Bloc]] designed buildings using an international modernist approach which was considered globally trendy in that period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such building designs included the Vice Chancellor's Lodge and the Senior Staff Club at the KNUST as well as various  halls of residence at the KNUST such as Unity Hall, the eight-storey annex blocks of the Independence, Republic, Queen's and University (Katanga) Halls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1960, Kwame Nkrumah appointed Theodore Clerk, the GIA’s first president as the Chief Architect of the then newly created [[Tema Development Corporation]] (TDC) to develop the satellite city of Tema.  When Clerk was elevated to the position of the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation, another Ghanaian pioneer architect and GIA co-founder, Victor Adegbite became the chief architect of the TDC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The American architect, Max Bond who returned to his homeland after the 1966 [[Coup d'état|coup d’état]], designed [[Bolgatanga]] Regional Library.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/In-praise-of-pioneer-architects-461011|title=In praise of pioneer architects|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808151844/http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/In-praise-of-pioneer-architects-461011|archive-date=8 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond later taught and worked in architecture schools in New York and was instrumental in the design of the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change|Martin Luther King Centre]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and the new [[African American Museum of Iowa|African-American Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. John Owusu Addo, a professor at the Department of Architecture at the KNUST and also the first Ghanaian native to head the department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For about twenty years, Anthony D. C. Hyland and William “Bill” Hill also taught in the same department. The German architect, Hannah Schreckenback worked at the Public Works Department (PWD) and the AESC before joining the faculty at the Department of Architecture at the KNUST in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Schreckenback wrote a construction design textbook still used by students of architecture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1977, the GIA took part in the general strike and  withdrawal of services by the Professional Bodies Association of Ghana, of which the GIA was a member.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Yaw Asante, the only non-architect to become architecture department chair at the KNUST supervised the expansion of department’s infrastructure using the then novel idea of “internally generated funds”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The building designed under his tenure is currently used as the sixth-year architectural design studio for the M. Arch II programme which has replaced the former [[postgraduate diploma]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2012, under the auspices of the KNUST, ArchiAfrika, a network connecting architectural scholars and professionals in the [[built environment]], launched the ArchiAfrika Educational Network, a partnership of architecture schools across the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noma.net/article/124/happenings/news-archive/network-of-african-architecture-schools-launched-in-accra-ghana|title=:Network of African Architecture Schools Launched in Accra, Ghana|website=www.noma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314232855/http://www.noma.net/article/124/happenings/news-archive/network-of-african-architecture-schools-launched-in-accra-ghana|archive-date=14 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Accra was spearheaded by an early Ghanaian architect of the Ghana Institute of Architects, David Wilberforce Kwame Dawson. Born on 6 February 2009. he was one of four architects at independence in 1957.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Voice from afar|last=Asante|first=K. B.|date=2 February 2009|work=Daily Graphic|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially trained as a sanitary health inspector, he joined the Sekondi-Takoradi Municipal Council. Gifted in technical drawing, his superiors transferred him to the Drawing Office of the Railway and Harbour Administration as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; He studied by correspondence at Bennet College in England before winning a colonial scholarship in 1944 to [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] where he graduated in architecture in 1946. He became an Associate of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] later that year. He returned to Accra in 1948 and became an Assistant Town Planning Officer at the Public Works Department, where he designed the Roof Loan Scheme.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Dawson became the Director of Rural Housing in 1956 and working in tandem with Ghana’s first leader, Kwame Nkrumah, R. P. Baffour, the first Vice Chancellor of the KNUST, engineer, J. S. Annan and others he contributed to rural development, architecture and town planning.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The '''Global Learning Opportunities in Business Education''' ('''GLOBE''') program is an undergraduate business program that sends 54 elite students to study at [[Copenhagen Business School]] (CBS) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) in [[Hong Kong]], and the [[Kenan–Flagler Business School]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina| Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States]]. 

At each respective university, eighteen students are selected based on their academic achievements, personalities, and previous life experiences. After being selected, the students spend a year and a half traveling the world, networking internationally, and gaining a new perspective on the business world. During the first year of the program, students study at CBS in the fall and CUHK in the spring. Following the semester in Hong Kong, students generally pursue competitive internships with companies throughout the world. The final semester is then spent at the University of North Carolina. Following completion of the program, students return to their respective universities, where they spend one final semester completing their degree.

As of September 2017, 10 batches of GLOBE students have graduated the program. Batch 11 is in the midst of its third and final semester while batch 12 is in its first.

== Ranking and reputation ==
The GLOBE program combines international business studies with real-life international experience, giving GLOBE Scholars unique perspectives in their future business endeavors. At CBS, only students majoring in International Business are eligible for program admission. At UNC, sophomores apply for the GLOBE program when applying to the Kenan-Flagler Business School. At CUHK, only students majoring in Global Business Studies, one of the most competitive undergraduate programs in Hong Kong, are eligible to apply. At each university, the GLOBE administration team selects students through a rigorous application and extensive interview process to maximize student and program compatibility.

The three universities at which GLOBE students study all receive top rankings on their respective continents. In 2012, CUHK was ranked fifth in Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2012|title=QS University Rankings: Asia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS was ranked as the third-best international business school in the world after Harvard and London Business School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.cbs.dk/about_cbs_campus/quality/accreditation_ranking |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109113010/http://uk.cbs.dk/about_cbs_campus/quality/accreditation_ranking |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kenan-Flagler Business School at UNC was ranked sixth-best business school in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Programs/BSBA/careerServices/rank.cfm|title=HTML 404 - Page Not Found|website=www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206124015/http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Programs/BSBA/careerServices/rank.cfm|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==
During the course of the program all the GLOBE students live and study together. Students also take the opportunity to travel extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States.

== Study trips ==
The third batch (graduated December 9, 2009) visited Brussels, Berlin, Shanghai, Tokyo, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, and New York City on its study trips. The students visited companies such as Deutsche Bahn in Berlin, Toyota City in Japan, and Standard &amp; Poor's in New York City.
Batch eight (graduating December 14, 2014) has visited Brussels and Berlin, and 10 days are going to be spent in Indonesia visiting and solving local company issues. In the US, there will be a study trip to Research Triangle Park and a more extensive one in the late fall.

== Media coverage ==
Although still a young program, the GLOBE program has been featured in numerous major business publications around the world. The program was referenced in an article about students' perceptions of companies in the ''Financial Times'' and ''BusinessWeek''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/nov2009/bs2009116_361652.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The program has also been the focus of articles in business media such as the Danish newspaper ''Børsen''.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.cbs.dk/uddannelser/bachelor/bacheloruddannelser/bsc_in_international_business/hoejreboks/nyheder/globe_delivers_says_danish_business_daily/(language)/eng-GB&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlingske Business (Danish newspaper) ran a series of articles about the program in the fall, 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.business.dk/?article=27332801-Fremtidens-globale-topledere-er-samlet-paa-CBS|title=Berlingske Business - Seneste nyheder fra erhvervslivet på business.dk|website=Berlingske Business - Seneste nyheder fra erhvervslivet på business.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harcourt Assessment''' was a company that published and distributed educational and psychological assessment tools and therapy resources and provided educational assessment and data management services for national, state, district and local assessments. On January 30, 2008, Harcourt Assessment was merged into [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]]'s [[Pearson Assessment &amp; Information|Assessment &amp; Information]] group after being acquired from [[Reed Elsevier]] for $950 million.&lt;ref name="pearson2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearsonassessments.com/haiweb/Cultures/en-US/Site/Community/PostSecondary/NewsEvents/PressReleases/NewsRelease013008.htm |title=Pearson Completes Acquisition of Harcourt Assessment |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |publisher=Assessment &amp; Information group of Pearson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Harcourt Assessment's history dates to the early part of the 20th century. Although the company name derives from [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace &amp; Company]], which was established in 1919, the corporate heritage goes back to 1905 and the founding of [[World Book Company]]. Many of the educational products produced by Harcourt Assessment originated at World Book. The [[psychological assessment]]s originated at [[The Psychological Corporation]], which was founded in 1921.

===Harcourt Brace &amp; Company (1919)===
[[Alfred Harcourt]] and [[Donald Brace]] were friends at [[Columbia University]] in New York, and both worked for [[Henry Holt &amp; Company]] before founding their own publishing company in 1919. [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace &amp; Company]] published the works of a number of world-renowned writers, including [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Thurber]], [[George Orwell]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]].

By 1960, Harcourt Brace led the market in high school textbook publishing, but had little presence in the elementary school market. That year, [[William Jovanovich]], who had become president of the company in 1954, took the company public and merged Harcourt Brace &amp; Company with World Book Company to create Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc.  This was a strategic move that had a long-term impact on the company because World Book was an established elementary textbook publisher and a test publisher.

In 1970, the company became known as Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), with William Jovanovich as chairman. That same year, the company acquired The Psychological Corporation. Under Jovanovich’s leadership, the company diversified into non-publishing businesses such as insurance and business consulting. It also bought several theme parks—including [[SeaWorld]], which it acquired in 1976 for $46 million. The company divested its theme park division in 1989 for $1.1 billion.

===World Book Company (1905)===
World Book Company opened its first office in [[Manila]] in 1905 and published English-language educational materials for schools in the [[Philippines]]. The company later moved to [[New York City]], where it became a test publisher. Much of the company’s success was based on the work of Arthur S. Otis, who was best known for the intelligence tests he developed for the U.S. Army. Millions of World War I draftees took [[Otis-Lennon School Ability Test|Otis’ tests]].

World Book Company became the first publisher of group-administered tests measuring mental ability when it published Otis’ Group Intelligence Scale in 1918. Otis joined World Book in 1921. By the time World Book merged with Harcourt Brace in 1960, it had a portfolio of educational tests, including the [[Stanford Achievement Test]] (1923), the Metropolitan Achievement Test (1932) and the Otis Mental Ability Test (1936).

World Book Company was not related to [[World Book Encyclopedia|World Book, Inc.]], the [[Chicago]]-based publisher of [[encyclopedia]]s and other reference books.

===The Psychological Corporation (1921)===
Psychologist [[James McKeen Cattell]] founded The Psychological Corporation in New York in 1921. Cattell was a leading figure in psychology and was the president of the [[American Psychological Association]], as well as founder and editor of [[Scientific monthly|Scientific Monthly]] and head of [[Columbia University]]’s psychology department. At age 60, when Columbia dismissed him because of his public opposition to the draft in World War I, Cattell decided to pursue his interest in publishing. He joined forces with two former graduate students, [[Robert S. Woodworth|Robert Sessions Woodworth]] and [[Edward Thorndike|Edward Lee Thorndike]].

Both were eminent psychologists, and Thorndike was regarded as the foremost authority on the analysis and measurement of learning. The three men started a business to market psychological tests and related materials to educational, corporate and government clients. In 1939, the company published the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scales. [[David Wechsler]] was a former student of Woodworth at Columbia University.
 
In 1970, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich acquired The Psychological Corporation and, in 1976, merged its educational testing department, acquired from World Book Company in 1960, into The Psychological Corporation.

In the 1980s and 1990s, The Psychological Corporation (TPC) expanded through a number of acquisitions. In 1986, the company acquired Merrill Publishing’s test division with its portfolio of tests for language, speech and hearing. In 1993, it acquired Cognitronics Corporation. In 1994, the company acquired Communication Skill Builders/Therapy Skill Builders and its therapy products for speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists and physical therapists.

In 1983, The Psychological Corporation moved from New York to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. When the company moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]], in 1985, it established its own operational services, including customer service, warehouse, distribution, information technology, scoring and reporting services.

In order to establish a stronger identity for its educational assessment products, and to link them more closely to the Harcourt name, The Psychological Corporation’s education testing unit was branded as Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement in 1995. The name was shortened in 1999 to Harcourt Educational Measurement.

===Harcourt General, Harcourt, Inc. and Harcourt Assessment, Inc.===
In 1991, General Cinema Corporation, a diversified company that operated retailers such as [[Neiman Marcus]] and [[Bergdorf Goodman]], as well as a national chain of movie theaters, acquired Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for more than $1.5 billion. In 1993, General Cinema Corporation renamed itself Harcourt General and restored the publishing division’s name to the historic Harcourt Brace &amp; Company. At the end of the year, Harcourt General divested its cinema division.

In 1999, Harcourt General divested its retail division and shortened the publishing division’s name to Harcourt, Inc. That same year, Harcourt, Inc. adopted the brand name Harcourt Assessment for its testing businesses. At the time, Harcourt Assessment comprised The Psychological Corporation, which was known as the clinical division, and Harcourt Educational Measurement, which was known as the education division.

In late 2003, the testing business legally changed its name to Harcourt Assessment, Inc., and unified its two divisions into one operating company.  The company retired the two division names – Harcourt Educational Measurement and The Psychological Corporation – although it retained “PsychCorp” as a brand imprint for select products.

===Reed Elsevier Group plc===
In 2001, the Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] acquired Harcourt General and Harcourt, Inc., including the business then known as Harcourt Assessment, Inc.  Harcourt Assessment encountered two straight years with mass layoffs as a result of poor management and a failed strategy to expand into the state assessment market. In January 2006, more than 70 workers were laid off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2006/02/13/story7.html Harcourt's recent job cuts due to competitive testing market], ''San Antonio Business Journal'', February 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the layoffs, division president Jeff Galt left the company, and was replaced by [[Michael E. Hansen]], who moved from [[Bertelsmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2006/01/30/daily31.html Harcourt Assessment CEO steps down], ''San Antonio Business Journal'', February 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Aug. 7, 2006) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115491671824028439 Who's News Noted …] Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Then again in January 2007, 122 workers lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011807.harcourtcuts.EN.524652b0.html Harcourt Assessment cutting staff by 10 percent], ''San Antonio Express-News'', January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2007, Reed Elsevier announced its intention to sell its education arm, Harcourt Education, of which Harcourt Assessment is a part. According to Reed Chief Executive Crispin Davis, "This is essentially a strategic decision that we want to focus more sharply on our three existing businesses ... with better growth rates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/02/15/uk-reed-results-idUKWLB502120070215?pageNumber=2 |title= Reed Elsevier to sell education arm |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |format= |work= |publisher= Reuters |date=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearson Education plc===
On May 4, 2007, [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], the international education and information company, announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearson.com/about-us/education/announcements/?i=352 |title= Pearson acquires Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |format= |work= |publisher=Pearson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the two units left Reed Elsevier with most of Harcourt Education still to sell, comprising its large U.S. textbook business and a number of supplemental publishing businesses. Pearson already held a market-leading position in the U.S. textbook market and would not be interested in the main Harcourt business on account of regulatory concerns. Reed stated that it expected to complete the sale in the second half of the year and would use the funds raised to return cash to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nic |last=Fildes |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pearson pays $950m for two of Reed's Harcourt Education units |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2514348.ece |work= |publisher=The Independent |date=May 5, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180728/http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2514348.ece |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2008, Pearson completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, Inc., having obtained all necessary regulatory approvals.&lt;ref name="pearson2008" /&gt; Doug Kubach, president of Pearson's [[Pearson Assessment &amp; Information|Assessment &amp; Information]] group, led the integration of Harcourt Assessment into Pearson.

'''Harriet Edquist''' is an Australian curator, and Professor of Architectural History in the School of Architecture and Design at [[RMIT University]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/e/edquist-professor-harriet|title=Staff Profile: Professor Harriet Edquist|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born and educated in Melbourne, she has both published widely on and created numerous exhibitions in the field of Australian (in particular, Victorian) architecture, art and design history. She also contributes to the production of Australian architectural knowledge as a director of the RMIT Design Archives and is a member of the Design Research Institute at RMIT University.

== Education ==
Edquist graduated from [[St Catherine's School, Toorak|St Catherine's School]], Toorak in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nil Magnum Nisi Bonum|url = http://www.stcatherines.net.au/nil-magnum-nisi-bonum|website = St Catherines School|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then studied for a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Classics from [[Monash University]], and completed a PhD in Architectural History at RMIT University.

== Academic career ==
Edquist began her teaching career as a lecturer in the Department of Fine Arts, [[University of Melbourne]], and specialised in Renaissance and modern art history.

In 1987, she joined RMIT University as editor (with [[Karen Burns (academic)|Karen Burns]]) of ''Transition: Discourse on Architecture''; a quarterly magazine produced by the Department of Architecture from 1979 until 2000 and dedicated to discourse on contemporary architectural practice and theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Companion City {{!}} ACCA|url = https://www.accaonline.org.au/exhibition/companion-city|website = www.accaonline.org.au|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving from 1987 to 1991, the partnership of Edquist and Karen Burns stretched the critical range of this publication, arguing - as they wrote in their editorial for ''Transition 38 -'' that architectural discourse could extend "the boundaries of discussion to include all the arts and observations on the society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sahanz2015.be.unsw.edu.au/papers/Sawyer_Call-and-Response.pdf|title = Call-and-Response: Group Formation and Agency enacted through an Architectural Magazine, its Letters and Editorials|last = Sawyer|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Architecture Institutions and Change, Proceedings of SAHANZ|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 11 October 2015|volume = 32|isbn = 978 0 646 94298 8|page = 553}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were both subsequently replaced as editors of ''Transition'' following a controversial 're-setting' of the publication's agenda, which was played out publicly through editorials and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sahanz2015.be.unsw.edu.au/papers/Sawyer_Call-and-Response.pdf|title = Call-and-Response: Group Formation and Agency enacted through an Architectural Magazine, its Letters and Editorials|last = Sawyer|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Architecture Institutions and Change, Proceedings of SAHANZ|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 11 October 2015|isbn = 978 0 646 94298 8|volume = 32|page = 554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Edquist was appointed lecturer in Architectural History by RMIT University and from 2001 to 2007 served as Head of the School of Architecture and Design. She now holds the positions of Professor of Architectural History at RMIT University, and director of the RMIT Design Archives.&lt;ref name="rmit.edu.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff%2Dcontacts/academic%2Dstaff/e/edquist%2Dprofessor%2Dharriet|title = RMIT Academic Profile: Professor Harriet Edquist|date = |accessdate = 11 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently a member (and was the past President from 2003 to 2005) of [[SAHANZ]], the Society of Architectural Historians Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About SAHANZ|url = http://www.sahanz.net/about/index.html#lifemembers|website = www.sahanz.net|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edquist is also a member of [http://docomomoaustralia.com.au Docomomo Australia].

In June 2015, she became the Foundation President of Automotive Historians Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OFFICE BEARERS/ COMMITTEE|url = http://www.autohistoriansaustralia.org/new-page-1/|website = Automotive Historians Australia Inc|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organisation focusses on Australian automative history and was launched alongside '''Shifting Gear: Design, Innovation and the Australian car''', an exhibition curated by Edquist in conjunction with David Hurlston.

The '''Institut National des Arts de Bamako (INA)''', is a national school for the arts in [[Bamako]], [[Mali]]. It was the only school of its kind in Mali until 2004.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19301944.2014.889952 | title=An Institution for Post-Independence Art: US-RDA Cultural Policy and Encadrement Malien at the Institut National des Arts | author=Davisa, Paul R. | journal=Critical Interventions: Journal of African Art History and Visual Culture | year=2014 | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=96–118 | doi=10.1080/19301944.2014.889952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally set up to train Sudanese artisans, it now offers courses in jewellery making and design, illustration, painting, sculpture, photography, music, and theatre. It has produced many of Mali’s most well-known artists and has hosted numerous exhibitions, workshops, and performances.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://museum.msu.edu/ProgramsandPartnerships/Educational/TheTransformationOfWestAfricanTextiles/About/Essays/Contemporary_Art_of_Africa/ | title=Threads of Change: the Transformation of West African Textiles - Contemporary Art in Mali | publisher=Michigan State University Museum | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Keller, Candace M. (Ph.D.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==
Over the history of its existence, many changes have affected the institute, including course offerings, faculty, and its name.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Since its inception it has been known by many previous names including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artisanat-bamako.com/Historique.html | title=History | publisher=artisanat-bamako.com | language=French | accessdate=24 April 2016 | archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aEZpkLRDMyYJ:www.artisanat-bamako.com/Historique.html&amp;num=1&amp;strip=1&amp;vwsrc=0 | archivedate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konaté"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.memoireonline.com/06/09/2105/m_les-musees-les-galeries-et-le-village-artisanal-de-Bamako-synergie-pour-lepanouissement6.html | title=Les musées, les galeries et le village artisanal de Bamako, une synergie pour l'epanouissement du tourisme malien | publisher=Memoire Online | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Konaté, Mamadou | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* (1933) Ecole Artisanale du Soudan
* (1948) Maison des artisans du Soudan
* (1963) Institut National des Arts (Law No. 63-98 / ANRM)&lt;ref name="Konaté"/&gt; 
* (1986) Maison des artisans du Mali (Law No. 86-93 / ANRM)&lt;ref name="Konaté"/&gt; 
* (2006) Maison des Artisans de Bamako

Notably, any reference to Sudan was removed from its name, reflecting the changing politics and identity of the country, as the former Sudanese Republic became the Republic of Mali in 1960.

== Modern times ==
In 2013, a large fire destroyed many of the craftsmen's shops and wares in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.journaldumali.com/article.php?aid=7559 | title=Incendie à l'Artisanat: des millions de pertes | publisher=DANGASSA Media | work=journaldumali.com | date=16 December 2013 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=d'ALMEIDA, Célia | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, it was run by a management committee, elected for three years and contained 89 souks and workshops for many crafts.&lt;ref name="Konaté"/&gt;

Commonly tourist guides will recommend a visit to the area to view the craftsmen working and to buy crafts from the market. Accordingly, it receives more than sixty thousand (60,000) tourists annually.&lt;ref name="Konaté"/&gt;

* [[Habib Dembélé]] (actor)
* Ismael Diabate (artist)

The '''International Young Physicists’ Tournament''', '''IYPT''', is one of the World's most respected and prestigious&lt;ref name="Haskell"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.880414 Hugh Haskell, Charles Britton, and Ronald Edge. A different kind of physics competition—the IYPT]. The Physic Teacher 38, 1, 22 (Jan. 2000) {{ISSN|0031-921X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2169438 Toni Feder. High Schoolers Debate Physics at International Tournament. Physics Today, Vol. 58  of Issue 12, p. 31 (Dec. 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; annual [[physics]] competitions centered on 17 non-examination research problems that are published yearly in late July. During the tournament, discussion-based sessions called ''Physics Fights'' are conducted and the performances of the teams are judged by expert physicists.

The IYPT is a week-long event in which currently around 150 international pre-university contestants participate. The participants present and discuss their research projects at the events that share common features with thesis defense or scientific conferences. The teams switch roles and take floor as Reporters, Opponents and Reviewers, thus learning about [[peer review]] early on in their school years.

The concept was conceived in 1979 by Evgeny Yunosov and was run as the [[Russian Young Physicists' Tournament]], an event localised to Russia.  He went on to initiate the first IYPT in 1988.

'''James Putnam''' is an independent curator and writer best known for his creative, innovative approach{{According to whom|date=May 2018}} to curating and juxtaposing contemporary art with historic museum collections.

==Life and work==
James Putnam was born in Walthamstow, London. He attended the City of London School and went on to study History of Art at the University of London. Putnam became a curator in the Egyptian Antiquities Department of the [[British Museum]], and in 1994, he initiated and organized the ‘Time Machine’ exhibition juxtaposing the work of contemporary artists with ancient sculptures. He subsequently curated a new version of the exhibition at the [[Museo Egizio]], Turin, and many other museum interventions at the British Museum with works by [[Henry Moore]], [[Richard Wentworth (artist)|Richard Wentworth]] and [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]]. His uses of ‘museum intervention’, ‘museum effect’ and ‘the museum as medium’ in the writings and curatorial statements have sparked research interests in museology and had profound impact on curatorial literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Caitlin|first=Hanbury,|title=Defining Museum Intervention: An Analysis of James Putnam's Time Machine|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|url=http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/312/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://museumcultures.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dannybirchall_institutionandintervention.pdf|title=INSTITUTION AND INTERVENTION: ARTISTS’ PROJECTS IN OBJECT-BASED MUSEUMS|last=Birchall|first=Danny|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peteratkins.com.au/library/file/Preview%20of%20%E2%80%9CMuseum%20Effect%201.jpg%E2%80%9D.pdf|title=The Museum Effect|last=Atkins|first=Peter|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pablohelguera.net/2002/04/the-museum-as-medium-2002/|title=Pablo Helguera  » Blog Archive   » The Museum as Medium (2002)|website=pablohelguera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities in the early 1990s included a stint as a visual artist and a musician when he formed the experimental rock band GOD together with Phil Gray &amp; Richard Dyer to tour UK extensively before disbanding. The band reformed in 2015 to play a gig at the Red Gallery during the [[Frieze Art Fair]].

Between 1999 and 2003, he founded and directed the British Museum’s Contemporary Arts &amp; Cultures Programme, which staged performances and talks by [[Tracey Emin]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Cai Guo-Qiang]], [[Antony Gormley]], [[Grayson Perry]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Gavin Turk]], [[Jake and Dinos Chapman|Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman]] and [[Michael Craig-Martin|Michael Craig Martin]].

In the summer of 2016, he co-curated ‘Daydreaming with [[Stanley Kubrick|Stanley Kubrick’]] at Somerset House with musician and DJ James Lavelle; the exhibition comprised immersive multi-media installations by 45 contemporary artists and musicians inspired by Kubrick’s films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07flf0z|title=Bryan Ferry, Jo Bell, Aidan Moffat and Beatrix Potter, The Radio 2 Arts Show with Jonathan Ross - BBC Radio 2|website=BBC|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently Senior Research Fellow Exhibitions at the University of the Arts, London. His ongoing curating projects include large-scale collateral projects for the prestigious Venice Biennales from 2007-2017 (52nd~57th Edition), and a series of critically acclaimed exhibitions that he collaborates with [[Sophie Calle]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Andy Hope 1930]], [[Ellen Gallagher]], Mat Collishaw, [[Tim Noble and Sue Webster|Noble &amp; Webster]], [[Mirosław Bałka|Miroslaw Balka]] and [[Gavin Turk]] in the [[Freud Museum]], London.

'''Jeanne Chasles''' (4 September 1869-20 March 1939) was a French dancer in the [[Belle Époque]] period who later became a noted choreographer for the [[Opéra Comique]] and dance instructor at the National Conservatoire. Interested in collecting memorabilia on the history of dance, her collection became an important part of the archives of the [[National Library of France]]. In 1931, she was honored as a knight in the [[Legion of Honour]].
 
==Biography==
Jeanne Marguerite Chasles was born on 4 September 1869 in Paris to Emilie Elisabeth (née Dornbret) and Auguste Alfred Chasles.{{sfn|Birth extract|1931}} She studied dance with [[Mariquita (dancer)|Madame Mariquita]]{{sfn|Gutsche-Miller|2015|p=316}} and in 1888 made her debut at the [[Opéra-Comique]] as a ''petit sujet'' (minor soloist).{{sfn|Garafola|2005|p=166}} She also danced at Dancer at the [[Gaîté Lyrique]] and at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe]].{{sfn|Bibliothèque nationale de France|2017}} By 1898, Chasles had become head of employment for the Opéra-Comique and the following year,{{sfn|Ministère de L’instruction Publique|1931|p=2}} she became one of their principal dancers, soloing until 1910.{{sfn|Garafola|2005|p=166}} Some of the other dancers she worked with included {{ill|Régina Badet|fr}}, {{ill|Aïda Boni|fr}}, [[Luz Chavita]], [[Cléo de Mérode]] and [[Stacia Napierkowska]].{{sfn|''Bulletin D’information du Centre Chorégraphique National''|2007|p=6}} While still working as the employment manager at Opéra-Comique, she temporarily worked in the same capacity at the Gaîté Lyrique and then in 1909 began serving as the Director of Dance at the [[Comédie-Française]]. From 1916, she taught dance at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]].{{sfn|Ministère de L’instruction Publique|1931|p=2}} In 1920, she replaced Madame Mariquita as the ballet mistress of the Opéra-Comique.{{sfn|Garafola|2005|p=220}}

In 1910, Chasles arranged some of the dances for the production of ''Quo Vadis?'', based on the [[Quo Vadis (novel)|novel of the same name]] at the Gaîté Lyrique. Three years later, she choreographed the opera ''[[Pénélope]]'' by [[Gabriel Fauré]] for the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] and later in 1913 she worked on a ballet based on [[Molière]]'s ''Le Sicilien'' for [[Jacques Rouché]] at the [[Théâtre Hébertot|Théâtre des Arts]]. Chasles’ choreography was unique in that it incorporated historical materials on dance from her private collection of dance-related engravings and documents. In 1923, she arranged a production for charity event based on a Renaissance entertainment featuring music created in the fifteenth century by Charles Lévadé. She prepared a revival of ''[[Les Indes galantes]]'' by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] in 1925 for the Opéra-Comique, her last year of choreographing for the Opéra-Comique.{{sfn|Garafola|2005|p=220}}{{sfn|Bibliothèque nationale de France|2017}}

In 1931, she was awarded the rank of knight in the [[Legion of Honour|National Order of the Legion of Honour]].{{sfn|Légion d'honneur|1931}}

==Death and legacy==
Chasles died on 20 March 1939 in Paris.{{sfn|Bibliothèque nationale de France|2017}} After her death, the collection of historic engravings and materials on the history of dance which Chasles had amassed were donated to the National Library of France.{{sfn|Lesure|1958}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11865">[[File:Rassias Photo.jpg|thumb|John A. Rassias, professor and creator of the Rassias Method for Language instruction]]
'''John Arthur Rassias''' (August 20, 1925 – December 2, 2015) was an American professor who developed a method for the teaching of foreign languages, the Rassias Method, also known as the Dartmouth Intensive Language Model.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; John Rassias founded the [[Dartmouth College's Rassias Center for World Languages and Cultures|Rassias Center for World Languages and Cultures]], a department of [[Dartmouth College]] situated in the Office of the Provost that works with language learners and professionals from around the world.

== Early life ==
John A. Rassias was born on August 20, 1925 to Athanathios and Eleni (Leonardakis) Rassias, immigrants from [[Georgitsi|Georgitsi, Greece]]. A [[World War II|WWII]] veteran, Rassias enlisted in the Marines and fought on [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. Rassias later referred to his experience in the war as important to his understanding of how cultural and linguistic understanding connects people of varying backgrounds and experiences. As Rassias states in his upcoming book ''To Be Human, the Unzipped Mind:''  ''"I am born in Manchester, New Hampshire, to a Greek father and Greek mother. Then some buddies and I invade Okinawa. Then I become a teacher...The war has ended... As the Occupation wears on I come into contact with more and more Japanese. Suspicion and distrust give way gradually to the need to communicate and work with them. I roam over the destroyed city (Sasebo)…The desire to understand the Japanese eventually overcomes the hate we’ve absorbed in our training and in combat, it is displaced by the simple human response of sympathy for the afflicted. For the second time in my life, language becomes the arbiter between me and others. Emotion. Learning takes place there, for nothing is real unless it touches me and I embrace it."''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rassias.dartmouth.edu/john/|title=John Rassias|website=rassias.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Rassias graduated summa cum laude from the [[University of Bridgeport]], and later obtained a doctorat d’Etat at the [[University of Dijon]], Dijon, France. He continued with further research at the [[Sorbonne]] and also studied at and performed with the Cours [[René Simon|Réné Simon]] in Paris in the 1950s. Rassias also received a certificate from the Institut de Phonétique in Paris and completed additional study at Laval University in Québec.

== Work ==
In 1964 John Rassias became a consultant for [[Peace Corps]] language education programs throughout the world. He also served as Director of the first pilot program of languages for the Peace Corps in Africa and as Director of Language Programs at Dartmouth. This work initiated his development of the Rassias teaching method.

From 1965 to 2015 Rassias was William R. Kenan Professor of French and Italian at [[Dartmouth College]], where the Rassias Center uses his method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kenancharitabletrust.org/KCTAR2016.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rassias.dartmouth.edu/method/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dartmouth, he was the founder and director of Dartmouth’s Language Study Abroad (LSA) program, through which Dartmouth students may complete their language requirement in a foreign country.

Rassias "put the teacher in the role of the performer, acting out words and expressions in imaginary real-life settings and inculcating vocabulary and grammar through rapid-fire drills that gave students no time to think in English."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/us/john-rassias-who-pioneered-foreign-language-teaching-dies-at-90.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that every class was to be treated like the first class, and for this reason gained appreciation from his students.

In 1978 Rassias was appointed to [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter's]] Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies. In 1994, Rassias was appointed to the Commission of the Modern Language Association of America on the study of service in the profession. He was also elected to the Division of the Teaching of Literature of the [[Modern Language Association]] in 1995, which he chaired in 1998. In addition, Rassias served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Foreign Languages to the Connecticut State Board of Education.

In 1998, Rassias was appointed as head of a commission focused on preserving the Greek language among Americans of Greek heritage by the Archbishop of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]].

In 2006, Rassias participated of the creation of a March 2007 pilot program for Intensive English (IE) education outside of [[Mexico City]]. This pilot program became called the Inter-American Partnership for Education, which remains active today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldfund.org/en/programs/iape.html|title=IAPE - Worldfund|last=Hickner|first=Lena|website=worldfund.org|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  The Rassias Method ==
The method aims to "make the participant feel comfortable and natural with the language in a short period of time" and involves "teaching procedures and dramatic techniques which seek to eliminate inhibitions and create an atmosphere of free expression from the very first day of class".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rassias.dartmouth.edu/method/|title=The Method|website=rassias.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis of the Rassias Method is spoken language. Drill techniques are quick-paced and stress theatrical elements as well as immediate positive reinforcement and error correction.

== Personal life ==
Rassias was married to Mary Ann Evanstock (1928-2012) from 1954 to 2012 and had three children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

== Awards, Honors and Distinctions ==
John Rassias received many awards for his work in language education, including the following:
* First Arthur Wilson Outstanding Teacher Award at Dartmouth (1968)
* E. Harris Harbison Award for Gifted Teaching by the [[Danforth Foundation]] (1971)
* Endowed Chair, William R. Kenan Professor (1977)
* Dartmouth College's Inaugural President's Medal for Outstanding Leadership and Achievement in 1991.
* Robert A. Fish Memorial Prize in Outstanding Teaching awarded by the Dean of the Faculty at Dartmouth College (1997)
* Dartmouth Class of 2008 Distinguished Teaching Award (2008) 
Rassias received eight honorary degrees from the following:
* [[University of Bridgeport]] (Connecticut),
* [[Alma College]] (Michigan),
* [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] (Missouri),
* [[Plymouth State University|Plymouth State College]] (New Hampshire),
* [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] (Michigan),
* [[Hampden–Sydney College|Hampden-Sydney]] (Virginia)
* [[Moravian College]] (Pennsylvania)
* [[Pine Manor College]] (Massachusetts)

== Legacy ==
Rassias died in [[Norwich, Vermont]] on December 2, 2015 at the age of 90.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Rassias Center]], run by Rassias’ daughter, Helene Rassias-Miles, continues to provide language education to Dartmouth community members and learners all over the world. Dartmouth undergraduates continue to receive language instruction through the Rassias Method.

Throughout his career Rassias reached a large number of students and educators around the world. Archives suggest that to date, his work has affected more than 200,000 Peace Corps volunteers since 1964 and continues to be fundamental in that organization’s language instruction approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/1011783.html|title=Peace Corps Online: February 10, 2003 - The Rassias Foundation:  John A. Rassias honored by Peace Corps for developing innovative and highly effective approach to teaching languages|website=peacecorpsonline.org|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An innovative language curriculum designer, Rassias started, in the early 1980s, immersion language programs for continuing education purposes.  These highly efficient 10-day summer programs have enabled adult language learners to make significant gains in their command of the oral and written foreign language in a short period of time.  Some rank beginners have even been able to reach the Intermediate-Low level (ACTFL scale) during the program, an achievement which usually requires three to four semesters in college curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jgoldfield/TenYearsofSpeaking.pdf|title=Ten Years of Speaking to Learn: The Assistant Teacher Program at Fairfield University|last=Goldfield|first=Joel|date=2013|website=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu|publisher=|access-date=2/1/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dartmouth and other U.S. post-secondary institutions, the Rassias Method has been used to teach more than 25,000 students in language acquisition courses. Through the Inter-American Partnership for Education (IAPE) over 1.5 million students of all ages in Mexico have been impacted by faculty trained in the Rassias Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldfund.org/en/programs/iape.html|title=IAPE - Worldfund|last=Hickner|first=Lena|website=worldfund.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, language learners worldwide continue to receive instruction in the method through workshops and classes offered through the Rassias Center.

[[Image:Julius Reisinger.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Julius Reisinger, original choreographer of the ballet ''Swan Lake'' in 1877]]
'''Vaclav (Wentsel), or Jules or Julius Wentsel Reisinger''' (1828 &amp;ndash; 1892) is paradoxical figure in the history of [[ballet]]. This prolific [[choreographer]], an author of more than twenty works on various European stages, directed the [[Moscow]] company of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He is linked with two memorable events: the first stage production of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and the production of the first ballet performance for the opening of the [[Prague National Theatre]] in 1884.  His work on ''Swan Lake'' was considered unsuccessful by the critics of the day but not necessarily unsuccessful by the theatre-going public—after all, Reisinger's original production of ''Swan Lake'' was kept in the active repertoire of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] for seven years and was performed over thirty times during a period when other ballets could not sustain even twenty performances.  In fact, the production was not pulled until the scenery and costumes were worn and threadbare.  Much of its popularity was assumably due to its beautiful musical score which was critically acclaimed even though the choreography was not.

Reisinger was born in February 1828 in [[Prague]] of a native [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] family. He began his professional life as a dancer in the [[corps de ballet]], rising to the position of leading soloist. In 1850, he was the Czech partner of the famous dancer [[Lucille Grahn]] in ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'' (as Phoebus) and ''[[Giselle]]'' (as Hilarion). He also had success in the part of Diavolino in [[Jules Perrot]]'s ballet ''Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit''. In short, the young dancer mastered the romantic repertoire and was familiar with the new ballet productions, one more fact in favour of Reisinger's erudition.

In 1852, he succeeded in securing an eight-year engagement on the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n stages. In 1860 he returned to his native Prague to the [[Nove Mesto Theatre]], already in the position of the choreographer. This was the first time a Czech theatre was actually headed by a Czech choreographer.
[[Image:Swanlakedecor.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Original sketch design for the ballet ''Swan Lake'' in 1877]]     

==Misconceptions==
It is commonly thought that none of Reisinger's ballets was successful but facts contradict this. An example of this would be "Swan Lake". a Classical Ballet that is still being performed today. Why then was such a [[choreographer]] invited to brilliant [[Leipzig]] where he directed the ballet company from 1864 to 1872?  Large-scale works were presented there, such as ''Saltarello'' and ''Interrupted Solitude'' to the music of the [[Leipzig]] [[kapellmeister]], Muhldorfer. And from Leipzig, Reisinger was invited to [[Russia]].

Indications of Reisinger's [[Moscow]] endeavors are readily found in the writings of several [[Russia]]n historians, the first one being a staging of the five-act ballet ''The Crystal Slipper'' (1871, a ballet of the ''[[Cinderella]]'' story) to Muhldorfer's music, which Yuri Bakhrushin referring to original sources, notes as quite successful. In 1873, finding himself in the post of '''Director of the Moscow Ballet''', he created successive multiple-act productions such as ''Kastchei'', where, as confirmed again by Yuri Bakhrushin, the choreographer successfully developed the Russian theme. He also produced ''Stella'' and ''Ariadne'' (in tandem with Imperial Balletmaster [[Marius Petipa]]). All ballets (except ''Kastchei'', which he staged with the two [[composer]]s  Muhldorfer and Gerber) used the music of Gerber. At the same time, in the last two (''Stella'' and ''Ariadne''), Reisinger reworked elements of ancient art according to the dictates of [[Biedermeier]]. Added to that, in the production of ''Ariadne'', the Theatre Directorate allotted what was (for that time), the very large sum of 40,000 [[Russian ruble|roubles]]. This not only suggests the confidence they had invested in Reisinger, but also confirms that in his first two years in Russia he had clearly won the authority of the Imperial Theatre Directorate.  It was with this artistic background that the choreographer approached the first production of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

==Questions Remain==
Though today Reisinger is considered the father of Czech professional ballet, criticisms regarding his choreography (such as "mediocre," "ordinary," and "untalented") have followed him, even after his death. His [[critics]] did not endow him with the usual praise in his own country or in Russia, but this did not prevent him from having a very long balletic career. With this in mind, one must ask oneself: was this choreographer truly untalented? Is it possible that in [[Prague]], [[Moscow]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Berlin]] his ascent to the top was merely the result of a long-patient public and theatre administration?  Though good timing undoubtedly played some part in his career, it is possibly unrealistic to form the conclusion that this was the only factor in his solid rise to the forefront of the most respected theatres of the time.

==Musical Style==
Mullady has a variety of musical acts as a solo artist. She has a distinct style of beatboxing, which consists of polyrhythms, avant garde style compositions, incorporation of theatrical performance,  the [[Mouth trumpet]] technique and extensive [[beatrhyming]]. She is also noted for her [[one woman band]] performances, which incorporate singing, [[beatboxing]], guitar, rapping, and [[live looping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/new-yorker-kaila-mullady-named-the-world-female-beatbox-champion-at-the-2015-beatbox-battle-world-championships/|title=New Yorker Kaila Mullady Named the World Female Beatbox Champion at the 2015 Beatbox Battle World Championships|date=31 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mullady's interest in music and beatboxing began at a young age. She took up guitar at age ten and began beatboxing for parties when she got older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geckosadventures.com/tales/beatbox-kaila-mullady/|title=Girl power: Meet American Vice Beatbox Champion, Kaila Mullady – Geckos Tales|date=2 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She originally planned on pursuing a career as a teacher, but over time became disinterested in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxygen.com/blogs/kaila-mullady-is-reinvigorating-beatboxing-and-schooling-the-boys-along-the-way|title=Kaila Mullady Is Reinvigorating Beatboxing And Schooling The Boys Along The Way|date=28 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 she met award-winning beatboxer J-Flo, and was introduced to the modern beatbox community. After an accident resulting in a broken back, which prevented her from performing, during her recovery, she met beatbox pioneer [[Kid Lucky]]. He introduced her to the art of [[beatrhyming]] which ultimately changed and defined the course of her artistry. He befriended Mullady and became her mentor and extensive collaborator.

Courses in both the department of social sciences and the department of natural sciences take five years to complete.&lt;ref name="terms.naver.com"/&gt;

==History==
On 25 May 1946 the Preparatory Committee was composed by the founding universities. In July 1946, the interim People's Committee of North Korea decided to establish a University (ordinance No. 40). Kim Il-sung proclaimed on 1 October 1946 the founding.

In 1948, four university faculties (Faculty of Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Medicine) were separated from Kim Il-sung University, to form the origin of Pyongyang University of Technology (currently Kim Chaek Industrial University), Sariwon Agricultural University and Pyongyang University School of Medicine.

[[File:Kim-Il-sung-University-Paeksong-2014.jpg|thumb|Buildings at the Paeksong Revolutionary Site near Pyongsong, to which many students from Kim Il-sung University were moved during the Korean War, for reasons of safety.]]

During the [[Korean War]], the university was located at Baeksong-ri under Mt. Jamo in Suncheon-gun, which was far from the centre of the city. By late 1955, the reconstruction of the main building on the Pyongyang campus was in progress and soon the university moved back to the centre of Pyongyang.

After the war, Kim Il-Sung University became known as a hotbed of intellectual dissent. Academics supported more intellectual freedoms than Kim loyalists, and disadvantageous factions within the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] were over-represented in university staff. Following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolutions of 1956 in Hungary]] and [[Polish October|in Poland]], North Korean exchange students were quickly repatriated from the affected countries. The students started asking "improper" questions on campus, causing alarm.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=96}} After that, up to one hundred students and several prominent staff members were purged. The purging of the university gave further impetus to purges against functionalists all over the country.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=97}}

By the end of 1970s more than 50,000 students graduated annually from the university. In addition, the university was an important asset of for the [[Korean People's Army]] to train its personnel. Since the 1970s, English courses have been taught at the university.

Until 2004, Pak Kwan-o, an authority on nuclear physics and current Chairman of the People's Committee of Pyongyang (De facto Mayor), had been serving as the president for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;[“北 평양시장 경질...전 김일성대 총장 박관오씨 새로 임명 [North, Replaced the Mayor of Pyongyang...

In "Brother Barnabas" by W.J. Battersby PhD, it states BB became director in January 1909 of the school renaming it the next month for Abraham Lincoln.  He was there until 1914.  This seems more likely than 1912 since he was appointed to serve on a White House Child Welfare committee in 1909.

'''''Linguistic Imperialism''''' is a book written by [[Robert Phillipson]], research professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]]'s Department of English, published in 1992 by [[Oxford University Press]].

In ''Linguistic Imperialism'', Phillipson argues that [[Western world|Western countries]] have used [[English language|English]] as a tool of [[imperialism]] to dominate [[Colonialism|colonies and former colonies]].  He further explores the ideologies transmitted through the English language.

The book was followed by ''Linguistic Imperialism Continued'', first published by [[Routledge]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Alan |title=Linguistic Imperialism Continued |url=http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/1/126.extract |journal=ELT

'''Matthias Felleisen''' is a [[German-American]] [[computer science]] professor and author. He grew up in Germany and immigrated to the US when he was 21 years old.

Felleisen is currently a Trustee Professor in the [[Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science|College of Computer and Information Science]] at [[Northeastern University, Boston|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].  In the past he has taught at [[Rice University]] after receiving his PhD from [[Indiana University]] under the direction of  [[Daniel P. Friedman]].

Felleisen's interests include programming languages, including software tools,  program design, the Design Recipe, software contracts, and many more.&lt;ref name='self-website'&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|accessdate=2012-06-26|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/research.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Felleisen launched [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]] and TeachScheme! (now [[ProgramByDesign]]) with the goal of teaching program-design principles to beginners and to explore the use of [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] to produce large systems. As part of this effort, he authored  ''[[How to Design Programs]]'' ([[MIT Press]], 2001) with [[Robert Bruce Findler|Findler]], [[Matthew Flatt|Flatt]], and [[Shriram Krishnamurthi|Krishnamurthi]].

Control delimiters, the basis of [[delimited continuation]]s, were introduced by Felleisen&lt;ref name='felleisen88'&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matthias Felleisen|title=The theory and practice of first-class prompts|journal=[[Principles of Programming Languages]]|year=1988|doi=10.1145/73560.73576|pages=180–190|isbn=0-89791-252-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988. They have since been used in a large number of domains, particularly in defining new [[Operator_(computer_programming)|control operator]]s; see Queinnec&lt;ref name="queinnec survey"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Queinnec, Christian | publisher=[[École Polytechnique]] and [[INRIA]]-Rocquencourt | title=A library of high-level control operators | citeseerx = 10.1.1.29.4790 | date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a survey.

[[A-normal form]] (ANF), an [[Intermediate language|intermediate representation]] of [[program (computer science)|program]]s in [[functional compiler]]s were introduced by Sabry and Felleisen in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
  | id = Sabry92

  | accessdate = 2012-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a simpler alternative to [[continuation-passing style]] (CPS).

Felleisen gave the keynote addresses at the 2011 [[Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education]], 2010 [[International Conference on Functional Programming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2012-12-18|title=ICFP 2010 Homepage|url=http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2010/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2004 [[European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming]] and the 2001 Symposium on [[Principles of Programming Languages]], and several other conferences and workshops on computer science.

In 2006, he was inducted as a [[fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].  In 2009, he received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award from the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]].&lt;ref name='karlstrom'&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2012-06-26|title=ACM Award Citation|url=http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2089571&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=142&amp;ao=KARLSTRM&amp;yr=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504095940/http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2089571&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=142&amp;ao=KARLSTRM&amp;yr=2009|archivedate=2012-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he received the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130603133901/http://www.sigcse.org/programs/awards/outstanding SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education] from the ACM.  In 2012, he received the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award for "significant and lasting contribution to the field of programming languages"&lt;ref name="sigplan-achievement"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2012-06-26|title=Programming Languages Achievement Award|url=http://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Achievement/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including small-step operational semantics for control and state, mixin classes and mixin modules, a fully abstract semantics for Sequential PCF, web programming techniques, higher-order contracts with blame, and static typing for dynamic languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2482">The '''National Framework of Qualifications''' (NFQ) is a system used to describe levels of educational qualifications in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  Responsibility for maintaining and developing the framework lies with [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (QQI).

Launched in 2003, the NFQ was developed by the [[National Qualifications Authority of Ireland]] as a means of comparing training and qualifications between institutions of education at all levels.  It encompasses learning at primary and second level, as well as acting as a benchmark for required standards for graduates of courses offered by  QQI, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] and [[university|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/learner.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework consists of 10 "Levels", ranging from Certificates at Level 1 which signify initial learning to degrees at [[doctoral]] level.  A 'fan diagram' [http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/images/FanDec2006.jpg] is used to illustrate the progression of the levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/public_resources/presentation.html National Framework of Qualifications - Communication Materials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6079">'''Offline mobile learning''' is the ability to access learning materials on a [[mobile device]] without requiring an [[Internet]] connection.

Generally, [[Web application|web-based applications]] functionalities are dependent on ability to access to the [[Website|Web]]. While there are many practical reasons for an application to access data on a [[Server (computing)|server]], not every feature of an [[Application software|application]] may necessarily need to have such access. [[Online and offline|Offline]] access to such features may enhance the user experience and wider applicability of an application {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

''Tasks that require a single service request are well suited to offline scenarios. Such tasks follow a "compose and forward" model, where the user specifies all of the required data for the service request, which is then forwarded to the actual service when the client reconnects. Examples of this type of task are: composing an e-mail, composing a meeting request, and entering order information. All of these tasks are discrete items that the user can complete offline and that result in a single service request.''&lt;ref&gt;MSDN [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998439.aspx "Smart Client Offline Application Block"]. Retrieved on 08/01/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile Learning: Developing Countries==
The developed world’s emphasis on highly sophisticated technological devices is a futuristic dream for most [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=K.|last=Masters|title=Low-key m-learning: a realstic introduction of m-learning to developing countries|year=2004|url=http://www.fil.hu/mobil/2005/Masters_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these countries realise that [[M-learning|M-Learning]] is more than just using a mobile device for [[Educational technology|E-Learning]], and that it requires an entirely different approach. In order to utilize M-Learning efficiently in these developing countries, there is a need to understand this approach, as technology becomes available.

These mobile technologies have successfully enabled learning opportunities and support to those learners in developing countries who are situated far distances away from [[Educational institution|educational facilities]], and do not have the infrastructure to support access.''

Users in developing countries have the same need for M-Learning to be mobile, accessible and affordable, as those in developed countries do. The very significance of M-Learning is its ability to make learning mobile, away from the [[classroom]] or [[workplace]]. These [[Wireless]] and [[Mobile phone|mobile]] technologies enable learning opportunities to learners who do not have direct access to learning in these places. Many learners in developing countries have trouble accessing the internet, or experience difficulty in affording technology that enables learning in an E-Learning environment. Mobile devices are a cheaper alternative compared to traditional E-Learning equipment such as [[Personal computer|PC]]’s and [[Laptop]]s.''

However, to fully utilize this potential it is imperative to explore the factors that determine mobile telecommunications development in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Ping, G. &amp; Adnan, R., 2009. Analysing the Mobile Telecommunications Market in a Developing Country: A Socio-Technical Perspective on Pakistan, Centre for Development Informatics, Instituate for development policy and management, SED.&lt;/ref&gt; Delivering mobile services on open hardware and open software not just practically makes sense but can also lower the cost and thus increase the possibility of offering sustainable services in the future.'' While the benefits of open-source software are proven, it is important to conduct a broader study to investigate the potential role of relatively new copyleft approach for custom hardware, as supporting mobile learners in their own socio-cultural contexts of developing countries is a significant challenge.''&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, S., Moore, J., Abdelnour-Nocera, J.  [http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/e/sac/meem/index.php/meem/article/view/134 "Low-cost hardware for ICT4D: what's right and what's left?"]. IIEEE Multidisciplinary Engineering Education Magazine, Vol 6, No 1 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==
A range of devices exist from mobile phones to single-purpose devices such as [[E-book]] readers. Current web technologies provide limited support for offline access to content and therefore web applications are generally designed for online interactions with server and require Internet connection to work. But mobile device is often disconnected by nature and wireless network connection is not available all the time. Device needs to store [[data]] locally in a fully searchable database and application should allow continuous interaction regardless of availability of Internet. Application should also be device and [[Platform as a service|platform]] independent.

==Challenges==
Some modern mobile devices have the capability to store thousands of documents and therefore have the potential to be used as powerful offline [[Learning Tools Interoperability|learning tools]].

Typically, the optimal solution is to use the local store as much as possible, since it is usually faster than a remote connection. However, the more work an application does locally, the more code you need to write to implement the feature locally and to synchronize the corresponding data. There is a cost/benefit tradeoff to consider, and some features may not be worthwhile to support locally.&lt;ref&gt;Google [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/architecture.html "Google Gears API Architecture"].

A '''Philosothon''' is an annual competition wherein students explore philosophical and ethical issues. Philosothons are held in all Australian states, New Zealand, and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wills|first=Matthew|title=The 2009 Sir Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation Ethics in Leadership Fellowship|url=http://www.churchilltrust.com.au/site_media/fellows/Wills_Matthew_2009.pdf|work=Fellowship Report|publisher=Winston Churchill Trust|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Philosothon website|url=http://philosothon.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchett|first=Mark|title=The Wellington News|url=http://www.wellington-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=105096&amp;headline=Philosophers%20debate%20Charlie%20Hebdo%20attack&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2017|accessdate=12 March 2017|newspaper=Wellington Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Philosothon school aged students are assessed by university based professional philosophers and score highly where they demonstrate rigour and clarity of thought. An essential component of a Philosothon is the pedagogical model for teaching Philosophy to young people called [[Community of inquiry]]. The event has grown alongside and within the [[Philosophy for Children]] movement.  The first Australasian Philosothon was held at Cranbrook School, Sydney in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Alan|title=The Philosophers Zone|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/philosothon-2011---the-first-australasian-high/2935678|accessdate=10 January 2012|newspaper=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rocca|first=Michelle|title=The Victorian Association for Philosophy in Schools|url=http://vaps.vic.edu.au/events/victorian-secondary-philosothon-16th-september-2015|publisher=VAPS|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first UK Philosothon was held in 2012 at King's College, Taunton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Education Today|url=http://ie-today.co.uk/Article/young_philosophers_have_winning_thoughts}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Philosothon2007Web2.jpg|thumb|2007 Hale School Philosothon Winning school students with trophy]]

== History ==
In 2007, [[Hale School]] in Perth Western Australia initiated a project to promote higher order thinking among secondary school students.  At the first Philosothon nine local high school teams, each including five students came together for an evening of philosophical investigation. The word 'Philosothon' was created in the first few years of the event by Matthew Wills and Leanne Rucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosothon Website|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Philosothon/|work=History|publisher=Philosothon|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosothon Website|url=http://www.philosothon.org/|work=History|publisher=Philosothon|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent history ==
Following the first Philosothon it was decided to promote the event more broadly to other schools around the country and later in the UK. Philosothons now take place annually in each Australian capital city and in regional locations around the country.

Recently Primary school Philosothons have been conducted in various Art Galleries in some Australian states and in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worley|first=Peter|title=Philosophy Foundation|url=http://philosophyfoundation.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/uks-first-primary-philosothon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Etherton|first=Rosemary|title=The National Gallery of Victoria|url=https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/2014-victorian-primary-school-philosothon/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 The Templeton Religion Trust awarded $281,656 AUD to the Philosothon project in order to "grow existing Philosothons and support the establishment of new ones, particularly in remote schools and at schools catering for students from low socio-economic backgrounds" in Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W.|first=Justin|title=Daily Nous|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/21/large-grant-support-pre-college-philosophy-australasia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JuniorSchoolPhilosothon.jpg|thumb|A Junior School Philosothon at the Art Gallery of Western Australia]]

== Rationale and process ==
The rationale for the Philosothon methodology is based on empirical evidence that teaching children reasoning skills early in life greatly improves other cognitive and academic skills and greatly assists learning in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prof Stephan Millett|first=Dr Alan Tapper &amp; |title=Educational Philosophy and Theory 'Benefits of Collaborative Philosophical Inquiry in Schools'|year=2011|url=http://legein.perso.sfr.fr/LPP/Benefits%20of%20Collaborative%20Philosophical%20Inquiry%20in%20Schools.pdf | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are given the topic questions in advance and some stimulus reading materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosothon Website|url=http://www.philosothon.org|work=Resources|publisher=Philosothon|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of topic questions from recent Philosothons are these:

* Is it moral to fake kindness? ([[Moral Philosophy]])
* Do men and woman have different natures? ([[Metaphysical]])
* Do you have free will? ([[Metaphysical]])
* Should you always listen to the opinions of others? ([[Epistemology]])
* How free should speech be? ([[Political Philosophy]])

Students, teachers and parents gather on a particular evening each year for the event. The students participate in a series of Communities of Inquiry which are facilitated by teachers or Phd. philosophy students from the local universities. While participating in this process students are scored by Philosophy lecturers also from local universities. The scores are then collated, ranked and later in the evening awards are given to students at each age level and encouragement awards to the most promising male and female philosopher. Also a trophy is awarded to the winning school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flood|first=Gary &amp; |title= A Marathon for the Mind|year=2014|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=tpm&amp;id=tpm_2014_0067_0010_0015| accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms and responses ==
Some might argue that Philosophy cannot be undertaken in the context of a competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|last=TALIAFERRO|first=CHARLES |title=Ask a Philosopher|website=Ask a Philosopher?|year=2010|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://www.askphilosophers.org/question/3267|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that by ranking individuals the process of developing a Community of Philosophical Inquiry is fundamentally compromised.  However, others have responded that many students forget they are involved in a competition and engage in the exact sort of investigation and collaboration we would hope to see in Philosophy. Others have suggested that the same process is undertaken in any academic institution, tertiary or secondary where students are ranked against criteria. The only difference is that one of the more important criteria in a COI is collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wills|first=Matthew|title=Philosothon|journal=American Philosophical Association|year=2012|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/808CBF9D-D8E6-44A7-AE13-41A70645A525/v12n1_Teaching.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australasian Philosothon ==
In July 2011 the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA) decided to host the first National Philosothon at [[Cranbrook School, Sydney|Cranbrook School]]. Each Australian state sent three teams (those schools that won the 2010 Philosothon in each state) and so twelve schools in total arrived in Sydney to participate in the inaugural event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Association of Philosophy|url=http://aap.org.au/event-319903|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dr Poulton|first=Janette|title= -Victorian Association for Philosophy in Schools|url=http://vaps.vic.edu.au/events/victorian-secondary-philosothon-16th-september-2015|work=Victorian Philosothon|publisher=VAPS|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAPSA|url=http://fapsa.org.au/philosothon/|work=Federal Association for Philosophy in Schools|publisher=FAPSA|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 it was held in Melbourne, Victoria and hosted by the National Art Gallery of Victoria and Ballarat Grammar's City campus. In 2014 Hale School in Perth Western Australia hosted the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAPSA|url=http://philosothon.org/2014AustralasianPhilosothon/philosothonstudents.mp3|work=ABC Drive Radio|publisher=ABC|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 North Sydney Girls High School hosted the 5th Annual FAPSA Australasian Philosothon. In 2016 Churchie in Brisbane hosted it and in 2017 St Andrew's Cathedral College in Sydney hosted the event.

== Other countries ==
Philosothons have been run in the UK since 2013. Revd. Mark Smith &amp; [[Julie Arliss]] from the Philosophy of Religion and Ethics Department at [[King's College, Taunton]], UK, have spearheaded the Philosothon movement in the United Kingdom in collaboration with Dr Michael Lacewing from [[Heythrop College]] and Lizzy Lewis from [[Sapere]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kings-taunton.co.uk/philosothon/&lt;/ref&gt; Wells Cathedral College won the first event. Since then Philosothons have been run annually around the UK including many Primary School Philosothons hosted by the Philosophy Foundation. Other Philosothons have been held around the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Sian|title=The Southern Daily Echo|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11155830.display/|accessdate=12 March 2017|newspaper=Wellington Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R (Begum) v Governors of Denbigh High School''''' [2006] is a [[House of Lords]] case on the legal regulation of religious symbols and dress under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/15.html UKHL 15, House of Lords Decisions] Retrieved 2014-06-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The case involved Shabina Begum, a Muslim pupil at [[Denbigh High School, Luton|Denbigh High School]] in [[Luton]], UK, who sued her school.&lt;ref name="Emon2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFbWEPGx7SkC&amp;pg=PA291|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|author=Anver M.

==The case==
Shabina Begum ({{lang-bn|শবিনা বেগম}}; born in the UK, aged 16 at the time and of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] origin), was a pupil at [[Denbigh High School, Luton|Denbigh High School]] in [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]]. Four out of the six parent governors were Muslims, the Chair of the Luton Council of Mosques was a community governor and three of the LEA governors were also Muslims. However the school also contained a significant number of pupils of other faiths and the school wished to be inclusive in serving the needs of this diverse community and regarded the school uniform as promoting a sense of communal identity. In addition to uniforms incorporating trousers or skirts, female pupils are also offered a uniform based on the [[Pakistan]]i or [[Punjab region|Punjabi]] [[shalwar kameez]] with optional [[khimar]]. The school uniform was decided upon in consultation with local mosques, religious organisations and parents. The School considered the shalwar kameez ideal as it was worn by several faith groups and, accordingly, helped to minimise the differences between them.

For two years, Ms. Begum attended the school without complaint, wearing the shalwar kameez, but in September 2002, Ms. Begum, accompanied by her brother and another young male, went to the school and asked that she be allowed to wear the long coat-like garment known as the [[jilbāb]]. In the opinion of Begum and her supporters, the particular form of shalwar kameez offered by the school was relatively close-fitting with short sleeves, and was therefore not compliant with the requirements of [[Sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] as they are stated in [[Sharia]] law. Shabina refused to attend for three years unless she was allowed to wear the jilbab to school. She said she believed that this was required by her [[Muslim]] faith, but also in contravention of the [[school uniform]] policy. In addition, the jilbab was, in the opinion of Begum and her supporters, a more culturally-neutral form of Islamic attire.

The school's supporters claimed that after Begum's parents had died, she had come under the undue influence of her brother Shuweb Rahman. They also argued that if Begum was allowed to attend classes wearing jilbab, other pupils would feel under pressure to adopt stricter forms of Islamic dress.{{fact?|date=December 2016}}

Begum, with her brother, issued a claim for judicial review of the school's decision not to allow her to wear the jilbab at school.  The claim was made on the grounds that the school had interfered with her right to manifest her religion (Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) and her right to education (Article 2(1) of the first protocol).

==Judgment==

===Appeals===
Begum lost the case in the [[EWHC|High Court]], but later won on appeal to the [[EWCA|Court of Appeal]]. The school [[appeal]]ed against this decision, and the case was heard by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]]. The [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] was allowed to make submissions in the hearing in the House of Lords.  The House of Lords ruled in favour of the school. Begum was represented in the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords by the former Prime Minister's wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Blair QC]].

===House of Lords===
[[Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] stressed at the outset of his judgment that,

{{Cquote|this case concerns a particular pupil and a particular school in a particular place at a particular time.  It must be resolved on facts which are now, for purposes of the appeal, agreed.  The House is not, and could not be, invited to rule on whether Islamic dress, or any feature of Islamic dress, should or should not be permitted in the schools of this country.}}

The Law Lords took the view that a person's right to hold a particular religious belief was absolute (i.e. could not be interfered with), but that a person's right to manifest a particular religious belief was qualified (i.e. it could be interfered with if there was a justification).

Three of the five Law Lords held that Begum's rights had not been interfered with&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|88A|School uniform, curriculum and discipline.|444|6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lord Bingham, [[Lord Scott of Foscote]] and [[Lord Hoffmann]]), and two held that they had ([[Lord Nicholls|Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead]] and [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Baroness Hale of Richmond]]).

All five agreed, however, that in this particular case there were justifiable grounds for interference, one of the grounds being to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of dress.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the website base, Smart.fm also had a Facebook application.

== History ==
Smart.fm was created by Japan-based company [[Cerego|Cerego Japan, Inc.]], initially featuring language-learning and [[product brand|branded]] under the name iKnow! (iKnow.co.jp). The original platform focused on English learners in [[Japan]] and attracted roughly 300,000 users in its first year.&lt;ref name="crunchbase-cerego"&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cerego-japan-inc

| date = 2009-09-17
| work = CrunchBase
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2008 the platform turned to world-wide audience when it added another 188 languages. The upgrade also included tools for users to create learning content; sample sentences and timed tests. Cerego had raised US$20 million in funding at the time and was staffed by 22 employees.&lt;ref name="smartfm-venturebeat-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat-iknow"&gt;{{cite web

| author = Dean Takahashi
| date = 2008-11-24
| work = Digital.VentureBeat.com
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's name was changed to Smart.fm on March 5, 2009 when the [[software platform|platform]] introduced an upgrade which enabled users to add learning content of any kind. The re-branding was sudden, and users complained about the new [[graphical user interface|interface]] and new name.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} About the new name, Cerego's ''Russell Moench'' explained in an official announcement: "''we see ourselves more like your personal learning station than an online classroom or teacher or textbook''."&lt;ref name="smartfm-announcement"&gt;{{cite web

| work = Smart.fm weblog
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Cerego's Smart.fm used [[spaced repetition]] techniques to assist users in organizing learning content, increase learning speed and improve recollection. The system was based on established methods of learning derived from [[cognitive science|cognitive]]- and [[neuroscience]] research; continuously analyzing performance, on a long- and short-term basis, making dynamic adjustments to learning exercises. The data was used to automatically plan a [[curriculum]] and learning strategy for the users.&lt;ref name="techcrunch-iknow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cerego-funding" /&gt;

== Closure ==
On January 27, 2011, [[Cerego|Cerego Japan, Inc.]] announced the planned closure of the Smart.fm free service for March 31, 2011. The Smart.fm service has since been replaced with Cerego's paid subscription-based language learning site, iKnow!&lt;ref name="smartfm-closure"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Development-Entertainment Continuum.png|thumb|SBCC on the Development-Entertainment spectrum.]]
'''Social and behavior change communication''' ('''SBCC'''), often also only "'''BCC'''" or "'''Communication for Development''' ('''C4D''')" is an interactive process of any intervention with [[individuals]], [[communities]] and/or societies (as integrated with an overall program) to develop [[communication]] strategies to promote positive behaviors which are appropriate to their settings and there by solve world's most pressing health problems. This in turn provides a supportive environment which will enable people to initiate, sustain and maintain positive and desirable [[behavior]] outcomes.&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | title = COMMUNICATION/BEHAVIOR CHANGE TOOLS
  | journal = Entertainment-Education
  | volume = 1
  | pages = 1–6
  | publisher = United Nations Population Funds

  | date = January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBCC is the strategic use of communication to promote positive health outcomes, based on proven theories and models of [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]]. SBCC employs a systematic process beginning with formative research and behavior analysis, followed by communication planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Audiences are carefully segmented, messages and materials are pre-tested, and mass media (which include radio, television, billboards, print material, internet), interpersonal channels (such as client-provider interaction, group presentations) and community mobilisation are used to achieve defined behavioral objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators/crosscutting/bcc|title=Behavior Change Communication — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCC should not be confused with [[behavior modification]], a term with specific meaning in a [[clinical psychiatry]] setting.

== Background ==
Providing people with information and teaching them how they should behave does not lead to desirable change in their response/behavior. However, when there is a supportive environment with information and communication (teaching) then there is a desirable change in the behavior of the target group. Thus, SBCC is proved to be an instructional intervention which has a close interface with education and communication. It is a strategic and group oriented form of communication to perceive a desired change in behavior of target group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web 
 |title=A Tool Box for Building Health Communication Capacity 
 |url=http://www.globalhealthcommunication.org/tools/29 
 |accessdate=29 April 2010

 |archivedate=4 February 2010 
 |df= 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not as easy as it sounds, as there is no one-size-fits all strategy for any intervention. Interventions are context specific. Therefore, there is a need for proper information management and sharing. It is advised to document and report the interventions that worked somewhere, for example, the kind of messages, the medium and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|displayauthors=etal|first=|date=|year=2003|title=Evidence-based behaviour change medicine: what is it and how do we achieve it?|url=|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=26|pages=161–171|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps==
SBCC is the comprehensive process in which one passes through the stages:

Unaware
&gt; Aware
&gt; Concerned
&gt; Knowledgeable
&gt; Motivated to change
&gt; Practicing trial behavior change
&gt; Sustained behavior change[[Image:Behavior Change Communication.jpg|thumb|SBCC in classroom practices]]

It involves the following steps:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# State program goals
# Involve stakeholders
# Identify target populations
# Conduct formative BCC assessments
# Segment target populations
# Define behavior change objectives
# Define SBCC strategy &amp; monitoring and evaluation plan
# Develop communication products
# Pretest
# Implement and monitor
# Evaluate
# Analyze feedback and revise

== Enabling factors ==
Behavior change is influenced by motivation from others (external influence) as well as from within oneself (internal influence). Internal influence plays a significant role in creating more enjoyment of a behavior change, instilling a sense of ownership of the new behavior, which in turn instills a sense of ownership of the changed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osbaldiston|first=R|last2=Sheldon|first2=K|year=2002|editor-last=Schmuck|editor-first=A|editor2-last=Schultz|editor2-first=W|title=Social dilemmas and sustainable development: Promoting the motivation to cooperate with the future.|url=|journal=Psychology of Sustainability|publisher=Boston: Kluwer|volume=|pages=37–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When designing SBCC strategies, enabling factors that affect the outcome must be considered. The following are some of the factors:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Effective communication
* Enabling environment, which include policies, human rights community values and norms
* User-friendly, accessible services and commodities

==Theories==
SBCC has several levels at which it can be implemented. Each level includes several theories. Each level (and each theory) employs specific communication channels.

;Individual level
* Health belief theory
* Theory of reasoned action and planned behavior
* Stages of change
* Social learning

;Community level
* Diffusion of innovations theory
* Community mobilization

;Change in organizations 
* 4 stage change

;Public policy Level
* Distinct stages of initiation, action, implementation, evaluation and re-formulation

==Strategies==
SBCC is different from the ordinary instructional method of communication and is target specific. A society consists of many sub-groups. The strategy for SBCC will vary from group to group. The following points are important while considering the SBCC strategy.&lt;ref name="BCC_AIDS"&gt;{{Cite journal

* The vulnerability/risk factor of the group which is to be addressed
* The conflict and obstacles in the way to desired change in behavior

* Type of resources available and assessment of existing knowledge of the target group about the issue which is going to be dealt with

There can be several more points in this list. A successful SBCC requires lots of research and meticulous planning about the knowledge content of the subject and behavior/attitude pattern of the target group.&lt;ref name="UNFPA" /&gt;

[[Social marketing]] has been described as a tool for [[sustainable behaviour]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merritt|first1=Rowena|last2=Truss|first2=Aiden|last3=Hopwood|first3=Toby|title=Social marketing can help achieve sustainable behaviour change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/social-marketing-behaviour-change|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
SBCC has proven effective in several health areas, such as increasing the use of family planning methods,reducing the spread of malaria and other infectious diseases, and improving newborn and maternal health.

SBCC is an effective tool for dealing with many community and group related problems. BCC has been adapted as an effective strategy for [[community mobilization]], health  and environment education and various public outreach programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Enhanced knowledge about the behavior change process has facilitated the design of communications programs to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and AIDS. A wide variety of health promotion strategies use communication as either an educational or norm-forming strategy. In addition, specific strategies must be designed for high-risk groups such as women, young people, injecting drug abusers, homosexuals and HIV positive groups.&lt;ref name="BCC_AIDS" /&gt;

'''''The Educated Mind: How Cognitive Tools Shape Our Understanding''''' is a 1997 book on [[Philosophy of education|educational theory]] by [[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Kieran Egan]].

== Main arguments ==

=== Criticism of previous education theories ===
Egan argues that much of educational theorizing pivots around three basic ideas of what the aim of education should be:

# to educate people in content that would give them a "privileged and rational view of reality"&lt;ref&gt;Kieran Egan (1997). The educated mind (page 13). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-19036-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Plato]]). Here we find the following ideas: reason and knowledge can provide a privileged access to the world; knowledge drives the student mind development; education is an [[epistemological]] process.
# to realize the right of every individual to pursue his own educational curriculum through self-discovery ([[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]). Here we also find the ideas that student development drives knowledge and that education is a psychological process.
# to '''Socialize the child''' - to homogenize children and ensure that they can fulfill a useful role in society, according to its values and beliefs.

Egan argues in Chapter One that "these three ideas are mutually incompatible, and this is the primary cause of our long-continuing educational crisis";&lt;ref name="EdMindIntro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Kieran Egan]] |title=The educated mind (introduction)|location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-226-19036-6|url=http://www.educ.sfu.ca/kegan/EdMindIntro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the present educational program in much of the West attempts to integrate all three of these incompatible ideas, resulting in a failure to effectively achieve any of the three.&lt;ref name="MacNeil_review"&gt;D. James MacNeil, review of ''The educated mind'', for the 21st Century Learning Initiative, September 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How knowledge grows in the mind  ===
Egan's proposed solution to the education problem which he identifies is to show how knowledge and understanding develop in the mind as we pick up sets of cognitive tools in our negotiations with those around us and with the natural world itself. This individual process, he argues, mirrors, as a result of logical and psychological pressures, a related process in human cultural development. Thus, he describes his theory as a "cultural recapitulation" theory, taking care to differentiate it from the conceptions of recapitulation common in the late 19th century and early 20th century. According to Egan, individuals can pick up sets of cognitive tools that will coalesce into five distinctive kinds of understanding:
# '''Somatic''' - (before [[language acquisition]]) the physical abilities of one's own body are discovered, as are our emotions; somatic understanding includes the communicating activity that precedes the development of language; as the child grows and learns language, this kind of understanding survives in the way children "model their overall social structure in play".
# '''Mythic''' - binary opposites (e.g. Tall/Short or Good/Evil), images, metaphor, and story-structure are prominent tools in pre-literate sense-making.
# '''Romantic''' - the limits of reality are discovered and rational thinking begins, connected with the development of literacy. Egan connects this stage with the desire to explore the limits of reality, an interest in the transcendent qualities of things, and "engagement with knowledge represented as a product of human emotions and intentions" (p. 254)
# '''Philosophic''' - the discovery of principles which underlie patterns and limits found in data; ordering knowledge into coherent general schemes.
# '''Ironic''' - it involves the "mental flexibility to recognize how inadequately flexible are our minds, and the languages we use, to the world we try to represent in them"; it therefore includes the ability to consider alternative philosophic explanations, and is characterized by a Socratic stance in the world.

"Drawing from an extensive study of [[cultural history]] and [[evolutionary history]] and the field of cognitive psychology and anthropology, Egan gives a detailed account of how these various forms of understanding have been created and distinguished in our cultural history".&lt;ref name="Polito2005"&gt;Theodora Polito, ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/epat/2005/00000037/00000004/art00003 Educational Theory as Theory of Culture: A Vichian perspective on the educational theories of John Dewey and Kieran Egan]'' Educational Philosophy and Theory, Vol. 37, No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Each stage includes a set of "cognitive tools", as Egan calls them, that enrich our understanding of reality. Egan suggests that recapitulating these stages is an alternative to the contradictions between the Platonic, Rousseauian and socialising goals of education.

Egan resists the suggestion that religious understanding could be a further last stage, arguing instead that religious explanations are examples of ironic understanding preserving a richly developed somatic understanding.

== Connections with other authors ==
Egan's main influence comes from the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]].&lt;ref name="MacNeil_review" /&gt; The idea of applying [[theory of recapitulation]] to education came from 19th century philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], although Egan uses it in a very different way. Egan also uses educational ideas from [[William Wordsworth]] and expresses regret that Wordworth's ideas, because they were expressed in poetry, are rarely considered today.

==In popular culture==
The same year the essay was published (1997), Italian comedian-satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] used Egan's ideas for his character ''Prof. Fontecedro'' in the popular TV show ''Mai dire gol'', aired on [[Italia 1]]. Fontecedro was satirizing the inadequacies of the Italian [[school|school system]], and the reforms proposed by [[Luigi Berlinguer]], 1996-2000 Ministry of Education of Italy. Fontecedro's sketches brought Egan's theory to extreme levels with surreal humor. The [[joke]]s were later published in the book ''Cosmico!'' (1998, [[Mondadori]], {{ISBN|88-04-46479-8}}), where the five stages of mind development are also cited at pp.&amp;nbsp;45–47.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">{{About|the two-body problem of dual-career academic couples|the two-body problem in classical mechanics|two-body problem}}

The '''two-body problem''' is a [[dilemma]] for life partners (for e.g. spouses or any other couple) in [[academia]], relating to the difficulty of both spouses obtaining jobs at the same university or within a reasonable commuting distance from each other. The central dilemma is thus a [[no-win situation]] in which if the couple wishes to stay together one of them may be forced to abandon an academic career, or if both wish to pursue academic careers the relationship may falter due to the spouses being constantly separated.&lt;ref name="Benton2009"&gt;Benton, Thomas H. (pen name of [[William Pannapacker]]) (2009). "[http://chronicle.com/article/Just-Dont-Go-Part-2/44786/ Just Don't Go, Part 2]". ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 13 March 2009, accessed 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Compromises the couple makes while trying to negotiate the two-body problem have implications for gender inequality.&lt;ref name="Wong2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong|first1=Jaclyn|date=16 March 2017 |title=Competing Desires: How Young Adult Couples Negotiate Moving for Career Opportunities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217695520|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=31|issue=2|pages=171–196|doi= 10.1177/0891243217695520 |access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''two-body problem'' has been used in the context of working couples since at least the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Benton2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil &amp; Sher"&gt;{{cite web|last=McNeil|first=Laurie|title=REPORT ON THE DUAL-CAREER-COUPLE SURVEY|url=http://www.physics.wm.edu/~sher/survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It alludes to the insolvable [[three-body problem]] in classical mechanics.

More than 70 percent of academic faculty have a working partner, while more than a third of faculty have an academic partner.&lt;ref name=clayman&gt;{{cite web|author1=Londa Schiebinger |author2=Andrea Davies Henderson |author3=Shannon K. Gilmartin |title=Dual-Career Academic Couples: What Universities Need to Know|url=https://gender.stanford.edu/publications/dual-career-academic-couples-what-universities-need-know|accessdate=19 March 2012|publisher=The Clayman Institute for Gender Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2017}}
Typical solutions include:
* two [[tenure-track]] positions at the same university
* two tenure-track positions at two nearby universities (daily commutes possible)
* two tenure-track positions with one or both partners commuting between two geographically separate institutions (daily commutes impossible because of distance; partners may be separated weekly or for semesters at a time, depending on their circumstances)
* one tenure-track position shared (if they are in the same field)
* one tenure-track position and one instructor position
* one tenure-track position and one industry position
* one tenure-track position and one administration position at a same university
* one tenure-track position and one position in government or with a private consulting firm (feasible in fields such as [[engineering]] and [[management]], probably infeasible in [[humanities]])

Although it is not an ideal solution, a possible outcome is a break-up of the relationship. Long distance commuting certainly places a strain on relationships, especially when maintained over long periods (years or even decades). Many academic institutes recognize the two-body problem is a challenging issue when they hire a new faculty member, and prepare policies to help dual-career academic couples to settle down at their institutions.  An institution in a small, rural state such as [[Wyoming]] may be under increased pressure to hire a spouse than in a large metropolitan area with many colleges and universities such as [[Boston]].

More proactive institutions may establish funds and procedures to assist with this situation.  Frequently a university will seek to hire one person in a couple, thereby making the other the "trailing spouse." One approach is for a tenure-track position to be funded for the trailing spouse be a combination of funds from both academic departments involved with additional funds from the dean and/or provost. Substantial resources must be offered external to the department that would accept the trailing spouse, as this department would not typically be in the position to hire said person nor would that particular person necessarily rank highly if a search were to be conducted.  For this reason, it is not unusual for departments to reject the trailing spouse even if substantial external funds are made available.  This makes the problem particularly intractable, as qualified persons may remain unemployed simply because they are not an ideal fit for the trailing department.  More commonly, institutions do not have such proactive programs in place.

WVU was required to have a Cadet Corps under the terms of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]], which allowed for the creation of [[land-grant college]]s. The [[United States Department of War]]—a predecessor of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Defense]]—offered military equipment to the university at no charge, forming the basis of the school's Military Tactics department. The heavy military influence led to opposition of female enrollment that lasted through the first decade of the university.&lt;ref name="WVU HIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvuhistory.wvu.edu/historyofwvu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130337/http://wvuhistory.wvu.edu/historyofwvu|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 27, 2007|title=West Virginia University: 1867–2003|publisher=West Virginia University|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend changed in 1889, when ten women were allowed to enroll and seek degrees at the university. In June 1891, Harriet Lyon became the first woman to receive a degree from West Virginia University, finishing first in the class ahead of all male students.&lt;ref name="WVU HIST" /&gt; Lyon's academic success supported the acceptance of women in the university as students and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=WVU Student Government|title=Dream Big, Dream Here|publisher=Tapestry Press|year=2007|chapter=8|isbn=1-59830-150-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the University's early years, daily chapel services and roll call for all students were mandatory, limiting time for student recreation. Following the removal of these obligations, students became active in extracurricular activities and established many of the school's first athletic and student organizations. The first edition of the student newspaper known as the ''Athenaeum'', now ''The Daily Athenaeum'', was published in 1887, and the ''[[West Virginia Law Review]]'' became the fourth-oldest law review in the United States when it was founded in 1894. [[Phi Kappa Psi]] was the first [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]] on campus, founded May 23, 1890, while Kappa Delta, the first [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|sorority]] at WVU, was established in 1899.&lt;ref name="WVU HIST" /&gt; The first [[American football|football]] team was formed in 1891, and the first basketball team appeared in 1903.&lt;ref name="Sports Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsintegration.wvu.edu/index.html|title=A History of the Integration of Sports at WVU|publisher=West Virginia University|accessdate=August 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831010953/http://sportsintegration.wvu.edu/index.html|archivedate=August 31, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Boyd Arnold Mascot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Boyd "Slim" Arnold, the first Mountaineer mascot to don the traditional buckskin uniform. His selection in 1937 marked the beginning of an official process to name the mascot annually.]]
The University's outlook at the turn of the 20th century was optimistic, as the school constructed the first library in present-day [[Stewart Hall (Morgantown, West Virginia)|Stewart Hall]] in 1902.&lt;ref name="dhr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/monongalia/80004034.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Stewart Hall|date=March 1980 |accessdate=August 18, 2011|author=Rodney S.

The campus welcomed U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]] to campus for WVU President Thomas Hodges's inauguration in 1911.&lt;ref name="WVU HIST" /&gt; On November 2, 1911, President Taft delivered the address "World Wide Speech", from the front porch of [[Purinton House]].&lt;ref name="dhr2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/monongalia/85003206.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Purinton House|date=July 1985|accessdate=August 18, 2011 |author=Randall Gooden|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the University's efforts to attract more qualified educators, increase enrollment, and expand the campus was hindered during a period that saw two [[World war|World Wars]] and the [[Great Depression]]. With a heavy military influence in the University, many students left college to join the army during [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], and the local [[ROTC]] was organized in 1916.&lt;ref name="WVU Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ia.wvu.edu/~magazine/issues/winter2000/html%20files/yearbyyear.html|title=WVU Year-by-Year|publisher=West Virginia University|accessdate=August 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627064613/http://www.ia.wvu.edu/~magazine/issues/winter2000/html%20files/yearbyyear.html|archivedate=June 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's involvement in the war efforts at home led to the creation of Women's Hall dormitory, now [[Stalnaker Hall]], in 1918.&lt;ref name="dhr3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/monongalia/85003205.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Stalnaker Hall|date=July 1985|accessdate=August 18, 2011 |author=Randall Gooden|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its wartime struggles, the University established the disciplines of [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[journalism]], [[pharmacy]], and the first [[mining engineering|mining]] program in the nation. In 1918, [[Oglebay Hall]] was built to house the expanded [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] programs.&lt;ref name="WVU Timeline" /&gt; Additionally, the first dedicated sports facilities were constructed including "The Ark" for basketball in 1918, and the original [[Mountaineer Field (1924)|Mountaineer Field]] in 1925. Stansbury Hall was built in 1928 and included a new basketball arena named [[WVU Fieldhouse|"The Fieldhouse"]] that held 6,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="WVU BB"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bill Bradley|title=ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game|publisher=ESPN|year=2009|page=36|isbn=0-345-51392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Moore Hall]], the woman's physical education building, was also completed in 1928.&lt;ref name="dhr4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/monongalia/85003208.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Elizabeth Moore Hall|date=July 1985 |accessdate=August 18, 2011|author=Randall Gooden|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Men's Hall]], the first dormitory built for men on campus, was built in 1935, and was funded in part by the [[Works Progress Administration]].&lt;ref name="dhr5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/monongalia/89002309.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Men's Hall|date=January 1989|accessdate=August 18, 2011 |author1=Stanley Bumgardner|author2=Barbara J.

The Mountaineer mascot was adopted during the late 1920s, with an unofficial process to select the Mountaineer through 1936. An official selection process began naming the mascot annually in 1937, with Boyd "Slim" Arnold becoming the first Mountaineer to wear the [[Buckskins|buckskin]] uniform.&lt;ref name="Mascot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=9614|title=The Mountaineer|publisher=MSN Sports|accessdate=August 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714130110/http://msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=9614|archivedate=July 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As male students left for [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1939, women became more prominent in the University and surpassed the number of males on campus for the first time in 1943.&lt;ref name="WVU HIST" /&gt; Soldiers returning from the war qualified for the [[G.I. Bill]] and helped increase enrollment to over 8,000 students for the first time, but the University's facilities were becoming inadequate to accommodate the surging student population.

===A campus divided===
[[File:WVU Evansdale Campus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of the Evansdale campus and many new facilities constructed around 1970, including
the iconic [[WVU Coliseum]]]]
Preparation for the [[baby boomer]] generation and plans for curriculum expansion led to the purchase of land for the Evansdale and Medical campuses. The growth of downtown Morgantown limited the space available on the original campus; therefore, the new site was nearly two miles north on what had been farmland.&lt;ref name="WVU HIST" /&gt; Beginning in the late 1950s the University experienced the most rapid period of growth in its history. In 1957, WVU opened a Medical Center on the new campus and founded the first school of dentistry in West Virginia. The basketball program reached a new level of success when the University admitted future 14‑time [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]] and [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] player [[Jerry West]], who led the team to the national championship game in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/west_bio.html|title=NBA Encyclopedia Playoff Edition
|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As enrollment approached 14,000 in the 1960s, the University continued expansion plans by building the Evansdale Residential Complex to house
approximately 1,800 students, the Mountainlair student union, and several engineering and creative arts facilities on the Evansdale campus. In 1970 the [[WVU Coliseum]], a basketball facility with a capacity of 14,000, opened near the new campus.&lt;ref name="WVU BB" /&gt; As the facilities expanded, the University researched ways to move its growing student population across the split campuses and to solve its worsening traffic congestion. The resulting [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system opened
in 1973 as the world's first automated rapid transit system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveengineer.com/PEWebBackissues2002/PEWeb%2024%20Mar%2002-2/PRT.htm|title=Still in a Class of Its Own|publisher=Progressive Engineer|accessdate=August 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60lRBniz0?url=http://www.progressiveengineer.com/PEWebBackissues2002/PEWeb%2024%20Mar%2002-2/PRT.htm|archivedate=August 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new era===
[[File:Woodburn hall wvu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Woodburn Hall is one of the oldest buildings at West Virginia University and has long been a symbol of the university.]]
The student population continued to grow in the late 1970s, reaching 22,000. With no room for growth on the downtown campus, the [[Mountaineer Field (1924)|football stadium]] was closed, and the new [[Mountaineer Field]] was opened near the Medical campus on September 6, 1980. Mountaineer Field would later be named Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium.&lt;ref name="WVU Timeline" /&gt; After an $8&amp;nbsp;million donation to the University, Ruby Memorial Hospital opened on the Medical campus in 1988,
providing the state's first level-one trauma center. Early the next year, the undefeated Mountaineer football team, led by [[Major Harris]], made it to the national championship game
before losing to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the [[1989 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]].

During the 1990s the University developed several recreational activities for students, including FallFest and WVU "Up All Night". While the programs were created to provide safe entertainment for students and to combat WVU's inclusion as the nation's top [[party school]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandonsun.com/world/breaking-news/list-of-top-party-schools-by-princeton-review-99770794.html?thx+y|title=List of Party Schools By Princeton Review|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=August 13, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also garnered national attention as solutions for reducing alcohol consumption and partying on college campuses across the country.&lt;ref name="WVU UAN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/students-student-life/14364607-1.html|title=WVU officials say program worth the cost|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ia.wvu.edu/~magazine/fall98/alcohol.html Party Response] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928222613/http://www.ia.wvu.edu/~magazine/fall98/alcohol.html |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 a 34 million-dollar, {{convert|177000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} recreation facility opened on

WVU reached a new level of athletic success to start the new millennium. The football team featured a 3‑0 [[BCS&amp;nbsp;bowl]] record, ten consecutive bowl game appearances, a #1&amp;nbsp;ranking in the [[USA Today Coaches Poll|''USA Today'' Coaches' Poll]], three consecutive 11‑win seasons amassing a 33–5 record, 41 consecutive weeks in the top&amp;nbsp;25, and 6 conference championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?sport=football&amp;show=65|title=A Championship Program|publisher=MSN Sports Net|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/rankings/_/year/2007/week/14|title=2007 NCAA Football Rankings – Week 14 (November 25)|publisher=ESPN/AP

On April 24, 2008, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' reported the university had improperly granted an [[MBA]] degree to [[Heather Bresch]], the daughter of the state's governor [[Joe Manchin]] and an employee of [[Mylan]], a pharmaceutical company whose then-chairman Milan Puskar was one of the University's largest donors.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Urbina, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/us/22heather.html?_r=1 "University Investigates Whether Governor's Daughter Earned Degree"], ''New York Times'', January 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, the University determined Bresch's degree had been awarded without having the prerequisite requirements met and rescinded it, leading to the resignation of president [[Michael Garrison (politician)|Michael Garrison]], provost Gerald Lang, and business school dean Steve Sears.

==Campus==
[[File:MountainlairWVU2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Mountainlair]] Student Union is a popular place for students on campus.]]

The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of Morgantown. This part of campus includes eight academic buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Downtown Campus comprises several architectural styles predominantly featuring red brick including Victorian Second Empire, Federal, Neoclassical, and Collegiate Gothic among others. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north-northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the [[Monongahela River]], was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population, since space for expansion was limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center, the Erma Byrd Biomedical Research Facility, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, WVU Healthcare Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, WVU Eye Institute, and the WVU Children's Hospital.

The Health Sciences Campus is near [[Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium|Mountaineer Field]], over a ridge from the Evansdale Campus.

===Transportation===
{{See also|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
[[File:Morgantown PRT - Beechurst Station.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The PRT shuttles students to and from WVU's Health Sciences, Evansdale, and Downtown Campuses.]]
Due to the distance between WVU's three campuses, the university built the innovative Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system to link the campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences) and reduce student traffic on local highways. [[Boeing]] began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in 1972. The unique aspect that makes the system "personal" is that a rider specifies their destination when entering the system and, depending on system load, the PRT can dispatch a car that will travel directly to that station.

WVU students, faculty and staff ride for free; they swipe their magnetically encoded ID&amp;nbsp;cards through the turnstiles when entering the stations. Others pay a cash fare of $0.50. The PRT began operation in 1973, with U.S.&amp;nbsp;President [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride.&lt;ref name="prt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/|title=WVU News and Information Services (July 13, 2004 press release): "WVU PRT Station to Bear Name of People-Mover's Creator"|work=WVUToday|accessdate=October 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111224014/http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/|archive-date=November 11, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day ({{as of|2005|lc=y}}) and uses approximately 70&amp;nbsp;cars.

The system has {{convert|8.7|mi}} of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. [[Steam]] heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/history.htm|title=Some Lessons from the History of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRT cars are painted in the school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the University name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige [[fiberglass]] and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room.

The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] named the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|WVU PRT]] one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,&lt;ref name="prt" /&gt; and in 1997 ''[[The New Electric Railway Journal]]'' picked the WVU PRT as the best [[people mover]] in North America (for 1996).&lt;ref name="best people mover"&gt;"Rating the Rails" (annual performance-ratings feature by transit [[Mode of transport|mode]]), ''[[The New Electric Railway Journal]]'', Spring 1997, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Transportation]] and [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Environmental Protection Agency]] dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nis.wvu.edu/2006/workplace_award.htm "WVU Named One of 'Best Workplaces' for Commuters by EPA, DOT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630142417/http://www.nis.wvu.edu/2006/workplace_award.htm |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the [[Mountainlair]] [[student activity center|student union]] where groups of students participate in the "PRT Cram" with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible. A record of 97 was set in 2000.&lt;ref name="wolfe2005"&gt;{{cite news|first=Billy|last=Wolfe|title=PRT Cram|date=November 1, 2005|url=http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=19842|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111223745/http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=19842|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 11, 2007|work=The Daily Athenaeum|pages=|accessdate=November 6, 2007|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buses and shuttles operated by the university can be used (during limited hours) in addition to the community's Mountain Line, which operates every day into the early morning. Students can use their Mountaineer Card to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-University, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community.

===Libraries===
[[File:Downtown library.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Wise Library on the downtown campus is West Virginia University's main library.]]

The university co-publishes the ''[[Labor Studies Journal]]'' with the [[United Association for Labor Education]].

===Core Arboretum===
The '''Core Arboretum''' is a 91-acre (37 ha) arboretum owned by West Virginia University and on Monongahela Boulevard in Morgantown, West Virginia. It is open to the public daily without charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://arboretum.wvu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arboretum's history began in 1948 when the university acquired its site. Professor Earl Lemley Core (1902-1984), chairman of the Biology Department, then convinced President Irvin Stewart to set the property aside for the study of biology and botany. In 1975 the Arboretum was named in Core's honor.

The Arboretum is now managed by the WVU Department of Biology, and consists of mostly old-growth forest on steep hillside and Monongahela River flood plain. It includes densely wooded areas with 3.5 miles (5.6&amp;nbsp;km) of walking trails, as well as 3 acres (12,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of lawn planted with specimen trees.

The Arboretum has a variety of natural habitats in which several hundred species of native WV trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants may be found. Some of the large trees are likely over 200 years old.

The Arboretum is well known as a superb site to see spring ephemeral wildflowers from late March to early May. Varied habitats and riverside location also make the area an excellent site to observe birds and animals.

===Campus safety===
WVU's campus has been ranked one of the safest in the country by [[Reader's Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/images/content/2008/0802/College-Safety-Survey-Results.pdf|title=College Safety Survey Results|publisher=Reader's Digest|accessdate=August 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103133910/http://www.rd.com/images/content/2008/0802/College-Safety-Survey-Results.pdf|archivedate=November 3, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was largely based on the safety of dorm facilities, emergency preparedness, and security/police staff. The university created WVU Alert, a text-based alert system for quickly disseminating emergency situations to faculty, staff and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.wvu.edu

Some examples include the script West Virginia logo for the WVU Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the interlocking WV logo used in baseball.&lt;ref name="WVU Branding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeservices.wvu.edu/r/download/10258|title=Branding and Communications at WVU|publisher=West Virginia University|accessdate=August 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720121928/http://creativeservices.wvu.edu/r/download/10258|archive-date=July 20, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fight songs of West Virginia University include "[[Hail, West Virginia]]" and "Fight Mountaineers". The [[West Virginia University Alma Mater]] was composed in 1937, and is sung before every home football game. The crowd sings along as the WVU Marching Band stands playing it on the field, as part of the pregame show.

"Old gold and blue", the official University colors, were selected by the upperclassmen of 1890 from the West Virginia state seal.&lt;ref name="WVU Traditions" /&gt; While the official school colors are old gold and blue, a brighter gold is used in official university logos and merchandise. This change in color scheme is often cited for the lack of a universal standard for colors during the 19th&amp;nbsp;century when the university's colors were selected. Additionally, the brighter gold is argued to create a more intimidating environment for sporting events. The university accepts "gold and blue" for the color scheme, but states clearly that the colors are not "blue and gold", to distinguish West Virginia from its rival, the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

"Country Roads" has become the unofficial song of the university and, {{as of|2014|March|8|lc=y}}, one of the official songs of the State of West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Roads, Take Me Home |url=http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Wrapup/pdfs/Vol.XXV_issue8.pdf|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the tradition originated during football games, it is now recognized throughout the university, with the song performed at various athletic events and ceremonies. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the singing of "Country Roads" as one of the must-see college traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[West Virginia University Mountaineer Marching Band|The Pride of West Virginia]] is the official marching band of the university. The band's football pre-game show includes traditions such as the Drumline's "Tunnel" and "Boogie" cadences, the 220‑beat per minute run-on cadence to start the performance, marching the "WV" logo down field to the university fight song, "Fight Mountaineers", expanding circles during ''[[Simple Gifts]]'', and the formation of the state's outline during "[[Hail, West Virginia]]".

The Firing of the Rifle is a tradition carried out by the Mountaineer Mascot to open several athletic events. The Mountaineer points the gun into the air with one arm and fires a blank shot from a custom rifle, a signal to the crowd to begin cheering at home football and basketball games. The Mountaineer also fires the rifle every time the team scores during football games.

The Carpet Roll is a [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|WVU Men's Basketball]] tradition. In 1955 Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball. The university continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player Gale Catlett reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men's basketball team.

'''Western Caspian University''' ({{lang-az|Qərbi Kaspi Universiteti}}) is a [[private university]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. Founded in 1991 by Husein Baghirov, it has six schools, 25 majors, 180 faculty and approximately 1500 students. The university took its name because it is modeled after Western universities in style of instruction and values, the latter in response to some of the corrupt practices under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Husein Baghirov, "[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/94_folder/94_articles/94_husein_baghirov.html Rethinking Education: The Birth of Western University]", ''Azerbaijan International'', (9.4) Winter 2001, accessed on April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the instruction is conducted in English.

In the late 1990s, the school partnered with American universities, such as [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]], to help set up its programs in business and law.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Bate, "[http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/112098/text/usia.htm USIA grant to fund SPEA-Azerbaijan faculty exchanges]", ''IU Home Pages'', November 20, 1998, accessed on April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIEDA, "[http://www.indiana.edu/~ird/cieda/azerbaijan.htm Public Administration Curriculum Development: Western University, Azerbaijan]", accessed on April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its partnerships were formed through the now defunct [[United States Information Agency]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9521">'''William Frederick Mellor''' was an English missionary who spent considerable time of his missionary endeavour in [[Sagamu|Ijebu-Remo]]. He embraced some of the culture of Remo and ended up being conferred a chieftaincy title by the [[Akarigbo of Remo|Akarigbo]]. Upon his retirement, he left Nigeria in 1957 but returned in 1966 to work with [[Tai Solarin]] at [[Mayflower School]], [[Ikenne]].

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Mellor was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], a city heavily influenced by the pottery industry, he came from a generation of potters, his great grandfather and grandfather worked for [[Mintons]] while his father worked for the [[Wedgwood]] company.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=6}} Mellor's father died when he was a child and at the age of 14, Mellor embraced his family's career path and apprenticed at the ceramic firm of George Woolliscroft to earn some income and support the family. For a year, he worked on making lead free [[Ceramic glaze|ceramic glazed]] tiles. In 1907, he changed firms and began a seven year apprenticeship with a pottery decoration company working on a variety of products produced by the city's potters. He attended [[Stoke-on-Trent College|Cauldon School]] and on Sundays, he usually attended the St Jude's Anglican Church but an encounter with a local Methodist preacher who was a bench mate at work prodded him to join the Wesleyan Church. He gradually became involved in the activities of the church becoming a Sunday school teacher at the local Methodist church and lay preacher within the Staffordshire area.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=7}}  While preparing to be a priest, Mellor began to develop little interest in various Methodist meetings and decided a life of missionary will be a better fit for him, originally having in mind working in India. Mellor wanted to study medicine and theology and before completing his apprenticeship, he took classes under the tutelage of the [[Workers' Educational Association]].{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=9}} Between June and July, 1914, he started college education at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] working with [[R. H. Tawney]] on economic history but his education was interrupted by War. Mellor continued ministerial education in Staffordshire for a year before enlisting in the [[Royal Navy]]. He joined Devonport Depot and initially posted on [[HMS Eclipse (1894)|HMS Eclipse]], when a search was done for recruits with medical degrees or had past shown interest in medicine, his name caught the attention of the navy and he was posted to the navy hospital in [[Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar|Gibraltar]]. Towards the latter part of the War, he toured [[Freetown]] and [[Lagos]] with [[HMS Africa (1905)|HMS Africa]] protecting convoy of cargo ships, it was at one of the stops at [[Freetown]], he decided a change of missionary service from India to West Africa. In 1916, his junior brother who was with the [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|HMS Indefatigable]] during the [[Battle of Jutland]] died.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=13}} In 1919, Mellor was demobilized and he was able to return to studies. He attended Handsworth College, Birmingham University and completed his education in 1921 with a degree in theology.
===Remo===
In 1921, Mellor sailed for [[Lagos]] to start a career as a [[Methodist]] [[missionary]]. Prior to his start, pioneer Wesleyan missionaries had earlier arrived in Ijebu in 1893, shortly after the Ijebu [[Expeditionary warfare|Expedition]] resulted in British occupation of Ijebu  Ode and ended the [[Ijebu Kingdom|kingdom's]] blockade of trade going to the coast. Shortly thereafter, Olumuyiwa Haastrup who was an adviser to the Akarigbo, wrote to the Wesleyan Church in London for a proposed mission house, while at the meantime, a Catechist can be provided and expense will be paid until the church finds it suitable to maintain a mission in Remo. In 1893, the Wesleyan Church sent a priest, H.J. Ellis and three un-ordained missionaries to Remo. The three missionaries built a mission house at [[Iperu, Ogun|Iperu]] from where they moved to other towns.

When Mellor arrived in [[Nigeria]], he spent some weeks with Wesleyan priests who were already living in the country. In March 1922, he was posted to Sagamu to replace the outgoing priest as superintendent of [[Ijebu Kingdom|Ijebu]] division. [[Sagamu]] was founded to replicate the structure of [[Abeokuta]], a town consisting of villages and lineages converged together for defense purposes. In Ijebu and Ijebu-Remo, the Methodist Church was already established in the district with about 22 mission stations, close to 2,000 converts and 12 chapels.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=33}} Mellor's efforts consolidated the presence of the Church and increased participation of community members in the activities of the Church. He developed cordial relationship with the local residents and was sometimes called upon to mediate conflicts between the residents and their [[Oba (ruler)|Obas]] or British colonists. To seek new converts, the Methodists employed monthly open air church services as part of their [[evangelical]] mission and was a significant way it garnered more converts within the community. At the Ijebu-Remo mission, he was assisted by a group of women including Mrs Kuti, Janet Adegunle and Julie Sokoya with the proselytizing of the mission.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=41}}

Mellors missionary activities within Remo also had its challenges, the church grew in Ijebu-Ode with the effort of J.A. Adegboyega and Pa Oworu and in Sagamu, Oba Adedoyin was a regular Sunday service attendee and the Oluwole family helped establish the church in Sagamu. But many of these elites who helped develop the mission were [[polygamists]] who had great influence behind the scenes but were ineligible for official leadership positions or full membership. The official position was for the men to reduce the surplus wives in order to attain full position with the church. Mellor opposed this attitude, he discouraged the men to do this or had to find ways to create a suitable just and careful arrangement for women if the men decide to live a [[monogamous]] life.

Mellor's success was visible in education, he started classes for [[catechists]] and another for new converts as preparation for induction to the Methodist Church.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=39}} His job as superintendent also involved managing the church's primary schools within the circuit. There was a  lack of secondary education facilities in the area for boys and girls, only one secondary school in the region, [[Ijebu Ode Grammar School]] then headed by Rev [[Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti|Ransome Kuti]] and girl's education was not fully supported with a proportion of 1 girl to 8 boys. Mellor developed craft training sessions for woman. He also encouraged girls education and cooperated with the local Anglican mission and Muslim community to establish Remo Secondary School, the first [[co-education]] secondary school in the country and Girls Secondary School, Shagamu. The girls secondary school developed a training class for teachers so as to increase the numbers of female teachers in the district.{{sfn|olusola|1973|p=43}} His interest in education led to his appointment as the representative of the Methodist order on the regional board of education where he was able to influence acceptance of co-education within the region. He also introduced the [[Boys' Brigade|Boys]] and [[Girls' Brigade]] movement to Ijebu and Remo and was an influential leader who contributed to sustain the Boys Brigade during the [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial period]].

Mellor also cultivated friendship with Akarigbo [[William Adedoyin]] and used his relationship and citizenship with colonists to help actualise Adedoyin's desire for an independent Remo division. In 1950, he was posted to [[Badagry]] and in 1957, he retired from missionary work.

===Mayflower===
While working in Remo, Mellor met a young Tai Solarin who was a looking for someone to recommend him for service with the Royal Air force.{{sfn|Mellor|1969|p=8}} Both individuals later developed a relationship and Mellor came to represent the Methodist mission in Nigeria during its independence in 1960, Solarin asked him to come back to [[Ikenne]] and be a part of his new school. In 1966, Mellor finally returned to Remo and acted as an adviser to Solarin and managed the school's husbandry, at the school, he was popularly referred to as Baba.{{sfn|Mellor|1969|p=8}}

Mellor influenced Solarin, an atheist to allow the creation of a chapel on school grounds.

===Personal===
Mellor was married to Cecilia who followed him to Remo. In 1930, she was wounded during a riot in [[Opobo]].{{sfn|Olusola|1973|p=95}} Mellor loved geography and travelling visiting most African countries with the exception of two.

== Overview ==
The university's stated mission is to advance [[global education]] through a tuition-free Master’s degree program in [[Financial Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wqu.totemapp.net/?token=qQx1KNHBpL941MQTL_X2 WQU Enrollment Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the university does not charge [[tuition]], students are advised to buy [[Textbook|course materials]] for around US $1000.00 over two years, and small fees for two required proctored exams&lt;ref&gt;

===York St Mary's===
{{main|St Mary's Church, Castlegate, York}}

York St Mary's is a contemporary art space in the deconsecrated church of [[St Mary's Church, Castlegate, York|St Mary's, Castlegate]].&lt;ref name=StMarysArt&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to York St Marys |url=http://www.yorkstmarys.org.uk/Page/yorkstmarys.aspx |publisher=York Museums Trust |accessdate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017100232/http://www.yorkstmarys.org.uk/Page/YorkStMarys.aspx |archivedate=17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first use of the space was a joint exhibition by a number of artists, but since 2005 St Mary's has hosted installations by individuals, which are changed on a regular basis. The first of these commissions, inspired by the medieval building itself, was a textile work by Caroline Broadhead called ''Breathing Spaces''. This was followed by ''Echo'', a work by Susie MacMurray.
In 2012, Laura Belem created ''The Temple of a Thousand Bells'', which used individually-made clear glass bells in a composition combining bell chimes with a narrative describing how a temple sinks into the sea, silencing the music of a thousand bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.jorvik.co.uk/st-marys-castlegate/ |work= Jorvik an illustrated guide to York |  title=   St Mary’s Church, Castlegate |publisher= jorvik.co.uk | accessdate= 28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocallink.co.uk/events/arts-culture/2012/05/installation-the-temple-of-a-thousand-bells.aspx |work=Events Arts &amp; Culture |title=Installation: The Temple of a Thousand Bells |publisher=yourlocallink.co.uk |accessdate=28 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031102707/http://www.yourlocallink.co.uk/events/arts-culture/2012/05/installation-the-temple-of-a-thousand-bells.aspx |archivedate=31 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
