'''''A Storm of Swords''''' is the third of seven planned novels in ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', a [[fantasy]] series by American author [[George R. R. Martin]]. It was first published on August 8, 2000, in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Locus 2000-11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2000/Reviews/BookReview11bMillerOnMartin.html|title=Locu  Online Reviews: ''A Storm of Swords'' (August 2000)|last=Miller|first=Faren|date=November 2000|work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]|publisher=LocusMag.com|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a United States edition following in November 2000. Its publication was preceded by a novella called ''Path of the Dragon'', which collects some of the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel into a single book.

At the time of its publication, ''A Storm of Swords'' was the longest novel in the series. It was so long that in the UK, Australia, and Israel, its paperback edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as ''Steel and Snow'' in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as ''Blood and Gold'' in August 2001 (with a specially-commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, the decision was made to cut the novel into four separate volumes.

''A Storm of Swords'' won the 2001 [[Locus Award]],&lt;ref name="WWE-2001"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2002 [[Geffen Award]] for Best Novel and was nominated for the 2001 [[Nebula Award]] for Best Novel.&lt;ref name="WWE-2001"/&gt; It was the first novel in the series to be nominated for the [[Hugo Award]], one of the two most prestigious awards in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] publishing, although it lost to [[J. K. Rowling]]'s novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name="WWE-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2001-hugo-awards/ |title=2001 Hugo Awards |publisher=The Hugo Awards |date=2001-09-03 |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/672et6No6?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2001-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meisha Merlin Publishing]], which had previously issued limited, illustrated editions of both ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'' and ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', was planning to release a similar version for ''A Storm of Swords'' in two volumes; however, lengthy delays in the release of ''A Clash of Kings'' caused it to lose its publishing rights, which were picked up by [[Subterranean Press]]. This edition, illustrated by [[Charles Vess]], was released in the summer of 2006.

''A Storm of Swords'' is also the name of the second expansion to the [[board game]] ''[[A Game of Thrones (board game)|A Game of Thrones]]'', released in July 2006. Approximately the first half of the novel was adapted for television as the [[Game of Thrones (season 3)|third season]] of the [[HBO]] show ''[[Game of Thrones]]'',&lt;ref name="GRRM 11 April 2012"&gt;{{cite web|first=George R.

==Plot summary==
{{redirect|The Red Wedding|the television adaptation of the scene|The Rains of Castamere}}
''A Storm of Swords'' picks up the story slightly before the end of its predecessor, ''A Clash of Kings''. The Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]] are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Five_Kings War of the Five Kings] at ''A Wiki of Ice and Fire'' westeros.org, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[Joffrey Baratheon]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]] compete for the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] while [[Robb Stark]] and [[Balon Greyjoy]] declare their independence. Meanwhile, a large host of [[wildlings]] approach [[the Wall (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Wall]] under the leadership of [[Mance Rayder]], the self-proclaimed "King Beyond the Wall", with only the undermanned [[Night's Watch]] in opposition. Finally, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] approaches [[Pentos (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Pentos]].

===In the Seven Kingdoms===

====The North / The Riverlands====
At [[Riverrun (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Riverrun]], [[Catelyn Stark]] offers the captive [[Jaime Lannister]] his freedom in exchange for Catelyn's daughters, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who Catelyn believes are held by the Lannisters in [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]]. Jaime is sent south, escorted by [[Brienne of Tarth]]. Catelyn makes this deal without the approval of her son Robb, the King in the North, and is taken prisoner upon its discovery. Robb's army returns to Riverrun, having vanquished [[Tywin Lannister]]'s armies in the Westerlands, and Robb reveals that he has married [[Jeyne Westerling]], invalidating his promise to be wed to a daughter of [[House Frey]]. Jaime's release infuriates Lord Rickard Karstark, whose two sons Eddard and Torrhen had been killed by Jaime in battle; and in revenge, Karstark kills two young Lannister captives. To secure his authority and atone for these deaths (thus preventing the Lannisters from executing Stark prisoners), Robb executes Lord Rickard, losing the support of House Karstark as a result.

Jaime and Brienne are waylaid by the Brave Companions (now in the service of [[Roose Bolton]]) and taken to [[Harrenhal]]. Their captain Vargo Hoat orders Jaime's sword hand cut off, hoping the blame will be placed on Bolton, but Jaime is sent to King's Landing after he assures Lord Bolton he will absolve him to his father. Brienne is thrown into a [[bear]] pit by Hoat, and Jaime risks his own life to rescue her. He also tells her that he had killed the former King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] because he planned to burn the city and its inhabitants with wildfire to spite Robert Baratheon.

Robb's forces dwindle further at the Battle of Duskendale, wherein the eastern half of the Stark's armies, under the command of Roose Bolton, are ambushed by a joint army under [[Gregor Clegane]] and Lord Randyll Tarly. More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile, the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] now hold the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin, thus barring Robb from returning to his homeland. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord [[Hoster Tully]] dies, Catelyn's brother [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that Balon Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon's brothers, as well as his daughter [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]], vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb's marriage.

Arya Stark and her friends encounter the "Brotherhood Without Banners", led by Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] and the red priest [[Thoros of Myr]]: originally sent by Eddard Stark to put down the Lannister raids, the band now defends the [[peasant|smallfolk]] of the Riverlands. The group encounters [[Sandor Clegane]], known as the Hound, who abandoned Joffrey during the Battle of the Blackwater, and offers him [[trial by combat|trial by battle]], which he wins by killing Beric, but Thoros resurrects Beric thereafter. Arya is kidnapped by the Hound for ransom, and they proceed to Riverrun. On their journey, they discover that Robb and Catelyn will be at Edmure's wedding at the Frey bridge-stronghold [[The Twins (A Song of Ice and Fire)|The Twins]], and change their destination accordingly.

Robb Stark's army reaches the Twins, where Walder agrees to forgive Robb if the wedding between Edmure and Roslin takes place. At the wedding celebration, the Boltons and Freys turn on the Stark soldiers, massacring the Stark forces. Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, while Catelyn has her throat cut by Raymund Frey and her body is thrown into the adjacent river. Many of the northern lords are killed, and the survivors captured. Edmure, after consummating his marriage, is kept as a hostage. These events become known as the Red Wedding.

It is thereafter revealed that Roose Bolton engineered the defeat at Duskendale by sending Robb's soldiers into a trap set by the Lannisters, while holding his own forces in reserve, and arranging that all but his own forces would be slaughtered in rearguard. The combined effect was to kill off the forces of other Northern houses loyal to Robb while leaving the Bolton army unscathed. Tywin Lannister (the King's Hand and grandfather) rewards Roose by naming House Bolton the Great House of the North, in place of [[House Stark]]. The crown also legitimizes Roose's bastard son [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] as a Bolton and the new Lord of Winterfell.

Arya and the Hound arrive at the outskirts of the castle as the Red Wedding is taking place; to keep her from running inside to her death, the Hound knocks Arya unconscious and takes her downriver. As she sleeps, Arya sees through the eyes of her long-missing direwolf, Nymeria, that her mother Catelyn is dead, the direwolf pulling Catelyn's body from the river. Arya and the Hound encounter Gregor Clegane's men, by whom the Hound is wounded. His wound becomes infected, and Arya abandons him. She finds a ship from the Free City of [[Braavos]] and asks for passage to Eastwatch, but the captain refuses her passage until she offers him the coin and password "Valar Morghulis", given to her by [[Jaqen H'ghar]]. The captain replies "Valar Dohaeris", and they set sail.

In the [[epilogue]], a re-animated but decayed and mutilated Catelyn is leading the Brotherhood Without Banners, and she oversees the lynching of two Freys present at the Red Wedding.

====The South / King's Landing====
After the Battle of the Blackwater, [[Davos Seaworth]] is taken to Dragonstone by men loyal to King Stannis. Stannis survived the Blackwater due to Rolland Storm commanding his rearguard and enabling him to escape to the fleet. Davos blames the red priestess [[Melisandre]] for Stannis's defeat and the deaths of his four eldest sons, and is imprisoned for treason (Melisandre having foreseen his intention to assassinate her). At Melisandre's behest, Stannis releases Davos and asks him to serve as his Hand. Stannis' previous Hand, his wife's uncle Lord Alester Florent, tried to make terms with the Lannisters behind Stannis' back, and has thus been arrested. With Stannis' cooperation, Melisandre has performed rituals to awaken "stone dragons", which she identifies as the great statues adjacent to the castle.

King's Landing welcomes the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] as liberators, and King Joffrey sets aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of [[Margaery Tyrell]]. Sansa is soon compelled to marry [[Tyrion Lannister]] to enable Lannister control of the North and to foil a Tyrell plot to marry her to Willas Tyrell and claim the North themselves. However Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage against her will.

Word reaches King's Landing of the sudden death of Balon Greyjoy, followed by news of the Red Wedding. Joffrey gloats that he has "won" the war; whereas the governing Small Council is shocked to learn that Tywin secretly masterminded the Red Wedding. Tyrion warns his father that the defeated Northerners will not quietly submit to Bolton rule, but Tywin dismisses his warning. Later, Tyrion realizes that Joffrey sent the assassin who attempted to kill [[Bran Stark]] at Winterfell, and thus [[A Game of Thrones|set the war in motion]].

Margaery and Joffrey's wedding is held as planned, but during the ensuing festivities, King Joffrey is poisoned and dies. Tyrion is accused of the murder by his sister [[Cersei Lannister]] and placed on trial. Sansa is smuggled out of the castle by the jester Dontos Hollard, and taken to Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish]], who has Dontos killed and admits culpability in Joffrey's death and Tyrion's framing, incriminating Margaery's grandmother Olenna Tyrell as well. Littlefinger and Sansa depart King's Landing for [[the Eyrie]], Littlefinger scheming to marry Catelyn's sister [[Lysa Arryn]] with the blessing of the Small Council to gain the support of House Arryn.

Davos discovers a request by the Night's Watch for aid against [[Mance Rayder]] and the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]]. Melisandre tries to persuade Stannis to sacrifice [[Edric Storm]], a bastard son of Stannis' late brother King [[Robert Baratheon]], to wake the dragons. Stannis is reluctant, though he uses Edric's blood in leeches to curse the three rival Kings. After Balon, Robb and Joffrey die, apparently proving the power of King's blood, Davos has Edric smuggled to safety. Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but is prevented when Davos shows Stannis the Night's Watch's plea.

Jaime and Brienne reach King's Landing to find that Joffrey's younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon]] will inherit the throne; Tyrion is on trial; and the Tyrell bannermen blame Brienne for [[Renly Baratheon]]'s death. Jaime's severed right hand becomes infected, but he is healed by former maester Qyburn, who was thrown out of the Citadel for forbidden experiments, earning Qyburn the admiration of Cersei. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey, rejects Cersei's advances, and becomes Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but refuses his father's offer of [[Casterly Rock]], whereupon Tywin disinherits him. Jaime frees Brienne and gives her a sword reforged from Ice, Ned Stark's sword. He tells her to keep her oath to Catelyn, to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. Against Tyrion, Cersei recruits the spymaster [[Varys]] and Tyrion's lover, [[Shae (character)|Shae]]. Tyrion is approached by Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] of [[Dorne]], who offers a trial by combat against Cersei's champion, Gregor Clegane, who he knows was responsible for the death of his sister Elia. Oberyn nearly emerges victorious, but is ultimately killed by Gregor, although the poison on Oberyn's spear leaves Gregor dying in agony. Tyrion is again condemned to death but is freed by Jaime and Varys. Jaime reveals that Tyrion's first wife Tysha, who Tywin had gang-raped by his garrison and forced Tyrion to participate, was not a prostitute as Tywin told him, and genuinely loved Tyrion. Outraged, Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin, and tells Jaime he murdered Joffrey and that Cersei took other lovers while he was Robb Stark's captive. During Tyrion's escape, he strangles Shae and kills Tywin in his privy before fleeing Westeros.

At the Eyrie, Littlefinger and Lysa are married, and Sansa remains hidden by pretending to be an illegitimate daughter of Littlefinger's, named Alayne Stone. Lysa reveals that Littlefinger had convinced her to poison [[Jon Arryn]], her late husband, to prevent her son from being fostered to Stannis Baratheon, and to write to Catelyn that Arryn had been poisoned by the Lannisters, which was the catalyst for the events of ''A Game of Thrones''. Lysa threatens to kill Sansa, thinking she is trying to seduce Littlefinger, but Littlefinger intervenes and, after revealing that he had only ever loved Catelyn, pushes Lysa to her death.

===On the Wall===
The detachment of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] awaits word from [[Qhorin Halfhand]] and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] at their forward base. The Watch are attacked by [[undead]] [[wights]] and the Others, suffering heavy casualties; but [[Samwell Tarly]] kills one of the Others with a blade of [[obsidian|dragonglass]]. At Craster's Keep, some of the Watch [[mutiny]] and kill Mormont and Craster, but Sam escapes with the help of one of Craster's daughter-wives, Gilly, and they and the girl's newborn child approach the Wall, assisted by a strange figure riding an [[elk]], whom Sam calls Coldhands. Among the dead are most of the Watch's senior leadership.

Bran Stark, his servant [[Hodor (character)|Hodor]], [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] and [[Meera Reed]] are guided north by Bran's dreams of a three-eyed crow. At the Wall, Sam guides them to Coldhands and returns to Castle Black, having sworn to keep Bran's survival secret even from Jon.

Jon convinces Mance that he is a deserter from the Night's Watch and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor [[Ygritte]] also begin a sexual relationship. Mance seeks the legendary Horn of Winter to shatter the Wall. After climbing the Wall, the wildlings press Jon to murder a homeless man. When Jon refuses, the wildlings turn on him but Jon, with the assistance of Bran's direwolf Summer (Bran and company are hiding in a nearby abandoned tower), kills many of the wildlings and escapes to Castle Black. The approaching wildling army reaches Castle Black and assaults the Wall; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, [[Janos Slynt]] and [[Alliser Thorne]] imprison Jon for treachery and subsequently send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the wildling camp, the army of King Stannis arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Melisandre believes the wildling invasion to portend the return of the Great Other, the sworn foe of her god [[R'hllor]]. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but when his direwolf Ghost unexpectedly returns, Jon decides to decline Stannis' offer. Before he can inform Stannis, Jon is chosen by the Night's Watch as its new Lord Commander.

===Across the Narrow Sea===
Heading for [[Pentos (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Pentos]] by sea, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] learns that large slave armies can be bought in the cities of [[Slaver's Bay]], and exchanges one of her infant dragons for the entire host of the warrior-eunuch [[The Unsullied|Unsullied]]. Upon payment, which includes Drogon (the largest and strongest of her dragons), Daenerys orders the Unsullied to turn on their former masters and sack the city. With the help of her maturing dragons, she frees all the slaves of [[Astapor]]. Daenerys' [[Army|horde]] then conquers the slaver city of [[Yunkai]]; but the lords of neighbouring [[Meereen]] antagonize Daenerys by killing child slaves and burning the land to deny her resources. Consequently, Daenerys besieges the city to no avail.

Daenerys discovers two traitors in her camp: Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], who had spied on her for Varys, informant to the late King Robert Baratheon, in exchange for a royal pardon; and Arstan Whitebeard, an alias of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], the humiliated former Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. Daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends by sneaking into Meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. Meereen soon falls and, in retaliation for the murdered child slaves, Daenerys has the city's rulers put to death. Selmy asks for Daenerys' forgiveness and becomes Lord Commander of her Queensguard while Jorah, who refuses to admit any wrong, is banished. When Daenerys learns that the council she left in Astapor has been overthrown, she decides to rule Meereen to practice for the rule of Westeros.

In contrast, he referred to the chapter of Joffrey's fatal wedding as "easy and fun to write" but that he nevertheless tried to instill empathy for the painful demise of this very unpopular character and "bring home the point that this, too, was a human being who was scared and terrified and then dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/To_Be_Continued_Chicago_IL_May_6_83/ |title=The Citadel: So Spake Martin - To Be Continued (Chicago, IL; May 6–8) |publisher=Westeros.org |date=2005-05-06 |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''George R.

==Reception==

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said the third volume was "one of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the chill of ice, the smell of the sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention."&lt;ref name=pw_review_asos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-553-10663-3 |title=Fiction review: ''A Storm of Swords'' |publisher=publishersweekly.com |date=October 30, 2000 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santo Domingo de Silos entronizado como obispo, por Bartolomé Bermejo.jpg|thumb|St. [[Dominic of Silos]] enthroned as abbot (Hispano-Flemish Gothic 15th century)]]

'''Abbot''', meaning father, is an [[ecclesiastic]]al [[title]] given to the [[male]] head of a [[monastery]] in various traditions, including [[Christianity]]. The [[office]] may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is [[abbess]].

==Origins==
The title had its origin in the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], spread through the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. The word is derived from the [[Aramaic]] ''av'' meaning "father" or ''abba'', meaning "my father". In the [[Septuagint]], it was written as "abbas".&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abbey Austin|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A–Ak&amp;nbsp;– Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk, but it was soon restricted by [[canon law]] to certain priestly superiors. At times it was applied to various priests, e.g. at the court of the Frankish monarchy the ''Abbas palatinus'' ("of the palace"') and ''Abbas castrensis'' ("of the camp") were chaplains to the Merovingian and Carolingian sovereigns’ court and army respectively. The title abbot came into fairly general use in western [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] [[order (religious)|orders]] whose members include priests.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

An abbot (from [[Old English]] ''abbod'', ''abbad'', from [[Latin]] ''abbas'' (“father”), from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀββᾶς'' (abbas), from Aramaic ''ܐܒܐ''/''אבא'' (’abbā, “father”); confer German ''Abt''; French ''abbé'') is the head and chief governor of a community of monks, called also in the East ''[[hegumen]]'' or ''[[archimandrite]]''.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} The English version for a female monastic head is [[abbess]].

===Early history===
In [[Egypt]], the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint [[John Cassian]] speaks of an abbot of the [[Thebaid]] who had 500 monks under him. By the [[Rule of St Benedict]], which, until the [[Cluniac reforms]], was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluniac]] Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognised.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the [[sacrament]]s, and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the [[ordination]] of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become [[deacon]]s, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the [[first Council of Constantinople]], AD 448, 23 [[archimandrite]]s or abbots sign, with 30 [[bishop]]s.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The [[second Council of Nicaea]], AD 787, recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders{{sfn|Venables|1911}} below the [[deacon|diaconate]], a power usually reserved to bishops.

Abbots used to be subject to [[bishop|episcopal]] jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The [[Code of Justinian]] (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an ''imperium in imperio,'' and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his [[diocese]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

===Later Middle Ages===
{{main|Mitre#Christian clergy|l1=Mitres}}
In the 12th century, the abbots of [[Fulda monastery|Fulda]] claimed precedence of the [[archdiocese of Cologne|archbishop of Cologne]]. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of [[mitre]], ring, gloves and sandals.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

It has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, ''Liturgische Gewandung'', p.&amp;nbsp;453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], [[St Albans Abbey|St Alban's]], [[Bardney Abbey|Bardney]], [[Battle Abbey|Battle]], [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St Edmunds]], [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Augustine's Canterbury]], [[Colchester Abbey|Colchester]], [[Crowland Abbey|Croyland]], [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], [[Gloucester Abbey|Gloucester]], [[St Benet's Abbey|St Benet's Hulme]], [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde]], [[Malmesbury Abbey|Malmesbury]], [[Peterborough Abbey|Peterborough]], [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey]], [[Reading Abbey|Reading]], [[Selby Abbey|Selby]], [[Shrewsbury Abbey|Shrewsbury]], [[Tavistock Abbey|Tavistock]], [[Thorney Abbey|Thorney]], [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], [[Winchcombe Abbey|Winchcombe]], and [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-03.htm#ecclmap Government in Church and State] from ''University of Wisconsin-Madison'' retrieved 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Ramsey Abbey|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, the mitred abbots that sat in the [[Estates of Scotland]] were of [[Arbroath Abbey|Arbroath]], [[Cambuskenneth Abbey|Cambuskenneth]], [[Coupar Angus Abbey|Coupar Angus]], [[Dunfermline Abbey|Dunfermline]], [[Holyrood Abbey|Holyrood]], [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], [[Kelso Abbey|Kelso]], [[Kilwinning Abbey|Kilwinning]], [[Kinloss Abbey|Kinloss]], [[Lindores Abbey|Lindores]], [[Paisley Abbey|Paisley]], [[Melrose Abbey|Melrose]], [[Scone Abbey|Scone]], [[St Andrews Cathedral Priory|St Andrews Priory]] and [[Sweetheart Abbey|Sweetheart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cowan |first= Ian B. |author-link= |last2= Easson |first2= David E. |author2-link= |title=Medieval Religious Houses: Scotland With an Appendix on the Houses in the Isle of Man |edition= 2nd |year=1976 |publisher=Longman |location= London and New York |isbn=0-582-12069-1}} pp. 67-97&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their [[crosier|pastoral staff]] (the crosier) should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The adoption of certain episcopal insignia ([[pontificalia]]) by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the [[First Council of the Lateran|Lateran council]], AD 1123. In the East abbots, if in priests' orders and with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|second Nicene council]], AD 787, to confer the [[tonsure]] and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD 1489 permitted by [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate.  Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the [[canon law]].  One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}&lt;!-- but paragraph lower down in EB1911--&gt;

====Appointments====
When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the [[abbey|convent]], but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In [[abbey]]s exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and [[benediction]] had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to [[Rome]]. It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The ceremony of the formal admission of a [[Benedictine]] abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the [[Consuetudinary (book)|consuetudinary]] of Abingdon.  The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession.  After proceeding up the [[nave]], he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his [[commissary]], and placed in his stall.  The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his [[staff of office]].  He then put on his shoes in the [[vestry]], and a [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==General information==
Before the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house.  When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed.  His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king.  No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society.  The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table.  In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks.  In the West the [[Rule of St Benedict]] appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers.  Because this permission opened the door to luxurious living, [[Synods of Aachen (816–819)]], decreed that the abbot should dine in the [[refectory]], and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots.  When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his [[chaplain]]s waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[File:Template-Abbot - Provost.svg|right|thumb|Arms of a Roman Catholic abbot are distinguished by a gold [[crozier]] with a veil attached and a black [[galero]] with twelve tassels (the galero of a [[territorial abbot]] would be green)]]
The ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire.  Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]].  Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of [[Leicester]], c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting.  In magnificence of equipage and [[retinue]] the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm.  They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants.  The bells of the churches were rung as they passed.  They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}  This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially.  For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], judicially murdered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons.  The [[abbots of Cluny]] and [[Trinity Abbey, Vendôme|Vendôme]] were, by virtue of their office, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s of the Roman church.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

In the process of time, the title abbot was extended to [[clergy#Catholic clergy|clerics]] who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and under the [[Charlemagne|Carolingians]] to the chief chaplain of the king, ''{{lang|la|Abbas Curiae}}'', or military chaplain of the emperor, ''{{lang|la|Abbas Castrensis.}}'' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials.  Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at [[Genoa]] was called ''{{lang|la|Abbas Populi}}''.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Lay abbot]]s (M. Lat. ''{{lang|la|defensores}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbacomites}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates laici}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates milites}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates saeculares}}'' or ''{{lang|la|irreligiosi}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbatiarii}}'', or sometimes simply ''{{lang|la|abbates}}'') were the outcome of the growth of the [[Feudalism|feudal]] system from the 8th century onwards.  The practice of [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]], by which—to meet a contemporary emergency—the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,
early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held ''in [[commendam]].''{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

During the Carolingian epoch, the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable [[fiefdom|fiefs]] or [[benefice]]s, and by the 10th century, before the great [[Cluniac]] reform, the system was firmly established. Even the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey of St Denis]] was held in commendam by [[Hugh Capet]]. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever.  In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the [[council of Cloveshoe]].  These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions.  The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other.  The [[enfeoffment]] of abbeys differed in form and degree.  Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as [[dean (religion)|dean]] (decanus), but also as abbot (''abbas legitimas'', ''monasticus'', ''regularis'').{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

When the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, with the head of the community retaining the title of dean.  The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West.  John, [[patriarch of Antioch]], at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, ''bencficiarii,'' for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported (''Itinerary'', ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:
{{quote|for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.}}

In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a [[prior]].

==Modern practices==
In the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the [[Carthusians]] for instance, have no abbots, only [[prior]]s). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the pope,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows, a certain number of years of establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.

[[File:Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi.jpg|thumb|220px|Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi (on the left) of [[Monastery of the Holy Spirit]], a [[Trappist]] monastery in [[Conyers, Georgia|Conyers]], Georgia, US.]]
The abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks. Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the [[mitre]], the ring, and the [[crosier]] as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of Holy Orders (although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy).

Once he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of "exempt religious" in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.

The abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.

[[Territorial abbot]]s follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.

==Abbatial hierarchy==
In some monastic families, there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots. In some cases, this is the result of an abbey being considered the "mother" of several "daughter" abbeys founded  as dependent priories of the "mother." In other cases, abbeys have affiliated in networks known as "congregations." Some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order.

* The abbot of [[Sant'Anselmo]] di Aventino, in Rome, is styled the "abbot primate," and is acknowledged the senior abbot for the Order of St. Benedict (O.S.B.)
* An abbot president is the head of a congregation (federation) of abbeys within the Order of St. Benedict (for instance, the English Congregation, The American Cassinese Congregation, etc.), or of the Cistercians (O. Cist.)
* An archabbot is the head of some monasteries which are the motherhouses of other monasteries (for instance, [[Saint Vincent Archabbey]], [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], Pennsylvania)
* [[Mauro-Giuseppe Lepori]] O. Cist. is the current Abbot General of the Cistercians of the Common Observance.

==Modern abbots not as superior==
The title [[abbé]] (French; Ital. ''abate''), as commonly used in the Catholic Church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English "Father" (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the [[tonsure]].  This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the [[concordat]] between [[Pope Leo X]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1516), to appoint ''abbés commendataires'' to most of the abbeys in France.  The expectation of obtaining these [[sinecure]]s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abbés so formed—''abbés de cour'' they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) ''abbés de sainte espérance'', (abbés of holy hope; or the [[jeu de mots]], of St. Hope)—came to hold a recognized position.  The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the title of abbé, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising [[celibacy]] and wearing a distinctive dress—a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar.  Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abbé. The class did not survive the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]; but the [[courtesy title]] of abbé, having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman.

==Eastern Christian==
{{further|Hegumen|Archimandrite}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the abbot is referred to as the ''hegumen''. The Superior of a convent of nuns is called the ''Hēguménē''. The title of ''archimandrite'' (literally the head of the enclosure) used to mean something similar.

In the East{{huh|date=December 2016}}, the principle set forth in the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' still applies, whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop. Those monasteries which enjoy the status of being ''stauropegiac'' will be subject only to a [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] or his [[Synod]] of Bishops and not the local bishop.

==Honorary and other uses of the title==
Although currently in the Western Church the title "abbot" is given only abbots of monasteries, the title archimandrite is given to "monastics" (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of [[monsignor]] in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the [[Orthodox Church]], only monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of [[Archpriest]] or [[Protopresbyter]]. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been [[widow]]ed. Since the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.

In the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|German Evangelical Church]], the German title of ''Abt'' (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French ''abbé'', as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.
Of these the most noteworthy is [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Hanover]], founded as a [[Cistercian]] house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Loccum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence over all the clergy of Hanover, and was ''ex officio'' a member of the [[wiktionary:consistory|consistory]] of the kingdom.  The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the "convent" of ''[[Stiftsherr]]en'' (canons).

In the [[Church of England]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], by royal decree given by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], also holds the honorary title of "Abbot of St. Benet."  This title hails back to England's separation from the See of Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monasteries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benet, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth, and lived like simple beggars, deposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.

Additionally, at the [[enthronement]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], there is a threefold enthronement, once in the throne the chancel as the [[diocesan bishop]] of [[Canterbury]], once in the [[Chair of St. Augustine]] as the [[Primate of All England]], and then once in the chapter-house as Titular Abbot of Canterbury.

There are several Benedictine abbeys throughout the [[Anglican Communion]].  Most of them have mitred abbots.

==Abbots in art and literature==
[[File:Houghton Typ 515.38.456a - Totentanz, 14.jpg|thumb|"The Abbot", from the ''[[Dance of Death]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]
"The Abbot" is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of ''[[Danse Macabre]]''.

The lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to Christian [[hagiography]], one of the most well-known being the ''Life of St. [[Benedict of Nursia]]'' by St. [[Gregory the Great]].

During the years 1106–1107 AD, Daniel, a Russian Orthodox abbot, made a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]] and recorded his experiences. His diary was much-read throughout [[Russia]], and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive. [[Joseph Volotsky|Saint Joseph]], Abbot of [[Volokolamsk]], Russia (1439–1515), wrote a number of influential works against [[heresy]], and about monastic and liturgical discipline, and Christian [[philanthropy]].

In the [[Redwall|''Tales of Redwall'' series]], the creatures of Redwall are led by an abbot or abbess.  These "abbots" are appointed by the brothers and sisters of Redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care, much like real abbots.

"The Abbot" was a nickname of [[RZA]] from the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].

'''''Allegro Non Troppo''''' is a 1976 Italian [[Animation|animated]] film directed by [[Bruno Bozzetto]]. Featuring six pieces of classical music, the film is a [[parody]] of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', two of its episodes being derived from the earlier film.&lt;ref name=deseret&gt;{{cite news | author=Chris Hicks | title=Allegro Non Troppo | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000059/Allegro-Non-Troppo.html | work=[[Deseret News]] | date=1991-03-12 | accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical pieces are set to color animation, ranging from comedy to deep tragedy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/bruno-bozzetto-to-receive-asifa-prize/|title=Bruno Bozzetto to Receive ASIFA Prize|website=www.animationmagazine.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning, in between the animation, and at the end, there are black and white live-action sequences, displaying the fictional animator, orchestra, conductor and filmmaker, with many humorous scenes about the fictional production of the film.&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; Some of these sections mix animation and live action.

The film was released in two versions. The first includes live action sequences in between the classical pieces; the second version of the film omits these, replacing them with animated plasticine letters spelling out the title of the next piece of music.

==Title==
In music, an instruction of "allegro ma non troppo" means to play "fast, but not overly so". Without the "ma", it means "Not So Fast!", an interjection meaning "slow down" or "think before you act".

The common meaning of "allegro" in Italian is "joyful". The title reveals therefore a dual meaning of "allegro", and in addition to meaning "Not So Fast!" can also be read as "joyful, but not too much".

== Program ==
*[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'', an elderly satyr repeatedly attempts to cosmetically recapture his youth and virility, all in vain.&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt;  With each failure, the satyr gets smaller and smaller, until he roams across a vast countryside which turns out to be a woman's body.
*[[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s [[Slavonic Dances|Slavonic Dance No. 7, Op. 46]], begins in a large community of cave-dwellers. A solitary cave man wants to better himself and builds himself a new home. From this point on, the rest of the community copies everything that he does.&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; He is annoyed that everyone is able to keep up with his advances so quickly. His attempts to break away from them leads to his planning a bizarre act of mass vengeance with unintended and humorous consequences.
*[[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'', primordial sugar water at the bottom of a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle left behind by space travelers attains life, and progresses through fanciful representations of the stages of evolution and history until skyscrapers destroy all that has come before. This segment parallels ''The Rite of Spring'' segment from ''Fantasia'', complete with a solar eclipse. Its opening moment was used as the image for the film poster.
*[[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]]'s ''[[Valse triste (Sibelius)|Valse triste]]'', a cat wanders in the ruins of a large house. The cat remembers the life that used to fill the house when it was occupied.&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; Eventually all of these images fade away,  as does the cat, just before the ruins are demolished.
*[[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s Concerto in C major for 2 Oboes, 2 Clarinets, Strings and Continuo RV 559, a female bee prepares to dine on a flower in elaborate style replete with utensils and a portable TV, but is continually interrupted by two lovers sitting down for a romantic interlude on the grass.&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; After having her meal interrupted several times, each time being forced to gather up her things and scramble to safety, she finally decides enough is enough and the male lover gets it in the end.
*[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'' (specifically ''The Princesses' Khorovod'' and ''The Infernal Dance of King Katschey'') begins with a lump of clay molded by a monotheistic symbol of the omniscient pyramid, first making a few unsuccessful creatures with overly awkward limbs, then finally the [[Adam and Eve]] as portrayed in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. Adam and Eve then transform into cel animation and, as in Genesis, the serpent comes up to them, offering the fruits of knowledge in the form of an [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|apple]]. After they refuse it the serpent swallows the apple himself. Falling asleep, he is immediately plunged into a nightmare in a hellish environment where he is first tormented by fiery demons and then plagued by things that are supposed to corrupt humankind (sex, alcohol, money, material objects, drugs, violence);&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; he also grows arms and legs and is magicked into a suit and [[fedora]]. When the music ends after he wakes up, he is still wearing the suit and hat but after telling Adam and Eve his dream in a fast-motion and incomprehensible manner, he sheds the suit (losing his arms and legs but keeping the hat) and spits up the still-whole apple.
*In an [[epilogue]] sequence (which features an assortment of short, unidentified orchestral clips instead of a single piece, though Slavonic Dance No. 7 can be very briefly heard again towards the end) the film's host asks an animated [[Igor (fictional character)|Igor]]-type monster (identified as "Franceschini") to retrieve a finale for the movie from a basement storeroom. Franceschini rejects several of these, but delightedly approves of one which depicts a ridiculously escalating war, ending with the earth exploding. The action returns to the host and the conductor discussing their next project. After a bit of brainstorming the host reveals his latest original and brilliant idea: ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' with the title ''Sleeping Beauty''. This scene turns out to be another finale being watched by Franceschini. After it ends, the serpent from the ''Firebird Suite'' pops out and bites him on the nose, and the words "HAPPY END" drop on them, the serpent coming out of the "D". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://366weirdmovies.com/152-allegro-non-troppo-1976/|title=152. ALLEGRO NON TROPPO (1976)|date=29 August 2013|website=366weirdmovies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live action sequences===
The uncut film also contains comic live action sequences, in black and white blended with occasional color animations, that parody the [[Deems Taylor]] introductions from ''Fantasia''.   "The Presenter" ([[Maurizio Micheli]]) starts off with an exaggerated version of Taylor's opening introduction in ''Fantasia'' ( "A new and original film" .. "you will see the music and hear the drawings" .. "a fantasia") only to be interrupted by a phone call from California informing him that the movie had already been done.  He angrily objects, dismissing the caller as an ill-mannered liar, explaining to the audience that the caller claims that someone ("Prisney", "Grisney", "some American") had done this years before, then telling the caller to at least watch the movie and hangs up.  Next the Presenter introduces "The Orchestra Master" (Néstor Garay) and an orchestra made up of little old ladies as the Orchestra Master roughly rounds them up into a large trailer for transport to the theater. As the trailer heads out to the theater the Presenter exults "Pisney has already done this?".  Lastly before the first animated music segment (''Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune''), the Presenter introduces "The Animator" ([[Maurizio Nichetti]]).&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; as the Orchestra Master retrieves him from a dungeon-like cell in which the Animator ("a free artist") is chained to a wall (as the Presenter puts it: "a binding contract based on trust and mutual respect").   A pretty young cleaning woman (Marialuisa Giovannini) also appears in each segment, although she's barely acknowledged by any of the characters except the Animator (who seems to take an increasing fancy to her as the movie progresses). Each sequence portrays action (like the tossing of a Coca Cola bottle) that leads directly into the next animated portion of the film and occasionally includes references to a previous segment (such as a chamberpot appearing on the Orchestra Master's head or the female bee and the serpent from their respective segments appearing briefly in the subsequent live-action sequences). After the "Ravel's Bolero" chapter, a gorilla (inspired by the animated character in the Bolero) also appears a few times, first chasing then dancing with The Animator, then later beating up the Orchestra Master who has attacked the Animator.  After the ''Firebird'' sequence, the Animator transforms the cleaning woman into a cartoon fairy tale princess and himself into a prince before both float away leaving the Presenter and Orchestra Master without a finale leading into the epilogue sequence.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/events/disney-museum-pays-tribute-bozzetto/|title=Disney Museum Pays Tribute to Bozzetto|website=www.animationmagazine.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology of art''' is a sub-field in [[social anthropology]] dedicated to the study of [[art]] in different cultural contexts. The anthropology of art focuses on historical, economic and aesthetic dimensions in non-Western art forms, including what is known as '[[tribal art]]'.

==History==
[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern [[anthropology]], conducted many field studies of the arts, helping create a foundation to the field. His book, ''Primitive Art'' (1927), summarizes his main insights into so-called 'primitive' art forms, with a detailed case study on the arts of the Northwest Pacific Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas. (1927) ''Primitive art''.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] took Boas' analyses further in his book ''The Way of the Masks'', where he traced changes in the plastic form of Northwest Pacific masks to patterns of intercultural interaction among the indigenous peoples of the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss. (1982) ''The Way of the Masks''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Problem of Art==
One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Layton. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is no consensus on a single, cross-cultural definition of 'art' in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Morphy &amp; Morgan Perkins. (2006) Introduction, in ''The Anthropology of Art: A Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Angioni, ''Fare dire sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture'', Nuoro, il Maestrale, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'. More recently, in his book ''Art and Agency'', [[Alfred Gell]] proposed a new definition of 'art' as a complex system of intentionality, where artists produce art objects to effect changes in the world, including (but not restricted to) changes in the aesthetic perceptions of art audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Gell. (1998) ''Art and Agency''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gell's ideas have stirred a large controversy in the anthropology of art in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Bowden.

The society was originally the idea of the lawyer [[Charles Henry Bellenden Ker|Bellenden Ker]] and was founded at a meeting in the house of the famous painter [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]], attended by Eastlake, Ker, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi, and Edmund Oldfield. The society's purpose was to promote knowledge of the art works of the old Italian, Flemish, and other European masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Nineteenth Century|title=The Arundel Society|author=[[William Henry Gregory|Gregory.

==Arundel Club==
The '''Arundel Club''' was a society founded in London in 1904 for the purpose of continuing more effectively the work of the Arundel Society, which had encouraged the study of art by reproducing the best works of the old masters.  The Arundel Club went further by copying and publishing important works in private collections previously inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMaCnQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Arundel+Club&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF4s6fxv_TAhVIOyYKHd_3ACYQ6AEIJzAA|title=The Arundel Club: For the Publication of Reproductions of Works of Art in Private Collections and Elsewhere|first=Arundel|last=Club|date=20 May 2017|publisher=J.J.

The '''[[Banaue]] Rice Terraces''' ({{lang-fil|Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe}}) are [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]s that were carved into the mountains of [[Ifugao]] in the [[Philippines]] by the ancestors of the [[Igorot|indigenous people]]. The terraces are occasionally called the "[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;Filipinasoul.com.[http://www.filipinasoul.com/the-best-of-the-philippines-its-natural-wonders/  ‘The Best’ of the Philippines - its natural wonders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105023206/http://www.filipinasoul.com/the-best-of-the-philippines-its-natural-wonders/ |date=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Statistical Coordinating Body of the Philippines.

These are fed by an ancient [[irrigation]] system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would ''encircle half of the globe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 Department of Tourism: Ifugao Province] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302155750/http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 |date=2009-03-02 }}. Accessed September 04, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locals up to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://famouswonders.com/banaue-rice-terraces-in-ifugao/|title=Banaue Rice Terraces Pictures, Photos &amp; Facts - Ifugao,|website=famouswonders.com|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic "steps", which require constant reconstruction and care. In 2010, a further problem encountered was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France-Presse [http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/03/09/10/drought-ravages-famed-banaue-rice-terraces] Drought ravages famed Banaue rice terraces. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the terraces are believed by many to be over a 2,000 years old as postulated by anthropologist [[Otley Beyer]]. Several researchers however dispute this and contend that the terraces were built much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabreza|first1=Vincent|title=For Ifugao rice terraces, age should not matter|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/445493/for-ifugao-rice-terraces-age-should-not-matter|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Inquirer.net|date=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ifugao Rice Terraces may be younger than we think|url=https://www.rappler.com/science-nature/society-culture/91521-ifugao-rice-terraces-age|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Rappler|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also giant [[Earthworm]]s ("Olang" in [[Ifugao language|Ifugao]]) of the genus [[Pheretima]] or Polypheretima elongata which are supposed to destroy the terraces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giant worms destroying ancient rice terraces|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/1512010/Giant-worms-destroying-ancient-rice-terraces.html|accessdate=21 September 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=3 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from rodents of the genus [[Chrotomys mindorensis|Chrotomis mindorensis]], and snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insights-philippines.de/riceterraces.htm|title=The brittle Steps to the Sky – T|website=www.insights-philippines.de|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cultural significance==
===Ifugao rice culture===
[[File:The Bulol.jpg|thumb|left|The Bulol, an Ifugao rice god.]]

The terraces are found in the province of Ifugao and the Ifugao people have been its caretakers. Ifugao culture revolves&lt;ref name = "“Vietnam &amp; the Philippines. Wonders of the Asian World "&gt;'' World Heritage Sites and Schlessinger Media and {{ISBN|9781417103423}}''&lt;/ref&gt; around rice, and the culture engenders an elaborate array of celebrations linked with agricultural rites from rice cultivation to rice consumption. The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called ''tango'' or ''tungul'' (a [[day of rest]]) entail a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the ''bayah'' rice wine), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practice during the festivities.

The Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labour at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces entails constructing retaining walls with stones and [[rammed earth]] which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao’s rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members. Ifugao previously belong to the [[Mountain Province]] as a municipality but on June 18, 1966 in effect of [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act No. 4695]], Ifugao became an independent province.

===Organic farming===
In March 2009 the Ifugao rice terraces were declared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ifugao rice terraces are GMO-free--officials | url= http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20090317-194605/Ifugao-rice-terraces-are-GMO-free--officials| work=Philippine Daily Inquirer| accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; free from [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified organisms (GMO)]]. An event declaring this achievement was organized in Dianara Viewpoint in collaboration with local and municipal government, Greenpeace, and the Miss Earth Foundation.

===Official heritage designation===

The Banaue Rice Terraces refer to the cluster close to the Banaue poblacion as seen from the viewpoint. Contrary to popular belief perpetrated by its inclusion on the [[Philippine twenty peso bill|twenty peso banknote]], the Banaue Rice Terraces are not a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They were not included in the UNESCO inscription [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]] due to the presence of numerous modern structures, making it score low in the integrity criterion of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.banauericeterrace.com/banaue/|title = Banaue Rice Terrace|date = |accessdate = September 4, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five clusters inscribed as part of the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are Batad, Bangaan, Hungduan, Mayoyao Central and Nagacadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/722/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=853| work=UNESCO| accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batad and Bangaan are under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Banaue but are not called the Banaue Rice Terraces.

The Banaue Rice Terraces were declared by the Philippine government as a National Cultural Treasure under Ifugao Rice Terraces by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 260 in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1973/pd_260_1973.html|title = Presidential Decree No. 260 August 1, 1973|date = |accessdate = September 5, 2014|website = The Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:Photographer at Banaue Rice Terraces.jpg|thumb|A tourist taking a photograph of the rice terraces.]]
Another thriving economy in the Banaue Rice Terraces is [[tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eighth Wonder of the World| url= http://www.visitbanaue.com/ | work=Visit Banaue | accessdate=2009-07-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090602195314/http://www.visitbanaue.com/| archivedate= 2 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tourism industry has developed a number of activities for visitors which may include the traditional [[Tourism|sight seeing]] of the terraces and visits to the tribes at the foot of the terraces. A ''[[Witch doctor|Mumbaki]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Mumbaki| url=http://blogs.inquirer.net/beingfilipino/2009/03/23/preserving-the-ifugao-heritage/| work=Philippine Daily Inquirer| accessdate=2009-07-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529005632/http://blogs.inquirer.net/beingfilipino/2009/03/23/preserving-the-ifugao-heritage/| archivedate=2009-05-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (traditional Ifugao witch doctor) is also recommended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribal rituals cleanse, unite towns | url= http://services.inquirer.net/mobile/09/05/17/html_output/xmlhtml/20090517-205443-xml.html| work=Philippine Daily Inquirer| accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to visitors, these doctors can perform spiritual healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tourismontheedge.com/hidden-places/asia/banaue-rice-terraces-a-treasure-from-the-ancestors|title=Banaue Rice Terraces, the Eighth Ancient World Wonder?|date=2012-08-28|work=Tourism on the Edge|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Domestic tourism however has gone down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Down on Domestic Tourism | url= http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20080518-137286/Down-on-Domestic-Tourism| work=Philippine Daily Inquirer| accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the past few years. A contributing factor to this is the treatment of domestic tourists by the local guides in the area where it has been reported that local guides are more willing to entertain foreign visitors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Batad Environmental Tour Guides Association (BETGA) in association with the Batad Baranguay authorities are currently laying a concrete track down from the Batad Saddle to the village proper.

The park is featured on the reverse side of the 1985 series of the [[Philippine one thousand peso note]] as well as the reverse side of the 2010 series of the [[Philippine twenty peso note]].

==Other notable rice terraces in Ifugao==

Aside from the Banaue Rice terraces there are 4 other similar terraces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Banaue Rice Terraces| url= http://www.philsite.net/banaue.htm| work=PhilSite| accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ifugao Is Famous For... |url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 |work=Wow Philippines |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302155750/http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 |archivedate=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil type here in this mountainous province are that ones like what they used to fabricate clay pot or a clay jar, (also used in the construction by firing clay), the Batad Rice Terraces, Mayoyao Rice Terraces in [[Mayoyao, Ifugao|Mayoyao]], Hapao Rice Terraces and Kiangan Rice Terraces. The Batad Rice Terraces are located in Barangay Batad in Banaue, these terraces shaped resembles an amphitheatre. The Mayoyao Rice Terraces are for a rice variety called "tinawon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Ifugao exports 2.5 tons of 'Tinawon' rice |url= http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;sec=reader&amp;rp=2&amp;fi=p061009.htm&amp;no=20&amp;date= | work=PIA.gov| accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rare type of organic rice which are grown in red and white variety in these terraces. The Hapao Rice Terraces are located in [[Hungduan]], these terraces are stone-walled from Sagada rock formation and date back to 650 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Rice Terraces-Banaue |url= http://www.luzpalma.com/Rice%20Terraces.html | work=Luz alma| accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kiangan Rice Terraces is are in Banaue, on which are grown the rice varieties of nagacadan and julungan.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
* In the ending scene of the movie [[Avengers: Infinity War]], the film’s main villain [[Thanos]] (played by [[Josh Brolin]]) is seen walking out of a small hut to watch the sunset on a vista of mountains and rice paddies.  Bangkok-based Indochina Productions who provided the image for the film production confirmed that the image is of the Banaue Rice Terraces.&lt;ref&gt;https://coconuts.co/manila/lifestyle/phs-banaue-rice-terraces-featured-avengers-infinity-war/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnphilippines.com/entertainment/2018/04/26/avengers-infinity-war-banaue-rice-terraces.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''beizi''''' ([[wikt:褙子|褙子]]) is an item of traditional Chinese attire common to both men and women, a large loose coat. It was most popular during the [[Song Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]]. The origin date of beizi is unknown, and someone believed that ''beizi'' and ''[[banbi]]'' had been adopted from [[Central Asia]] during the [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] through the [[Silk Road]] when cultural exchanges were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Ji-Won.

The gender difference is that while wide-sleeved ''beizi'' were considered formal wear for women (narrow-sleeved ''beizi'' were casual wear for women), both wide and narrow-sleeved ''beizi'' were only used as casual wear for men. It has a parallel/straight-collar (對襟) with side slits beginning at the armpit or at the waist. It can be secured at the front either with ties or a metal button.{{Verify source|date=June 2012}}

The relationship between '''biology and sexual orientation''' is a subject of research. While scientists do not know the exact cause of [[sexual orientation]], they theorize that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and social factors determine it.&lt;ref name="Frankowski"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.113.6.1827 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/6/1827?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=%22Sexual+orientation+and+adolescents%22&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |author=Frankowski BL |author2=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|title=Sexual orientation and adolescents |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=113|issue=6 |pages=1827–32 |date=June 2004|pmid=15173519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamanna"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Ann Lamanna|author2=Agnes Riedmann|author3=Susan D Stewart|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1305176898|year=2014|page=82|accessdate=February 11, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fofaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|quote=The reason some individuals develop a gay sexual identity has not been definitively established &amp;nbsp;– nor do we yet understand the development of heterosexuality.

==Empirical studies==
===Twin studies===
A number of [[twin study|twin studies]] have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation. In a 1991 study, Bailey and Pillard conducted a study of male twins recruited from "homophile publications", and found that 52% of [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic (MZ)]] brothers (of whom 59 were questioned) and 22% of the [[Twin#Fraternal (sororal; dizygotic) twins|dizygotic (DZ)]] twins were [[Concordance (genetics)|concordant]] for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Pillard, RC |title=A Genetic Study of Male Sexual Orientation |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=1089–96 |year=1991 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1991.01810360053008 |pmid=1845227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'MZ' indicates identical twins with the same sets of genes and 'DZ' indicates fraternal twins where genes are mixed to an extent similar to that of non-twin siblings. In a study of 61 pairs of twins, researchers found among their mostly male subjects a concordance rate for homosexuality of 66% among monozygotic twins and a 30% one among dizygotic twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexual orientation in twins: a report on 61 pairs and three triplet sets|year=1993|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|volume=22|issue=3|pages=187–206|author=Whitam FL|displayauthors=etal|doi=10.1007/bf01541765|pmid=8494487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Bailey, Dunne and Martin studied a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins but reported less than half the level of concordance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Dunne MP, Martin NG |title=Genetic and environmental influences on sexual orientation and its correlates in an Australian twin sample |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=524–36 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10743878 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.3.524 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/78/3/524}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. Self reported [[zygosity]], sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was [[Serology|serologically]] checked when in doubt. Other researchers support biological causes for both men and women's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, Scott L. 2001. Biological Factors in the Development of Sexual Orientation. Pp. 27–51 in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identities and Youth: Psychological Perspectives, edited by Anthony R. D’Augelli and Charlotte J. Patterson. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press. Quoted in Bearman and Bruckner, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bearman and Brückner (2002) criticized early studies concentrating on small, select samples&lt;ref name=Bearman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bearman P. S. |author2=Bruckner H. |year=2002 |title=Opposite-sex twins and adolescent same-sex attraction |url=http://iserp.columbia.edu/content/opposite-sex-twins-and-adolescent-same-sex-attraction |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=1179–1205 |doi=10.1086/341906 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175100/http://iserp.columbia.edu/content/opposite-sex-twins-and-adolescent-same-sex-attraction |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.483.4722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-representative selection of their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;While inconsistent with modern findings, the first relatively large-scale twin study on sexual orientation was reported by [[Franz Josef Kallmann|Kallman]] in 1952. (''See:'' {{cite journal |author=Kallmann FJ |title=Comparative twin study on the genetic aspects of male homosexuality |journal=J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=283–97 |date=April 1952 |pmid=14918012 |doi= |url=}}). Examining only male twin pairs, he found a 100% concordance rate for homosexuality among 37 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, compared to a 12%–42% concordance rate among 26 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, depending on definition. In other words, every identical twin of a homosexual subject was also homosexual, while this was not the case for non-identical twins. This study was criticized for its vaguely described method of recruiting twins and for a high rate of [[mental illness|psychiatric disorders]] among its subjects. (''See'' Rosenthal, D., "Genetic Theory and Abnormal Behavior" 1970, New York: McGraw-Hill.)&lt;/ref&gt; They studied 289 pairs of identical twins (monozygotic, or from one fertilized egg) and 495 pairs of fraternal twins (dizygotic, or from two fertilized eggs) and found [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance rates]] for same-sex attraction of only 7.7% for male identical twins and 5.3% for females, a pattern which they say "does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context".&lt;ref name=Bearman/&gt;

A 2010 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins)&lt;ref name="karolinska"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Långström N, Rahman Q, Carlström E, Lichtenstein P |title=Genetic and environmental effects on same-sex sexual behavior: a population study of twins in Sweden |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=75–80 |date=February 2010 |pmid=18536986 |doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9386-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that same-sex behavior was explained by both heritable factors and individual-specific environmental sources (such as prenatal environment, experience with illness and trauma, as well as peer groups, and sexual experiences), while influences of shared-environment variables such as familial environment and social attitudes had a weaker, but significant effect.  Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects.  The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;

{{quote|text=Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34–.39 of the variance [of sexual orientation], the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61–.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18–.19 for genetic factors, .16–.17 for shared environmental, and .64–.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="karolinska"/&gt;}}

====Criticisms====
Twin studies have received a number of criticisms including [[self-selection bias]] where homosexuals with gay siblings are more likely to volunteer for studies. Nonetheless, it is possible to conclude that, given the difference in sexuality in so many sets of identical twins, sexual orientation cannot be attributed solely to genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel Todd |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |title=Psychology |date=2011 |publisher=New York, NY Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1429237192 |page=435 |edition= 2nd |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/35310322 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is the finding that even monozygotic twins can be different and there is a mechanism which might account for monozygotic twins being discordant for homosexuality. Gringas and Chen (2001) describe a number of mechanisms which can lead to differences between [[Twin#chorionicity|monozygotic twins]], the most relevant here being chorionicity and amniocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-3782(01)00171-2 |last1=Gringas |first1=P. |last2=Chen |first2=W. |year=2001 |title=Mechanisms for difference in monozygous twins |url= |journal=Early Human Development |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=105–117 |pmid=11440823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dichorionic twins]] potentially have different hormonal environments because they receive maternal blood from separate placenta, and this could result in different levels of brain masculinisation. Monoamniotic twins share a hormonal environment, but can suffer from the 'twin to twin transfusion syndrome' in which one twin is "relatively stuffed with blood and the other exsanguinated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Seth G. N. |title=Michael Rutter: Genes and behavior: nature-nurture interplay explained |journal=Genes, Brain and Behavior |date=April 2006 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=303 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-183x.2006.00219.x |language=en |issn=1601-1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromosome linkage studies===
Chromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993 [[Dean Hamer]] and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamer DH, Hu S, Magnuson VL, Hu N, Pattatucci AM |title=A linkage between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation |journal=Science |volume=261 |issue=5119 |pages=321–7 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8332896 |doi=10.1126/science.8332896 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8332896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested were found to have similar alleles in the distal region of [[Xq28]], which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the "'''gay gene'''" in the media, causing significant controversy.  Sanders et al. in 1998 reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side.&lt;ref name= "Born gay321"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Glenn |last2=Rahman |first2=Qazi |title=Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Owen Publishers |isbn=9780720613094 |edition= 2nd |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later analysis by Hu et al. replicated and refined the earlier findings.  This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X chromosome at Xq28.&lt;ref name=Huetal95&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu S, Pattatucci AM, Patterson C |title=Linkage between sexual orientation and chromosome Xq28 in males but not in females |journal=Nat.

Mustanski et al. (2005) performed a full-genome scan (instead of just an X chromosome scan) on individuals and families previously reported on in Hamer et al. (1993) and Hu et al. (1995), as well as additional new subjects. In the full sample they did not find linkage to Xq28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mustanski BS, Dupree MG, Nievergelt CM, Bocklandt S, Schork NJ, Hamer DH |title=A genomewide scan of male sexual orientation |journal=Hum.

Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012.&lt;ref name=camb20141117&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sanders AR, Martin ER, Beecham GW, Guo S, Dawood K, Rieger G, Badner JA, Gershon ES, Krishnappa RS, Kolundzija AB, Duan J, Gejman PV, Bailey JM |date = November 2014 |title = Genome-wide scan demonstrates significant linkage for male sexual orientation |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033291714002451 |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume = 45 |issue = 7 |pages = 1379–88 |doi = 10.1017/S0033291714002451 |pmid = 25399360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] markers. The data strongly replicated Hamer's Xq28 findings as determined by both two-point and multipoint (MERLIN) LOD score mapping.  Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer lab's previous genomewide study.  The authors concluded that "our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation".

In addition to [[allosome|sex chromosomal]] contribution, a potential [[autosomal]] genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood type A between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They also found that "unusually high" proportions of homosexual males and homosexual females were [[Rh factor|Rh negative]] in comparison to heterosexuals. As both blood type and Rh factor are genetically inherited traits controlled by [[alleles]] located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 1 respectively, the study indicates a potential link between genes on autosomes and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis L |author2=Ficek C |author3=Burke D |author4=Das S |title=Eye Color, Hair Color, Blood Type, and the Rhesus Factor: Exploring Possible Genetic Links to Sexual Orientation |journal=Arch.

The biology of sexual orientation has been studied in detail in several animal model systems.  In the common fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the complete pathway of sexual differentiation of the brain and the behaviors it controls is well established in both males and females, providing a concise model of biologically controlled courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pavlou HJ, Goodwin SF |title=Courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster: towards a 'courtship connectome' |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=76–83 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23021897 |pmc=3563961 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2012.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology altered the sexual preferences of female mice by removing a single gene linked to reproductive behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20609214 |year=2010 |last1=Park |first1=D |last2=Choi |first2=D |last3=Lee |first3=J |last4=Lim |first4=DS |last5=Park |first5=C |title=Male-like sexual behavior of female mouse lacking fucose mutarotase |volume=11 |pages=62 |doi=10.1186/1471-2156-11-62 |pmc=2912782 |journal=BMC Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism. According to Dean Hamer and Michael Bailey, genetic aspects are only one of the multiple causes of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-gay-gene-is-back-on-the-scene-1536770.html |title=The 'gay gene' is back on the scene |first=Steve |last=Connor |date=31 October 1995 |website=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10637532/Being-homosexual-is-only-partly-due-to-gay-gene-research-finds.html |title=Being homosexual is only partly due to gay gene, research finds |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |date=13 February 2014 |website=The Telegraph |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published an article with a [[genome wide association study]] on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named '''SLITRK6''' on [[chromosome 13]] was identified, and contains an area or DNA sequence which is different for gay men than for heterosexual men.&lt;ref name="Nature21"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=Alan R. |last2=Beecham |first2=Gary W. |last3=Guo |first3=Shengru |last4=Dawood |first4=Khytam |last5=Rieger |first5=Gerulf |last6=Badner |first6=Judith A. |last7=Gershon |first7=Elliot S. |last8=Krishnappa |first8=Ritesha S. |last9=Kolundzija |first9=Alana B. |last10=Duan |first10=Jubao |last11=Gejman |first11=Pablo V. |last12=Bailey |first12=J.

Levay's research suggested that the [[hypothalamus]] of gay men is different from straight men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeVay |first1=S. |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |date=30 August 1991 |volume=253 |issue=5023 |pages=1034–1037 |pmid=1887219 |issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLITRK6 is active in the mid-brain where the hypothalamus is. The researchers found another gene, named "thyroid stimulating hormone receptor" (TSHR) on chromosome 14 which dna sequence is different also for gay men.&lt;ref name="Nature21" /&gt; TSHR stimulates thyroid and [[grave disease]] interrupted the function of TSHR.

===Epigenetics studies===
{{Main|Epigenetic theories of homosexuality}}
A study suggests linkage between a mother's genetic make-up and homosexuality of her sons. Women have two X chromosomes, one of which is "switched off". The inactivation of the X chromosome occurs randomly throughout the embryo, resulting in cells that are mosaic with respect to which chromosome is active. In some cases though, it appears that this switching off can occur in a non-random fashion. Bocklandt et al. (2006) reported that, in mothers of homosexual men, the number of women with extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation is significantly higher than in mothers without gay sons.  13% of mothers with one gay son, and 23% of mothers with two gay sons, showed extreme skewing, compared to 4% of mothers without gay sons.&lt;ref name="Bocklandt et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocklandt S, Horvath S, Vilain E, Hamer DH |title=Extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation in mothers of homosexual men |journal=Hum.

===Birth order===
{{Main|Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation}}
Blanchard and Klassen (1997) reported that each additional older brother increases the odds of a man being gay by 33%.&lt;ref name="Blanchard and Klassen 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P |title=H-Y antigen and homosexuality in men |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=185 |issue=3 |pages=373–8 |date=April 1997 |pmid=9156085 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1996.0315 |url=http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/sex/H-Y%20anitgen.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.602.8423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/health/10gene.html |title=Pas de Deux of Sexuality Is Written in the Genes |date=10 April 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Wade |first1=Nicholas }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now "one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in homosexual versus heterosexual males and females |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=8 |issue= |pages=27–67 |year=1997 |pmid=10051890 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus.
This maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH) begins when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth.&lt;ref name="Anthony2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Anthony F. Bogaert]] |author2=[[Malvina Skorska]] |last-author-amp=yes |title=Sexual orientation, fraternal birth order, and the maternal immune hypothesis: a review |journal=[[Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=247–254 |date=April 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.004 |pmid=21315103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which are "almost certainly involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates".
These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, increasing the likelihood that the exposed son will be more attracted to men than women.&lt;ref name="Anthony2011"/&gt;
It is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and 'remember'. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinisation.&lt;ref name="Blanchard and Klassen 1997"/&gt;

However, the maternal immune hypothesis has been criticized because the prevalence of the type of immune attack proposed is rare compared with the prevalence of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitehead NE |title=An antiboy antibody? Re-examination of the maternal immune hypothesis |journal=J Biosocial Sci |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=905–921 |year=2007 |pmid=17316469 |doi=10.1017/S0021932007001903|citeseerx=10.1.1.573.5483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fraternal birth order effect" however, cannot account for between 71-85% of male homosexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Blanchard, Paterson, &amp; Bogaert, 2002; Blanchard &amp; Bogaert, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it does not explain instances where a firstborn child displays male homosexual preference (MHP).&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 2011; Rieger et al., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think [[Neuroligin 4 Y-linked]] protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bogaert |first1=Anthony F. |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Wang |first3=Chao |last4=Gabrie |first4=José |last5=MacNeil |first5=Adam J. |last6=Hoffarth |first6=Mark R. |last7=VanderLaan |first7=Doug P. |last8=Zucker |first8=Kenneth J. |last9=Blanchard |first9=Ray |title=Male homosexuality and maternal immune responsivity to the Y-linked protein NLGN4Y |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=9 January 2018 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=302–306 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1705895114 |pmid=29229842 |pmc=5777026 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/302 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female fertility===
In 2004, Italian researchers conducted a study of about 4,600 people who were the relatives of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men tended to have more offspring than those of the heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men on their mother's side tended to have more offspring than those on the father's side. The researchers concluded that there was genetic material being passed down on the X chromosome which both promotes fertility in the mother and homosexuality in her male offspring. The connections discovered would explain about 20% of the cases studied, indicating that this is a highly significant but not the sole genetic factor determining sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Camperio-Ciani A, Corna F, Capiluppi C |title=Evidence for maternally inherited factors favouring male homosexuality and promoting female fecundity |journal=Proc.

Research conducted in Sweden&lt;ref name="pmid15883379"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savic I, Berglund H, Lindström P |title=Brain response to putative pheromones in homosexual men |journal=Proc.

The research showed that when both heterosexual women and gay men are exposed to a testosterone derivative found in men's sweat, a region in the hypothalamus is activated. Heterosexual men, on the other hand, have a similar response to an estrogen-like compound found in women's urine.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Nicholas. (May 9, 2005). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/science/09cnd-smell.html Gay Men Are Found to Have Different Scent of Attraction]." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion is that sexual attraction, whether same-sex or opposite-sex oriented, operates similarly on a biological level. Researchers have suggested that this possibility could be further explored by studying young subjects to see if similar responses in the hypothalamus are found and then correlating these data with adult sexual orientation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Studies of brain structure===
A number of sections of the [[Human brain|brain]] have been reported to be sexually dimorphic; that is, they vary between men and women. There have also been reports of variations in brain structure corresponding to sexual orientation. In 1990, [[Dick Swaab]] and Michel A. Hofman reported a difference in the size of the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] between homosexual and heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=An enlarged suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men |journal=Brain Res. |volume=537 |issue=1–2 |pages=141–8 |date=December 1990 |pmid=2085769 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90350-K |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(90)90350-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Allen and Gorski reported a difference related to sexual orientation in the size of the [[anterior commissure]],&lt;ref name="pmid1496013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=L.

Research on the physiologic differences between male and female brains are based on the idea that people have male or a female brain, and this mirrors the behavioral differences between the two sexes. Some researchers state that solid scientific support for this is lacking. Although consistent differences have been identified, including the size of the brain and of specific brain regions, male and female brains are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 2006; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2009; Sakuma, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum and Beltz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexually dimorphic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus====
[[Simon LeVay]], too, conducted some of these early researches. He studied four groups of [[neuron]]s in the [[hypothalamus]] called INAH1, INAH2, INAH3 and INAH4. This was a relevant area of the brain to study, because of evidence that it played a role in the regulation of [[sexual behaviour in animals]], and because INAH2 and INAH3 had previously been reported to differ in size between men and women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=LeVay |first=Simon |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |issn=0036-8075 |volume=253 |issue=5023 |year=1991 |pages=1034–1037 |doi=10.1126/science.1887219 |pmid=1887219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained brains from 41 deceased hospital patients. The subjects were classified into three groups. The first group comprised 19 gay men who had died of [[AIDS]]-related illnesses. The second group comprised 16 men whose sexual orientation was unknown, but whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. Six of these men had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The third group was of six women whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. One of the women had died of an AIDS-related illness.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;

The [[HIV-positive people]] in the presumably heterosexual patient groups were all identified from medical records as either [[intravenous drug abuse]]rs or recipients of [[blood transfusion]]s. Two of the men who identified as heterosexual specifically denied ever engaging in a homosexual sex act. The records of the remaining heterosexual subjects contained no information about their sexual orientation; they were assumed to have been primarily or exclusively heterosexual "on the basis of the numerical preponderance of heterosexual men in the population".&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;

LeVay found no evidence for a difference between the groups in the size of INAH1, INAH2 or INAH4. However, the INAH3 group appeared to be twice as big in the heterosexual male group as in the gay male group; the difference was highly significant, and remained significant when only the six AIDS patients were included in the heterosexual group. The size of INAH3 in the homosexual men's brains was comparable to the size of INAH3 in the heterosexual women's brains.

However, other studies have shown that the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted Dörner hypothesis that homosexual males have a "female hypothalamus" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the "male brain from originally female brain" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.hiim.unizg.hr/images/knjiga/CNS41.pdf |last1=Judaš |first1=Miloš |last2=Kostović |first2=Ivica |title=Temelji Neuroznanosti: Sadržaj Poglavlja |chapter=Neurobiologija emocija i spolnosti |page=408 |language=hr |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://webcitation.org/query?date=2016-03-23&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hiim.unizg.hr%2Fimages%2Fknjiga%2FCNS41.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |archive-date=23 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1292983 |volume=38 Suppl 2 |issue=2 |title=Gender and sexual orientation in relation to hypothalamic structures |year=1992 |journal=Horm Res |pages=51–61 |doi=10.1159/000182597 |author1=Swaab |first1=D.

William Byne and colleagues attempted to identify the size differences reported in INAH 1–4 by replicating the experiment using brain sample from other subjects: 14 HIV-positive homosexual males, 34 presumed heterosexual males (10 HIV-positive), and 34 presumed heterosexual females (9 HIV-positive). The researchers found a significant difference in INAH3 size between heterosexual men and heterosexual women. The INAH3 size of the homosexual men was apparently smaller than that of the heterosexual men, and larger than that of the heterosexual women, though neither difference quite reached statistical significance.&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Byne W, Tobet S, Mattiace LA |title=The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and HIV status |journal=Horm Behav |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11534967 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byne and colleagues also weighed and counted numbers of neurons in INAH3 tests not carried out by LeVay. The results for INAH3 weight were similar to those for INAH3 size; that is, the INAH3 weight for the heterosexual male brains was significantly larger than for the heterosexual female brains, while the results for the gay male group were between those of the other two groups but not quite significantly different from either. The neuron count also found a male-female difference in INAH3, but found no trend related to sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"/&gt;

A 2010 study, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab asserted that "the fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF |title=Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation |journal=Endocr Dev |volume=17 |issue= |pages=22–35 |year=2010 |pmid=19955753 |doi=10.1159/000262525 |series=Endocrine Development |isbn=978-3-8055-9302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovine model====
The [[domestic ram]] is used as an experimental model to study early programming of the neural mechanisms which underlie homosexuality, developing from the observation that approximately 8% of domestic rams are sexually attracted to other rams (male-oriented) when compared to the majority of rams which are female-oriented. In many species, a prominent feature of sexual differentiation is the presence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus, which is larger in males than in females.

Roselli et al. discovered an ovine SDN (oSDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus that is smaller in male-oriented rams than in female-oriented rams, but similar in size to the oSDN of females. Neurons of the oSDN show [[aromatase]] expression which is also smaller in male-oriented rams versus female-oriented rams, suggesting that sexual orientation is neurologically hard-wired and may be influenced by hormones. However, results failed to associate the role of neural aromatase in the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in the sheep, due to the lack of defeminization of adult sexual partner preference or oSDN volume as a result of aromatase activity in the brain of the fetuses during the critical period. Having said this, it is more likely that oSDN morphology and homosexuality may be programmed through an androgen receptor that does not involve [[aromatisation]]. Most of the data suggests that homosexual rams, like female-oriented rams, are masculinized and defeminized with respect to mounting, receptivity, and gonadotrophin secretion, but are not defeminized for sexual partner preferences, also suggesting that such behaviors may be programmed differently. Although the exact function of the oSDN is not fully known, its volume, length, and cell number seem to correlate with sexual orientation, and a dimorphism in its volume and of cells could bias the processing cues involved in partner selection. More research is needed in order to understand the requirements and timing of the development of the oSDN and how prenatal programming effects the expression of mate choice in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[C.

==Biological theories of cause of sexual orientation==

===Early fixation hypothesis===
{{Main|Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation}}
The early fixation hypothesis includes research into prenatal development and the environmental factors that control masculinization of the brain. Some studies have seen pre-natal hormone exposures as the primary factor involved in determining sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation, in Endocrine Development, vol. 17, pp. 22–35 (2010) ({{ISSN|1421-7082}}) (authors are of Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences) (author contact is 2d author) (vol. 17 is Sandro Loche, Marco Cappa, Lucia Ghizzoni, Mohamad Maghnie, &amp; Martin O. Savage, eds., Pediatric Neuroendocrinology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. &amp; Rahman, Q (2005) Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation, Peter Owen, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4808435 |volume=131 |issue=1 |title=Plasma testosterone levels in heterosexual and homosexual men |date=January 1974 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |pages=82–3 |vauthors=Brodie HK, Gartrell N, Doering C, Rhue T |doi=10.1176/ajp.131.1.82}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by both the observed differences in brain structure and cognitive processing between homosexual and heterosexual men. One explanation for these differences is the idea that differential exposure to hormone levels in the womb during fetal development may change the masculinization of the brain in homosexual men. The concentrations of these chemicals is thought to be influenced by fetal and maternal immune systems, maternal consumption of certain drugs, maternal stress, and direct injection. This hypothesis is also connected to the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order research]].

===Exotic becomes erotic===&lt;!--Linked from 'Daryl Bem'--&gt;
[[Daryl Bem]], a social psychologist at [[Cornell University]], has theorized that the influence of biological factors on sexual orientation may be mediated by experiences in childhood. A child's temperament predisposes the child to prefer certain activities over others. Because of their temperament, which is influenced by biological variables such as genetic factors, some children will be attracted to activities that are commonly enjoyed by other children of the same gender. Others will prefer activities that are typical of another gender. This will make a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-gender children, while gender-nonconforming children will feel different from children of their own gender. According to Bem, this feeling of difference will evoke psychological arousal when the child is near members of the gender which it considers as being 'different'. Bem theorizes that this psychological arousal will later be transformed into sexual arousal: children will become sexually attracted to the gender which they see as different ("exotic"). This proposal is known as the "exotic becomes erotic" theory.&lt;ref name="Bem"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bem DJ, Herdt G, McClintock M |title=Exotic becomes erotic: interpreting the biological correlates of sexual orientation |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=531–48 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11100261 |doi=10.1023/A:1002050303320 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&amp;volume=29&amp;page=531}} [http://dbem.ws/Exotic%20Becomes%20Erotic.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation and evolution==
===General===
Sexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be [[adaptation|maladaptive]] in an [[evolution]]ary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection—on the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency.  Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre F, Estep KW 1993 223-33"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0303-2647(93)90051-D |vauthors=MacIntyre F, Estep KW |title=Sperm competition and the persistence of genes for male homosexuality |journal=BioSystems |volume=31 |issue=2–3 |pages=223–33 |year=1993 |pmid=8155854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref name="MacIntyre F, Estep KW 1993 223-33"/&gt; have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage in a non-obvious way on heterosexual siblings or their children. By way of analogy, the [[allele]] (a particular version of a gene) which causes [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]] when two copies are present, also confers resistance to [[malaria]] with a lesser form of [[anemia]] when one copy is present (this is called [[heterozygous advantage]]).&lt;ref name="swars"&gt;Baker, Robin (1996) Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex, p.241 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also pointed out that Darwin himself described [[kin selection]] in [[The Origin of Species]], so under a Darwinian model of evolution, not only individuals, but family groups (bloodlines) can compete for selection.

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295 |title=Gender bending |journal=The Economist|date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them". Their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zietsch, B. |author2=Morley, K. |author3=Shekar, S. |author4=Verweij, K. |author5=Keller, M. |author6=Macgregor, S. |date=November 2008 |title=Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=424–433 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the same study, the authors noted that "nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing "social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way" (and thus seek out a greater number of sexual partners) as an example of one alternative explanation. Also, the authors of the study acknowledge that a large number of sexual partners may not lead to greater reproductive success, specifically noting there is an "absence of evidence relating the number of sexual partners and actual reproductive success, either in the present or in our evolutionary past".

The heterosexual advantage hypothesis was given strong support by the 2004 Italian study demonstrating increased [[fecundity]] in the female matrilineal relatives of gay men.&lt;ref name="Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camperio08"/&gt;  As originally pointed out by Hamer,&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, D., Copeland, P. The Science of Desire: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior (Simon and Schuster, 1994) {{ISBN|0-684-80446-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; even a modest increase in reproductive capacity in females carrying a "gay gene" could easily account for its maintenance at high levels in the population.&lt;ref name="camperio08"/&gt;

===Gay uncle hypothesis===
The "gay uncle hypothesis" posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by providing resources (e.g., food, supervision, defense, shelter) to the offspring of their closest relatives.

This hypothesis is an extension of the theory of [[kin selection]], which was originally developed to explain apparent altruistic acts which seemed to be maladaptive. The initial concept was suggested by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1932 and later elaborated by many others including [[John Maynard Smith]], [[W. D. Hamilton]] and [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard]].&lt;ref name="Mayr 1982"&gt;Mayr, E. (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p 598.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was also used to explain the patterns of certain social insects where most of the members are non-reproductive.

Vasey and VanderLaan (2010) tested the theory on the Pacific island of Samoa, where they studied women, straight men, and the fa'afafine, men who prefer other men as sexual partners and are accepted within the culture as a distinct third gender category. Vasey and VanderLaan found that the fa'afafine said they were significantly more willing to help kin, yet much less interested in helping children who aren't family, providing the first evidence to support the kin selection hypothesis.&lt;ref name="uleth.ca"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/3159 | title=The development and evolution of male androphilia in Samoan fa'afafine| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2010/02/05/study-supports-gay-super-uncles-theory | title=Study Supports Gay Super Uncles Theory| date=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis is consistent with other studies on homosexuality, which show that it is more prevalent amongst both siblings and twins.&lt;ref name="uleth.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} Since both twins and non-twin siblings share genes and therefore have a higher factor of genetic redundancy, there is less genetic familial risk if the strategy is expressed. It is speculated that environmental and hormonal stress factors (linked to resource feedbacks) may act as triggers.

Since the hypothesis solves the problem of why homosexuality has not been selected out over thousands of years, despite it being antithetical to reproduction, many scientists consider it the best explanatory model for non-heterosexual behaviour such as homosexuality and bisexuality. The natural bell curve variation that occurs in biology and sociology everywhere, explains the variable spectrum of expression.

Vasal and VanderLaan (2011) provides evidence that if an adaptively designed avuncular male androphilic phenotype exists and its development is contingent on a particular social environment, then a collectivistic cultural context is insufficient, in and of itself, for the expression of such a phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10508-011-9763-z|pmid = 21656333|title = Sexual Orientation in Men and Avuncularity in Japan: Implications for the Kin Selection Hypothesis|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume = 41|issue = 1|pages = 209–215|year = 2011|last1 = Vasey|first1 = Paul L|last2 = Vanderlaan|first2 = Doug P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Gay men and straight women have, on average, equally proportioned brain hemispheres.

The authors of the study caution that any interpretation of this finding must take into account that the group difference in brain activation between heterosexual men and homosexual men in the amygdala region is not large and that the most robust finding is that both heterosexual and homosexual men used the same areas when they reacted to sexually preferred stimuli. "For the most part, homosexual and heterosexual men showed very similar patterns of activation (albeit to different erotic stimuli). One possible exception was the amygdala, in which homosexual men showed greater activational differences between preferred and nonpreferred erotic stimuli compared with heterosexual men. However, this difference was not hypothesized a priori, was not large, and was the only group difference found out of many tested. Thus, this finding needs replication."(Debra A.

==Political aspects==
{{Main|LGBT social movements|LGBT rights opposition}}
Whether genetic or other physiological determinants form the basis of sexual orientation is a highly politicized issue. ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', a U.S. gay and lesbian newsmagazine, reported in 1996 that 61% of its readers believed that "it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined".&lt;ref&gt;The Advocate (1996, February 6). Advocate Poll Results. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-national study in the [[United States]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Sweden]] found that those who believed that "homosexuals are born that way" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that "homosexuals choose to be that way" or "learn to be that way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ernulf KE, Innala SM, Whitam FL |title=Biological explanation, psychological explanation, and tolerance of homosexuals: a cross-national analysis of beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=65 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=1003–10 |date=December 1989 |pmid=2608821 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1989.65.3.1003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitley B. E. Jr |year=1990 |title=The relationship of heterosexuals' attributions for the causes of homosexuality to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men |url= |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=369–377 |doi=10.1177/0146167290162016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Equal Protection Clause|Equal protection]] analysis in U.S. law determines when government requirements create a “suspect classification" of groups and therefore eligible for heightened [[strict scrutiny|scrutiny]] based on several factors, one of which is [[Immutable characteristic|immutability]].

Evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined (and therefore perhaps immutable in the legal sense) would strengthen the legal case for heightened scrutiny of laws discriminating on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;Balog, Kari (2005–2006) "Equal Protection for Homosexuals: Why the Immutability Argument is Necessary and How it is Met.", Cleveland St. L. Rev. 545–573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Is Sexuality Immutable?", Margaret Talbot, The New Yorker, January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0125/Prop.-8-trial-defenders-of-gay-marriage-ban-make-their-case |title=Prop. 8 trial: defenders of gay-marriage ban make their case |journal=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=27 January 2010 |date=2010-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived causes of sexual orientation have a significant bearing on the status of sexual minorities in the eyes of social conservatives. The [[Family Research Council]], a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] [[think tank]] in Washington, D.C., argues in the book ''Getting It Straight'' that finding people are born gay "would advance the idea that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals, like African-Americans, should be legally protected against 'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true." On the other hand, some [[social conservatives]] such as Reverend Robert Schenck have argued that people can accept any scientific evidence while still morally opposing homosexuality.&lt;ref name=neil&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/14/what_makes_people_gay/ What Makes People Gay?] By Neil Swidey. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. Published August 14, 2005. Accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Organization for Marriage]] board member and fiction writer [[Orson Scott Card]] has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that "our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized.... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to 'commit genocide' against the homosexual community.... There is no 'cure' for homosexuality because it is not a disease. There are, however, different ways of living with homosexual desires."&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mormontimes.com/content/single/10235 |title=Science on gays falls short |publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]] |date=August 7, 2008 |last=Card |first=Orson Scott |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advocates for the rights of sexual minorities resist linking that cause with the concept that sexuality is biologically determined or fixed at birth. They argue that sexual orientation can shift over the course of a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queerbychoice.com/myths.html Myths About Queer by Choice People]. [http://www.queerbychoice.com/ Queer by Choice]. Accessed March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, others resist any attempts to pathologise or medicalise 'deviant' sexuality, and choose to fight for acceptance in a moral or social realm.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt; [[Chandler Burr]] has stated that "[s]ome, recalling earlier psychiatric "treatments" for homosexuality, discern in the biological quest the seeds of genocide. They conjure up the specter of the surgical or chemical "rewiring" of gay people, or of abortions of fetal homosexuals who have been hunted down in the womb."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 Homosexuality and Biology]. By Chandler Burr. ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; LeVay has said in response to letters from gays and lesbians making such criticisms that the research "has contributed to the status of gay people in society".&lt;ref name=neil/&gt;

'''Breast milk jewelry''' is jewelry made from pumped or expressed mother's [[breast milk]] as a [[Souvenir|keepsake]] often worn by the mother. Breast milk keepsakes come in various jewelry types such as rings, lockets, pendants and popular European style beads. Pendants may include custom background colors, children's names and be made in many shape choices. Some pendants may be bezel set, locket set, made from only resin, or filled. Filled styles use a preserved breast milk and resin mix to fill holes or openings in jewelry pieces, usually Sterling Silver. Generally, the filled shapes are trees, leaves, or hearts representing love and life.

Various methods may be used to make the jewelry. To preserve and protect it, the piece may be covered in a clear resin or glaze. No matter the process used for preservation there seems to be a long and tedious process involved in creating the keepsakes, leading to long waits for order fulfillment. The long waits for order fulfillment have caused online speculation about the practice, even gaining media attention. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/15/breast-milk-jewelry_n_7804122.html|title=R.I. Moms Feel Scammed Waiting For Breast Milk Jewelry|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The process ==
After the purchase of a breast milk keepsake design the consumer sends their breast milk to the creator so the process can begin. Each creator likely uses a different trade process. In some methods it's believed that solvents or chemicals are added to assist the preservation. Other methods may include dehydrating, freeze drying, cooking down, or mixing breast milk with other mediums, forming and curing take place after a period of drying and/or curing with the medium mixes. Coating, pouring, or mixing the preserved milk into resin is believed to be the final step.

'''CELINE''' is a [[France|French]] [[ready-to-wear]] and [[leather]] [[luxury goods]] brand that has been owned by [[LVMH]] group since 1996. It was founded in 1945 by Céline Vipiana. Since November 2015, the headquarters are located at 16 rue Vivienne in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]] at the Hôtel Colbert de Torcy, which has [[Monument historique|French Historic Monument classification]].&lt;ref name="The House"&gt;Robert Murphy, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-house-that-celine-built-1427291901 The House That Céline Built] March 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Séverine Merle is the Chief Executive Officer since April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/celine-recruits-next-ceo-plots-online-sales-10816290/|title=Céline Finds Next CEO; Plots Online Sales|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2018, [[LVMH]] announced that [[Hedi Slimane]] will take over at Celine as its artistic, creative and image director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/news/hedi-slimane-named-artistic-creative-and-image-director-of-celine/|title=Hedonism Slimane named Artistic, Creative and Image Director of Céline|website=lvmh.com |date= January 21, 2018 |accessdate= January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the brand==
In 1945, Céline Vipiana (1915–1997)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vogue.it/en/news/encyclo/designers/c/celine&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband, Richard, created one of the first luxury brands in the industry, Céline, a [[made-to-measure]] children's shoe business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/fashion/fashionshows/designers/bios/celine/ Celine] ''[[New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and opened a first boutique at 52 rue Malte in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was recognised by its logo, the red elephant created by Raymont Peynet.&lt;ref&gt;vogue.com [http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Celine Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==A new positioning==
In 1960, the brand decided to change its positioning by focusing its business on a ready-to-wear fashion brand for women with a [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;europa-exclusive.com [http://www.europa-exclusive.com/live/brandinfo.asp-lang=en&amp;brand_id=1884.htm Celine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811145652/http://www.europa-exclusive.com/live/brandinfo.asp-lang%3Den%26brand_id%3D1884.htm |date=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the brand offered a range of leather goods such as bags, [[loafers]], gloves and clothes.&lt;ref&gt;thinkfashion.com [http://www.thinkfashion.com/designer-brands/designer-profiles/celine.aspx Celine Designer Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Céline Vipiana remained the designer from 1945-1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/celine/ Céline] ''[[New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the launch of the new [[fragrance]] "Vent fou"&lt;ref&gt;Vogue France, [http://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/celine-1/639 Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; and the new ‘American Sulky’ collection of accessories gained success. The trench became the chief product of the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by the popularity of leather, Céline opened a leather goods factory in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/celine-1/639 Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Céline redesigned its [[logo]] with the intertwined "C" Sulky canvas, linked to the Arc-de-Triomphe, which appeared as a symbol for Parisians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Céline began its expansion in the world with the opening of various boutiques in Monte Carlo, Geneva, Hong Kong, Lausanne, Toronto and Beverly Hills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cahierdexercices.com/fr/celine Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand’s founders wished to be part of a charitable association, so Richard Vipiana established the Céline-Pasteur Prize, a sponsor for the [[American Hospital of Paris]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Vogue France, [http://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/celine-1/639 Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by LVMH==
In 1987, [[Bernard Arnault]] decided to buy into Céline’s capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Celine Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only in 1996 that the brand was integrated into the [[LVMH]] group for 2.7&amp;nbsp;billion [[French francs]] ($540&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DF1439F931A15750C0A960958260 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; [[LVMH]] propelled the brand to fame with the opening of a boutique at 36 avenue Montaigne in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Céline’s designers ==
American fashion designer [[Michael Kors]] was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for Céline in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aboutus.michaelkors.com/bio.php Michael Kors Official biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607064539/http://aboutus.michaelkors.com/bio.php |date=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure at Céline, Kors brought modern femininity with a luxurious spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2004RTW-CELINE Fall 2004 Ready-to-Wear Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he left the fashion luxury house to focus his career on his own brand.

In 2005, [[Italian people|Italian]] designer Roberto Menichetti was named creative director.

A year later, [[Croats|Croatian]] designer Ivana Omazic directed the design studio. Omazic was a former consultant for the brand and previously worked with Romeo Gigli, [[Prada]], [[Jil Sander]] and Miu Miu. Omazic designed for Céline until 2008, after further disappointments for the brand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/runway/2008/10/02/celines-ivana-omazic-takes-final-bow/ Céline's Ivana Omazic takes final bow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phoebe Philo: a Decade as Creative Director==
On September 4, 2008, the fashion portal ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' announced that [[Bernard Arnault]], president of [[LVMH]], had appointed [[Phoebe Philo]] as the new creative director of Céline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/celine-taps-phoebe-philo-1735699 Céline taps Phoebe Philo]&lt;/ref&gt; Philo's tenure at Céline began in October 2008, and she presented her first ready-to-wear collection for Spring/Summer 2010 at [[Paris Fashion Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/2010RST-CELINE Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive officer of LVMH’s fashion division, said that recruiting Philo was giving her the opportunity to express her vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionunited.com/news/leads/celine-appoints-phoebe-philo-as-creative-director-200804090980 Céline appoints Phoebe Philo as creative director]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cersei Lannister''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', where she is portrayed by English actress [[Lena Headey]]. In the novels, she is a [[Narrative mode#Third-person view|point of view]] character.

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Cersei is a member of [[House Lannister]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the kingdom of [[Westeros]]. She subsequently appeared in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000). She becomes a prominent point of view character in the novels beginning in ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005) and ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'' (2011). The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume ''[[The Winds of Winter]]''.

In the story, Cersei Lannister, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, is the wife of King [[Robert Baratheon]]. Her father arranged the marriage after his attempt to betroth her to Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], as she wanted, failed. The Targaryen dynasty lost the war, and her father schemed his way into the role of a political counselor for the newly crowned King Robert. The Lannisters are the richest family in Westeros and helped him to win the Throne, which is why Robert agreed to a marriage between them. Cersei has a twin brother, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], with whom she has been involved in an incestuous affair. All three of Cersei's children are Jaime's. Cersei's main character attribute is her desire for power and her ambition.

Headey has received critical acclaim for her portrayal of the character on the [[HBO]] series ''Game of Thrones''. She has been nominated for four [[Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] and a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance. Headey and the rest of the cast were nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series|Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]] in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016. In [[Game of Thrones (season 5)|season 5]], a young version of the character is portrayed by [[Nell Williams]] in a flashback.

==Character background==
Cersei was born the only daughter and first child of [[Tywin Lannister]] and his wife Joanna, with her twin brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] born soon after. Cersei and Jaime looked so similar as children that Cersei occasionally wore Jaime’s clothes and was mistaken for him.&lt;ref name="ACOK"&gt;{{cite book |first=George R. R. |last=Martin |authorlink=George R. R. Martin |title=[[A Clash of Kings]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They even went as far as to experiment sexually at an early age but were discovered by a servant who informed their mother. She decided to separate them using a guard and keep this a secret from their father, threatening them that she would inform him if they ever repeated it.&lt;ref name="ASOS"&gt;{{cite book |first=George R. R. |last=Martin |authorlink=George R. R. Martin |title=[[A Storm of Swords]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, her mother died giving birth to their [[dwarfism|dwarf]] brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. Cersei blamed Tyrion for her death, and started to abuse him as a baby.&lt;ref name="ASOS"/&gt; Martin said in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':

{{quote|There's certainly a great level of narcissism in Cersei. She has an almost sociopathic view of the world and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/george-r-r-martin-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140423? |title=George R.R. Martin: The ''Rolling Stone'' Interview |first=Mikal |last=Gilmore |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=April 23, 2014 |accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tywin hoped his daughter would marry [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] from a very young age and rejected the Princess of Dorne's proposal to betroth [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Elia Martell]] to her and Jaime respectively. She became infatuated with Rhaegar and even hid her infatuation from her brother as her father advised her.&lt;ref name="AFFC"&gt;{{cite book |first=George R. R. |last=Martin |authorlink=George R. R. Martin |title=[[A Feast for Crows]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eleven, Jaime was sent away to serve as a squire for Lord Sumner Crakehall.&lt;ref name="ASOS"/&gt; A year later, [[Aerys Targaryen]] rejected Cersei's marriage to his son, humiliating Tywin.&lt;ref name="AFFC"/&gt; Tywin took Cersei to [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]] and, in the following years, refused every other offer of marriage for her. In 281 AC, when Cersei and Jaime were fifteen, Jaime, newly knighted on the battlefield, came to King's Landing on his way to Casterly Rock to visit his sister, from whom he had been separated for years. She informed him that their father planned to marry him to [[Lysa Tully]] and persuaded him to join the Kingsguard in order to be near her, after sleeping together for the first time.&lt;ref name="ASOS"/&gt; They started an affair which lasted until the morning of her marriage to [[Robert Baratheon]]. While she was happy marrying Robert at first,&lt;ref name="GoT"&gt;{{cite book |first=George R. R. |last=Martin |authorlink=George R. R. Martin |title=[[A Game of Thrones]] |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; he didn't return her affections and repeatedly cheated on her. She then resumed her incestuous affair with her brother, resulting in the births of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]].

During her teenage years, believing that her betrothal to Rhaegar would soon be announced, Cersei brought her companions Melara Hetherspoon and Jeyne Farman to a witch named Maggy the Frog. Jeyne was instantly frightened and left the tent. Cersei and Melara stayed and tried to get the witch to tell them a prophecy. In the face of Cersei's threats, Maggy agreed to answer three questions. Maggy told Cersei she would marry the king and not the prince, and that she would be overthrown by a younger and more beautiful queen. She further predicted that Cersei's children will die during her lifetime and that the valonqar (High Valyrian for "little brother") would come to end her life. Melara then asked if she would marry Jaime, to which Maggy answered that she wouldn't marry anyone and that her death was near her and would happen that night. It is implied that Cersei killed the girl to prevent her speaking of the prophecies and for being greedy with ideas above her social status.&lt;ref name="AFFC"/&gt; Cersei spends her entire adult life attempting to subvert the prophecy and eventually develops a strong paranoia over this.

==Storylines==
[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Lannister red scroll.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a golden lion on a red field|Coat of arms of House Lannister]]

===''A Game of Thrones''===
Robert, Cersei and most of the court visit the North to appoint [[Eddard Stark]] as Hand of the King. During the royal visit to [[Winterfell]], Eddard's son [[Bran Stark|Bran]] finds Cersei committing incest with Jaime in a tower. To prevent their adultery from being revealed, Jaime pushes Bran from the tower; Bran survives, but has no memory of the fall and is left paraplegic.

Eddard eventually discovers the truth of Cersei's infidelity and confronts her, giving her the opportunity to flee into exile and thus spare her children certain execution. Cersei had already arranged Robert's death in a hunting accident. When Robert dies, Cersei seizes control as [[regent]] and has Eddard arrested for treason. Cersei intends for Eddard to publicly confess and join the Night's Watch as punishment, but Joffrey orders Ned executed instead.

===''A Clash of Kings''===
Frustrated with Cersei's many political blunders, as well as her failure to control Joffrey, Tywin appoints Tyrion as Hand of the King with explicit instructions to control Cersei and Joffrey. Once at the capital, Tyrion enters into a bitter power struggle with Cersei, subverting her authority and removing her supporters from positions of power. In Jaime's absence, Cersei begins taking other lovers, including Lancel. When [[Stannis Baratheon]] sails on King's Landing, Cersei and Joffrey hide in a tower, leaving Tyrion to mastermind the defense of the city. Ultimately, Tywin arrives in time to force Stannis to retreat and save the city.

===''A Storm of Swords''===
After formally assuming his position as Hand of the King, Tywin makes it clear to Cersei that she is no longer welcome at Small Council meetings, ''de facto'' stripping her of political authority. Furthermore, Tywin intends to wed Cersei to Wilas Tyrell in order to form an alliance with [[House Tyrell]]. This state of affairs is shaken when Joffrey is poisoned at his wedding feast. Maddened with grief at the loss of her eldest son, Cersei lashes out against Tyrion, accusing him of poisoning the king out of revenge.

Cersei [[kangaroo court|manipulates Tyrion's trial]] to ensure a guilty verdict, bribing and intimidating witnesses. When Tyrion demands a [[trial by combat]], Cersei selects the imposing [[Gregor Clegane]], "The Mountain," as the Crown's champion. The Mountain prevails, killing Tyrion's champion [[Oberyn Martell]]. Tywin then pronounces Tyrion guilty and sentences him to death, but Tyrion escapes prison and kills Tywin. Cersei is once again in complete control of the capital.

===''A Feast for Crows''===
With the death of her father and her son, Cersei ''de facto'' rules the kingdom. Her youngest child, Tommen Baratheon, is crowned king but is widely considered weak, signing every decree that passes in front of him. However, Cersei rules a kingdom on the brink of ruin. The huge losses suffered by House Lannister in the war, combined with the wartime disruptions to trade and harvest mean that the Lannisters are dependent on resources from House Tyrell. The Tyrells leverage this position and begin to build power in the capital, much to Cersei's consternation.

Furthermore, Cersei makes a series of political and economic blunders, alienating allies such as [[Pycelle]] and [[Kevan Lannister]]. In an attempt to undermine the Tyrells, as well as release her son from his marriage to Margaery, Cersei attempts to frame Margaery for adultery and treason. However, this plot backfires as the investigation into Margaery reveals evidence of Cersei's own adultery and her complicity in Robert's death, resulting in her arrest by the Faith. She sends a letter to Jaime, asking him for help, but he burns her note.

===''A Dance with Dragons''===
Cersei confesses her post-marital affairs (though not her relationship with Jaime), while the more serious charges of [[regicide]] and incest are to be settled in a trial by combat. Cersei is punished with a walk of shame, being stripped naked and forced to walk through the capital in full view of the public, nearly breaking down in tears near the end. Confined to the Red Keep awaiting trial, the kingdom is now run by Pycelle and Kevan. However, at the nadir of her fortunes, [[Varys]] returns to the capital and murders both Pycelle and Kevan. The book ends with Cersei's fate unknown.

===Storylines===
Much of Cersei's storyline from the first and second season in the television series is unchanged from the books. A notable change in the show is Joffrey authorising the purge of Robert's bastards, not Cersei.

====Season 1====
Cersei learns that her husband Robert is in danger of finding out that the children he sees as his heirs to the throne are not his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title="Winter is Coming" Review|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/winter-is-coming,54682/|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert meets his end as the result of a boar attack on a hunting trip, before Ned Stark tells him of the truth about his children. Cersei works quickly to instate her oldest son, Joffrey, on the throne, with her as his chief political advisor and Queen Regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title="You Win Or You Die" Review|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/you-win-or-you-die-for-experts,56747/,75561/|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joffrey quits listening to his mother.

====Season 2====
Tywin decides that Cersei does not exercise enough control over her son, and sends Tyrion as an additional political advisor. Cersei and Tyrion do not get along, and constantly try to undermine each other's authority over the crown. As of the end of season 2, Tyrion has accumulated more sway over the Iron Throne, and has shipped Cersei's only daughter off against Cersei's will to be married to the prince of Dorne.

====Season 3====
Cersei comes to fear that Margaery intends to usurp her as queen, and unsuccessfully tries to alienate Joffrey from her. Cersei is delighted when Tywin learns of the Tyrells' plan to wed [[Sansa Stark]] to Margaery's brother Loras and he intervenes having Tyrion marry Sansa instead, but is furious when Tywin also orders her to marry Loras. When Jaime returns to King's Landing, he immediately seeks out Cersei, who is shocked to discover that his sword hand has been cut off.

====Season 4====
Cersei has Tyrion arrested after Joffrey is fatally poisoned. It is implied that she knows Tyrion's guilt is highly unlikely, but just wants to see him dead, though Jaime refuses to carry out the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title="Valar Morghulis" Review|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/valar-morghulis-for-experts,75561/|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, at Tyrion's trial, Cersei has manipulated the entire procedure so that the witnesses give either incomplete or entirely false testimonies to implicate Tyrion and Sansa further in the murder. When Tyrion demands a trial by combat, Cersei quickly chooses Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane as her champion to diminish Tyrion's chances of acquittal, and has Bronn betrothed to a noblewoman so that Tyrion cannot choose him as his champion. Cersei's wish comes true when Tyrion's champion, Oberyn Martell, is killed by Clegane, but she still refuses to marry Loras, even threatening her father with revealing the truth about her relationship with Jaime and the parentage of her children. Tywin rebuffs her threats, though he himself is killed by an escaping Tyrion soon afterwards.

====Season 5====
Cersei receives a threat from Dorne, where Myrcella is betrothed to Trystane Martell, and sends Jaime to Dorne to retrieve her. Tommen is married to Margaery, who tries to manipulate Tommen into sending Cersei to Casterly Rock. Fearful of losing her power, Cersei meets religious leader the High Sparrow, appointing him as the High Septon and giving him authority to re-establish the Faith Militant. In order to destabilise House Tyrell, Cersei arranges for the High Sparrow to arrest Loras for his homosexuality, with Margaery also arrested for perjury after lying to defend Loras. However, Cersei's plot backfires when Lancel, now a member of the Faith Militant, confesses to his affair with Cersei and his role in Robert's assassination, and also accuses Cersei of incest, prompting the High Sparrow to arrest her. Cersei is eventually allowed to return to the Red Keep after confessing to adultery with Lancel, but has her hair cut off and is forced to walk naked through the streets of King's Landing as atonement. Cersei returns distraught by the abuse directed at her by the smallfolk of King's Landing, but is consoled by Qyburn's successful reanimation of Ser Gregor Clegane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/15/game-of-thrones-mothers-mercy-review |title=Game of Thrones: "Mother's Mercy" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |last=Fowler |first=Matt |date=June 15, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 6====
Cersei remains in the Red Keep, confined to her chambers and stripped of her authority. Though Cersei accepts Tommen's apology for his lack of action in her arrest and walk of atonement, she remains looked down upon by other members of the court. Cersei learns from Tommen that the High Sparrow plans to have Margaery do a walk of atonement before Cersei's trial and conspires with the Small Council to have the Tyrell army march on the Sept of Baelor to secure Margaery and Loras' release. Their plan backfires when it is revealed that Margaery has joined the Faith of the Seven and has convinced Tommen to merge the Faith and the Crown. Despite being stripped of her allies, Cersei opts to remain in King's Landing, having named Ser Gregor as her champion in her trial by combat. However, Tommen announces that trial by combat has been abolished and replaced by trial by the Seven. Cersei arranges for a cache of wildfire to be detonated beneath the Sept during Loras' trial, killing the High Sparrow, Margaery, Loras, and the rest of the Small Council. As a direct result of Cersei's actions, Tommen commits suicide after witnessing the explosion. With House Baratheon officially extinct (technically speaking, House Baratheon became extinct with the death of Stannis Baratheon) and no one to oppose her in King's Landing, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |title=Game of Thrones: "The Winds of Winter" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=February 17, 2017 |date=June 27, 2016 |last=Fowler|first=Matt|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 7====
Despite nominally being ruler of Westeros, Cersei's grip to power is tenuous, with the Riverlands in upheaval following [[Arya Stark]]'s massacre of House Frey, the Vale and the North declaring Ned Stark's bastard son [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] King in the North, and Tyrion, Dorne, and the Reach all supporting [[Daenerys Targaryen]], whose fleet has seized Dragonstone. She remains cold and distant in regards to Tommen's suicide, viewing it as a betrayal of their family. With no children left to protect, Cersei's malice and vindictiveness has grown as she relentlessly seeks to expand her power and destroy her enemies. Cersei reaches out to the King of the Iron Islands, [[Euron Greyjoy]], to form an alliance, but rejects Euron's marriage proposal as she considers him untrustworthy. Euron later ambushes Daenerys' fleet and captures Yara Greyjoy, Ellaria and Tyene Sand and presents them as a "gift" to Cersei. She agrees to marry Euron after the war is won; however, she continues her affair with Jaime, no longer attempting to hide their relationship from their servants. Cersei imprisons Ellaria and Tyene in the dungeons, poisoning Tyene with the same poison used to kill Myrcella and keeping Ellaria alive to watch her daughter die and rot.

Tycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank arrives in King's Landing to request repayment of their debt. Cersei requests a fortnight in order to fulfill their request. She then has the Lannister and Tarly armies attack Highgarden, defeating the Tyrells. [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]] commits suicide following defeat, and gloats to Jaime that she was responsible for poisoning Joffrey. The Tyrell's wealth is transported safely to King's Landing, but the food the Lannisters steal from the Reach is destroyed when Daenerys attacks the caravan with her Dothraki horde and dragon Drogon. Jaime barely survives the battle, and encourages Cersei to consider a ceasefire.

Tyrion infiltrates the capital to meet with Jaime, and Jaime tells Cersei that Daenerys and Jon want to meet with Cersei to negotiate an [[armistice]] while mankind fights the threat of the [[White Walkers]]; Cersei is skeptical, but agrees, and tells Jaime that she is pregnant. Daenerys and Jon meet with Cersei in the Dragonpit on the outskirts of King's Landing, and present to her a wight reanimated by the White Walkers as evidence of their threat. Although terrified, Cersei initially refuses to agree an armistice, as Jon refuses to remain neutral in the war between the Lannisters and Targaryens. Tyrion speaks to Cersei in private, apparently persuading her to ally with the rival monarchs. However, she later reveals to Jaime that she intends for her enemies to wipe out each other before attacking the victor, and has sent Euron to Essos to transport the Golden Company to Westeros. Disgusted by Cersei's selfishness and shortsightedness, Jaime finally abandons her side and goes north on his own, leaving Cersei alone.

=== Recognition and awards ===
Cersei has been continuously praised as one of the most complex and multi-faceted characters in either version of the story. ''Rolling Stone'' ranked Cersei at No.5 on a list of the "Top 40 ''Game of Thrones'' Characters", describing her as a character who'd "rather die than give you control".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/top-40-game-of-thrones-characters-ranked-20140331|title=Top 40 'Game of Thrones' Characters, Ranked|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar list made by ''Rolling Stone'' ranking the "30 Best ''Game of Thrones'' Villains", Cersei was ranked No.1, being described as the "most dangerous human being in Westeros" as well as "one of the most complex and fascinating characters on television.....she's also a strangely sympathetic figure, warped by being treated like an expensive brood mare by powerful men her entire life and genuine in her affections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/30-best-game-of-thrones-villains-20160613|title=30 Best 'Game of Thrones' Villains|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alyssa Rosenburg of ''The Washington Post'' wrote "As the men....destroy themselves and each other, leaving a generation of women without husbands, sons, and marriage partners, [Cersei] may be the only [person] left to repair the shattered world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/04/26/game-of-crones-in-praise-of-the-older-women-of-hbos-fantasy-epic/|title=Game of Crones: In praise of the older women of HBO's fantasy epic|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=2016-04-26|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese Calendar of 2017.png|thumb|alt=See caption|2017 Chinese calendar]]
[[File:Chinese Calendar(Daoguang 15).jpg|thumb|alt+Handwritten calendar|Page of a Chinese calendar]]
The traditional '''Chinese calendar''' (officially known as the Rural Calendar [{{zh|labels=no |s=农历 |t=農曆 |p=Nónglì |l=farming calendar}}]), or Former Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = 旧历 |t = 舊曆 |p = Jiùlì}}), Traditional Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = 老历 |t = 老曆 |p = Lǎolì}}) or Lunar Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = 阴历 |t = 陰曆 |p = Yīnlì |l = [[Yin and yang|yin]] calendar }}), is a [[lunisolar calendar]] which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. It is defined by [[GB/T]] 33661-2017, "Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar", issued by the Standardization Administration of China on May 12, 2017. 

Although China uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], the traditional Chinese calendar governs holidays (such as the [[Chinese New Year]]) in China and in [[overseas Chinese]] communities. It lists the dates of traditional Chinese holidays and guides people in selecting auspicious days for [[Auspicious wedding dates|weddings]], funerals, moving, or starting a business.

Like [[Chinese characters]], variants of this calendar are used in different parts of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese cultural sphere]]. Korea, Vietnam, and the Ryukyu Islands adopted the calendar, and it evolved into [[Korean calendar|Korean]], [[Vietnamese calendar|Vietnamese]], and [[Ryukyuan religion#religious calendar|Ryukyuan calendars]]. The main difference from the traditional Chinese calendar is the use of different [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], which leads to some astronomical events—and calendar events based on them—falling on different dates. The traditional [[Japanese calendar]] also derived from the Chinese calendar (based on a Japanese meridian), but its official use in Japan was abolished in 1873 as part of reforms after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Calendars in [[Mongolian calendar|Mongolia]] and [[Tibetan calendar|Tibet]] have absorbed elements of the traditional Chinese calendar, but are not direct descendants of it.

Days begin and end at midnight, and months begin on the day of the [[new moon]]. Years begin on the second (or third) new moon after the [[winter solstice]]. [[Solar term]]s govern the beginning and end of each month. Written versions in ancient China{{when|date=May 2018}} included [[sexagenary cycle|stems and branches]] of the year and the names of each month, including [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|leap months]] as needed. Characters indicated whether a month was long ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|大}}}}, 30 days) or short ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|小}}}}, 29 days); stem branches for the first, eleventh, and 21st days, and the date, stem branch and time of the solar terms.

[[File:Five Phases and Four Seasons Calendar.png|thumb|alt=See caption|Five-phase and four-quarter calendars]]
The traditional Chinese calendar was developed between 771 and 476 BC, during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the [[Eastern Zhou]] dynasty. Before the [[Zhou dynasty]], solar calendars were used. 

One version of the solar calendar is the five-elements calendar ({{zh|labels=no|s=五行历|t=五行曆}}), which derives from the [[Wu Xing]]. A 365-day year was divided into five phases of 73 days, with each phase corresponding to a Wu Xing element. A phase began with a governing-element day ({{zh|labels=no|c=行御}}), followed by six 12-day weeks. Each phase consisted of two three-week months, making each year ten months long. Years began on a ''jiǎzǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=甲子}}) day (and a 72-day wood phase), followed by a ''bǐngzǐ'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c=丙子}}) and a 72-day fire phase; a ''wùzǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=戊子}}) day and a 72-day earth phase; a ''gēngzǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=庚子}}) day and a 72-day metal phase, and a ''rénzǐ'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c=壬子}}) followed by a water phase.&lt;ref name="Guanzi 41"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:管子 |trans-title=[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] |script-chapter=zh:第41篇五行 |trans-chapter=Chapter 41: Five Elements |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E7%AE%A1%E5%AD%90/%E7%AC%AC41%E7%AF%87%E4%BA%94%E8%A1%8C |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other days were tracked using the [[Yellow River Map]] (''He Tu'').

Another version is a four-quarters calendar ({{zh|labels=no|s=四时八节历|t=四時八節曆|l=four sections, eight seasons calendar}}, or {{zh|labels=no|t=四分曆|s=四分历}}). Weeks were ten days long, with one month consisting of three weeks. A year had 12 months, with a ten-day week [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalated]] in summer as needed to keep up with the tropical year. The 10 [[Heavenly Stems]] and 12 [[Earthly Branches]] were used to mark days.&lt;ref name="Guanzi 40"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:管子 |trans-title=[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] |script-chapter=zh:第40篇四時 |trans-chapter=Chapter 40: Four Sections |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E7%AE%A1%E5%AD%90/%E7%AC%AC40%E7%AF%87%E5%9B%9B%E6%99%82 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third version is the balanced calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=調曆|s=调历}}). A year was 365.25 days, and a month was 29.5 days. After every 16th month, a half-month was intercalated. According to [[oracle bone]] records, the [[Shang dynasty]] calendar ({{Circa|1600|1046}} BC) was a balanced calendar with 12 to 14 months in a year; the month after the winter solstice was ''Zhēngyuè''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmth.net/bbsanc.php?path=/groups/sci.faq/Astronomy/bw/all2/bk37k/M.1275291864.z0&amp;ap=353 |script-title=zh:中国农历发展简史 |trans-title=A brief history of the development of Chinese Lunar calendar |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lunisolar calendars====
The first lunisolar calendar was the Zhou calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=周曆|s=周历}}), introduced under the [[Zhou dynasty]]. This calendar set the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice. It also set the ''shàngyuán'' as the winter solstice of a ''dīngsì'' year, making the year it was introduced around 2,758,130.{{cn|date=October 2018|reason=Also needs an explanation.}}

Several competing lunisolar calendars were also introduced, especially by states fighting Zhou control during the [[Warring States period]]. The state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] issued its own Lu calendar({{zh|labels=no|t=魯曆|s=鲁历}}). [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] issued the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=夏曆|s=夏历}}) in 102 AD,&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Jens Østergård |year=1992 |title=The Taiping Jing and the A.D. 102 Clepsydra Reform |journal=Acta Orientalia |volume=53 |pages=122–158 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12945035}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the [[March equinox]]. [[Qin (state)|Qin]] issued the [[Zhuanxu]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=顓頊曆|s=颛顼历}}), with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the [[winter solstice]]. [[Song (state)|Song]]'s [[Shang dynasty|Yin]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=殷曆|s=殷历}}) began its year on the day of the new moon after the winter solstice.

These calendars are known as the six ancient calendars ({{zh|labels=no|t=古六曆|s=古六历}}), or quarter-remainder calendars, ({{zh|labels=no|t=四分曆|s=四分历|p=sìfēnlì}}), since all calculate a year as {{frac|365|1|4}} days long. Months begin on the day of the new moon, and a year has 12 or 13 months. Intercalary months (a 13th month) are added to the end of the year. The Qiang and Dai calendars are modern versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, used by mountain peoples.

===={{anchor|Calendar of the Qin and early Han dynasties}}Qin and early Han dynasties====
After [[Qin Shi Huang]] unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the Qin calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=秦曆|s=秦历}}) was introduced. It followed most of the rules governing the Zhuanxu calendar, but the month order was that of the Xia calendar; the year began with month 10 and ended with month 9, analogous to a Gregorian calendar beginning in October and ending in September. The intercalary month, known as the second ''Jiǔyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=後九月|s=后九月|l=later ''Jiǔyuè''}}), was placed at the end of the year. The Qin calendar was used into the Han dynasty.

===={{anchor|Taichu calendar and the calendars from the Han to [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties}}Han-Ming dynasties and Taichu calendar====
[[Emperor Wu of Han]] {{reign|141|87 BC}} introduced reforms halfway through his reign. His Taichu Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=太初曆|s=太初历|l=grand beginning calendar}}) defined a solar year as {{frac|365|385|1539}} days, and the lunar month was {{frac|29|43|81}} days. This calendar introduced the 24 [[solar term]]s, dividing the year into 24 equal parts. Solar terms were paired, with the 12 combined periods known as climate terms. {{citation needed span|date=October 2018|text=The first solar term of the period was known as a pre-climate, and the second was a mid-climate. Months were named for the mid-climate to which they were closest, and a month without a mid-climate was an intercalary month.}}

The Taichu calendar established a framework for traditional calendars, with later calendars adding to the basic formula. The Dàmíng Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=大明曆|s=大明历|l=brightest calendar}}), created in the [[Liang dynasty]] by [[Zhu Chongzhi]], introduced the equinoxes. The use of a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] to determine the lunar month was first described in the [[Tang dynasty]] Wùyín Yuán Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=戊寅元曆|s=戊寅元历|l=earth tiger epoch calendar}}). The [[Yuan dynasty]] Shòushí calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=授时曆|s=授时历|l=teaching time calendar}}) used [[spherical trigonometry]] to find the length of the [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Needham |first=Joseph |orig-year=1954 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth |journal=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 3 |volume=3 |date=1986 |pages=109–110|bibcode=1959scc3.book.....N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ho |first=Peng Yoke |date=2000 |title=Li, Qi, and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China |location=Mineola |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-41445-4 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Restivo |first=Sal |date=1992 |title=Mathematics in Society and History: Sociological Inquiries |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |isbn=978-1-4020-0039-3 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Asiapac Editorial |date=2004 |title=Origins of Chinese Science and Technology |translator1=Yang Liping |translator2=Y.N.

The Republic of China adopted [[UTC+08:00]] in 1928, but the change to a single [[time zone]] was not been universally adopted in areas such as Taiwan and Hong Kong; some calendars followed the last calendar of the Qing dynasty, published in 1908. This caused confusion about the date of the 1978 [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], and those areas then switched to the UTC+8-based calendar.&lt;ref name="aslaksen" /&gt;

==== Shíxiàn calendar ====
{{Main|Chongzhen calendar}}
During the late [[Ming dynasty]], [[Xu Guangqi]] and his colleagues worked out a new calendar based on Western astronomical arithmetic; however, the new calendar was not released before the end of the dynasty. In the early [[Qing dynasty]], [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] submitted the calendar to the [[Shunzhi Emperor]]. The Qing government issued it as the Shíxiàn (seasonal) calendar.

In this calendar, the [[solar term]]s are 15° each along the [[ecliptic]] and it can be used as a [[solar calendar]]. However, the length of the climate term near [[Apsis|perihelion]] is less than 30 days and there may be two mid-climate terms. The Shíxiàn calendar changed the mid-climate-term rule to "decides the month in sequence, except the intercalary month."{{Quote without source|date=October 2018}} The present traditional calendar follows the Shíxiàn calendar, except:
# The baseline is Chinese Standard Time, rather than Beijing local time.
# Astronomical data is used, rather than mathematical calculations.

===={{anchor|Proposals to optimize the Chinese calendar}}Proposals====
To optimize the Chinese calendar, astronomers have proposed a number of changes. Gao Pingzi ({{zh|labels=no|c=高平子}}; 1888-1970), a Chinese astronomer who co-founded the [[Purple Mountain Observatory]], proposed that month numbers be calculated before the new moon and solar terms be rounded to the day. Since the intercalary month is determined by the first month without a mid-climate and the mid-climate time varies by time zone, countries which adopted the calendar but calculate with their own time could vary from the time in China.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== {{anchor|Other practices}}Outlying areas ===
Calendars of ethnic groups in the mountains and plateaus of southwestern China and the grasslands of northern China are based on their [[phenology]] and algorithms of traditional calendars of different periods, particularly the Tang and pre-Qin dynasties.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Structure ==
=== {{anchor|General}}Elements ===
Elements of the traditional Chinese calendar are:
* ''Day'', from one midnight to the next
* ''Month'', the time from one [[new moon]] to the next. These [[Lunar_month#Synodic_month|synodic months]] are about {{frac|29|17|32}} days long. 
* ''Date'', when a day occurs in the month. Days are numbered in sequence from 1 to 29 (or 30).
* ''Year'', the time of one revolution of the earth around the sun. It is measured from the first day of spring (lunisolar year) or the winter solstice (solar year). A year is about {{frac|365|31|128}} days.
* ''[[Chinese zodiac|Zodiac]]'', {{frac|12}} year, or 30° on the [[ecliptic]]. A zodiac is about {{frac|30|7|16}} days.
*''[[Solar term]]'', {{frac|24}} year, or 15° on the ecliptic. A solar term is about {{frac|15|7|32}} days. 
* ''Calendar month'', when a month occurs within a year. Some months may be repeated.
* ''Calendar year'', when it is agreed that one year ends and another begins. The year begins on the first day of spring, defined as the second (sometimes third) new moon after the winter solstice. A calendar year is 353–355 or 383–385 days long.

The Chinese calendar is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], similar to the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]] calendars.

=== {{anchor|7 Luminaries, Great Bear (Ursa Major), 3 Enclosures, 28 Mansions}}Features ===
The movements of the sun, moon, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] (known as the seven luminaries) are the references for calendar calculations. 
* The distance between Mercury and the sun is less than 30° (the sun's height at ''chénshí'':{{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|辰時}}}}, 8:00 to 10:00 am), so Mercury was sometimes called the "chen star" ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|辰|星}}|s=|t=}}); it is more commonly known as the "water star" ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|水星}}}}).
* Venus appears at dawn and dusk, and is known as the "bright star" ({{Zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|启明|星}}|t={{linktext|啟明|星}}}}) or "long star" ({{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|长庚|星}}|t={{linktext|長庚|星}}}}).
* Mars looks like fire and occurs irregularly, and is known as the "fire star" ({{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|荧惑|星}}|t={{linktext|熒惑|星}}}} or {{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|火星}}}}). Mars is the punisher in Chinese mythology. When Mars is near [[Antares]] ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|心宿二}}}}), it is a bad omen and can forecast the death of an emperor or removal of a chancellor ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|荧惑|守|心}}|s=|t=}}).
* The period of Jupiter's revolution is 11.86 years, so Jupiter is called the "age star" ({{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|岁星}}|t={{linktext|歲星}}}}); 30° of Jupiter's revolution is about a year on earth.
* The period of Saturn's revolution is about 28 years. Saturn, known as the "guard star" ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|鎮星}}|s=|t=}}), guards one of the 28 mansions every year.

The [[Big Dipper]] is the celestial compass, and its handle's direction determines the season and month.
The stars are divided into [[Chinese constellations#Three Enclosures|Three Enclosures]] and [[Twenty-Eight Mansions|28 Mansions]] according to their location in the sky relative to [[Ursa Minor]], at the centre. Each mansion is named with a character describing the shape of its principal [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. The Three Enclosures are [[Purple Forbidden enclosure|Purple Forbidden]], ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|紫微}}|s=|t=}}), [[Supreme Palace enclosure|Supreme Palace]] ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|太微}}|s=|t=}}), and [[Heavenly Market enclosure|Heavenly Market]]. ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|天市}}|s=|t=}}) The eastern mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|角}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|亢}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|氐}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|房}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|心}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|尾}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|箕}}}}. Southern mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|井}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|鬼}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|柳}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|星}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|张}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|翼}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|轸}}}}. Western mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|奎}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|娄}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|胃}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|昴}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|毕}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|参}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|觜}}}}. Northern mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|斗}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|牛}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|女}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|虚}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|危}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|室}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|壁}}}}.
The moon moves through about one [[lunar mansion]] per day, so the 28 mansions were also used to count days. In the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Yuan Tiangang]] ({{Zh|labels=no|c=袁天罡}}) matched the 28 mansions, seven luminaries and yearly animal signs to yield combinations such as "horn-wood-flood dragon" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|角|木|蛟}}}}).

==={{anchor|Hour|Hours}}Codes ===
Several coding systems are used to avoid ambiguity. The [[Heavenly Stems]] is a [[decimal]] system. The [[Earthly Branches]], a [[duodecimal]] system, mark dual hours (''shí'', {{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|時}}|s={{linktext|时}}}} or ''shíchen'' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|時辰}}|s={{linktext|时辰}}}})) and climatic terms. The 12 characters progress from the first day with the same branch as the month (first ''Yín'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|寅|日}}}}) of ''Zhēngyuè''; first ''Mǎo'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|卯|日}}}}) of ''Èryuè''), and count the days of the month.

The [[Sexagenary cycle|stem-branches]] is a [[sexagesimal]] system. The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches make up [[Sexagenary cycle|60 stem-branches]]. The stem-branches mark days and years. The five elements of the [[Wu Xing]] are assigned to each of the stems, branches and stem-branches.

===Week===

{{For|more information on the ten-day week|Decan}}

As early as the Bronze-Age [[Xia dynasty]], days were grouped into nine- or ten-day weeks known as ''xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|旬}}}}).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | author = {{zh|labels=no|c=海上}} | script-title = zh:中國人的歲時文化 |trans-title=Timekeeping of the Chinese culture | publisher = {{zh|labels=no|c=岳麓書社}} | year = 2005 | pages = 195 | isbn = 978-7-80665-620-4 |lang=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months consisted of three ''xún''. The first 10 days were the ''early xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|上旬}}}}), the middle 10 the ''mid xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|中旬}}}}), and the last nine (or 10) days were the ''late xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|下旬}}}}). Japan [[Japanese calendar#Subdivisions of the month|adopted this pattern]], with 10-day-weeks known as {{nihongo|''jun''|旬}}. In Korea, they were known as ''sun'' ({{lang-ko|label=none|순}},{{lang-ko|label=none|旬}}).

The structure of ''xún'' led to [[public holiday]]s every five or ten days. During the [[Han dynasty]], officials were legally required to rest every five days (twice a ''xún'', or 5–6 times a month). The name of these breaks became ''huan'' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|澣}} |s={{linktext|浣}}}}, "wash").

Grouping days into sets of ten is still used today in referring to specific natural events. "Three Fu" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三伏}}}}), a 29–30-day period which is the hottest of the year, reflects its three-''xún'' length.&lt;ref name="3 fu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/prtver/html/docs/education/edu01met/wxobs/folklore/ele_hs_c.shtml |author={{zh|labels=no|c=陳浩新}} |script-title=「冷在三九，熱在三伏」|trans-title=Cold is in the Three Nines, heat is in the Three Fu |website=Educational Resources - Hong Kong Observatory |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the winter solstice, nine sets of nine days were counted to calculate the end of winter.&lt;ref name="81 days"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/14/12/26/n4327438.htm |script-title=zh:【典故】冬至進入數九寒天 九九消寒圖蘊藏智慧 |trans-title=(Classical allusion) As the winter solstice enters into the shǔjǐu cold days, wisdom is hidden in the end-of-winter nine-nines calendar |website=Epoch Times |access-date=15 May 2018 |language=zh|date=2014-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven-day week was adopted from the Hellenistic system by the 4th century CE, although its source is unclear. It was again transmitted to China in the 8th century by [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] via [[Kangju]] (a Central Asian kingdom near [[Samarkand]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Dow/dowjpn.html |website=CJVLang |title=Days of the week in Japanese |access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 4th-century date, according to the ''[[Cihai]]'' encyclopedia,{{year needed|date=April 2015}} is due to a reference to Fan Ning ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|範寧}}|s={{linktext|范宁}}}}), an astrologer of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]].{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}}}{{efn|The renewed adoption from Manichaeans in the 8th century ([[Tang dynasty]]) is documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yi Jing]] and the Ceylonese Buddhist monk [[Amoghavajra|Bu Kong]].{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}}} and is the most-used system in modern China.

===Month===
Months are defined by the time between [[new moon]]s, which averages {{frac|29|17|32}} days. Instead of using half-days to balance months with the lunar cycle, every other month of the year has 29 days (short month, {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|小月}}}}) and the rest have 30 (long month, {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|大月}}}}). Years start on a long month and alternate. 

A 12-month-year using this system has 354 days, which would drift significantly from the [[tropical year]]. To fix this, traditional Chinese years have a 13-month year every other year. The 13-month version has the same alternation of long and short months, but adds a 30-day month at the end of the year. Years with 12 months are called common years, and 13-month years are known as long years. 

Although most of the above rules were used until the [[Tang dynasty]], different eras used different systems to keep lunar and solar years aligned. The [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] of the Taichu calendar was {{frac|29|43|81}} days long. The 7th-century, Tang-dynasty Wùyín Yuán Calendar was the first to determine month length by synodic month instead of the cycling method. Since then, month lengths have primarily been determined by observation and prediction.

The days of the month are numbered beginning with 1, and the day number is written with two characters.
Days one to 10 are written with the day [[Chinese numerals|numeral]], preceded by the character ''Chū'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|初}}}}); ''Chūyī'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|初一}}}}) is the first day of the month, and ''Chūshí'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=初{{linktext|十}}}}) the 10th. Days 11 to 20 are written as numerals; ''Shíwǔ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|十五}}}}) is the 15th day of the month, and ''Èrshí'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|二十}}}}) the 20th. Days 21 to 29 are written with the character ''Niàn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|廿}}}}) before the characters one through nine; ''Niànsān'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|廿三}}}}), for example, is the 23rd day of the month. Day 30 (as applicable) is written as the numeral ''Sānshí'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三十}}}}).

History books use days of the month numbered with the 60 stem-branches: {{Quote| text={{zh|labels=no|c=天聖元年....{{linktext|二月}}....{{linktext|丁|巳}}, 奉安太祖、太宗御容于南京鴻慶宮}}. &lt;br /&gt;[[Tiansheng Era (Song)|''Tiānshèng'']] 1st year....''Èryuè''....''Dīngsì'', the emperor's funeral was at his temple, and the imperial portrait was installed in Nanjing's ''Hongqing Palace''. |title=[[History of Song Dynasty]]|sign=|source=[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/宋史/卷009 Part 9, Volume 9: Renzong part 1] {{link language|zh}}}}

Because astronomical observation determines month length, dates on the calendar correspond to moon phases. The first day of each month is the new moon. On the seventh or eighth day of each month, the first-quarter moon is visible in the afternoon and early evening. In the 15th or 16th day of each month, the full moon is visible all night. On the 22nd or 23rd day of each month, the last-quarter moon is visible late at night and in the morning.

Since the beginning of the month is determined by the new moon occurs, other countries using this calendar use their own time standards to calculate it; this results in deviations. The first new moon in 1968 was at 16:29 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on January 29. Since [[North Vietnam]] used [[UTC+07:00]] to calculate their [[Vietnamese calendar]] and [[South Vietnam]] used [[UTC+08:00]] (Beijing time) to calculate theirs, North Vietnam began the [[Tết]] holiday at January 29 at 23:29 and South Vietnam began it on January 30 at 00:15. The time difference allowed asynchronous attacks in the [[Tet Offensive]].&lt;ref name="aslaksen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal.pdf |title=Mathematics of the Chinese calendar |last=Aslaksen |first=Helmer |date=July 17, 2010 |format=PDF |lang=en |website=www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen|publisher=Department of Maths, National University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar year and solar term===
{{See also|Solar term}}
The [[tropical year|solar year]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=岁|t=歲|p=Suì}}), the time between [[winter solstice]]s, is divided into 24 [[solar term]]s. Different versions of the traditional calendar might have different average solar-year lengths. One solar year of the [[1st century BC]] Tàichū calendar is {{frac|365|385|1539}} (365.25016) days. A solar year of the 13th-century Shòushí calendar is {{frac|365|97|400}} (365.2425) days, identical to the Gregorian calendar. The additional .00766 day from the Tàichū calendar leads to a one-day shift every 130.5 years.

Pairs of solar terms are climate terms, or solar months. The first solar term is "pre-climate" ({{zh|labels=no|s=节气|t=節氣|p=Jiéqì}}), and the second is "mid-climate" ({{zh|labels=no|s=中气|t=中氣|p=Zhōngqì}}).

There are generally 11 or 12 complete months, plus two incomplete months around the winter solstice, in a solar year. The 11 mid-climates, except for the winter solstice, are in the 11 or 12 complete months. The complete months are numbered from 0 to 10, and the incomplete months are considered the 11th month.

The first month without a mid-climate is the [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|leap]], or intercalary, month. Leap months are numbered with ''rùn'' {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏}}}}, the character for "intercalary", plus the name of the month they follow. In 2017, the intercalary month after month six was called ''Rùn Liùyuè'', or "intercalary sixth month" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏|六月}}}}) and written as ''6i'' or ''6+''. The next intercalary month (in 2020, after month four) will be called ''Rùn Sìyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏|四月}}}}) and written ''4i'' or ''4+''.

==={{anchor|Estimate the Chinese date|Birthday issue}}Lunisolar year===
The lunisolar year begins with the first spring month, ''Zhēngyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|正月}}|l=capital month}}), and ends with the last winter month, ''Làyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|腊月}}|t={{linktext|臘月}}|l=sacrificial month}}). All other months are named for their number in the month order. If a leap month falls after month 11—as it will in 2033—the 11th month will be ''Shíèryuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|十二月}}|l=twelfth month}}), and the leap month will be ''Làyuè''.

Years were traditionally numbered by the reign in ancient China, but this was abolished after the founding of the People's Republic of [[China]] in 1949. For example, the year from February 8, 2016 to January 27, 2017 was a ''Bǐngshēn'' year ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|丙申|年}}}}) of {{Chinese Year|l}}.

During the [[Tang Dynasty]], the Earthly Branches were used to mark the months from December 761 to May 762.&lt;ref name="new book of tang"&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=[[New Book of Tang]] |script-title=新唐書 |trans-chapter=Volume 6 Annals 6: Suzong, Daizong |script-chapter=新唐書卷六 本紀第六 肅宗 代宗 |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%94%90%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7006|quote={{zh|labels=no|c=上元…。二年……，九月壬寅，大赦，去「乾元大圣光天文武孝感」号，去「上元」号，称元年，以十一月为岁首，月以斗所建辰为名。…。&lt;br /&gt;元年建子月癸巳[2]，…。己亥[9]，…。丙午[16]，…。己酉[29]，…。庚戌[30]，…。[初一壬午大雪，十七冬至]&lt;br/&gt;建丑月辛亥[1]，…。己未[9]，…。乙亥[25]，…。[初一辛亥，初三小寒，十八大寒]&lt;br/&gt;宝应元年建寅月甲申[4]，…。乙酉[5]，…。丙戌[3]，…。甲辰[24]，…。戊申[28]，…。[初一辛巳，初三立春，十八雨水]&lt;br/&gt;建卯月辛亥[1]，…。壬子[2]，…。癸丑[3]，…。乙丑[15]，…。戊辰[18]，…。庚午[20]，…。壬申[22]，…。[初一辛亥，初四惊蛰，十九春分]&lt;br/&gt;建辰月壬午[3]，…。甲午[5]，…。戊申[19]，…。[初一庚辰，初五清明，二十谷雨]&lt;br/&gt;建巳月庚戌[1]，…。壬子[3]，…。甲寅[5]，…。乙丑[16]，…。大赦，改元年为宝应元年，复以正月为岁首，建巳月为四月。丙寅，…。[初一庚戌，初五甲寅立夏]。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over this period, the year began with the winter solstice.

==== {{anchor|Age recognition in China}}Age reckoning ====
{{Main|East Asian age reckoning}}
In China, a person's official age is based on the Gregorian calendar; for traditional use, age is based on the Chinese calendar. At birth, a child is considered one year old; after each Chinese New Year, one year is added to their traditional age. Because of the potential for confusion, infant ages are often given in months instead of years. 

After the Gregorian calendar's introduction in China, the Chinese traditional age was referred to as the "nominal age" ({{zh|labels=no |t=虛歲 |s=虚岁|p=xūsuì|l=fake age}}) and the Gregorian age was known as the "real age" ({{zh|labels=no |t=實歲 |s=实岁 |p=shísùi |l=real age}}).

==== {{anchor|Year numbering systems|Astrological epoch|''Yuán-Huì-Yùn-Shì'' system}}Year-numbering systems ====
====={{anchor|Era system}}Eras=====
{{Main|Chinese era name}}
In ancient China, years were numbered from a new emperor's assumption of the throne or an existing emperor's announcement of a new era name. The first recorded reign title was ''Jiànyuán'' ({{zh|labels=no |c = 建元 |l = founding era}}), from 140 BC; the last reign title was ''Xuāntǒng'' ({{zh|labels=no |s = 宣统 |t = 宣統}}, from 1908 AD. The era system was abolished in 1912, after which the current or [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republican era]] was used. 

====={{anchor|Stem-branches system}}Stem-branches=====
The 60 stem-branches have been used to mark the date since the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600-1046 BC). Astrologers knew that the orbital period of Jupiter is about 4,332 days. Since 4332 is 12 × 361, Jupiter's orbital period was divided into 12 years ({{zh|labels=no|s=岁|t=歲|p=suì}}) of 361 days each. The stem-branches system solved the era system's problem of unequal reign lengths. 

====={{anchor|Continuous year numbering}}Continuous numbering=====
Nomenclature similar to that of the Christian era has occasionally been used:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=辽宁大学学报：哲社版 Journal of Liaoning University: Philosophy and Social Science Edition|date=2004 |issue=6|pages=43–50 |title=[Subsidiary Relations in the Pre-Qin Period] |author=Liu Rong}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Huángdì year ({{zh|labels=no|t=黄帝紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the reign of the [[Yellow Emperor]] with year 0 at 2697 (or 2698) BC
* Yáo year ({{zh|labels=no|t=唐尧紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the reign of [[Emperor Yao]] (year 0 at 2156 BC)
* Gònghé year ({{zh|labels=no|t=共和紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the [[Gonghe Regency]] (year 0 at 841 BC)
* Confucius year ({{zh|labels=no|t=孔子紀年}}), starting at the birth year of [[Confucius]] (year 0 at 551 BC)
* Unity year ({{zh|labels=no|t=統一紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the reign of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (year 0 at 221 BC)
No reference date is universally accepted. The most popular is the Gregorian calendar ({{zh|labels=no|p=gōnglì|t={{linktext|公曆}}|s={{linktext|公历}}|l=common calendar}}).

On January 2, 1912, [[Sun Yat-sen]] announced changes to the official calendar and era. January 1 was Shíyīyuè 13th, 4609 Huángdì year, assuming a year 0 of 2698 BC. The change was adopted by many [[overseas Chinese]] communities, such as [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]].&lt;ref name="aslaksen" /&gt;

During the 17th century, the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits]] tried to determine the [[Epoch (reference date)|epochal year]] of the Han calendar. In his ''Sinicae historiae decas prima'' (published in [[Munich]] in 1658), [[Martino Martini]] (1614–1661) dated the ascension of the [[Yellow Emperor]] to 2697 BC and began the Chinese calendar with the reign of [[Fuxi]] (which, according to Martini, began in 2952 BC. [[Philippe Couplet]]'s 1686 ''Chronological table of Chinese monarchs'' (''Tabula chronologica monarchiae sinicae'') gave the same date for the Yellow Emperor. The Jesuits' dates provoked interest in Europe, where they were used for comparison with Biblical chronology.{{cn |date=October 2018}} Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini's dates, except that it usually places the reign of the Yellow Emperor at 2698 BC and omits his predecessors Fuxi and [[Shennong]] as "too legendary to include".{{Quote without source|date=October 2018}}

Publications began using the estimated birth date of the [[Yellow Emperor]] as the first year of the Han calendar in 1903, with newspapers and magazines proposing different dates. The province of [[Jiangsu]] counted 1905 as the year 4396 (using a year 0 of 2491 BC), and the newspaper ''[[Ming Pao]]'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=明報|s=明报}}) reckoned 1905 as 4603 (using a year 0 of 2698 BC).{{cn |date=October 2018}} [[Liu Shipei]] ({{lang|zh|劉師培}}, 1884–1919) created the Yellow Emperor Calendar, with year 0 as the birth of the emperor (which he determined as 2711 BC). There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century.{{sfnb|Cohen|2012| p = 1, 4}} Liu calculated that the 1900 international expedition sent by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] to suppress the [[Boxer Rebellion]] entered [[Beijing]] in the 4611th year of the Yellow Emperor.

The [[East Asian rainy season|plum-rains season]] ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|梅雨}}}}), the rainy season in late spring and early summer, begins on the first ''bǐng'' day after ''[[Mangzhong]]'' ({{zh|labels=no|芒种}}) and ends on the first ''wèi'' day after [[Xiaoshu]] ({{zh|labels=no|小暑}}). The [[dog days|Three Fu]] ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三伏}}|p=sānfú}}) are three periods of hot weather, counted from the first ''gēng'' day after the summer solstice. The first ''fu'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=初伏|p=chūfú}}) is 10 days long. The mid-''fu'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=中伏|p=zhōngfú}}) is 10 or 20 days long.

It is distinct from [[vestment]]s in that it is not reserved specifically for services.  Practices vary: is sometimes worn under vestments, and sometimes as the everyday clothing or street wear of a [[priest]], [[religious minister|minister]], or other clergy member.  In some cases, it can be similar or identical to the [[religious habit|habit]] of a [[monk]] or [[nun]].

In modern times, many [[Christianity|Christian]] clergy have adopted the use of a shirt with a [[clerical collar]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Catholicism (Latin Rite)==
In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council made it mandatory for all the Christian clergy to wear distinctive dress.  Its purpose was not necessarily to elevate the status of the Christian clerics; it was intended that they would catch the public eye if any member of the clergy is seen on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CH310/CH310_T_32.html | dead-url = yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517201531/http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CH310/CH310_T_32.html | archive-date=May 17, 2008 | title = Lesson 32: Wycliffe &amp; Hus | first = David | last = Calhoun | date = | work = Ancient &amp; Medieval Church History | publisher = Covenant Theological Seminary | location = St. Louis, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the rules at the time were not the same as the modern rules, and the rules vary by jurisdiction.

[[File:Osmin Gardey 1836-1914.jpg|thumb|The Rabat, worn until the early 20th century.]]
*[[Cassock]]: A long-sleeved, hoodless garment. Depending on the climate it can be made of very lightweight material or heavy wool. In tropical climates white is worn. This is the norm for secular clergy and members of religious institutes. Some religious societies such as the Jesuits and Redemptorists wear their own style of cassock. Monks and friars wear a habit which can differ considerably from the cassock. Cassocks are generally ankle-length. The color is black for priests, black with purple piping for canons, black with fuchsia piping for monsignors, black with red piping for bishops; and black with scarlet for cardinals. The Roman Pontiff wears a white cassock. Monsignors, bishops and cardinals have what is known as a "choir cassock" for liturgical occasions but this is not worn for everyday wear. 
* [[Ferraiolo]]: A full-length cape reaching to the ankles. This is only worn with the cassock on formal [[white tie]] or [[Morning dress]] occasions.
* Cape: A covering for the cassock in cold weather. 
* [[Greca (clothing)]] (douillette): An overcoat covering the cassock. 
* Hat: [[Zuchetto]] or [[biretta]], depending on circumstance. The biretta is not worn outside of liturgical events.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* [[Clerical collar]]: There are a variety of options for daily clerical attire, all involving the use of a clerical collar:
**Collarino (Tab Collar): This is probably the most common type of shirt and collar among Roman Catholic clergy. It resembles a standard dress shirt, but has a standing black collar that is sewn to accommodate a white cloth or soft plastic insert, leaving a small white square at the base of the throat.
**Neckband: A collarless shirt (similar to a banded collar shirt) tailored to accommodate a strip of linen or plastic that, when worn over the shirt, creates a standing white collar that rings the neck. This [[detachable collar]] is fastened with collar stays or buttons.  These shirts and detachable collars were originally intended to be worn underneath a waistcoat, rabat, or cassock.  Today these shirts are almost invariably black poly-cotton, but when worn under a waistcoat or rabat are usually white and made of a higher quality oxford cotton weave.
**Clerical waistcoat or rabat: Clerical waistcoats or rabats are the most traditional and formal item of clerical costume.  They are almost always black and are made of worsted wool.  Clerical waistcoats generally sport silk backing.  They are worn over a neckband shirt and a detachable collar to create a cassock-like appearance about the neck.  Unlike the waistcoats that accompany suits, they button all the way to the collar.  The rabat is a late innovation, and exactly mirrors the clerical waistcoat, except that it is backless.

In Rome, Roman Catholic clergy are permitted to wear black, grey, and blue clerical shirts, while in the United States they are permitted to wear only black, quite likely because of long-standing custom and to distinguish them from non-Catholic clergy.

This applies to the Latin clergy only. Clergy of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] dress in a similar fashion to local Orthodox clergy.

==Eastern Christianity==
In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es a useful distinction between liturgical vestments and clerical clothing is that vestments are required to be blessed before being worn. Conversely, clerical clothing is not, and is regarded as daily wear.

*[[Cassock|Inner cassock]]: The inner cassock (more commonly, simply ''cassock'') is a floor length garment, usually black, worn by all clergy members, monastics, and seminarians.
*[[Cassock|Outer cassock]]: Called a ''ryasa'' ({{lang-ru|ряса}}) or ''exorason'', the outer cassock is a large flowing garment worn over the inner cassock by bishops, priests, deacons, and monastics.
*[[Skufia]]: A soft-sided cap worn by monastics or awarded to clergy as a mark of honor.
*[[Kamilavka]]: A stiff hat worn by monastics or awarded to clergy as a mark of honor.
*[[Apostolnik]]: A veil worn either by nuns, either alone or with a ''skufia''.
*[[Epanokamelavkion]]: A veil extending over the back, worn with the ''kamilavka'' by all monastics and bishops.
*[[Klobuk]]: A ''kamilavka'' with an ''epanokamelavkion'' permanently attached; more common in the Russian tradition.

*Married Priests can wear an exorasson or zostikon when not celebrating Liturgy and may opt to wear the more informal skufia over the more formal Kamilavkion. They may also wear a vest called a kontorasson, usually during colder weather. The colors of their cassocks vary between the typical black, grey and blue.

==Anglicanism==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
According to the 1604 Canons of the Church of England, the clergy were supposed to wear cassock, gown, and cap whilst going about their duties.  The cassock was either double or single breasted; buttoned at the neck or shoulder, and was held at the waist with a belt or cincture.  The gown could either be of the special clerical shape - open at the front with balloon sleeves - or the gown of the wearer's degree.  This was worn with the [[Canterbury Cap]], which gradually stiffened into the familiar 'mortar board' in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Cassock and gown were worn as outdoor dress until the beginning of the nineteenth century, with the Canterbury Cap being replaced by the mortar board or tri-corn hat latterly.  Increasingly, though, ordinary men's clothing in black, worn with a white shirt and either a black or white cravat, replaced the dress prescribed by the Canons.

In the 19th century, it was fashionable among gentlemen to wear a [[detachable collar]] which was washed and starched separately from the shirt. Initially with the detachable collar, Anglican clergy wore a white cravat, later a white bow tie, with a waistcoat with a standing collar and a loose clerical frock coat resembling a knee length cassock with multiple buttons to waist level. Alternatively they could wear the normal style of gentleman's frock coat and a rabat (See above). In the earlier part of the century, Evangelicals often wore 'swallow tail' coats to distinguish themselves from the High Churchmen who favored the frock coat.  This distinction is mentioned as late as 1857 when it is alluded to in Anthony Trollope's 'Barchester Towers.' In the middle of the century Anglican clergymen began turning the collar around backwards, creating the first versions of the "dog collar". This form of distinctive dress was seen as a controversial affectation of the High Church party, but as time progressed the collar-turned-backwards became more common, and even survived the demise of detachable collars among the general public. Although the black waistcoat has given way to a black shirt, the collar has become a daily part of clerical costume for most Anglican clergy. However, some Anglican clergy join with ministers of reformed churches in eschewing distinctive clerical costume entirely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. During the 20th century Anglican bishops began wearing purple (officially violet) shirts as a sign of their office. Along with the [[pectoral cross]] and [[episcopal ring]], this marks them off from other clergy in appearance. While there is no law among the churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] that prevents other members of the clergy from wearing a purple shirt, to do so is generally not considered appropriate.

Until the Regency period, Anglican clergy regularly wore the cassock in public, after enjoying something of a revival in the mid-20th century, this custom is again less common. The traditional Anglican headwear with the cassock was the Canterbury cap, which is now seldom used. Some [[Anglo-Catholic]] clergy still wear the [[biretta]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} From the mid-eighteenth century, Bishops and archdeacons traditionally wore a shortened version of the cassock, called an [[apron]] (which hung just above the knee), along with breeches and [[gaiter]]s. The gaiters, buttoned up the side, would cover the trouser leg to a point just below the knee. This form of everyday vesture, common up until the 1960s, is now almost extinct. (This was appropriate for them in the time when some of their travelling would be on horseback but continued into the middle of the 20th century.)

Some Anglican clergy favour a double-breasted cassock (known as a [[Cassock|Sarum]]), often with an external button at chest level on which to hook an [[academic hood]] (which is worn as part of the [[choir habit]]). However, most Clergy, including[[Anglo-Catholic]] Clergy, choose the single breasted cassock. Like Roman Catholic clergy, some Anglican clergy wear the fascia (known within Anglicanism as a cincture) around the waist, while others prefer a belt. Where extra protection from the elements is needed a cloak may be worn over the cassock.

Clergy of the [[royal peculiars]], senior chaplains to the forces, members of the [[Chapels Royal]] and Honorary Chaplains to the Queen may wear a scarlet cassock and a special badge (Queen's cypher surmounted by [[St Edward's crown]] surrounded by oak and laurel leaves) on their scarf.

It has been mentioned above that the headcover normally worn with the cassock is the biretta (for Roman Catholics) or the Canterbury Cap (for Anglicans). In the 19th century clergy, like most gentlemen of the time, wore the tall silk (top) hat with their outdoor dress and this remained traditional for bishops and other senior clergy for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Madeleine|title=Victorian Dress in Photographs|year=1982|publisher=Batsford|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However many clergy preferred to wear the [[cappello romano]], a distinctive broad brimmed round topped hat resembling a low crowned bowler and this remained popular until the [[World War I]], when it tended to be substituted by the dark or black Homburg style hat worn by many professional men until recently.

==Lutheranism==
[[File:Erik Norman Svendsen.jpg|thumb|upright|The ruff, as worn by a Danish Lutheran bishop]]
[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] clerical clothing varies depending on locality and denomination. The clerical clothing of Lutheran priests and bishops often mirrors that of Catholic clergy; cassock or clerical shirt and a detachable clerical collar. In Scandinavia Lutheran bishops usually wear a [[pectoral cross]].

Danish clergy will wear a black cassock, as in Anglican and Catholic traditions, but with a distinctive [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]]. The ruff is a large collar, stiffly starched, worn over the top of a full clerical collar.  Until the 1980s, this used to be the custom in Norway also, and was a relic of the period when Denmark-Norway had shared a common monarchy (1384-1814).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ruff (collar) |url=http://www.memidex.com/ruff+collar|publisher=Memidex|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Sweden, a distinctive form of frock coat was worn by the clergy, and is still seen on formal occasions when it is worn with a stand-up collar and short bands.

==Methodism==

===United Kingdom===
In British [[Methodism]], a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] ([[presbyter]]) often wears a simple business suit with a coloured shirt and [[clerical collar]]. For more formal services a minister will adopt a cassock with [[bands (neckwear)|bands]]. For ceremonial and very formal occasions, such as the ([[United Kingdom|British]]) [[Remembrance Day]] service at the [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|Cenotaph]] in [[London]], a traditional black [[Geneva gown|Geneva preaching gown]], [[academic dress#Hood|academic hood]] and bands may be worn.

[[Methodist diaconal order|Methodist deacons]] (male or female) have a less strict dress code; but they often wear dark blue clothing, and always wear the [[pectoral cross]] of their religious order.

The dress of those lay members of the congregation who sing in the choir, and of the organist, varies from congregation to congregation. A typical costume might be a blue cassock, English-style plain white [[surplice]], and for women a [[canterbury cap]].

===United States===
Dress in the [[United Methodist Church]] differs from the British norms. There are no official rules on vestments or clerical clothing. Therefore, use of clerical clothing by United Methodist clergy varies greatly by location and situation. Methodist clergy frequently wear clerical clothing on pastoral visits at hospitals and nursing facilities. Elders will most frequently wear black or blue clerical shirts while bishops will wear purple.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Cultural influence of ''Star Trek''}}
''[[Star Trek]]'' is one of the most culturally-influential media franchises, and is often regarded as the most influential [[Science fiction on television|science fiction TV series]] in history.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The original series, which aired in the late 1960s, has since spawned six successor series and thirteen movies {{as of|2017|December|lc=on}}, merchandise, and a multibillion-dollar industry collectively known as the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[media franchise|franchise]]. The franchise is owned by [[CBS Television Studios]], which now owns television properties previously held by [[Paramount Pictures]], the studio that produced ''Star Trek'' for many decades. CBS Paramount continues to hold DVD rights to the TV series, and the rights to produce feature films.

Two films, ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' (1999) and ''[[Free Enterprise (film)|Free Enterprise]]'' (1999), and a television series, ''[[The Orville]]'', have been inspired by the '''cultural influence of ''Star Trek'''''.

==''Star Trek: The Original Series''==
{{rquote|left|The fact is, never in the history of any entertainment medium has there ever been a story, an idea, a situation, a set of characters, or a theme that has approached the magnitude or impact of ''Star Trek''.|''A Vision of the Future'' (1998)&lt;ref name="poe1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Vision of the Future | author=Poe, Stephen Edward | year=1998 | publisher=Simon and Schuster | isbn=0-671-53481-5}}{{rp|56}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[Gene Roddenberry]] sold ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' in 1964 to [[NBC]] as a classic adventure drama, calling it a "[[Wagon Train]] to the Stars". But Roddenberry wanted to tell more sophisticated stories, using [[futurism|futuristic]] situations as [[analogy|analogies]] for current problems on Earth and showing how they could be rectified through [[humanism]] and optimism. The series' writers frequently addressed moral and social issues such as slavery, warfare, and discrimination. The opening line "to boldly go [[where no man has gone before]]" is almost [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] from a [[United States|U.S.]] [[White House]] booklet on space produced after the ''[[Sputnik]]'' flight in 1957.

A major inspiration for ''Star Trek'' was the science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', whose influence is especially apparent in the pilot episode "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifidimensions.com/Sep00/forbidden_planet.htm ''Forbidden Planet'', Science Fiction Movies, Leslie Neilsen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315081605/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Sep00/forbidden_planet.htm |date=2009-03-15 }}.

At a time when there were few non-white or foreign roles in American television dramas, Roddenberry created a multi-ethnic crew for the Enterprise, including an African woman ([[Uhura]]), a Scotsman ([[Montgomery Scott]]), an Asian man ([[Hikaru Sulu]]), and—most notably{{original research inline|date=December 2017}}—an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]], the half-[[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] [[Spock]]. In the second season, reflecting the contemporaneous [[Cold War]], Roddenberry added a Russian crew member, ([[Pavel Chekov]]). The original series is also credited with American television's first interracial kiss, between a white man and an African-American woman, although this had happened earlier in a British medical soap opera, ''[[Emergency – Ward 10#Overview|Emergency – Ward 10]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/soaps/british.html Soaps | British] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219181045/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/soaps/british.html |date=2012-02-19 }}. TVARK. Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the spy series ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', featured a scripted, unedited interracial kiss between [[Robert Culp]] (white) and [[France Nuyen]] (Vietnamese) in the episode "The Tiger"; a kiss that would not gain the controversy or attention as the ''Star Trek'' kiss.

''Star Trek''{{'}}s contributions to television history include giving women jobs of respect, most notably through the casting of Nichelle Nichols, a black actress, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Black actresses at that time on television were almost always cast as servants. In fact, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] recalled that the first time she saw Uhura, she excitedly told her mother: "Mama, there's a black woman on television and she ain't no maid!" In an interview, Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that ''Star Trek'' was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [She told King about her plans to leave the series.] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.'&lt;/blockquote&gt; When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.&lt;ref name="freep"&gt;''The Detroit Free Press''; September 6, 2016; page 3C&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Original Series'' has later received some criticism for its portrayal of women, particularly its visual aesthetics. Women's crew uniforms, which consisted of miniskirts, high heeled boots, and heavy makeup, have been pointed-to as degrading to women for highlighting their frequent role as sexual objects. Researchers have pointed out that this was not necessarily the way the wardrobe, or the overall femininity of female characters in the series, was viewed by contemporary female viewers. Cited are the concerns of women of the time period with the perceived upsetting of traditional gender roles for women of the future, with the women of the show's feminine behavior acting to reaffirm that women's sexuality and traditional femininity would not be lost. This fear was manifested by the media's criticisms of Valentina Tereshkova, the first female astronaut to go to space, as masculine and "mannish".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The uniform's usage of the miniskirt was also considered progressive by some at the time, as the miniskirt, at that time, was a symbol of the modern woman's economic and sexual independence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vettel-Becker, Patricia.

Computer engineer and entrepreneur [[Steve Wozniak]] credited watching ''Star Trek'' and attending ''Star Trek'' conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for him co-founding [[Apple Inc.]] in 1976, which would later become the [[List of the largest information technology companies|world's largest information technology company]] by revenue and the [[Mobile phone#By manufacturer|world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interview-steve-wozniak-on-sci-fi-comic-books-and_us_58f7e86de4b081380af51897 Steve Wozniak on Sci-Fi, Comic Books, and How Star Trek Shaped the Future]. Retrieved on January 2, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gained multiple [[Emmy Award]] nominations during its run, but never won. Despite a restricted budget, the series' special effects were superior to contemporary TV series, its stories were often written by prominent [[list of science fiction authors|science fiction authors]] (though often re-written by the series' regular writers),&lt;ref name="Science Fiction 1979, Page570"&gt;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Gen Ed Peter Nichols, Granada 1979, Page570&lt;/ref&gt; and many of its production values—such as [[costuming]] and [[set design]]—were of high caliber for such a low budget. Some of the production staff of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' worked on ''[[Star Trek]]'' and often made creative re-use of props from the earlier series.&lt;ref name="fastcopyinc.com"/&gt;

During its network run from 1966 to 1969, ''TOS'' [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were mediocre. A letter-writing campaign by fans, unprecedented in size, contributed to NBC's decision to renew the series for a third season, but the network put the series in a [[Friday night death slot|disadvantageous timeslot]], and ''TOS'' was finally canceled after its third season.

==Cancellation and aftermath==
[[File:The Shuttle Enterprise - GPN-2000-001363.jpg|thumb|235px|In 1976, a letter-writing campaign compelled [[NASA]] to name the inaugural (and test) [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|space shuttle ''Enterprise'']] after the [[Starship Enterprise|fictional starship]]. In this image, ''Enterprise'' is rolled out of the Palmdale manufacturing facilities with ''Star Trek'' television cast members and creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in attendance.]]
After its cancellation, through reruns ''Star Trek'' became more popular and reached a much wider audience than when it had originally aired.&lt;ref name="shult19720703"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rx0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gX4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=star-trek%20syndication%20%7C%20rerun&amp;pg=6303%2C2206524 | title=Cult Fans, Reruns Give 'Star Trek' an Out of This World Popularity | author=Shult, Doug | accessdate=March 4, 2011 | date=1972-07-03 | publisher=Milwaukee Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as [[trekkie|"trekkies" or "trekkers"]], the series' fans formed clubs and organized conventions. In 1976, following another fan-organized letter-writing campaign, [[NASA]] named its first [[Space Shuttle program|space shuttle orbiter]], [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'' (OV-101)]], after the fictional [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|starship]].&lt;ref name="ciss-enterprise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov:80/osf/shuttle/orbiters.html|title=The Names of the Space Shuttle Orbiters|author=Dawn Brooks|publisher=nasa.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614151658/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/shuttle/orbiters.html|archivedate=June 14, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA also employed actress [[Nichelle Nichols]], who played Uhura, to help recruiting African-Americans and women to become astronauts.

==Waxing and waning==
In the mid-1970s, encouraged by the burgeoning fan base for the series, Roddenberry sought to start a second television series (''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]''); this abortive attempt morphed into ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' in 1979. The movie did sufficiently well at the [[box office]], grossing more than [[United States dollar|$]]80 million in the United States and $139 million worldwide,&lt;ref name=The_Numbers&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; to spawn several more movies during the 1980s. In 1987, Roddenberry created a second television series, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG''), which was set aboard the fifth starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-D)]] more than seventy years after events in the earlier series and related movies. Unlike ''TOS''—which often reflected a bold, interventionist American philosophy—''TNG'' had a less aggressive and more [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] message. Unlike its progenitor, this series entered [[Television syndication|syndicated]], rather than a nationwide network, from the beginning, and was sold to individual local television stations. It became the number one syndicated television, lasting seven seasons, spawned two [[sequel]]s, a [[prequel]], four movies, and a vast marketing franchise.

''Star Trek'' and its spin-offs have proved highly popular in television repeats, shown repeatedly on television stations in the United States and throughout the world. The ''Star Trek'' franchise is similarly prolific. Only ''[[Star Wars]]'' has had as significant an influence as a science fiction and [[popular culture]] phenomenon.

''Star Trek'' [[science fiction convention|conventions]] have been popular, but are waning{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} and are now often meshed with conventions of other genres. [[Science fiction fandom|Fans]] coined the terms [[Trekkies|"Trekkies" and "Trekkers"]] to describe themselves, and produce an abundance of material like [[fanzine]]s with fiction, art and songs.

The series cultural influence goes far beyond its longevity and profitability. An entire subculture grew up around the series and, anecdotally, there are indications that ''Star Trek'' has influenced many people's lives.

A broad consensus amongst fans is that the ''Star Trek'' franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s on account of over-exploitation of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though fans do not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of ''TOS'' felt it also could be formulaic and repetitive&lt;ref name="Science Fiction 1979, Page570"/&gt;).

==The music of ''Star Trek''==
{{Main|List of Star Trek composers and music}}
The opening fanfare of ''Star Trek: The Original Series'', written by [[Alexander Courage]], is one of the most culturally-recognized musical [[meme]]s in existence.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Also included as the opening fanfare to ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and the ''Star Trek'' [[Star Trek (film series)|film series]], it has come to iconically symbolize ''Star Trek'' to even the casual viewer. [[Michael Giacchino]] has written a well-received distinctive new fanfare for the reboot ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' movie and its sequels, ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]''.

''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' received their own distinctive opening fanfares. In a departure from the tradition of sweeping classical themes symbolizing the various incarnations of ''Star Trek'', the opening theme to ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' is the (pre-existing) [[pop music|pop song]] "[[Faith of the Heart]]", by [[Diane Warren]] (''Star Trek: Enterprise'' episodes close with the more-traditionalized "Archer's Theme" epilogue, as a consolation to disappointed ''Star Trek'' music fans).

Some of the most prominent composers of 20th- and 21st-century [[film score|film music]] have written film scores and television scores for ''Star Trek''. These include [[Jay Chattaway]], [[Cliff Eidelman]], [[Michael Giacchino]], [[Jerry Goldsmith]], [[James Horner]], [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]] and [[Leonard Rosenman]].

A subgenre of ''Star Trek'' fandom has developed, specifically for the music of ''Star Trek'', which includes music lovers who are not otherwise interested in ''Star Trek'' fandom. Dozens of commercially produced musical recordings of performances of ''Star Trek'' music exist—unrelated to the performance of screen ''Star Trek'' itself—evidencing the intrinsic cultural value and influence of the music of ''Star Trek''.

A concert series, ''[[Star Trek: The Music]]'', by [[Erich Kunzel]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]], played in several [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] cities between 2007 and 2010.

==Science fiction, fantasy and television==
The first television series with comparable storyline and set-up to ''Star Trek'' (aside from the genre rival ''[[Doctor Who]]'') was the 1990s series ''[[Babylon 5]]''. When pitching the series, the producer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] had hoped that television executives would think ''Trek'' had opened up the market for science-fiction on television. However, he was told that ''Star Trek'' only created a market for more ''Star Trek'' and that the prospects for non-Trek related science fiction were seen as bleak. Eventually, ''Babylon 5'' was greenlit. Three script writers who had worked for the original ''Trek'' series were to write for ''Babylon 5'' (including [[D. C. Fontana]] who had written for three different ''Trek'' series), and ''Star Trek'' actor [[Walter Koenig]] was cast in a recurring role. All this, and the strong similarities of the series' premise to ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' invited comparison to ''Star Trek''. In addition, ''Babylon 5'' was the first television series since ''Star Trek'' to get nominated for or win the Hugo award for best science fiction drama, which had only recognized feature films in the media category since ''Star Trek''. Gene Roddenberry's widow and ''Star Trek'' actress, [[Majel Barrett|Majel Barrett-Roddenberry]], publicly stated that her decision to do a guest star appearance on ''Babylon 5'' was to stop the feuding and bickering among hardline fans of the two series, which broke out occasionally at science fiction conventions. Ultimately, the series ran for its intended length of five seasons, making it the longest running American space oriented futuristic television series outside of the ''Star Trek'' franchise.

===''Star Trek'' fandom in fiction===
Some television series feature major or supporting characters whose love of ''Star Trek'' affects the storyline of the series.
 
"The Replacement", a Season 5 episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', features two versions of the character [[Xander Harris|Xander]], a ''Star Trek'' fan, which is a simultaneous tribute to the ''Star Trek'' episode "[[The Enemy Within (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Enemy Within]]", in which there are two Captain Kirks.

In crossover casting, two other television series have cast actors from ''Star Trek'' in series in which other characters are ''Star Trek'' fans who frequently refer to ''Trek'' moments or cite ''Trek'' storylines. The character [[Hiro Nakamura]] on NBC's ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' likes to describe his ability to teleport as "like ''Star Trek''", and has often performed Mr. Spock's [[Vulcan salute]]. His father is played by original ''Star Trek'' cast member George Takei (Sulu). Additionally, [[Nichelle Nichols]], who portrayed [[Uhura]] on ''The Original Series'' also appears on the series.

Over a dozen actors from various ''Star Trek'' series have made guest appearances on one or the other of the ''Stargate'' series. In those series, Colonel [[Jack O'Neill]] makes unsuccessful pitches to name new space vessels after the ''Enterprise'', and also gives the Vulcan salute in tribute to ''Trek''. In an earlier episode of ''[[Stargate: SG-1]]'', O'Neill travels back in time to the 1960s and during an interrogation by an Air Force officer he refers to himself as "James T. Kirk, captain of the federation starship Enterprise". Another ''Trek'' reference is made when a character questions whether or not another team member can be "beamed up". The response is "What am I, Scotty"? Later on the series, advanced alien technology allows team members to "beam" up and down in manner similar to that seen on ''Star Trek''.

In the Cold War submarine film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' (1995), in a moment of crisis, the USS Alabama executive officer (played by [[Denzel Washington]]) gives a pep talk to his young radioman, urging him to repair the ship's radio by referring to Kirk's telling Scotty they need "more power". The ''Trek'' fandom of Noel, a recurring character on the sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', plays a role in several episodes, including "Star Mitzvah", in which he deceives Frasier into believing a speech is written in Hebrew when it is really in the Klingon language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Star Mitzvah |series=Frasier |first1=Kelsey |last1=Grammer |first2=Sheldon |last2=Epps |first3=Sam |last3=Johnson |network=NBC |date=November 2002 |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9xWYApbd6Y |season=10 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characters from the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', especially [[Sheldon Cooper]], make various references to and are big fans of ''Star Trek'', with Sheldon even citing Starfleet regulations during an argument in one episode and the main characters dressing up as [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], [[Worf]], [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] and a [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] drone, respectively, in another. Also the series features [[Wil Wheaton]] in a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself plus guest appearances from [[Brent Spiner]] and [[LeVar Burton]], and a voice-only cameo from [[Leonard Nimoy]], who voices a Mr. Spock action figure talking to Sheldon in his dreams. There was also an appearance of a [[Gorn]] in one episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndo-fkY7fnc|title=A Gorn Sitting On Sheldon's Spot - The Big Bang Theory|date=5 October 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorn captain's fight to the death with Captain Kirk in the original ''Star Trek'' episode, "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]", was the subject of an episode of the television series ''[[MythBusters]]'', in which the viability of Kirk's improvised bamboo cannon was put to the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OclaRDU0fNg|title=Mythbusters: Mini Myth Mayhem - Gorn Cannon Myth Sneak Peek|date=18 December 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Trek'' has been the subject of a large number of parodies and tributes.

Prominent among film parodies is ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', as it parodied the original ''Star Trek'' series, elements of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', and the whole [[Trekkie]] phenomenon.

On television, the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' makes frequent references to ''Star Trek'' and parodies some of its better known plot elements on a regular basis, including the character [[Zapp Brannigan]] who is based on a combination of Captain Kirk and William Shatner, and cast members of the original series have taken part in [[Where No Fan Has Gone Before|one episode]].&lt;ref name="locus"&gt;Cook, Lucius (April 26, 2004). [http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Reviews/04Cook_Futurama.html Hey Sexy Mama, Wanna Kill All Humans?: Looking Backwards at Futurama, The Greatest SF Show You've Never Seen]. ''[[Locus Online]]''. Retrieved on July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent examples in other television series include multiple episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''. The children's series ''[[The Backyardigans]]'' has an episode titled "Garbage Trek" that is an homage to the original series. [[Joss Whedon]] has cited ''Star Trek'' as being the father of his cult series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and its film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005).

The direct-to-video series ''[[VeggieTales]]'' features two ''Star Trek'' parodies, including "The Gourds Must Be Crazy" (from ''Are You My Neighbor?'') and ''Veggies in Space: The Fennel Frontier'' which serves as a sequel to the other. The character Scooter is based on Montgomery Scott.

There are many other parodies in comic strips, music and computer games, such as Eminem's song "We Made You". In the music video, Eminem was dressed as Mr. Spock and Dr. Dre as Captain Kirk.

In 1995, MTV's animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' parodied the series with Beavis as Captain Picard and Butt-Head as Commander Riker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/beavis-and-butthead/dream-on-58264/|title=Beavis and Butt-head - Season 5, Episode 22: Dream On - TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire [[Finland|Finnish]] [[parody]] series ''[[Star Wreck]]'' was produced starting in 1992, culminating with ''[[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]]'' in 2005, all available as legal downloads on the web [https://web.archive.org/web/20120314091958/http://lame.lut.fi/starwreck/]. ''[[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]]'' is a fan-made parody of both ''Star Trek'' and ''[[Babylon 5]]''.

[[NASA]] and other institutions have paid explicit tribute to the series in the use of names of ships and characters from the series. Subtle acknowledgments in media and real life include the use of ''Star Trek'' ships' registry numbers, especially the Enterprise's NCC-1701.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Two episodes of ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'' parodied ''Star Trek'' (with the main character as a Captain Kirk-esque character; one episode featured William Shatner voicing the villain Captain Berserk).

In August 2010, the members of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] created a six-minute ''Star Trek'' themed training [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxU6n4pAnrU video] for an agency conference. The video featured a mock set of the ''Enterprise'' in one of the agency's studios. The project cost 62 hours of staff time and cost $3,100. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds and "insulting the beloved sci-fi TV show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/irs-official-apologizes-star-trek-spoof-video-article-1.1365589 | title=IRS Official Apologizes for Wasting Funds on 'Star Trek' Spoof Video | publisher=New York Daily News | accessdate=24 May 2016 | date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2013/0604/How-much-did-IRS-spend-filming-Star-Trek-spoof-video | title=How Much did IRS Spend Filming 'Star Trek' Spoof? | publisher=The Christian Science Monitor | date=4 June 2013 | accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Dan|title=IRS Official Apologizes for 'Star Trek' Spoof Video|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/irs-official-apologizes-star-trek-spoof-video-article-1.1365589|accessdate=25 May 2016|work=NY Daily News|publisher=New York Daily News|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Animaniacs]]'' has made an obvious parody of ''Star Trek'', calling it ''Star Truck''. Another ''Star Trek'' band, [[Warp 11]], has released several studio albums.

==Locations==
===Canada===
A limited number of [[Famous Players]] theatres in Canada house large replicas of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-A)]]. They can be found in the cities of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ottawa]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]. In the [[Greater Toronto Area]], replicas can be seen in the [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], and in the [[SilverCity]] in Richmond Hill.

In addition, a replica of the [[Sovereign class starship (Star Trek)|Sovereign-class]] [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-E)]] can be found in Laser Planet in [[Oakville, Ontario]] as well as in the Colossus theatres, in [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley, British Columbia]] and [[Laval, Québec]].

The coincidentally-named [[Vulcan, Alberta]] hosts ''Trek''-related memorabilia and events.

===United States===

[[Riverside, Iowa]] has proclaimed itself the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of ''Star Trek'', asserts in the book ''The Making of Star Trek'' by Stephen Whitfield, that the character of Kirk had been born in the state of Iowa. In March 1985, when the town was looking for a theme for its annual town festival, Steve Miller, a member of the Riverside City Council who had read Roddenberry's book, suggested to the council that Riverside should proclaim itself to be the future birthplace of Kirk. Miller's motion passed unanimously. The council later wrote to Roddenberry for his permission to be designated as the official birthplace of Kirk, and Roddenberry agreed. In the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 ''Star Trek'' reboot]], Riverside is depicted as having a Starfleet shipyard on its outskirts, where the USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701) was built.

The city of [[Garland, Texas]] is the first city known to have an official place name based on the television series: "Star Trek Lane", located off of Apollo Road and east of North Jupiter Road ({{coord|32.953|-96.681}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yahoo Maps|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/index.php#mvt=h&amp;q1=3499+Aquarius+Circle%2C+Garland%2C+TX&amp;trf=0&amp;lon=-96.681463&amp;lat=32.952364&amp;mag=1|accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Birmingham, Alabama]] also boasts a "Star Trek Lane" and "Star Trek Circle", in the Sunrise East subdivision of its Roebuck neighborhood.

The unincorporated Sky Parkway area of South [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] has a number of space-themed street names, including Klingon Court and Romulan Court.

An unincorporated area near the [[Las Vegas Strip]] contains a residential street named "Roddenberry Avenue". While the mailing address lists the avenue as being located in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], the physical address is an unincorporated township called "[[Enterprise, Nevada|Enterprise]]". There is no indication that the township's name has any connection with the ''Star Trek'' series, and it is unknown whether or not the street name is a deliberate tribute to the ''Star Trek'' creator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/maps?q=Roddenberry+Ave,+Las+Vegas,+NV+89123,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title Google Maps: Roddenberry Ave].

Udvar-Hazy Center]] annex of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] occasionally hosts set pieces and movie screenings.

==''Star Trek'' and space exploration==
The series greatly influenced public interest in the U.S. Space Program and in education on the topic of space exploration. ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' ran from 1966 to 1969 benefited from the popularity of the televised [[Apollo 11]] moon landing. The association between ''Star Trek'' and NASA grew stronger over time - the first NASA orbiter shuttle, [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'']], was named after the USS ''Enterprise'' of ''Star Trek'' fame.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, J. (1994, March 18). Enterprise(OV-101). Retrieved March 10, 2015, from http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/enterprise.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IXS Enterprise|IXS ''Enterprise'']], NASA's conceptual design for a [[superluminal]] [[spacecraft]], was similarly named after the USS ''Enterprise'' in 2014.

This connection remained solid throughout the 1990s, when many of the cast members began narrating documentaries about the franchise's content and space exploration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Some of these documentaries were produced in cooperation with NASA itself, most notably the IMAX title ''Destiny in Space'' (1994), narrated by Leonard Nimoy. In 2013, NASA produced a 30-second ad to accompany the theatrical release of ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' in an effort to bolster support for its space program.&lt;ref&gt;Spaleta, S. (n.d.). NASA Ad to Play Before New Star Trek Movie | Video | Space.com. Retrieved March 10, 2015, from http://www.space.com/20456-nasa-ad-to-play-before-new-star-trek-movie-video.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, NASA has named a number of [[asteroid]]s after people or elements connected to the ''Star Trek'' franchise:

* [[4659 Roddenberry]]
* [[7307 Takei]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">'''Enrollment Management''' is a term that is used frequently in higher education to describe well-planned strategies and tactics to shape the enrollment of an institution and meet established goals.  Plainly stated, enrollment management is an organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments. {{ref|hossler}}

Such practices often include marketing, admission policies, retention programs, and financial aid awarding. Strategies and tactics are informed by collection, analysis, and use of data to project successful outcomes. Activities that produce measurable improvements in yields are continued and/or expanded, while those activities that do not are discontinued or restructured. Competitive efforts to recruit students is a common emphasis of enrollment managers.

The numbers of universities and colleges instituting offices of "enrollment management" have increased in recent years. These offices serve to provide direction and coordination of efforts of multiple offices such as admissions, financial aid, registration, and other student services. Often these offices are part of an enrollment management division.

Some of the typical aims of enrollment management include:

* Improving yields at inquiry, application, and enrollment stages. {{ref|citation1}}
* Increasing net revenue, usually by improving the proportion of entering students capable of paying most or all of unsubsidized tuition ("full-pays") {{ref|quirk}}
* Increasing demographic diversity {{ref|citation2}}
* Improving retention rates 
* Increasing applicant pools

According to Matthew Quirk {{ref|quirk3}}:
:More-advanced enrollment managers also tend to focus as much on retaining admitted students as on deciding whom to recruit and accept. They smooth out administrative hassles, guarantee at-risk students the advising and academic help they need, and ensure that the different parts of the university's bureaucracy work together to get students out the door with a degree.

{{Infobox Language game
|nativename     = ''Alfabeto Farfallino''&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;''Afalfafabefetofo fafarfafallifinofo''{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}
|states         = [[Italy]]
|classification = '''Alfabeto Farfallino'''
|hostlanguage   = [[Italian Language|Italian]]
}}

The '''farfallino alphabet''' (in [[italian language|Italian]] '''alfabeto farfallino''') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] used primarily in [[Italy]], which can be regarded as an elementary form of [[substitution cipher]]. It is usually used by [[child]]ren for amusement or to converse in (perceived) privacy from [[adult]]s. The name "farfallino" comes from the word "farfalla" (butterfly), which is an ordinary Italian word but sounds like the "codified" words in farfallino alphabet. The farfallino alphabet is similar to games found in other languages such as [[jeringonza]] ([[spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), [[langue de feu]] ([[french language|French]]), [[Fay Kee Bolee]] ([[Urdu]]) and [[pig latin]] ([[English language|English]]).

==Rules and variations==
The usual rules for farfallino alphabet are based on the substitution of each vowel with a 3 letter sequence where the vowel itself is repeated with an interceding ''f''.
 
* [[:wikt:casa#Italian|casa]] → ca'''fa'''sa'''fa'''
* [[:wikt:lago#Italian|lago]] → la'''fa'''go'''fo'''
* [[:wikt:stella#Italian|stella]] → ste'''fe'''lla'''fa'''
* [[:wikt:re#Italian|re]] → re'''fe'''
* [[:wikt:cercare#Italian|cercare]] → ce'''fe'''rca'''fa'''re'''fe'''

&lt;blockquote style="background: ccccff; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;"&gt; Here is an example:
:''Quefestofo èfe ufun efesefempifiofo difi frafasefe ifin afalfafabefetofo fafarfafallifinofo. Nofon èfe fafacifilefe, afanchefe peferchèfe vafa defettofo ifil pifiùfu vefelofocefe pofossifibifilefe''
Its translation in Italian is:
:Questo è un esempio di frase in alfabeto farfallino. Non è facile, anche perché va detto il più veloce possibile
Which means, in English:
:This is an example of phrase in Farfallino Alphabet. It is not easy, also because you should say it as fast as possible.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are several minor variations to this scheme. One such variation is based on the following substitution rules: 
* a → agasa
* e → eghese
* i → ighisi
* o → ogoso
* u → ugusu

Although rules for ''e'' and ''i'' look different, they are not; the additional ''h'' is needed in Italian to enforce a [[voiced velar plosive]] sound for letter ''g'', which is implicit in the other combinations. Another more complicated scheme, which is used in some regions of Italy, is as follows:
* a → aufer
* e → enghel
* i → ix
* o → older
* u → uflez

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The '''four field approach''' in [[anthropology]] sees the discipline as composed of the four subfields of [[Archaeology]], [[Linguistics]], [[Physical Anthropology]] and [[Cultural anthropology]]. The approach is conventionally understood as having been developed by [[Franz Boas]] who developed the discipline of anthropology in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E. N. (2003), Four-Field Anthropology. Anthropology News, 44: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Beck Kehoe. 1998. Humans:  An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology. Psychology Press, 1998 - Social Science&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 re-assessment of the evidence has indicated that the idea of four-field anthropology has a more complex 19th-century history in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Dan|title=Four Field Anthropology: Charter Myths and Time Warps from St. Louis to Oxford|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2013|volume=54|issue=6|pages=753|jstor=10.1086/673385|doi=10.1086/673385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Boas, the four field approach was motivated by his [[Holism|holistic]] approach to the study of human behavior, which included integrated analytical attention to culture history, material culture, [[anatomy]] and population history, customs and social organization, [[folklore]], grammar and language use. For most of the 20th century, U.S. Anthropology departments housed anthropologists specializing in all of the four branches, but with the increasing professionalization and specialization, elements such as [[linguistics]] and [[archaeology]] came to be regarded largely as separate disciplines. Today, physical anthropologists often collaborate more closely with biology and medicine than with cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Borofsky, R. (2002), The Four Subfields: Anthropologists as Mythmakers. American Anthropologist, 104: 463–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">'''Gender budgeting''' means preparing [[budget]]s or analysis them from a gender perspective. Also referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting, this practice does not entail dividing budgets for women. It aims at dealing with budgetary [[gender inequality]] issues, including gender hierarchies and the discrepancies between women's and men's salaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender budgeting allows governments to promote equality through fiscal policies by taking analyses of a budget's differing impacts on the sexes as well as setting goals or targets for equality and allocating funds to support those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/03/economist-explains-2|title=What is gender budgeting?|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main activities ==
Three principal activities have been recognized as gender budgeting sensitive:
# At the institutional level, the goal is to understand policies promoted by governmental institutions and how these affect gender inequalities within a specific society.
# Analysis of the institutional budget, in order to see whether [[gender mainstreaming]] activities are included.
# Planning as well as implementing a gender-based budget that will focus on gender-related issues.
Point 3 most likely includes the restructuration of the existing budget to deal with gender-related issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gender budget analysis ==
Gender budget analysis aims at finding out whether women and men have can access the same opportunities equally. In gender budget analysis, gaps are addressed so that those who are disadvantaged become empowered. A gender-sensitive budget analysis contains how budgets recognize and answer the needs of men and women, whether they are children, young or adults.&lt;ref&gt;Balmori, H. H. 2003.

''Gender Budgeting: Practical implementation handbook''. Strasbourg, Council of Europe, Directorate General of Human Rights and Legal Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender budget analysis plays a key role in highlighting discrimination against women and how money is distributed between two groups.&lt;ref&gt;Elson, D. 2005.

'''Gorani''' (also '''Gurani''') is an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language]] of the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza-Gorani subroup]] of the [[Western Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian languages]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/zaza-gorani|title=Zaza-Gorani|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=AZGUEQmFqfMC&amp;pg=PA564&amp;lpg=PA564&amp;dq=zaza+gorani+shabak+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rp5HArGnWg&amp;sig=_Qvw1GvO75a5Nb8LOHardxBu-zk&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtyrzi_ZreAhXL2KQKHVtMCIk4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=zaza%20gorani&amp;f=false|title=A Survey of Word Accentual Patterns in the Languages of the World|last=Hulst|first=Harry van der|last2=Goedemans|first2=Rob|last3=Zanten|first3=Ellen van|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110196313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hawrami''' (or Hewrami) is an alternate name of Gorani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hac/21|title=Gurani|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/16/show_language/hac/|title=Ethnologue report for language code: hac|website=www.ethnologue.com|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has similarities with other languages of the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza-Gorani]] subgroup of the Northwestern Iranian languages. Gorani is most similar to languages like [[Zaza language|Zazaki]], [[Shabaki language|Shabaki]], [[Bajelani language|Bajelani]] and [[Sarli language|Sarli]].

Gorani or Hawrami is spoken in the southwestern corner of [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|province of Kurdistan]] and northwestern corner of [[Kermanshah Province|province of Kermanshah]] in Iran, and in parts of  the [[Halabja]] region in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and the [[Hawraman]] mountains between [[Iran]] and Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;"Kurdish language." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 23 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The oldest literary documents in these related languages, or dialects, are written in Gorani.

Many Gorani speakers belong to the religious grouping [[Yarsan]]ism, with a large number of religious documents written in Gorani.

Gorani was once an important literary language in the parts of Western [[Iran]] but has since been replaced by [[Sorani]].&lt;ref&gt;Meri, Josef W. Medieval Islamic Civilization: A–K, index. p 444&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Gorani as a language was slowly replaced by [[Sorani]] in several cities, both in Iran and Iraq. Today, Sorani is the primary language spoken in cities including [[Kirkuk]], [[Meriwan]], and [[Halabja]], which are still considered part of the greater Goran region.

[[Kurd]]s and Gorani speakers themselves tend to consider Gorani as a dialect of [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish group of languages]],&lt;ref&gt;"Kurdish Nationalism and Competing Ethnic Loyalties", Original English version of: "Nationalisme kurde et ethnicités intra-kurdes", Peuples Méditerranéens no. 68–69 (1994), 11-37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kehl-Bodrogi, Krisztina. "Syncretistic religious communities in the Near East: Collected Papers of the International Symposium, Alevism in Turkey and Comparable Syncretistic Religious Communities in the Near East in the Past and Present”, Berlin, 14–17 April 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ozoglu, Hakan. "Kurdish notables and the Ottoman state." Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romano, David. "The Kurdish nationalist movement: opportunity, mobilization, and identity." Cambridge. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which diverged off from Kurmanji speakers, Badhini and Sorani alike, at around 100 BCE.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kurds: A concise Handbook|last=Izady|first=Mehrdad R.|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1992|isbn=|location=London|pages=170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the Zaza–Gorani languages and the Kurdish languages are too many, and are therefore far too great by any standard linguistic criteria to warrant classification as dialects of the same languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Etymology==

The name Goran appears to be of [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] origin. The name may be derived from the old [[Avestan]] word, ''gairi'', which means mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/avdict/avdict.htm#dctg|title=Avestan Dictionary|first=Joseph H.|last=Peterson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Gorani refers to inhabitants of the mountains or highlanders as the suffix ''-i'' means ''from''. The word has been used to describe mountainous regions and the regions' communities in modern [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] literary texts. In this sense Gorani has the same etymological background as the [[Gorani language (Našinski)|Gorani]] language spoken in the [[Balkans]], which derives from a Slavic word 'gora' also meaning mountainous region. 

The name Horami is believed by some scholars to be derived from God's name in Avestan, [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;ref&gt;Nyberg, H.S. (1923), The Pahlavi documents of Avroman, Le Monde Oriental, XVII, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Under the independent rulers of Ardalan (9th–14th / 14th–19th century), with their capital latterly at Sanandaj, Gorani became the vehicle of a considerable corpus of poetry. Gorani was and remains the first language of the scriptures of the Ahl-e Haqq sect, or [[Yarsan]]ism, centered on Gahvara. Prose works, in contrast, are hardly known. The structure of Gorani verse is very simple and monotonous. It consists almost entirely of stanzas of two rhyming half-verses of ten syllables each, with no regard to the quantity of syllables.

An example:
دیمای حمد ذات جهان آفرین

"After praise of the Being who created the world

یا وام پی تعریف شای خاور زمین

I have reached a description of the King of the Land of the East.

Names of forty classical poets writing in Gurani are known, but the details of the lives and dates are unknown for the most part.  Perhaps the earliest writer is Mala Parisha, author of a [[masnavi]] of 500 lines on the [[Shi'ite]] faith who is reported to have lived around 1398–99. Other poets are known from the 17th–19th centuries and include Mahzuni, Shaikh Mostafa Takhti, [[Khana Qubadi]], Yusuf Zaka, and Ahmab Beg Komashi.  One of the last great poets to complete a book of poems (divan) in Gurani is Mala Abd-al Rahm of Tawa-Goz south of [[Halabja]].

There exist also a dozen or more long epic or romantic masnavis, mostly translated by anonymous writers from [[Persian literature]] including: [[Bijan and Manijeh]], Khurshid-i Khawar, [[Khosrow and Shirin]], [[Layla and Majnun]], [[Shirin and Farhad]], Haft Khwan-i [[Rostam]] and Sultan Jumjuma.  Manuscripts of these works are currently preserved in the national libraries of [[Berlin]], [[London]], and [[Paris]].

Some Gorani literary works:
* ''Shirin u Xusrew'' by [[Khana Qubadi]] (lived 1700–1759), published 1975 in Bagdad.
* Diwan des Feqe Qadiri Hemewend, 19th century
* The Quran, translated in the 20th century by Haci Nuri Eli Ilahi (Nuri Eli Shah).

==Hawrami==
{{Main article|Hawrami dialects}}
'''Hawrami''' (&lt;span lang="ckb"&gt;هەورامی&lt;/span&gt;; ''&lt;span lang="kmr"&gt;Hewramî&lt;/span&gt;'') also known as '''Avromani''', '''Awromani '''or '''Owrami''', is one of the main groups of dialects of the '''Gorani language''', and is regarded as the most archaic of the Gorani group.&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Mackenzie [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avromani-the-dialect-of-avroman-q Avromani], Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly spoken in the [[Hawraman]] region, a mountainous region located in western [[Iran]] ([[Iranian Kurdistan]]) and northeastern [[Iraq]] ([[Iraqi Kurdistan]]). The key cities of this region are [[Paveh|Pawe]] in Iran and [[Halabja]] in Iraq.  Hawrami is sometimes called Auramani or Horami by people foreign to the region.

=== Gorans===
{{main article|Guran (Kurdish tribe)|Kurdish people}}
There are also large communities of people of [[Ahl-e Haqq]] in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The town of [[Ilkhichi]] (İlxıçı), which is located 87&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Tabriz]] is almost entirely populated by [[Yâresân]]is. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} But they are ethnically Turks. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in [[Iranian Kurdistan]]. Both the [[Dersim]] ''([[Zazaki]])'' people and the Gorani people, adhere to a form of ''[[Yazdânism|Yazdanism]]. ''These people are called under the various names, such as [[Ali-Ilahis]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]]. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in all parts of [[Kurdistan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Hagarenes''' ({{lang-el|Ἀγαρηνοί}} ''Agarenoi'', {{lang-syc|ܗܓܪܝܐ}} ''Hagráyé'' or {{lang|syc|ܡܗܓܪܝܐ}} ''Mhaggráyé''), is a term widely used by early Syriac, Greek, [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Armenia]]n sources to describe the early [[Arab]] conquerors of Mesopotamia, Syria and Egypt.

The name was used in [[Christian]] literature and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[chronicle]]s for "[[Hanif]]" [[Arab]]s, and later for [[Islamic]] forces as a synonym of the term ''[[Saracens]]''. The Syriac term "Hagraye" can be roughly translated as "the followers or descendants of [[Hagar]]",&lt;ref Name=Hoyland123&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoyland|1997|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other frequent name, "Mhaggraye", is thought to have connections with the Arabic "[[Muhajirun|Muhajir]]",&lt;ref Name=Hoyland180&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoyland|1997|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars assume that the terms may not be of Christian origin.&lt;ref Name=Hoyland180/&gt;  [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] claim in their book ''[[Hagarism|Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'' was introduced by the Muslims themselves who described their military advance into the Levant and Jerusalem in particular as a [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].&lt;ref Name=Hagarism19&gt;{{Harvnb|Crone|Cook|1977|p=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name, used interchangeably with [[Ishmaelites]], came also to mean any [[Muslim]]. An example of its current usage is ''Ahryani'' (Aхряни), a name used for [[Bulgarian Muslims]] in colloquial [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] - although this term has also been explained as paralleling the spread of Balkan Islam with anti-trinitarian [[Arianism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A '''hereditary witch''' is one who is born into a tradition of esoteric origin. These traditions are often not recorded, except maybe in [[grimoire]]s which are also passed down, but rely primarily on oral and physical tradition.

Hereditary Witches are generational in that their skills in magic are passed down from one generation to another.  Most tend to be solitaires with traditional, British, Mexican, Italian, Stegheria, or pecti-witan upbringing. The Hereditary Witch is most common in parts of the world where families live together most of their lives for generations and community services such as education and health services have remained inaccessible over several years such as Africa, the far northern regions of Scotland, remote regions of  Ireland and Wales, island provinces such as Bali, etc.

*In America, Appalachian "granny witches" also pass down their skills and craft to their daughters. So, in this way, many granny witches are also hereditary witches.

In [[anthropology]] and [[archaeology]], '''homology''' is a type of [[analogy]] whereby two human beliefs, practices or [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s are separated by time but share similarities due to [[genetics|genetic]] or [[history|historical]] connections. Specifically in anthropology, a homology is a structure that is shared through descent from a common ancestor.

The concept was explored by the American archaeologist [[William Duncan Strong]] in his [[direct historical approach]] to [[Archaeology#Archaeological_theory|archaeological theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="713">In  [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] spirituality, the '''kra''' is the soul of a person. It is of divine origin; that is to say, one gets their "Kra" from God (Onyame/Nyame).

An Akan conforms to the [[abusua]]/(Mogya (blood)) of his mother, and receives the [[Ntoro]] from his father. These maternal and paternal bonds follow the Akan wherever he/she travels. An Akan's Sunsum is their Spirit/personality which they develop through their interaction with the world.

This page lists '''state and national [[motto]]s''' for the world's nations. The mottos for some [[List of unrecognized countries|states lacking general international recognition]], [[List of extinct states|extinct states]], non sovereign nations, and territories are listed, but their names are not bolded.

A state motto is used to describe the intent or motivation of the state in a short phrase. For example, it can be included on a country's [[flag]], [[coat of arms]], or [[currency]]. Some countries choose not to have a national motto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27803">This is a list of [[nonfiction]] works that have been made into [[feature film]]s. The title of the work is followed by the work's author, the title of the film, and the year of the film. If a film has an alternate title based on geographical distribution, the title listed will be that of the widest distribution area.

The list does not include [[documentary film]]s that are based on real events and people which are not based chiefly on a written work. For other documentary film categories, see [[:Category:Documentaries|documentaries]].

'''Malay folklore'''  refers to a series of knowledge, traditions and taboos that have been passed down through many generations in oral, written and symbolic forms among the indigenous populations of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] ([[Nusantara]]). They include among others, themes and subject matter related to the indigenous knowledge of the [[ethnic Malays]] and related ethnic groups within the region.

The stories within this system of lore often incorporate supernatural entities and magical creatures which form parts of the Malay mythology. Others relate to creation myths and place naming legends that are often inter-twined with historical figures and events. Ancient rituals for healing and traditional medicine as well as complex philosophies regarding health and disease can also be found.

== Oral tradition ==
The oral forms of this lore are transmitted primarily through nursery rhymes, folksongs, theatrical exhibitions, and stories that are commonly told from parent to child. Nomadic storytellers that would roam the temples, marketplaces and palace courts also play a large part in the insemination of the oral traditions throughout the populace, often accompanied by music as well through forms of composed poetry and prose. The oral traditions are often integrated with moral values and some may also include stories of talking animals.

===Folk music (''lagu rakyat'')===
Of all the types of oral transmission, those in the form of music appear to be most pervasive in Malay society. Songs and melodies from times of old are sung and resung on a regular basis during festivities such as weddings, celebrations of motherhood and childbirth, rites of passage and  at cultural or religious celebrations. They are also utilized in the occasional ceremonial functions in royal weddings, in rites of ascension (or [[coronation]]) and royal birthday celebrations; in the form of the more refined court music.

Every region or each of the states may employ different versions of oral transmission but the most popular is in the form of folk-singing or ''lagu rakyat''. The Middle Eastern-influenced ''ghazal'' can be heard in the southern Malaysian state of [[Johor]] especially is the district of [[Muar (district)|Muar]]. Poets and singers consisting of often females and sometimes males vocalize popular love poems and riddles in the form of [[pantun]] to the accompaniment of a composition and  of music made for a six-stringed Arabian lute (see [[oud]]), Indian [[tabla]]s, Western [[violins]], accordion and [[marracas]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of nursery rhymes and lullabies are also sung at weddings and cultural festivals in the state of [[Melaka]] by Malays and the Malay-speaking [[Peranakan]] communities. The contents of the songs are mostly to do with advise on love, life and marriage and are affectionately known in Malay as ''dondang sayang'' meaning "song of love".

Within each of these folk-songs, messages and stories are told, a kind of informal handing down of wisdom from the old to the young in the form of poetry which may include any of these:
* [[Pantun]] - a poem with four stanzas, two of each rhymes with each other
* [[Syair]] - a poem also with four stanzas, with all ends rhyming together
* Seloka - a poem, similar to ''pantun''
* Madah - a kind of rhyming speech, a discourse through poetry
* [[Gurindam]] - poetry, set to music

===Folksongs===
The Malay oral tradition includes a large collection of folksongs. Many of these songs are in the form of stories weaved into poetry or simple rhyme. These folksongs continue to be sung and a sizable number of them are included in the albums of modern-day singers, often with improvisations in terms of melody and more complex musical arrangements to suit a larger accompaniment of musicians as well as singers.

[[File:UlekMayangdance.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A dancer performing the ''Ulek Mayang''. Manifested in a dance and healing ceremony, it narrates a mystical tale about the sea spirits in a forbidden love with a fisherman.]]
Among the more well known Malay folksongs include:
* ''Anak Itek Tok Wi''
* ''Apo Kono Eh Jang''
* ''Bunga Hutan''
* ''Can Mali Can''
* ''Damak''
* ''Di Tanjong Katong''
* ''Ewah Bule''
* ''Ikan Kekek''
* ''Istana Bunian''
* ''Itek Gembo-gembo''
* ''Jong Inai''
* ''Kenek-kenek Udang''
* ''Ketipang Payong''
* ''Lanchang Kuneng''
* ''Londeh Mak Londeh''
* ''Nak Dara Rindu''
* ''Nenek Si Bongkok Tiga''
* ''Suriram''
* ''Sri Mersing''
* ''Tanjong Puteri''
* ''Tudong Periok''
* ''Tumbok Kalang''
* ''[[Ulek mayang]]''
* ''Wau Bulan''

A number of these folksongs originally belong to a certain region within Southeast Asia and are sung by the populations within the area. However, due to the nature of inter-mingling and mutual co-migrations within these areas the folksongs may also be heard in places far from their original geographic origins.

===Bardic tales (''cerita penglipur lara'')===
[[File:Malaysia 250.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A view of [[Tasik Chini]] in [[Pahang]], where a dragon known as [[Naga Seri Gumum]] is believed to dwell.]]
Stories of love and romance of princes and princesses, kings and queens, and heroes and their damsels in distress (and often, damsels and their heroes in distress) have long filled the imaginations of ethnic Malays. The fact that numerous royal courts existed and still exist in Southeast Asia supplied the basis of the stories. Although many of these tales are replete with additions (or reductions) and may contain a certain measure of exaggeration as well as the expected variations that existed from one story teller to another, the value and the wisdom behind each story cannot be ignored.

These stories are often told by professional story tellers called ''penglipur lara'', which roughly translates to ''reliever of sorrows''. The few ''penglipur lara'' that exist today are often farmers or at least rural villagers. In the past, travelling ''penglipur lara'' would carry the stories from one ''[[kampung]]'' (village) to another, making the occasional stops at marketplaces, village squares as well as royal courts. The essence of the stories remain the same but sometimes, adjustments are made according to the individual story-teller's preference. For example, the ''penglipur lara'' version of the [[Ramayana]] changes many of the names and settings and casts [[Laksmana]] as a ''pawang'' or Malay shaman, as opposed to the literary [[Hikayat Seri Rama]] or the theatrical Hikayat Maharaja Wana which remained closer to the original [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]].

Among the well known stories that may fall into this category includes the following:
* ''Anak Buloh Betong''
* ''Batu Belah Batu Bertangkop''
* ''Bayagong''
* ''Lebai Malang''
* ''Mat Jenin''
* ''Naga Tasik Chini''
* ''Nenek Kebayan''
* ''Nujum Pak Belalang''
* ''Pak Kadok''
* ''Pak Pandir''
* ''Puteri Santubong Puteri Sejinjang''
* ''Raja Bersiong''
* ''Sang Kelembai''
* ''Si Bongkok''
* ''Si Luncai''
* ''[[Si Tanggang]]''
* ''Singapura Dilanggar Todak''

Many of these stories are also condensed and made into poetic songs. A fixed melody is set for each story to the extent that if a melody is played or sung in the absence of its wordings, a Malay would be able to instantly recall the title of the story or at least the name of the characters in the story.

===Animal fables (''cerita binatang'')===
Animal fables are often used to explain certain natural phenomena. Other times, they are simple moral tales. In almost all instances, the animals in these stories possess the ability to speak, reason and think like humans, similar to [[Aesop's Fables]].

The ''kancil'' or [[mouse-deer]] serves as the main character in a number of the stories. The Malays regard this humble animal in the highest esteem due to its ability to overcome obstacles and defeat adversaries despite of its rather small and benign appearance. The mouse-deer appears in the state herald of [[Melaka]] and even plays a part in the legend of Malacca's founding.

Below are listed some of the common fables as well as their approximate title translations. (Note that the word ''sang'', an [[Old Malay]] honorific meaning "revered", appears in all instances preceding the name ''kancil'' to indicate respect)
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Buaya'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the crocodile
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Monyet'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the monkey
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Harimau'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the tiger
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Sang Sempoh'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the bison
* ''Kisah Anjing dengan Bayang-bayang'' - The dog and the shadow
* ''Kisah Burung Gagak dan Merak'' - The crow and the peacock
* ''Kisah Burung Gagak yang Haus'' - The thirsty crow
* ''Kisah Labah-labah Emas'' - The golden spider
* ''Kisah Labah-labah dengan Burung Merpati'' - The spider and the pigeon
* ''Kisah Kerengga dengan Pemburu'' - The fire-ant and the hunter
* ''Kisah Burung Murai'' - The mockingbird
* ''Kisah Burung Kakak Tua'' - The cockatoo

===Ghost stories (''cerita hantu'')===
{{Main|Malay ghost myths}}
Malays, as with other Southeast Asians, have always taken great interest in stories of ghosts and spirits. It must be stressed that due to the animistic root of Malay folklore, these ghosts are seen as sharing the plane of existence with humans and are not always considered evil. However, when the delicate line that separates the boundaries of existence is crossed, or a transgression of living spaces occurs, a conflict ensues that may result in disturbances such as [[Spirit possession|possession]]s.

The Malay word for ghost is ''hantu''. However, this word also covers all sorts of demons, goblins and undead creatures and are thought to have real physical bodies, instead of just apparitions or spectres. The most famous of these is the ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]]'' or ''matianak'', the ghost of a female stillborn child which lures men in the form of a beautiful woman.

Below are listed other popular supernatural beings and ghosts as well as their descriptions.
* ''Bajang'': the spirit of a stillborn child in the form of a [[civet]] cat (''musang'').
* ''Bota'': a type of evil spirit, usually a giant
* ''Hantu galah'': a ghost with legs and arms as long and slender as bamboo poles.
* ''Hantu kopek'': a female ghost with large bosoms who lures men who cheat on their wives
* ''Hantu kum-kum'': the ghost of an old woman who sucks the blood of virgin girls to regain her youth.
* ''Hantu lilin'': a wandering spirit that carries a torch or a lit candle at night
* ''Hantu Pemburu'': the Spectral Huntsman whose head is always looking upwards with a shoot growing from his neck
* ''Hantu punjut'': a ghost that takes children who wander into the forest late at night
* ''Hantu tinggi'': lit. "tall ghost", a type of giant that will flee at the sight of a naked body
* ''Jembalang'': a demon or evil spirit that usually brings disease
* ''Lang suir'': the mother of a [[pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]]. Able to take the form of an owl with long talons, and attacks pregnant women out of jealousy
* ''Mambang'': animistic spirits of various natural phenomena
* ''[[Orang minyak]]'': a cursed man covered in oil, who rapes women at night
* ''[[Pelesit]]'': a type of grasshopper that precedes the polong's arrival.
* ''[[Penanggal]]'': a flying head with its disembodied stomach sac dangling below. Sucks the blood of infants.
* ''Penunggu'': tutelary spirits of particular places such as caves, forests and mountains.
* ''[[Pocong]]'': a ghost wrapped in white burial shroud
* ''[[Polong]]'': a spirit resembling a thumb-sized woman.
* ''Puaka'': nature spirit of a place which are typically said to reside in abandoned buildings
* ''[[rakshasa|Raksaksa]]'': humanoid man-eating demons. Often able to change their appearance at will.
* ''Toyol'': the spirit of a stillborn child, appears as a naked baby or toddler

== Written forms ==
{{Main|Malay literature}}
Malay folklore that appear as written traditions are often called ''[[hikayat]]'', ''kisah'' or ''dongeng''. The oldest of them were written in [[Old Malay]] using the prevailing scripts of the time, such as [[Sanskrit]], [[Pallava]] or [[Kawi language|Kawi]]. From around the 14th century onward, they were written in [[Classical Malay]] using [[Jawi script]] which prevailed ever since the arrival of Islam until the colonial era. During this time, the Malay royal courts became the centre for learning where scribes record the genealogy of kings and queens as well as historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics (''hikayat'')===
The ''[[hikayat]]'' or epics are collections of stories and legends of heroism that often involve mythological and historical figures in a setting usually engaging the role of protagonists and antagonists. The [[Hikayat Hang Tuah]] and the story of [[Hang Jebat]] are among the most well known ''hikayat'' which are often told and retold in various forms such children's books, films, theatre plays and musical productions. The choice of who were to be portrayed as the protagonists and who were to be portrayed as the antagonists usually lies with the alignment of the storyteller, although most commonly, bards tend to maintain a stance of neutrality and dispassion in their story telling. In the stories of Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat for example, the lawful Hang Tuah may be portrayed as the hero, while sometimes, the non-lawful Hang Jebat may assume that role.
[[File:AbdullahbinAbdulKadir-HikayatAbdullah-1849.jpg|thumb|A page from the first edition of ''Hikayat Abdullah'' in the [[Jawi script]]. Published in 1849, it is a personal autobiography of [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], a [[Malacca]]-born [[munshi]] of [[Singapore]].]]

Other notable ''hikayat'' include:
* ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' or ''Hikayat Megat Seri Rama''
* ''[[Mahabharata|Hikayat Pandawa Lima]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Patani]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Inderaputera]]''
* ''Hikayat Inderajaya''
* ''[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai]]''
* ''Hikayat Malim Deman''
* ''Hikayat Andaken Penurat''
* ''Hikayat Iskandar''
* ''[[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]'' or ''Hikayat Hamzah''
* ''Hikayat Isma Yatim''
* ''Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah''
* ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Abdullah]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]''
* ''Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati''

===Fairy tales (''kisah dongeng'')===
''Kisah dongeng'' are a loose collection of bedtime stories, fables and myths that involves human or non-human characters, often with superhuman powers along with talking animals, and an unearthly setting.

In this category, the story of ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup'' is well known by the Malays. All three have been made into movies, albeit with differing interpretations and settings.

====Humanoid beings====

Characters with human-likeness abound in these stories. They are collectively referred to as ''orang halus'' meaning the "refined folk" or "soft folk" (often erroneously translated as "elves"). Most are invisible to the average human.

* '''[[Orang Bunian]]''': "hidden people" or "whistling people"; a race of exceptional beauty and grace.
* '''Orang ketot''': humans with short stature, similar to [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]
* '''Orang kenit''': small humans, often possessing magic powers
* '''Gergasi''': giants or ogres
* '''Gedembai''' or '''Kelembai''': an ogre who has the power to turn things to stone.
* '''Duyong''': [[mermaid]]s, having the lower body of a fish and a woman's upper body

====Middle Eastern and Persian additions====

== Symbolic lore ==
Apart from the stories and songs, Malay folklore also includes traditions, rituals and taboos related to the physical as well as the more metaphysical realms of the Malay world view. Such knowledge are usually presented in the forms of symbols and signs inscribed or built into temple walls, palaces, houses and often appear on stone inscriptions as well as grave markers. Natural symbolism are also important such as flowers, trees, animals, the sea as well as celestial objects such as the moon and stars. Malays also have knowledge of a series of constellations that are markedly different from the Indian system upon which it is based. Object symbolism such as wood carvings of animals, ancestral images, mythical beings and masks are also common in Malay society.

Symbolic forms of folklore are usually the domains of the spirits and are therefore sometimes employed by the traditional healers and shamans. The Malays have been known to employ supernatural forces for healing as well as in the aiding of child-birth, the curing of poisons and in the warding off of spirits. Due to the [[Islamic revival|Islamization movement]] of recent decades, these practices are not very well-documented in Malay, but have been recorded in some Western sources.

==Premise==
Set in [[Detroit, Michigan]] the series stars [[Martin Lawrence]] in the role of Martin Payne, a [[disc jockey]] with a girlfriend named Gina Waters ([[Tisha Campbell-Martin]]). Martin works for the fictional radio station WZUP and later for local [[Public-access television]] station Channel 51. A common theme of the series is Martin's selfish and free-spirited nature. Episodes often center on Martin's inappropriate behaviors and incessant smart mouth towards his friends, neighbors, and whoever else finds themselves in his presence. When all is said and done, however, Martin loves his family and friends—it just takes dire situations for him to show it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/03/news/review-television-a-macho-image-for-a-sensitive-soul.html|title=A Macho Image for a Sensitive Soul|website=The New York Times|date=November 3, 1992|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the series progressed, plotlines saw Martin eventually move on to become the host of the talk show ''Word on the Street'', which aired on the small Detroit public-access television station Channel 51. He retained this position until the series' final episode, in which he and Gina prepared to move to [[Los Angeles]], from where his show would be syndicated nationally. The move coincided fortuitously with Gina's promotion by her boss Mr. Whitaker to head up his company's new Los Angeles headquarters, after having shut down the Detroit office. Gina's best friend Pam, whom Whitaker let go two episodes earlier due to this consolidation and downsizing, went on to pursue a career in the music industry as an artists &amp; repertoire ([[A&amp;R]]), executive at Keep It Real Records. (This plotline is the subject of a backdoor pilot episode that was included in the ''Martin'' series for a planned sitcom on Fox starring Tichina Arnold to be called ''Goin' for Mine'' (Episode 129, "Goin' for Mine"). This sitcom never materialized, however.) And at series' end, Cole{{who|date=November 2016}} proposed to his even more dimwitted, but attractive and devoted girlfriend Shanise (portrayed by Maura McDade), and they made plans to move into their own place. The only actor to appear in every episode as the same character is [[Thomas Mikal Ford]] as Tommy.

In early episodes, Lawrence began with a [[monologue]] of him speaking directly to the camera and audience from the darkened radio studio.

In 1997, Tisha Campbell filed a lawsuit against her co-star Martin Lawrence and the show's producers for [[sexual harassment]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[Physical abuse|physical assaults]], and she did not appear in most of the season five episodes. The explanation in most of the episodes Campbell did not appear in was that Gina was "out on business", though in the two-part episode "Going Overboard" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/15/arts/tv-notes.html|title=TV Notes|website=The New York Times|date=January 15, 1997|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBO Studios eventually settled the case with Campbell so that the show's last season could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/martin-campbell-reconcile-1117342288/|title='Martin,' Campbell reconcile|date=March 21, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell did return to the Martin set to film the two-part series finale of the show under the condition that she would not share any scenes with or interact in any way with Martin Lawrence.  In the episode, Martin and Gina kept entering and exiting the sets at different times and the storyline was adjusted so that the characters were both part of it but never crossed paths.

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===
* '''Martin Payne''' ([[Martin Lawrence]]) Martin, the [[title role|title character]], is a caring family man deep down, but on the outside a very macho, selfish smart alec. Martin carries himself in a typical [[urban culture|urban]] youth manner, with modern expressions and mannerisms. His girlfriend turned wife, Gina Waters, has sometimes tried to change him (much to his anger, seeing as he likes the way he acts), but this rarely worked. Martin is not much of a physical fighter despite trying to come off as such. He has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Gina's best friend Pam.
* '''Regina "Gina" Waters-Payne''' ([[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]]) (Seasons 1–4 (&lt;small&gt;main&lt;/small&gt;); 5 &lt;small&gt;recurring&lt;/small&gt;), Martin's professional, fun-loving, eternally romantic and forgiving girlfriend and later wife. She often acts as a peacemaker, admonishing others when they trade barbs and insults and breaking up fights. Gina works for a public-relations firm. She complements Martin's street savvy by serving as a voice of reason. She is Pam's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-07/entertainment/ca-16050_1_fox-series|title='Martin's' Wife Leaves Fox Series|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/martin-campbell-reconcile-1117342288/|title='Martin,' Campbell reconcile|date=March 21, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thomas "Tommy" Strawn''' ([[Thomas Mikal Ford]]), one of Martin's best friends. Level-headed, intelligent, and charming, Tommy serves as another voice of reason, especially during Martin's schemes. He would often portray himself as a ladies' man and would flirt with Pam and other women on the show. He had a romantic relationship with Pam during the third and fourth seasons. His mysterious employment status was a running gag on the show. Of all the male characters, he is the only one to have attended college. He is the only character to appear physically in every episode.
* '''Cole Brown''' ([[Carl Anthony Payne II]]), Martin's other best friend. Dimwitted but well-meaning and known for his eclectic taste in headgear, Cole proudly cleans jets at the airport for a living, drives an [[AMC Pacer]], and lives with his mother Maddie until early Season Five. For a time in Season 3, Cole appeared to be attracted strictly to plus-sized women and dated a security guard named Big Shirley (who is fully seen in only one episode; another episode only showed "her" below the neck to portray her as being much taller and bigger than Cole). In the final season, after Cole meets Shanise and moves into his own apartment in a rough neighborhood, he dates Shanise, who appears to be even more dimwitted than he is. During the series finale, he becomes engaged to Shanise.
* '''Pamela "Pam" James''' ([[Tichina Arnold]]), Gina's sassy and ill-tempered co-worker, best friend and Tommy's girlfriend. Before eventually dating Tommy, Pam was always looking for a good man. Pam worked at the PR firm where she was employed as Gina's assistant. Pam has a very adversarial relationship with Martin. When he insults her, she responds typically via belittling that brings attention to Martin's short stature. Pam has a beautiful singing voice that she displays throughout the show.

=== Supporting characters ===
* '''Bruh-Man (Brother Man)''' ([[Reginald Ballard]]) &lt;small&gt;(1993–1997)&lt;/small&gt;: Martin's neighbor, who debuts in season two. He lives on the fifth "flo" (yet he always puts 4 fingers up when relating this fact), directly upstairs from Martin. Whenever Martin asks what he is doing, Bruh-Man replies, "Nuttin'…just chillin'." He often climbs down the "f-a-a-a-ah 'scape" (fire escape), to enter Martin's apartment, taking food, borrowing assorted items, and generally lounging around as if he lives there. At first, this greatly annoyed Martin but he eventually got used to it. In fact, fire escapes seem to be his only means of movement throughout buildings—he is seldom seen entering or exiting the apartment through the front door. When he attended Martin and Gina's engagement party at Gina's apartment, he went as far as climbing the building since there was no fire escape. Bruh-Man always wears badly fitting clothing a size or two too small (frequently, items he's "borrowed" from Martin), and has a characteristic gait consisting of a slow and lazy, rather limping, plodding walk, with his head cocked to one side. Martin, as Bruh-Man was heading toward the window to make his exit, once referred to it as his "slow bop". Bruh-Man speaks in a deep voice and with a long drawl, like that of [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Despite being a popular character, Bruh-Man was quietly phased out of the series after season three. His last appearances were in the fourth season, and he explains his absence by stating that he only comes around when Martin and Gina are away out of respect for their marriage. This is proven true as he is absent throughout the fifth and final season of the series, however he is mentioned once albeit briefly. In episode 13, "Ain't That About a Ditch", when Gina's mother locks Martin out of his apartment, he pauses to think, then whispers "Bruh-Man" to himself as he walks off to climb in through the fire escape, then Martin shows up in his apartment.
* '''Hustle Man''' ([[Tracy Morgan]]) &lt;small&gt;(1994–1996)&lt;/small&gt;: The neighborhood purveyor of questionable products and services "at a discount rate! I don't do dat for erra'body! I'm just tryna help ''YOU'' out!" He always greets Martin with his trademark "What's happenin', chief?" In one episode, one of Hustle Man's more outrageous items for sale was an 'appetizing' array of roasted pigeons impaled on a tree branch (as if barbecued on it), which he attempted to sell to Martin and his friends while they were snowed in and starving. In another episode he served as Martin's cut-rate "wedding planner", armed with a shopping cart brimming with plastic flowers, chitlin loaf, and a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor—Martin's retaliation for Gina's choice of a more elegant and ridiculously overpriced wedding planner.
* '''Stan Winters''' ([[Garrett Morris]]) &lt;small&gt;(1992–1994; 1995; 1997; guest role)&lt;/small&gt;, Martin and Shawn's boss, the owner and founder of radio station WZUP. He perpetually used too much cologne and wore woefully outdated clothing from the 1970s. Martin knew Stan to be cheap and quite untrustworthy, and just when Martin didn't think Stan could sink any lower with his schemes, Stan was always able to surprise him. Furthermore, Garrett Morris' real-life shooting resulted in his unexpected absence in the episode and a major change in the storyline, regarding Martin's career. Therefore, Stan was absent in the episode "The Hoedown in Motown" when he gets into trouble with the IRS due to a debt of $20,000 in unpaid taxes, precipitating his sale of the radio station, but returned in the season 2 finale "Martin's on the Move" where Stan recovers from the hospital and reunites with Martin for one last goodbye until he left town and subsequent flight to parts unknown. He returned for one episode in Season 3 to form a partnership with Martin, and together they opened a restaurant—Marty Mart's Meatloaf and Waffles. Needless to say, their joint venture was a failure. After this episode, Stan was never seen or mentioned again, however he returns as a guest appearance in the two-part series finale episode [[California, Here We Come]] where Martin reunited with him as he and the gang gave Martin a farewell roast at Nipsey's.
* '''Shawn McDermott''' ([[Jon Gries|Jonathan Gries]]) &lt;small&gt;(1992–1994; 1997; guest role)&lt;/small&gt;, the white, scatterbrained radio station engineer at WZUP. Martin always finds himself having rather strange conversations with him. Shawn often does things that upset their boss Stan, and once even tried to secure a record deal from [[Snoop Dogg]] when he was at an engagement party for Martin &amp; Gina. Shawn was later fired, along with Martin, when Stan sold the radio station. It is revealed in a later episode that Shawn was retained by the new station as an engineer. Shawn's final appearance on the show was in the Season 2 season finale episode where he says farewell to Martin. That particular episode showed a more serious side of Shawn as he gives Martin some advice on life that actually made sense. After this episode, Shawn is never seen or mentioned again, with the exception of the Season 4 clip show "The Best of Martin" in which he appears via archive footage, however he returns for one final guest appearance in the two-part series finale [[California, Here We Come]] where Martin reunites with him and the gang as he prepared Martin for a final roast at Nipsey's.
* '''Ms. Geri''' (Jeri Gray): She was a tough, trigger-happy senior who, regardless of her age and diminutive size, has no qualms about "whoopin' ass". Most of her assaults are committed on Martin in everyday situations, such as standing in line at the DMV or at the unemployment office. On one occasion, her opponent was Dragonfly Jones (Lawrence), whom she soundly defeated as well, taking his money for good measure.
* '''Shanise McGullicuddy''' (Maura McDade) &lt;small&gt;(1996–1997)&lt;/small&gt; is Cole's girlfriend (and later fiancée), during the fifth and final season. Shanise is a very friendly woman. She always has a positive attitude. However, she is even more dimwitted than Cole. She and Cole briefly break up in one episode but this occurs because when she told Cole she needed more space, he assumed she meant she wanted to break up but she actually wanted a bigger apartment. She is also thoughtful and willing to help others. In the episode ''Over the Hoochie's Nest'', she assists Martin, Tommy and Cole in rescuing Pam from an insane asylum. In the [[California, Here We Come|series finale]], Cole wanted to ask Shanise to marry him. He had a hard time asking her due to him losing the ring. Shanise was even taken to get X-rayed in order for Cole to find the ring after he stuck it in cupcake. Finally, they become engaged when she is tricked into reading a letter that says "Will you marry me?" and Cole says yes to her. At the end of the episode, she is last seen helping the Paynes move out of their apartment as well as saying farewell to them. The character started minor but developed a grounded position in the group after [[Tisha Campbell]] briefly left the show.
* '''Nipsey''' (Sean Lampkin): The rotund, good-natured bartender who owns Nipsey's Lounge, the group's favorite hangout.
* '''Varnell Hill''' (Tommy Davidson): The more successful talk show host and frenemy of Martin's that is constantly showing off and throwing his flashy lifestyle in Martin's face. Varnell is known to be a ladies man and gets worldwide recognition to Martin's dismay. He appears on the radio show that Martin hosts at WZUP.

=== Recurring characters ===
* '''Nadine Waters''' ([[Judyann Elder]]): Gina's doting and somewhat over-protective mother, who comes on as sophisticated, sweet and mild-mannered on the surface, but has shown a dark side on occasion—such as once getting immediately turned on by a brief scene from a porn video, and generally becoming quite flustered whenever conversation or situations turned to sexual subjects.
* '''Dr. Cliff Waters''' ([[J.A. Preston]]): Gina's overbearing and overprotective father who works as a chiropractor. Instantly disliked Martin because he didn't feel he was good enough for his daughter. During the wedding rehearsal dinner, he threatens to start "capping" people, instantly inciting a major fight with members of the Payne family.
* '''Lil' Dawg''' (Adrian Tibbs): A tall, lanky barber at Jim's Barber Shop whose unorthodox personal style is the subject of much ribbing in the workplace—he keeps his head nearly shaved, but grows a long mane of hair in back, and wears Coke-bottle-thick glasses. He is often seen at Nipsey's trolling for women (successfully!), and despite his looks and demeanor always seems to come out on top whenever he and Martin have a disagreement.
* '''Buckwhite''' (Ray Massara): A very easygoing, tall white boy with a huge dark-coloured Afro, Buckwhite has been seen hanging out at Jim's Barber Shop, at Martin's apartment for various sporting events on TV, and at Nipsey's Lounge. He speaks Ebonics in an unaffected "normal" white manner. (Massara is actually a property master and special-effects assistant in the film and television industry; at the time of his appearances on ''Martin'', he was that production's property master.)
* '''Bro Fo' Real (Brother For Real)''' ([[Charlie Murphy]]): A faithful audience member of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program, and quite possibly Martin's number one fan. Bro Fo' Real attends every of Martin's taping for his show and encouraged Martin to be himself during one of the show's taping ([[List of Martin episodes#Season 3: 1994–1995|Season 3, Episode 14]]).
* '''Angry Man''' (David Jean Thomas): A fellow audience member of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program, and often can be found in other locations such as the DMV. He is prone to stand up and shout "''Man.... SIT-CHO ASS DOWN!!''" when a guest (or anyone else, for that matter) says something he disagrees with.
* '''Mr. and Mrs. Booker''' ([[Jeris Lee Poindexter]] and [[Ellia English]]): A married couple and audience members of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program. The Bookers are constantly arguing. Mr. Booker appears to be somewhat goofy and dimwitted, while Mrs. Booker is loud and aggressive. Their most prominent appearance is in the Season 4 episode "Kicked to the Curb", where they assist Martin and Gina in getting their apartment back, by scaring off the new tenants after Mrs. Booker pretends to be a scorned wife looking to fight the woman who was "creeping with her husband".
* '''Maddie Brown''' (Laura Hayes): Cole's gossiping, no-nonsense mother who still supports him. She's known for talking about other people and spreading their business around. For example, Martin being broke and having Gina support him.
* '''Evelyn Porter''' ([[LaWanda Page]]): A senior resident who lives in Martin's apartment building who is also friends with Mama Payne and Cole's mother, Maddie.
* '''The Reverend Leon Lonnie Love''' ([[David Alan Grier]]): A local fire-and-brimstone preacher whose brand of religion doesn't seem to frown upon avarice, lying, cheating, stealing, and philandering—even with his own cousin Pam.
* '''Marian''' (Roxanne Reese): A seemingly well-heeled, middle-aged neighborhood alcoholic who often appears at parties, nightclubs, and gatherings, such as the audience on Martin's show ''Word on the Street'' and The Ladies League of Detroit. However, in one episode, she reveals that she is not drunk, that she is instead on medication.
* '''Kenji''' (Kenneth Whack): Dragonfly's student. 
* '''Laquita''' ([[Simbi Khali]]): The nail stylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon and Sheneneh's even-more vocal best friend.
* '''Keylolo''' ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]): A hairstylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon. She is also Sheneneh's sidekick.
* '''Bonquisha''' ([[Kim Coles]]): Another one of Sheneneh's friends who always has bad breath. Bonquisha routinely claims that Keylolo is the one that has bad breath stating that was "eatin chitlins".
* '''Sonny''' ([[Reno Wilson]]): Martin's shoplifting cousin who dresses and acts like [[Eddie Murphy]].
* '''Luis''' ([[Luis Antonio Ramos]]): The superintendent of the apartment building where Martin lives. In one episode, he marries Pam to avoid deportation.
* '''Titus''' ([[Bentley Kyle Evans]]): A handsome well-dressed guy who is Gina's hairdresser, and seems to be attracted to Martin—affectionately calling him "Almond". (Evans was the executive producer of ''Martin''; he made several cameo and voice-only appearances throughout the series, including one of the callers on WZUP, a guest at one of Gina's parties, and the only guy who appeared at an all-male fashion show that Pam and Tommy sponsored.)
* '''Myra''' (BeBe Drake-Massey): Stan's girlfriend; they once double-dated with Martin and Gina (while Martin was on the outs with Cole, Pam and Tommy). She was a customer of Sheneneh's hair salon, and went bald after Gina treated her hair. While working for the unemployment office, she got several jobs for Martin – then nearly gave up on him since he kept quitting each job he received.
* '''Gloria Rodriguez''' (Angelina Estrada): Station director and Martin's supervisor at television station Channel 51.
* '''Bernice''' (Kymberly Newberry): A producer at Channel 51 who is always at odds with Martin. (Kymberly Newberry also briefly played an entirely different part of a shoe-saleswoman in episode 8 of season 2 "You've Got a Friend".)

=== Other roles played by Lawrence ===
One of the trademark running gags of ''Martin'', especially early in its run, was Lawrence playing multiple characters, utilizing various costumes and prosthetic appliances. This was often done as a plot device or comic relief. Season four was the last season to feature Lawrence as multiple characters on a regular basis. This technique was rarely used in Season 5, which was the final season of the series. The only characters that appeared in Season 5 were Sheneneh, Roscoe and Elroy. Mama Payne does not appear but her voice is heard in the holiday episode "Scrooge". Most of the other characters were last seen in Season 4 and the episodes they last appeared in seemingly wrote them out of the series.
* '''Sheneneh Jenkins''': Played by Martin, she is an exaggerated parody of a stereotypical "ghetto girl": she always has on flashy clothes/fashion accessories and [[Artificial hair integrations|hair weaves]]; nature has endowed her with a disproportionately oversized [[steatopygia|ghetto booty]]; and she speaks in [[African American Vernacular English]]. Sheneneh is the owner/operator of ''Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon''. Mama Payne and Sheneneh were the only two characters Lawrence played as women on the show, and both characters hated Gina. Full of quirks, Sheneneh is tall and thick in build and often describes herself as a "''la-a-a-dy''{{-"}}. Some of her other locutions are "''Oh mah goodnehhh!''{{-"}} and "''Aw-iight?''{{-"}} at every other word, and "Oh, no you didn't." Sheneneh's portrayed as being a very feisty, belligerent, touchy antagonistic, confrontational and disparaging diva, known for her ghetto fabulous scoldings. She lives in the apartment across the hallway from Martin's and factors into many of the plots by picking fights with Gina and especially Pam out in the hallway. Sheneneh has several girlfriends who occasionally appeared in the program, those being Keylolo ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]), Bonquisha ([[Kim Coles]]), and Laquita ([[Simbi Khali]]). Of all the secondary characters played by Lawrence, Sheneneh is the only one to make an appearance in the final episode, though only her voice was heard. The [[nae nae]] dance, created in 2013, was inspired by the way Sheneneh danced in ''Martin'', and was named after the character.
* '''Edna (Mama) Payne''': Martin's extremely frenetic, and easily excited mother, who is extremely over-protective of Martin, and who dislikes Gina immensely. Comically, Lawrence's mustache was never covered with stage make-up while in this role. Mama's mustache was occasionally the subject of a sharp retort by Gina when she and Martin argued. She has a brother named Junior (portrayed by [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]). Mama does not appear in the fifth and final season, but her voice is heard in the Christmas episode "Scrooge". She has the same catchphrase as her son Martin, ''"Damn! Damn! Daaaaamn!"''
* '''Ol' Otis''': A very abrasive, strict, stuttering and potbellied old man, who is always seen in uniform while on his job as a security guard. His catchphrase is repeatedly referring to males as "bwah" [boy] and females as "guh" [girl]. Otis is usually seen melodramatically and hyperactively attempting to keep order whether there's trouble or not. Because of his immense gut, advanced age, and oafish appearance, Otis is often taken for a weak old man who just ''acts'' tough. Because of this, he's often challenged to physical fights following his abrasive behavior. Otis is always more than willing to oblige others in engaging in combat. Surprisingly through his buffoonish-styled wrestling, unexpected strength from Otis always catches his "antagonists" off guard, invariably making him the victor in the end. Otis's pet peeve is misconduct in the "younger generations". When all is said and done, he physically defeats all his much younger challengers with ease. In his final episode on the show, he moves to an undisclosed island. Otis does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Jerome''': A loudmouthed, aging, somehow well-funded, once-flashy but now-faded Detroit pimp. He runs an illicit casino, sports a family-heirloom gold tooth ("gold toof-es") in his mouth, was once voted Detroit's "Player of the Year", and has his sights set on Pam, as when he occasionally calls her "Junk in the Trunk". He often speaks in rhyming sentences. Usually Jerome appears on the scene with his signature spiel, "Oooh, oooh, oo-oo-ooh, I say Jerome's in the house, I say Jerome's in the ah-um-ah-um...watch yo' mouth!" Jerome's final appearance on the show is in the episode "Uptown Friday Night" (which parodies ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]''), in which his final line is "And that's the eeeend!" Jerome does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Roscoe''': An antagonistic child with a perpetually runny nose and a very smart mouth, who can be considered Gina's arch-enemy (similar to Martin and Pam's rivalry). Lawrence played the role by standing on his knees, with shoes attached to his kneecaps. Roscoe only appears once during the first, fifth and final season.
* '''Dragonfly Jones''': A martial arts "expert" who is beaten up in nearly every appearance. He always seems to owe money to a real martial artist named Kenji, who is actually a student of Dragonfly. Kenji who would often beat up Dragonfly whenever he refuses to pay him some small sum he is owed. Dragonfly does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Bob''': A white man who works in an unknown capacity at the marketing firm where Gina is employed, Bob is best described as a stereotypical surfer-dude-cum-redneck. He speaks in a Southern Californian accent mixed with a Southern twang, and often uses words like "dude" and "man", even in professional settings. Lawrence achieved a white appearance with stage make-up and a prosthetic nose appliance to make him appear Caucasian, as well as wearing a long, blond [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] wig to complete the look. Bob only appears in 2 episodes, once in the first season and again in the second season.
* '''Elroy Preston''': The fictional "Godfather of Black Surf Music" who is now completely forgotten and washed up. Preston works as an auto mechanic, and is best known for randomly breaking into song while performing his mechanical duties. He often distracts himself and irritates others when reminiscing on things that involve his trademark song, which consists only of Preston singing "Don't you know no good!" over and over. He makes one appearance in the fifth and final season.
* '''King Beef''': Cole's favorite 1970s [[blaxploitation]] movie actor, who is actually Lawrence in a huge bodysuit. Whenever trouble arises, he feels the overwhelming need to dance. It does not matter if he is on the run from Godzilla—he always finds time for dancing, and always with his scantily clad female co-stars flanking him. He is only seen during the first season.

== Possible revival ==
In January 2018, rumors have circulated that the popular series was possibly slated for a reboot due to a post that Martin Lawrence's fiance teased on Instagram, which made viral headlines to a popular blog [[The Shade Room]]. She posted a picture of the Martin TV show [[Intertitle|title card]] logo with the caption: ''"Got word from my fiance that my favorite TV show may be coming back"'' ending the comment with the peeking wide eyes emoji and Martin replied to the post with the same emoji, which can insinuate a common nod towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeZE8mFFmZ7/|title=Instagram post by The Shade Room • Jan 26, 2018 at 12:02am UTC|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HipHollywood'', another internet entertainment media blog, questioned Tisha Campbell-Martin on the rumor during an interview, in which she gave a ecstatic response that she can't speak upon it stating ''"It has been an honor to be Gina all these years and its surprising that people still love those characters so much. So, i can't tell you guys anything, but it is very excitng"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=HipHollywood|title=Exclusive: Tisha Campbell-Martin Confirms 'Martin' Reboot!|date=2018-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwilqeYaftw|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding insult to injury, a few days later during an [[E! News]] Daily Pop interview, she was caught off guard by the host who asked her about it, and instead of answering it, she jokingly denied it and brushed it off by changing the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=E! News|title=Tisha Campbell-Martin Teases "Martin" Reboot {{!}} Daily Pop {{!}} E! News|date=2018-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlrw66eh-BY|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her responses caused an immediate interest from all media outlets to believing that she confirmed a possible reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dish Nation|title='MARTIN' REBOOT MAY BE IN THE WORKS|date=2018-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqoTjVPp91E|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early February, [[TMZ on TV|TMZ]] caught up with Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell-Martin and Martin Lawrence altogether leaving Morton's Steakhouse in Burbank, California, all smiles and anticipating the same question. Martin replied by saying ''"Never Say Never"'', Tichina added by stating ''"In life there's always new beginnings, and there's always change...so we'll see what's happening".'' Tisha ended it bluntly and jokingly by blurting out  ''"We can't tell y'all shit, how 'bout that"'', The interview continues to go more in depth about questioning the shows popularity from the past and how a reboot can be made up to date with current events and hold its' popularity if it's greenlighted. Tichina and Tisha's responses kind of hinted and gave it away that it may happen, but realizes the questions already pushed them to reveal their answer, in which Tisha ends it with the same blunt quote she stated earlier in the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/02/01/martin-cast-reunites-steaks-talks-reboot-never-say-never/|title='Martin' Cast Reunites, Plays it Coy About TV Reboot|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview is also the first time Tisha and Martin is seen publicly together since their past cast debacle, which was part of the reason for the show's cancellation in 1997.

'''Movement in learning''' or movement-based instruction is a [[teaching method]] based on the concept that humans learn better through [[:wikt:movement|movement]]. This teaching method can be applied to students, who should have the opportunity throughout a class period to move around to take "brain breaks" to refocus their attention so they can learn new material. Brain research suggests that physical activity prior to class (in PE for example) and during class, increases students' ability to process and retain new material. This is a new and controversial development in education, and, to date, has little research and empirical data to support this trend.  However, anecdotal evidence regarding the benefits of incorporating movement in the classroom is promising. 

== Benefits ==
Physical movement stimulates long-term memory and recall  because it has been associated in the human brain with survival and this is supported by [[Neuroimaging|brain imaging]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How the Brain Influences Behavior: Strategies for Managing K 12 Classrooms|last=Sousa|first=David|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781632206848|location=Delaware|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by findings such as the studies that show exercise shapes muscles along with the strengthening of some areas of the brain, growing brain cells and increases alertness in the process. It is said that the harder the task is for students, the greater the [[Cerebellum|cerebellar]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivry|first=Richard|date=1997|title=Cerebral Timing Systems|url=|journal=International Review of Neurobiology|volume=41|pages=555-573|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, short movement breaks for the brain is said to lead to more opportunities for information processing and increased [[Memory|memory formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brain-Compatible Science|last=Mangan|first=Margaret|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781632209658|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contributes to the overall [[cognitive development]] of the students because it sends [[oxygen]], water, and [[glucose]] to the brain, helping it grow and improve mood and motivation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refocus and Recharge! 50 Brain Breaks for Middle Schoolers|last=Responsive Classroom|first=|publisher=Center for Responsive Schools, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=9781892989871|location=Turner Falls, MA|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the area of the brain that processes movement is also the part that processes cognitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth to Big School|last=Kearns|first=Karen|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=9780170369343|location=Sydney|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between movement and the cognitive development has been proven as early as the 1960s during [[Richard Held]] and Alan Hein's experiments that revealed the role of physical activity on the development of brain networks that are important for adaptive mental function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Children's Cognition With Physical Activity Games|last=Tomporowski|first=Phillip|last2=McCullick|first2=Bryan|last3=Pesce|first3=Catherine|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2015|isbn=9781450441421|location=Champaign, IL|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students through brain breaks to engage in physical activities can facilitate physical development. In combination with the socialization, which also contributes to the learners' [[Socioemotional adaptation theory|socio-emotional]] development - movements offer a quick and convenient way to support the rapid development, especially among young learners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be demonstrated in the efficacy of using physical tasks to address the needs of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|hyperactive]] students because they release stress and energy, allowing them to focus on their studies without causing disruption in the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Win-Win Classroom: A Fresh and Positive Look at Classroom Management|last=Bluestein|first=Jane|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2008|isbn=9781412958998|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movements also eliminate [[lethargy]] that results from sitting for long periods of time. There are recorded cases, for instance, that show marked improvement in school performance for learners who were made to do physical tasks such as [[walking]] in mid-afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Minds of Boys: Saving Our Sons From Falling Behind in School and Life|last=Gurian|first=Michael|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2005|isbn=9780787977610|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Applications in the classroom==
Ideally students should be getting physical activity before they try to learn new material.  However, if it is not possible for students to have physical activity before a lecture, there are many ways to get students out of their seats and moving during a class period. Students can get out of their seats to turn an assignment in or to pick up a handout. You could have students stand up to share their answers to questions posed by the teacher. After they have shared their answers with each other they may sit down. If students are acting tired and drowsy a teacher could give students a quick break to stand up and stretch. Once they get out of their seats and move around for a bit they will act more alert. Students that struggle to stay focused or are seen as disruptive can benefit greatly from movement in the classroom.

Younger students can benefit from a variety of activities that get them moving and also reinforce what they are learning. Brain based learning supports the use of movement in learning. According to the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, a core principal of brain-based learning states, "Learning engages the whole body. All learning is mind-body: movement, foods, attention cycles, and chemicals modulate learning." Another core principal states, "Complex learning is enhanced by challenge and inhibited by stress. Another state,"Enrichment: The brain can grow new connections at any age. Challenging, complex experiences with appropriate feedback are best. Cognitive skills develop better with music and motor skills. (Dï Arcangelo)" The U.S. National Institute of Health as well as the Mayo Clinic list exercise and movement as a way to decrease stress levels. Elementary aged children can only absorb 15 to 20 minutes worth of material at a time. Taking brain breaks is a win-win situation. Students can learn during these brain breaks plus return to a task renewed and energized.

===Additional benefits for special-needs learners===
Many special-needs learners are stuck in counterproductive mental states, and movement is a quick way to change them, movements, such as those involved in playing active games, will activate the brain across a wide variety of areas. A study by Reynolds and colleagues (2003) found that children with dyslexia were helped by a movement program. Those in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in dexterity, reading, verbal fluency, and semantic fluency than did the control group. The exercising group also made substantial gains on national standardized tests of reading, writing, and comprehension in comparison with students in the previous year.

'''''Oh, God! You Devil''''' is a 1984 American [[comedy film]] starring [[George Burns]], [[Ted Wass]], [[Ron Silver]] and [[Roxanne Hart]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Oh God You Devil (1984) MOVIES: BURNS IN 'OH GOD! YOU DEVIL'|first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|date=November 9, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Paul Bogart]] and produced by Robert M. Sherman.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The [[screenplay]] is by [[Andrew Bergman]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; ''Oh, God! You Devil'' is the third and final installment in the ''Oh, God!'' [[film series]] following ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' (1977) and ''[[Oh, God! Book II]]'' (1980), based on the [[novel]] of the same title by [[Avery Corman]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

George Burns received a [[Saturn Award]] [[nomination]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his performance.

==Plot==
Burns plays the [[dual role]]s of both [[God]] and the [[Devil|devil]]. The devil—Harry O. Tophet—(Tophet is a Hebrew word for "Hell") is a lively character, taking pleasure in petty acts of PG-rated malice, such as making a waiter fall into a pool.

The movie tells the story of a struggling [[rock music|rock]] musician/songwriter, Bobby Shelton (played by Wass), who cannot get a break. Bobby, desperate to support his wife, Wendy ([[Roxanne Hart]]), and start a family, muses that he would [[deal with the Devil|sell his soul to the devil]] to get ahead. The devil begins to appear to Bobby as a prospective agent called Harry O. Tophet and offers Shelton a deal—seven years of unprecedented fame and fortune. Shelton balks at the deal and so Tophet renegotiates claiming that it will be for a "trial period," urging Bobby to leave his earnest agent Charlie ([[Eugene Roche]]). Shelton signs the document, but his signature transforms into that of established rock star Billy Wayne ([[Robert Desiderio]]), the last person to whom Tophet offered this deal, and soon after Bobby realizes he has sold his soul to the devil.

Shelton discovers that, though he now has the big success he wanted after a mammoth concert tour, he has lost his identity—he is now Billy Wayne. As such, his family is now someone else's--the former Billy Wayne, whose life Tophet now controls and who has assumed Bobby's identity. He also discovers that his wife is pregnant with his child. Realizing that he is trapped, Bobby asks for help from God, who has been watching over him, finally succeeding when, as Billy Wayne, he travels to Las Vegas for important shows. God appears after Bobby has "the Lord" paged in a hotel lobby and offers to help.

During a climactic [[poker]] game between God and the devil over Bobby's soul, God raises the stakes while Bobby as Billy attempts suicide. God claims he will stop protecting all those on "his list" in exchange for Bobby's soul (meanwhile, Bobby, under Tophet's machinations, is about to kill himself). If God wins, the devil would be prevented from meddling with any of those on the list, even if they beg for his assistance. Considering the loss too high, Tophet folds, and finds that God had been bluffing and that part of the reason he had intervened for Bobby was because the devil had become too arrogant and cocky.

Bobby rises from the floor of the dressing room and slips away as staffers discover the corpse of Billy Wayne, who had committed suicide. In the end, God meets with Bobby and tells him about how his father once prayed for him when he was a sick child, and that since then, God has kept his eye on him. After warning Bobby that next time he will not bail him out, Shelton returns to happiness in a simple life with his loving wife and daughter. Years later, his daughter becomes ill and Bobby says the same prayer that his father did. The movie ends with Bobby, God, and the spirit of Bobby's father singing to his daughter the same song Bobby's father used to sing to him, "Fugue for Tinhorns" from the musical ''Guys and Dolls''.

==Production==
After the success of ''Oh God!'' Warner Bros. approached other writers for sequels. They commissioned Josh Greenfield to write one and Andrew Bergman another. Bergman rewrote a play he had on his shelf about a songwriter who sells his soul to the devil. "Not a good play, but it was there sitting on my shelf," he says. "For me it was just an attempt to salvage something that I thought was a cute idea and was going nowhere. Also, I wanted to work with George Burns. This to me was linking up with a previous era of comedy... George was just the most fantastic person. He's so smart. Every single thing he said was funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2015/01/09/andrew-bergman-on-writing-blazing-saddles-striptease-honeymoon-in-vegas-and-more/|website=Entertainment Weekly|title=Andrew Bergman on writing 'Blazing Saddles,' 'Striptease,' 'Honeymoon in Vegas' and more|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2654">The '''Olavarria Municipal Orchestra''' is an Argentinian orchestra based in [[Olavarria]]. Founded in 1961, it is based in the Municipal Theatre of Olavarria [[Teatro Municipal de Olavarria]], and is considered one of the most prestigious orchestras in its nation. The orchestra current Music Director is [[Diego Lurbe]].

==History==

Since its creation in 1961 the Municipal Orchestra Stable, current Municipal Symphony Orchestra, he has performed extensively in Olavarria and a wide area in the center of the Province of Buenos Aires; in addition to several presentations in major cities like Buenos Aires by National Radio and Television Channel 7; in Mar del Plata on channel 8 and the Teatro Solis in Montevideo, concerts giving hierarchy and renown to the orchestra.

It stresses that the Olavarría Symphonic Orchestra was one of the first Argentine orchestras that performed since 1961 a comprehensive and continuous cycle of educational concerts at elementary schools, bringing to the children the knowledge of the fundamental cultural values universal music. From the date of its creation performed more than 500 concerts.

After a hiatus of seven years of inactivity, the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of its owner, the master Mario Patané, resumed his cultural work in 1993, with the support of the municipal authorities and the community of Olavarria, who promoted the recreation of this orchestra, which is regarded as a cultural heritage of the city and one in the center of the Province of Buenos Aires.

During the 1994 season featured 24 successful Symphony concerts, prominent among them the one offered in the Golden Hall of the Municipality of La Plata. In addition to the success achieved in public recitals for the Evening Classical Concert Series 1994 seasons, 95, 96 and 97 is proof the need for our community to have an organization of this type.

During the 1997 season the Symphonic Orchestra of Olavarria offered with signal success with critics and audiences, symphony concerts in the cities of Bolivar, Henderson, Daireaux and the Golden Hall of the Municipality of La Plata (second year).

Orchestra depends on the Department of Culture and Education of the Municipality of Olavarria.

'''''Pet Sematary''''' (sometimes referred to as '''''Stephen King's Pet Sematary''''') is a 1989 American [[horror film]] [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Stephen King]]'s [[Pet Sematary|1983 novel of the same name]]. Directed by [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]] and written by King, the film features [[Dale Midkiff]] as Louis Creed, [[Denise Crosby]] as Rachel Creed, [[Blaze Berdahl]] as Ellie Creed, [[Miko Hughes]] as Gage Creed, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Jud Crandall. [[Andrew Hubatsek]] was cast for Zelda's role. King, who scripted from his own book, also has a cameo as a minister.

A [[sequel]], ''[[Pet Sematary Two]]'', was met with less financial and critical success. An upcoming [[Pet Sematary (2019 film)|second film adaptation of the same name]] is scheduled for release in 2019.

==Plot==
The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from [[Chicago]] to rural [[Ludlow, Maine]], after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the [[University of Maine]]. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated [[pet cemetery]] (misspelled "sematary") in the forest behind the Creeds' new home.

On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. After he dies, Pascow comes to Louis in the night and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is "sour". Louis awakens assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt.

During [[Thanksgiving]] while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway in front of the house. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an abandoned [[Mi'kmaq|Micmac]] burial ground. Without explanation Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day Church comes back to life, though a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground as a boy, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet.

Sometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

He tells him the story of a local named Bill Baterman who buried his son Timmy in the Micmac ground after he was killed in [[World War II]]. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying the townsfolk. A group of men including Jud tried destroying Timmy by lighting the Baterman house on fire, only for the deranged Bill to perish with his son. Jud insists that the burial ground is evil and Louis must never try to bury his son there.

After the funeral, Rachel and Ellie leave for Chicago while Louis remains home. Despite Pascow and Jud's warnings, Louis exhumes his son's body and buries him at the ritual site. In Chicago, Pascow appears to Ellie in a dream and warns her that Louis is about to do something terrible. Rachel is unnerved by her daughter's dream, but is only able to reach Jud when she calls, who tells her Louis is not home. She decides to return to Maine, much to Jud's alarm.

That night, Gage returns home and steals a [[scalpel]] from his father's bag. He taunts Jud before slashing his [[Achilles tendon]] and throat, killing him. Rachel returns home and is lured into Jud's house by the voice and specter of her dead sister Zelda, only to discover that she is actually seeing Gage, holding a scalpel. In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her.

Waking up from his sleep, Louis notices Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers that his scalpel is missing. Receiving a phone call from Gage that he has "played" with Jud and Mommy, he fills three syringes with [[morphine]] and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection before entering the house. Gage taunts him further and Louis is startled by Rachel's corpse falling hanged from the attic before he is attacked by his son.

After a brief battle, Louis kills Gage with the morphine injection. He then lights the house on fire, leaving it to burn as he carries Rachel's body from the fire. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to "make it worse" but Louis, now grief-stricken to the point of insanity, believes that because Rachel was not dead as long as Gage was, burying her "will work this time". Pascow cries out in frustration and vanishes as Louis passes through him.

That night, the horribly mutilated Rachel returns to Louis and the couple embrace. Rachel takes a large knife from the counter; Louis screams as the screen cuts to black.

Initially, Paramount executives wanted a pair of twins to play the role of Gage, like those chosen to play Ellie, which was the more cost-effective option. However, Lambert was very impressed with three-year old Miko Hughes, whom she felt was a natural talent despite his young age, so she lobbied the studio to accept her choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBP1JzE1TsI |title=Mary Lambert Interview (screamography) |

''Pet Sematary'' was director Mary Lambert's second feature film. She was better known for her work directing music videos, especially those for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] including "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]" and "[[Material Girl]]". Through her work in the music industry Lambert was friends with the [[Ramones]], who were one of Stephen King's favorite bands. She approached them about recording a song for the film and they agreed to write and perform "[[Pet Sematary (song)|Pet Sematary]]", which is featured in the closing credits.&lt;ref name="youtube panel"/&gt;

The original cut of the film delivered to Paramount's executives was judged to be too long, so excess footage had to be removed. They also decided that the closing scene was too tame and at their request it was re-shot to be more graphic.&lt;ref name="youtube panel"/&gt;

==Music==

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 50% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating was 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Pet Sematary'' is a bruising horror flick that wears its quirks on its sleeves, to the detriment of its scare factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pet_sematary/ |title=Pet Sematary (1989) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pet-sematary |title=Pet Sematary (1989) Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "undead schlock dulled by a slasher-film mentality".&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1988/film/reviews/pet-sematary-1200427883/|title=Review: 'Pet Sematary'|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|year=1989|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film "has some effectively ghoulish moments" but "fails mostly because it doesn't trust the audience to do any of the work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE0D71E39F931A15757C0A96F948260|title=Pet Sematary (1989)|last=Canby|first=Vincent|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-04-22|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Lambert goes for strong, succinct images and never stops to worry whether there's a lack of credibility or motivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-24/entertainment/ca-1722_1_pet-sematary-pet-cemetery-blaze-berdahl|title=Movie Reviews : A Chilling Vision in 'Pet Sematary'|last=Thomas|first=Kevin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1989-04-24|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Harrington of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "bland, clichéd, cheap".&lt;ref name=twp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/petsemataryrharrington_a0aab5.htm|title='Pet Sematary' (R)|last=Harrington|first=Richard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1989-04-22|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrington criticized Gage's actions as disturbing and the climax as "an ugly payoff to an inept setup".&lt;ref name=twp/&gt; [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 4.5/5 stars and wrote, "The plot alone would make for a scary movie, but by injecting excellent atmosphere, capable acting and generally nightmarish scenes, ''Pet Sematary'' is a truly effective horror flick and well worth the price of admission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/108355/pet-sematary-2/|title=Pet Sematary|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2004-10-22|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Dread Central]], Steve Barton rated it 4/5 stars and called it one of the best King adaptations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4365/pet-sematary-special-collector-s-edition-dvd/|title=Pet Sematary: Special Collector’s Edition (DVD)|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2006-09-13|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Jenkins rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it "one of the better King adaptations of the period".&lt;ref name=dread/&gt;

==Legacy==
A sequel, ''[[Pet Sematary Two]]'', was released in 1992 to poor reviews and a disappointing box office. Although it references the events of the first film, the sequel focused on all-new characters. ''Pet Sematary'' has acquired a [[cult following]] in recent years, and members of the cast occasionally appear at horror conventions to discuss it.  

In 2002, New York horrorcore rapper [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]] wrote the song "Ballad of Worms" which was featured on the album ''[[Eastern Conference All Stars II]]'' for the independent hip-hop label [[Eastern Conference Records]]. Before thought to be about his relationship and struggle with the hip-hop community, he later revealed it was a love song dedicated to the ''Pet Sematary'' character Zelda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Cage-ballad-of-worms-lyrics|title=Cage - Ballad of Worms Lyric Genius|date=1 January 2012|website=genius.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A documentary, ''Unearthed &amp; Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary'', premiered in September 2014, and was released in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/66898/unearthed-untold-the-path-to-pet-sematary-set-to-premiere-with-the-original-film/|title=Unearthed &amp; Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary Set to Premiere with the Original Film|last=Condit|first=Jon|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2014-09-07|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Pet Sematary'' was ranked #16 on [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]]'s list of the best Stephen King film and television adaptations, and also placed at 16 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Top 30 King adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/2015/08/the-definitive-ranking-of-stephen-king-movies | title=A Definitive Ranking of Nearly Every Stephen King Movie and TV Show | publisher=ifc.com | date=2015-08-10 | access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/top-30-stephen-king-movies-ranked-w493317/pet-sematary-1989-w495391 |title=Top 30 Stephen King Movies, Ranked | publisher=Rollingstone.com | date=2017-08-02 | access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been intermittent buzz about a possible adaptation of ''Pet Sematary'', but as of 2017 none has been commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/02/pet-sematary-stephen-king-remake.html|title='Pet Sematary' looks to rise again|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2011-02-02|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] was announced as directing the adaptation in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/juan-carlos-fresnadillo-pet-sematary-paramount-1200782223/|title=‘Pet Sematary’ Back From the Dead With Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Kroll|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2013-10-31|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2017, the brother-sister team behind the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', [[Andrés Muschietti|Andrés]] and [[Barbara Muschietti]], told the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' that they hoped to adapt ''Pet Sematary'' after the sequel of ''It''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.torontosun.com/2017/08/04/stephen-kings-pennywise-is-back-secrets-from-the-set-of-it | title=Stephen King's Pennywise is back: Secrets from the set of 'It'| author=Mark Daniell | publisher=Toronto Sun | date=2017-08-04 | access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remake==

'''Phryne Fisher''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|aɪ|n|i}} {{respell|FRY|nee}}), often called "Miss Fisher", is the main character in Australian author [[Kerry Greenwood]]'s series of Phryne Fisher detective novels. Phryne is a wealthy aristocrat and private detective who lives in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda, Melbourne]], in the late 1920s. With the assistance of her maid Dot, and Bert and Cec (who are [[Stevedore|wharfies]], [[Taxicab|taxi]] drivers and "red raggers" (Australian slang of that period meaning [[Communism|communists]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ozwords.org/?p=6127|title=Words from the First World War Australian Home Front {{!}} Ozwords|website=ozwords.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phrynefisher.com/glossary.html|title=What did she say? A glossary of slang from Phryne Fisher's world|website=phrynefisher.com|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, she solves all manner of crimes. As a crime fiction character, she has been called a "quintessentially Australian" construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.australiancrimefiction.com/phyrne-fisher|title = Phryne Fisher: Feminism and Modernism in Historical Crime Fiction|last = Johnson-Woods|first = Toni|date = 2015|journal = The Australian Journal of Crime Fiction|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 January 2016|last2 = Franks|first2 = Rachel|volume = 1|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phryne is no ordinary aristocrat, as she can fly a plane, drives her own car (a [[Hispano-Suiza]]) and sometimes wears trousers. However, while displaying [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] panache, she manages also to maintain style and class.&lt;ref name="booksite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrynefisher.com |title=Official website |website=Phyrne Fisher |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phryne was accidentally named after a [[Phryne|famous Greek courtesan]] who lived in the 4th century BC. At her christening, her father forgot the classical name, [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], that her parents had intended for her.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Phryne is described in the first of [[Kerry Greenwood]]'s books, [[Cocaine Blues (novel)|''Cocaine Blues'']], as being named after the courtesan Phryne, after her father forgot her chosen name of Psyche at the christening.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

Phryne was not always rich, having been born into a poor family in [[Collingwood, Melbourne]]. Her childhood was one of deep poverty, and she occasionally had to scavenge for food in the pig-bins in Victoria Market; she often ate rabbit and cabbage because there was no other food available.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; In ''Cocaine Blues'', she tells her maidservant and secretary Dot that during her youth she "starved like [[wikt:billy-oh|Billy-o]]" and that her sister died of diphtheria and starvation.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

In [[World War I]], the other male heirs to a [[British peerage]] were killed, and Phryne's father inherited the title. In the book Blood and Circuses her father is described as an earl, but in the TV series her father is a [[baron]]. As his daughter, she was granted the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of "[[The Honourable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|The Honourable]] Phryne Fisher" and an enormous fortune. She has an aunt, Mrs. Prudence Stanley. She is also described as having sisters and a brother, it is not clear how many sisters she has but her younger sister died of diphtheria.

After completing school, Phryne ran away to France where she joined a French women's ambulance unit during WWI, receiving a reward for bravery and a French war pension. She then worked as an artist's model in [[Montparnasse]] after the war.&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PAdHCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Flying+Too+High&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnwOSliq_UAhUE0GMKHQHpBisQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Flying%20Too%20High&amp;f=false |title=Flying Too High |last=Greenwood |first=Kerry |date=1990 |publisher=McPhee Gribble |isbn=978-0869142158 |location=Australia |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her time in France, Phryne travelled widely, and has disclosed that she has, amongst other places, visited Florence and spent a night in a Turkish prison (for unknown reasons).&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"/&gt;

=== Move to Australia and career as a detective ===
Phryne Fisher's career as a detective is described in ''Cocaine Blues'' as having had its origins in an incident that took place at her family's estate in [[England]]. At an evening ball, a diamond necklace belonging to one of the guests disappeared, and Phryne was able, through observing the guests and the room, to quickly identify the person responsible for the theft as Bobby, a young cricket-playing aristocrat.

Impressed by her skills, another guest at the party, a retired Colonel Harper and his wife, Mrs. Harper, engaged Phryne to travel to Australia, her country of birth, and find out if his daughter, Lydia Andrews, was being treated well by her husband, John Andrews.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drxcCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cocaine+Blues&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSvf_jh6_UAhUG4mMKHZ06BKsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cocaine%20Blues&amp;f=false |title=Cocaine Blues |last=Greenwood |first=Kerry |date=1989 |publisher= McPhee Gribble |isbn=978-0869141724 |edition=First Paperback |location=Australia |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set in motion the events described in the first of Kerry Greenwood's books on Phryne Fisher, ''Cocaine Blues''. Phryne's motivation to take up private detection as a career is rooted, at least initially, in boredom with the activities of high society in England. Although she did previously engage in charitable works, Phryne noted that "the company of the Charitable Ladies was not good for her temper."&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

In ''[[Flying Too High]]'', Phryne Fisher decides to settle down in Melbourne, buying a house at 221B, The Esplanade, and moving in there with Dot Williams, her maid. She also engages Mr. and Mrs. Butler to act as her butler and housekeeper, respectively. Phryne confesses to her friend Bunji Ross that she bought the house because it was numbered 221 and that she added 'B' in an obvious reference to the home of [[Sherlock Holmes]] at [[221B Baker Street]].&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"/&gt;

Through the course of the books, Phryne collects a personal maid, Dot; two adoptive daughters, Ruth and Jane (whom she rescued from slavery); a cat, Ember; a dog, Molly; and two loyal servants, the Butlers. She also has relationships with a string of lovers, most notably Lin Chung, a wealthy Chinese man (whom she rescues in the city one evening). Lin is the only lover with whom she maintains a relationship for more than a few books and even goes so far as to make a deal with his autocratic and overbearing grandmother that after he is married, she (Phryne) be allowed to continue a relationship with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Away with the Fairies |date=1 April 2001 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=978-1865084893 |location=Australia |page=233 |author=Greenwood, Kerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character and appearance ==

=== Appearance ===
Phryne is described in ''Cocaine Blues'' as having a 'short black cap of hair' which is very straight, and cut to leave the nape of her neck and most of her forehead uncovered. She has grey-green eyes. In ''[[Flying Too High]]'', she is described by an acquaintance as being 'small, thin, with black hair cut in what I am told is a bob, disconcerting grey-green eyes and porcelain skin. Looks like a Dutch doll." – a description that Phryne herself agrees with.&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"/&gt;

=== Character and skills ===
Phryne can shoot, and frequently carries, and uses, a lady's handgun in her purse. She is frequently described as being possessed of great courage and fearlessness, and personally admits to having very few actual fears (one of them being head-lice, which she abhors).&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; She rarely cries, noting in ''Cocaine Blues'' that the last time she had done so was over a book of poetry by [[Wilfred Owen]], after being sickened by the deaths in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

Phryne is a skilled and experienced pilot, and in ''[[Flying Too High]]'', performs a number of dangerous and skilful flying maneouvres in a [[De Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moth]] plane in response to a flying instructor's doubts about her skills.&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"/&gt; She has also flown Dr. Elizabeth Macmillan, her friend and a surgeon, through dangerous conditions to provide medical assistance to those who needed it.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; In addition to planes, Phryne is a skilled, if somewhat reckless driver, and drives a red [[Hispano-Suiza]], one of her prized possessions.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

She is fond of dancing and has learned to dance the tango from 'the most expensive gigolo on the Rue de Chat-qui-Peche' in Paris.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; She speaks French fluently, with a Parisian accent and peppered with 'indelicate apache idioms'.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

Phryne is described as being fond of the luxuries her position and wealth afford her, while always being conscious of her impoverished origins. She tells the Princess de Grasse in ''Cocaine Blues'' that "there is nothing like being really poor to make you relish being really wealthy."&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; She often carries cash on her person, reasoning that she is unused enough to wealth to want the security of having readily available funds.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; She is generous with her money, and tips well.

Phryne is frequently described as dressing in high fashion and her clothes are often described in great and elaborate detail. She occasionally dresses in trousers and men's shirts. Phryne also enjoys good food. She is 'devoted' to lobster mayonnaise with cucumbers, in particular.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; Despite her numerous relationships and conduct that some parts of society might find shocking, Phryne describes herself as being immune to blackmail, showing no alarm, for instance, when Bobby Matthews, a thief she had once caught, threatens to tell all of Melbourne that she had once visited an expensive gigolo in Paris.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

=== Relationships ===
Although Phryne has had several relationships with men, she is described as being disinclined to settle down and marry. She is described in her books as using a diaphragm sold by Dr. [[Marie Stopes]] to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She is described as being heterosexual, and often politely rebuffs advances from women who are attracted to her.

In ''Cocaine Blues'', for instance she is the subject of the attentions of both Sasha De Lisse and his twin sister Ellie, but tells Sasha that she would prefer him over her, in general. She also declines an unstated offer from a woman attending to her at the Turkish Baths in Melbourne, and notes that she had visited several bars frequented by lesbian and bisexual women in the company of her friend and gigolo, Georges Santin, in Paris.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; Phryne notes that she "had little leaning towards homosexuality but she had liked the lesbian bars. They were free of the domination of men, creating their own society."&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

=== Family ===
Phryne's relationship with her family can occasionally be strained. In ''Cocaine Blues'', after a theft of jewelry belonging to a guest at a dinner party hosted by the Fishers, Phryne's father and mother engage in a vocal altercation, a situation that Phryne describes as 'normal'.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; On her arrival in Melbourne, she is initially embarrassed to discover that her father had left a number of unpaid debts of honour there, including one to the local MP, Mr. Sanderson.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

Phryne once describes herself as having 'not the faintest spurt of maternity' and demonstrates a disinclination towards young children.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

==Main and recurring characters ==

=== Dorothy 'Dot' Williams ===
Dorothy Williams, known as 'Dot' is Phryne's confidential [[maid]] and social secretary. Phryne meets Dot soon after her arrival in Melbourne, while taking a walk through the city. Dot, possessed of a knife, had been trying to find and kill her former employer's son, who had repeatedly harassed and molested her and had her fired when she resisted his advances. Phryne convinces Dot to hand over the knife and gives her food to eat, and then secures Dot's revenge by using the knife to surreptitiously cut through her persecutor's braces, thus disrobing and publicly embarrassing him. Phryne then offers Dot a job as her personal maid and secretary, which Dot accepts.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; Dot is described as being a very devout Catholic and is very neat with a particular talent for delicate mending and sewing work. She is close to her family and her mother, in particularly, whom she visits frequently.

=== Bert (Albert Johnson) and Cec (Cecil Yates) ===
Cecil Yates, known as 'Cec' and Albert Johnson, known as 'Bert' together run and operate a taxi cab in Melbourne, Australia.

Cec is described as being tall and blonde-haired, with brown eyes and a taciturn, quiet manner. Bert, on the other hand, is short, darker and older than Cec, as well as more voluble. Cec and Bert are both described as 'red-raggers' i.e. Communists.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; Cec, in particular, is a gifted navigator with a keen memory for the streets of Melbourne, and is also described as having a soft spot for any animal or person in trouble. Cec and Bert eventually join Phryne as investigative assistants. Phryne Fisher pays them enough money to enable them to buy a new taxi to replace their old one.&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"/&gt;

Phryne's adopted daughters.

=== Hugh Collins ===
One of Jack's policemen and Dot's husband-to-be.

=== Mr Tobias Butler and Mrs Aurelia Butler ===

In Flying Too High, they are known by the names 'Ted' and 'Else'&lt;ref name="Book – Flying Too High"/&gt;

=== Dr. Elizabeth Macmillan ===
Dr. Elizabeth Macmillan is a Scottish surgeon who works at the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women in Melbourne, Australia. She is a friend of Phryne's. Dr. Macmillan and Phryne reunited during Phryne's voyage by ship from England to Australia in ''Cocaine Blues''. Dr. Macmillan is described as being of around forty-five years of age, with a broad, strong physique, rough and calloused hands, and a weatherbeaten complexion.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; Her black hair, now turning white, is cut into a 'short Eton crop' and she tends to dress in men's clothes for convenience.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt; Phryne and Dr. Macmillan first meet when there is a 'flu epidemic at a remote island, and Phyrne steps in to fly Dr. Macmillan in on a plane despite dangerous weather conditions. She then assists Dr. Macmillan in attending to the unwell residents of the island, including slaughtering a Highland cow to make them broth.&lt;ref name="Book – Cocaine Blues" /&gt;

=== Jillian Henderson ===

He respects her skills and intelligence, and the two frequently collaborate on criminal investigations.

==Feature Film==

A stand-alone action-adventure feature film, ''[[Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears]]'' will pick up the story from the end of the third series. It began production in October of 2018. The film is budgeted at $8 million and will be directed by [[Tony Tilse]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frater|first1=Patrick|title=Hit Australian TV Series ‘Miss Fisher’ set for Movie Adaptation|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/australian-tv-miss-fisher-set-for-movie-adaptation-1202817568/|accessdate=21 May 2018|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, there has been speculation on the possibility that the television series would be made into a feature film. In May 2016, Essie Davis acknowledged interest in playing Miss Fisher in a film. "[We’re] just working out the ideas of how to make it bigger and better and more fabulous than the TV show," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spring |first=Alexandra |date=9 May 2016  |title=The thousand faces of Essie Davis: 'People don’t realise I’m the same person' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/09/the-thousand-faces-of-essie-davis-people-dont-realise-im-the-same-person |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, it was revealed that plans were afoot to produce a trilogy of Phryne Fisher films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bowden |first=Ebony |date=17 November 2016 |title=ABC's Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries set to become an action movie trilogy |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/drama/abcs-miss-fishers-murder-mysteries-set-to-become-an-action-movie-trilogy-20161116-gsr3sa.html |newspaper=Sidney Morning Herald |location=Sidney |access-date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1518">The '''pointinini''' (pointed shoe) is a type of shoe popular in [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

==Description==
[[Image:Abou nidal libre.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Abou Nidal]] with a pointinini'']]
They are shoes whose characteristic is that the front part pointed and is slightly bent, available in all the colors and various materials (leather, deer, synthetic fibre).

==Tendency==

This fashion strongly developed in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and was quickly exported with [[Coupé-Décalé]] and the concept of the "farot" incarnated by [[JetSet]]. Ivorian singer [[Abou Nidal]] sings about it in "La chaussure qui parle" (The shoe which speaks).

The pointinini is a key component of the "Afrodesign" or modern "Afrostyle". The pointinini is a true phenomenon of style in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200807230968.html Cameroun: La mode est à la "Pointinini"] [[28 juillet]] 2008 dans ''Allafrica''&lt;/ref&gt;
The pointinini was not invented by Abou Nidal but finds its origins in the centre of Africa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, via the science of  ''sapeology'' (which originates from the word ''sape'' i.e. Societe Admirer des Persons Elegant).

'''''Prototype''''' (stylized as '''''[PROTOTYPE]''''') is an [[open world]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Radical Entertainment]] and published by [[Activision]]. The game was released in North America on June 9, 2009 ([[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]), in southwestern parts of North America ([[Microsoft Windows]]) as well as Oceania on June 10, and in Europe on June 12. Versions for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] were released on July 14, 2015 alongside the sequel as ''Prototype Biohazard Bundle''. Separate versions of the games became available in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=July 14, 2015|title=Surprise! Prototype game bundle released for Xbox One today|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-14-surprise-prototype-game-bundle-released-for-xbox-one-today|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in [[Manhattan]], the game follows a powerful amnesiac [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Alex Mercer who must stop an outbreak of Blacklight, a plague that mutates individuals into hideous violent monsters. During his quest, Alex tries to uncover his past while also coming into conflict with both the US military and a black operations force called Blackwatch. Parallel to the game's storyline is the ability to play the game as a [[Sandbox game#Sandbox mode|sandbox]]-style video game giving the player freedom to roam Manhattan.

The game was a critical and commercial success, with critics praising the game for its originality and engaging gameplay. Many reviewers compared and contrasted it with ''[[Infamous (video game)|Infamous]]'', another open world action-adventure game released one month prior to ''Prototype''. A sequel, ''[[Prototype 2]]'', was released in April 2012.

==Gameplay==
Alex's primary superpower is his ability to shapeshift, changing his body into anyone. Going hand-in-hand with this power is his ability to "consume" others, absorbing them entirely. This process allows Alex to quickly regain health by absorbing the biomass of his enemies. This also allows him to take on the forms of the human enemies he absorbs, thereby allowing the player to move about the enemy as one of them. The disguise will only last as long as Alex remains inconspicuous. Alex has incredible physical strength, and will kill most humans in a single punch. He can perform various [[melee]] attacks without shapeshifting, as well as more gymnastic moves such as air combos, sliding along the ground using any humanoid enemy's body, and a high-speed rolling cannonball attack.

Alex can also transform parts of his body into a selection of martial implements acquired over the course of the game, either as purchased upgrades or being given them. Offensive powers include the large and powerful Blade arm, fast razor-sharp Claws (which can also erupt large spikes from the ground), the telescoping Whipfist, Musclemass that augments his strength, and the slow but powerful Hammerfists. Defensive options consist of a large shield on Alex's left arm for blocking ballistic attacks that needs to regenerate after excessive damage, and full body armor that exchanges agility and speed for toughness in hand-to-hand combat; both will allow Alex to plow through most obstacles when active. Vision modes include [[thermography|thermal]] vision, which allows Alex to see enemies through smoke and other obstacles at the expense of a decreased vision range, and Infected vision, which highlights those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus as well as military units. Both vision modes muffle all of Alex's other senses, such as hearing, in order to concentrate on his sight. One defensive and offensive power may be active at a time, and using either will negate Alex's current disguise. In addition to his own abilities, Alex can take the weapons from defeated or absorbed enemies. These include automatic rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and missile launchers. He can also seize control of military vehicles, such as tanks and helicopters.

Alex's most powerful attacks are the Devastators, which require Alex to be in Critical Mass- either a state of near-death or the exact opposite, having excess stored biomass and increased health. These include the Tendril Barrage, which fires impaling tendrils from his body in all directions, the Groundspike Graveyard, which erupts massive spikes from the ground all around Alex, and the Critical Pain, which fires a single beam of hardened biomass from his hands to severely damage a single target.

For movement around the city, Alex uses his increased physical abilities. When sprinting, he will automatically hop over cars, barriers and other obstacles without losing momentum. Alex will also scale any wall he comes into contact with and simply knock aside any humanoids that get in his way without stopping. He can jump great heights and distances, enough to clear five-story buildings, and can sprint at extreme speed indefinitely. Falls cause no damage to the player even from the greatest heights. Even small jumps are enough for Alex to dent the ground beneath him, and falls from sufficient heights will create shockwaves at the point of impact which will kill most humans nearby and send objects as large as cars flying. Falling height also factors into several of Alex's melee attacks.

Enemies in the game are the Infected: those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus, and the Military. The Infected consist of ordinary civilians infected with the virus that are generally not a threat to Alex. However, the Hunters, huge creatures created from Infected water towers, are one of the main enemies in the game. Evolved Hunters referred to as Leaders are one of the most powerful creatures in the game and are incredibly hard for Alex to kill. The Military consist of ordinary soldiers which are usually not a threat to Alex, although they are capable of operating weaponry that is extremely dangerous to Alex, such as tanks and heavily armed helicopters. The Military also consists of BLACKWATCH, an agency dedicated to combating biological and nuclear warfare. BLACKWATCH is one of the intricate parts of the game's story and create some of the most deadly biological weaponry to combat Alex, including viral detectors capable of detecting Alex even in his disguise, and, introduced later in the game, the deadly poison Bloodtox, capable of slowly killing Alex and the Infected. Introduced later in the game are heavily armored and durable soldiers referred to as Super Soldiers, capable of fighting against Alex and some of the strongest Infected.

In order to gain more advanced upgrades, Alex is capable of sneaking into Military Bases using a disguise and stealthily consume various officials within the base. He can also set off an alert within the base, in which the only way to escape is to slaughter whoever is in the base. Alex can also gain upgrades from the Infected by collecting genetic data. Infected Hives, like Military Bases, are located all over the city, and produce genetic data constantly. Alex can destroy the Infected Hives or simply absorb the data on the outside as it is being produced. At the start of the game, only small factions of the Infected and Military are present in the city. However, as the game progresses, the Military and the Infected begin to expand. Territory in the city is made out of three distinct zones. Blue Zones are in Military control and are relatively clean of the Infection. Red Zones thrive with the Infection, although there still remains a strong Military presence. In some areas of the city, a Blue Zone and a Red Zone might converge, creating a new and distinct Purple Zone. In these Zones, the Military and the Infected are in a constant battle for control. How the player decides to act in these Zones determine which faction seizes the territory.

The game takes place in a medium-sized version of Manhattan with all its famous landmarks, including the [[Empire State Building]], the [[Chrysler Building]], the [[Trump Building]], the [[One Chase Manhattan Plaza]], the [[Conde Nast Building]], the [[Metlife Building]], the [[One New York Plaza]], and the [[New York Life Building]], among others.

==Plot==
The game follows Alexander J. "Alex" Mercer (voiced by [[Barry Pepper]]) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a [[genetic engineering]] company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful [[shapeshifting]] abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses, endurance, weaponry and the ability to "consume" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth. During his quest, Alex faces two factions: the [[United States Marine Corps]] and Blackwatch, a [[Fort Detrick]] [[special forces]] unit dedicated to combating [[biological warfare]]; and the Infected, monsters created by a virus known as BLACKLIGHT that is overrunning Manhattan. Captain Robert Cross (voiced by [[Jeffrey Pierce]]), a Blackwatch officer, is given orders to find and contain Alex.

Alex makes contact with his sister, Dana (voiced by [[Lake Bell]]), who assists him in tracking down targets, leading to the infiltration of Gentek headquarters. He finds a young woman called Elizabeth Greene contained in the building. Greene is a host for BLACKLIGHT, and upon her escape unleashes it upon Manhattan. Dana directs Alex to Karen Parker, his ex-girlfriend. She agrees to aid him in stopping the virus, while requiring Alex to bring back samples of the virus. Karen later leads Alex into a trap, where he is confronted by Cross. During their battle, Alex almost defeats Cross, when Cross mentions 'Penn Station', triggering a flashback that leaves Alex dazed. Alex is injected with a parasite that threatens to kill him. Alex seeks help from Dr. Ragland, a [[Pathology|pathologist]] linked to Gentek. Ragland helps Alex remove the parasite and turn it into a weapon against Greene. However, it has no effect on Greene as her body rejected the parasite immediately, and the rejected biomass forms a monstrous being, the Supreme Hunter, which Alex kills. Alex later finds and kills Karen in revenge for setting him up.

The origins of the virus and Elizabeth Greene are uncovered through a contact: in 1969 the government tested the virus' predecessor in [[Hope, Idaho]], designed to target predetermined [[Race (biology)|races]]. Although the entire town was infected, no ill effects manifested until Elizabeth Greene's infection. An [[Congenital disorder#Primarily structural|anomaly]] in her body's biology accepted the virus, rewriting her genetic code and causing her to take control of the infected town, becoming hostile in the process. The entire population of Hope, Idaho was liquidated by Blackwatch with only Greene and her son, codenamed PARIAH, surviving. Although kept separate, the two were held in captivity for further research. With samples taken from Greene's blood, Gentek's team led by Mercer synthesized the current strain of BLACKLIGHT virus.

Alex discovers his own past: Blackwatch shut down the Gentek project due to [[News leak|leaks]] and ordered all project personnel eliminated. Alex Mercer took a sample of BLACKLIGHT as "insurance". Eventually pinned down by Blackwatch in [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]]. Alex, in a final act of desperation and vengeance, shatters the vial containing the BLACKLIGHT, releasing the virus before being gunned down. The virus entered Mercer's bloodstream through the bullet holes and repaired his body at the cellular level.

The contact and Alex pump a new "BLOODTOX" [[biological agent]] underground in order to drive the virus above ground where it can be fought directly, causing Greene to emerge, encased in a towering monstrosity. Greene falls from the monster in human form once she is defeated, and is consumed by Alex. Through her memories, it becomes apparent that General Randall, head of Blackwatch, is prepared to destroy Manhattan with a nuclear weapon. Alex, with the help of the contact - revealed to be Cross - infiltrates the [[USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)|USS Ronald Reagan]] to stop Randall. Once Alex consumes Randall, Cross is revealed to be the Supreme Hunter, who assumed Cross' identity after consuming him, and attacks Alex, asserting that when Blackwatch leaves NYZ (New York Zero, the name given to the city after the outbreak) they will no longer be searching for infected, and that after he consumes Alex, he will then be strong enough to survive the nuclear detonation. Alex defeats the Supreme Hunter and moves the weapon out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with a helicopter, where it detonates and catches him in the blast. His remains float back to the city and regenerate after consuming a crow.

During the credits, it is revealed that the public considers the military to have been the one who stopped the infection; a US Senator is heard telling the media that the events in Manhattan were a case of nuclear and biological terrorism, and promises retribution upon those responsible. Alex, reflecting on the events that occurred and the truth he uncovered about himself, claims he has "become something less than human, but also something more". After the credits, Manhattan is shown to be slowly recovering, with the virus close to eradicated. Alex, standing on top of the [[Reuters Building]] in [[Times Square]], comments that his work is almost done.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22185">'''Racebending''' is a [[neologism]] that describes the changing of a character's perceived race or ethnicity during the adaptation of a work from one medium to another. Racebending was coined as a term of protest in 2009 as a response to the casting decisions for the [[The Last Airbender|live-action film adaptation]] of the television series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]].''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.racebending.com/v4/about/what-is-racebending/|title=What is “racebending”?|date=2011-02-23|work=Racebending.com|access-date=2018-04-10|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The starring roles of the show ([[Aang]], [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]], and [[Sokka]]) were intended to be of Asian and [[Inuit]] descent, but were cast by Caucasian actors in the film.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez|first=Lori Kido|title=Fan Activists and the Politics of Race in The Last Airbender|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1367877911422862|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|date=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial protests such as "Saving the World with Postage,"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drawing New Color Lines: Transnational Asian American Graphic Narratives|last=Gruenewald|first=Tim|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created in a [[LiveJournal]] online forum that initially responded to the casting decisions by "inundating [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] with protest mail."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the cast went unaltered and when production began, the leaders of this protest responded by founding the advocacy group and accompanying website ''Racebending'' by "playfully borrowing the concept of manipulating elements (bending) from the ''Avatar'' universe."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Racebending.com website defines "racebending" as, "situations where a media content creator (movie studio, publisher, etc.) has changed the race or ethnicity of a character. This is a longstanding Hollywood practice that has been historically used to discriminate against people of color."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The website also states that the coining of the term predates the issue itself. [[Whitewashing in film|Whitewashing, particularly common in film]], "possesses a long tradition among the industry's most successful and venerated productions. Film history is replete with ignominious examples of white actors portraying characters of color."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Christopher|title=The Routledge Companion to Media and Race|location=London|publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for racebending ==
According to Christina Shu Jien Chong, racebending, [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]] and an overall lack of representation of Asians as well as other minorities in the film industry is due to lack of minority applicants, lack of opportunities for minorities due to a connection-based culture in the entertainment industry created through implicit bias, and breakdowns, casting descriptions that usually include characteristics including a characters name, gender, age, race, minor personality traits and a brief life background.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Chong does not consider breakdowns problematic in themselves, but as stated by Russell Robinson in a research article published by the Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, they tend to discriminate against minorities in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2730&amp;context=facpubs|title=Casting and Caste-ing: Reconciling Artistic Freedom and Antidiscrimination Norms|last=Robinson|first=Russell|date=January 1, 2007|website=Berkley Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Robinson's argument against breakdowns is that they are usually created by studio directors and 87% of directors are white.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robinson claims that these directors as well as others within the film industry can easily decide to change the race of a breakdown or of a character being adapted from another form of media. Robinson stated, "Any person in this decision-making chain might exclude an actor or an entire category of actors based on race or sex-based considerations, yet this discrimination would normally remain concealed from the excluded applicants and the public."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Robinson, there are circles of "the wealthy elite in [[Hollywood]]" whose "implicit biases", covered up by breakdowns, lead to a significant amount of racebending and whitewashing within the film industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Many producers and directors in the film industry believe that it is not racial discrimination that leads to racebending, whitewashing, and an overall lack of minority representation in the film industry. Instead, many accredit it to a low number of minority applicants and the lack of funding they would receive if they did cast minorities in lead roles. In response to critic backlash after the release of the film ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', which is based on the true story of a group of [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] students who in the film are portrayed mostly by Caucasian actors, producer [[Dana Brunetti]] claimed, "We would have loved to cast Asians in the lead roles, but the truth is, we didn't have access to any bankable Asian-American actors that we wanted."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Furthermore, [[Ridley Scott]] claimed, after the release of his film ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'', which faced a similar whitewashing controversy, "I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain and say that my lead actor is Muhammad so-and-so from such-and-such. I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up."&lt;ref name="Odyssey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/whitewashing-racebending|title=Whitewashing Vs Racebending|last=Bazemore|first=Kendall|date=June 7, 2016|website=Odyssey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
After the producers of ''[[The Last Airbender]]'' announced their decision to cast white actors [[Noah Ringer]], [[Nicola Peltz]] and [[Jackson Rathbone]] as the lead roles, the artists who had worked on [[Avatar: The Last Airbender|the animated show]] it was based on created an anonymous [[LiveJournal]] website and started a letter-writing campaign.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; On the other hand, the actors portraying the antagonist characters are mainly Middle Eastern and Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.palmbeachstate.edu/honors/Documents/people_painted_over_whitewashing_of_minority_actors_in_recent_film-_and%20_television.pdf |title=People Painted Over: Whitewashing of Minority Actors in Recent Film |last=Lowrey|first=William|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two fans from the LiveJournal website, known as glockgal and jedifreac, realized there were more cases regarding racebending other than ''The Last Airbender'' movie, leading them to create their own forum against racebending as a whole, Racebending.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racebending.com/v4/|title=Racebending.com|website=Racebending.com|access-date=2018-04-11|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Racebending.com wrote a letter to [[Nickelodeon]]'s CEO at the time, Jeff Dunn, regarding the audition restrictions for ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]],'' the eighteenth season of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://racebending.livejournal.com/277256.html|title=Update on the Red Samurai Ranger|access-date=2018-04-09|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the show had restricted auditions for the [[Red Ranger]] to only white actors, but the casting was re-opened in June 2010 to actors of all ethnicities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The film ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' received significant backlash on social media before its release, due to white actors [[Christian Bale]], [[Joel Edgerton]] and others being cast to play the roles of Egyptians, while black actors were only given the roles of slaves and thieves.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/exodus-racial-casting-controversy-familiar-one|title='Exodus' racial casting controversy is a familiar one|work=MSNBC|access-date=2018-04-11|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Ridley Scott]] argued that they cast actors of other ethnicities as well (Iranians, Spaniards, Arabs, etc.) because Egyptians have varied ethnicities, and that the audience shouldn't focus on only the white actors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2010, Racebending.com and the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, alongside urging boycotts of ''The Last Airbender'', also urged boycotts of ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'' as well, due to practices of racebending. ''Prince of Persia'' was criticized for casting white actors for the leads instead of actors of Iranian or Middle Eastern descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/racebending/|title=Hollywood whitewash? ‘Airbender’ and ‘Prince of Persia’ anger fans with ethnic casting|last=Lee|first=Chris|date=May 22, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Scarlett Johansson]] was cast in the lead role of [[Motoko Kusanagi]] in ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', a live-action adaptation of the [[Ghost in the Shell|Japanese manga]], there was fan backlash over the casting as, since the story is located within Japan, it was assumed that the actress to portray the character was meant to be of Japanese descent, and numerous fans signed petitions for a recast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loreck|first=Janice|date=2018-02-16|title=Race and stardom in Ghost in the Shell|url=https://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/sfftv.2018.6?journalCode=sfftv|journal=Science Fiction Film &amp; Television|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–44|doi=10.3828/sfftv.2018.6|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johansson addressed the issue in an interview for ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine, stating that she never would have accepted the role if it meant taking it from an Asian actor. Johansson explained how she accepted the part because the main protagonist was female and "having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity."&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14559866/ghost-in-the-shell-scarlett-johansson-whitewashing|title=Scarlett Johansson finally addresses Ghost in the Shell whitewashing controversy|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2017-02-09|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-04-11|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists groups, such as the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) accused Johansson of lying that she would never portray or attempt to play someone of a different race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ghost-movie-controversy-20170401-story.html|title=Asian American media group condemns Scarlett Johansson in ‘Ghost in the Shell’ controversy|last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick D.|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-11|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their complaints stemmed in the idea that they believed Hollywood was not allowing Asians to portray Asian characters, and instead, was hiring white actors to take roles that could easily have been portrayed by an Asian actor and actress. Asian actors such as [[Constance Wu]] and [[Ming-Na Wen]] called for a boycott of the movie because they thought that it was unfair that the role did not go to an Asian woman.&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; The Founding President of MANAA, Guy Aoki, stated, "Hollywood continues to make the same excuses, that there aren't big enough Asian/Asian American names to open a blockbuster film. Yet it has not developed a farm system where such actors get even third billing in most pictures. Without a conscientious effort, how will anyone ever break through and become familiar enough with audiences so producers will confidently allow them to topline a film? When will we ever break that glass ceiling?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/scarlett-johansson-ghost-in-the-shell-whitewashing-1202020230/|title=Asian American Media Group Accuses Scarlett Johansson of ‘Lying’ About ‘Ghost in the Shell’ Whitewashing Controversy|last=Ahern|first=Sarah|date=2017-03-31|work=Variety|access-date=2018-04-11|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film spurned many different conversations on how to allow actors and actresses of minority groups to have the spotlight, as well as created discussions on how to end these endemic problems throughout Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunday Talk: The panel discusses whitewashing in film and television|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/whitewashing-in-film-and-television-sunday-talk-1.4042146|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, when ''[[Harry Potter]]'' received an addition to its installment with the stage play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'', it was announced that the character [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] would be played by [[Noma Dumezweni]], an African actress residing in England. Fans were displeased with this and called it "reverse whitewashing", but [[J. K. Rowling]], the author of the original series, stated in a tweet that white skin was never specified in the making of the character Hermione, but rather being intelligent and smart.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

==Other uses==
The Racebending website acknowledges that often the terms "whitewashing" and "racebending" are used interchangeably, but that occasionally, the effects of racebending can have a positive impact. Racebending can, at times, result in increased representation for minorities if a "white role" is altered to be played by a minority. The website gave as examples of positive racebending [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films, Cinderella (Brandy Norwood) and Prince Christopher (Paolo Montalban) in The Wonderful World of Disney's retelling of ''Cinderella'' (1997), and Velma (Hayley Kiyoko) in ''Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins'' (2009), stating that, although minimal, "for communities of color, these casting decisions meant representation and meaningful inclusion in the American storytelling landscape."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Usage evolved, and by 2015, [[media studies]] academic Kristen J. Warner wrote that the term has "many definitions and contexts", from the film industry practice of [[color-blind casting]] to [[fan fiction]]. She describes how writers can "change the race and cultural specificity of central characters or pull a secondary character of color from the margins, transforming her into the central protagonist."&lt;ref name="warner"&gt;{{Harvnb|Warner|2015|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''{{'}}s Abbey White said in 2016 that the term can apply to actors of color being cast in traditionally white roles. White said, "In the last several years, racebending has become a practice used more and more to help networks diversify their ensembles and capture a bigger audience. Not only has it resulted in more racial visibility on the small screen, but in a far more unexpected way, racebending can generate deeper and more significant depictions of characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=White | first=Abbey | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/5-tv-shows-that-benefited-from-racebending.html | title=5 TV Shows That Benefited from Racebending | work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] | date=August 29, 2016 | accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
According to a 2016 [[University of Southern California]] report on diversity in entertainment within which 414 stories were sampled, 109 motion pictures and 305 broadcast, cable and digital series, "71.7% were white, 12.2% Black, 5.8% Hispanic/Latino, 5.1% Asian, 2.3% Middle Eastern and 3.1% other",&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://annenberg.usc.edu/sites/default/files/CARDReport_FINAL.pdf|title=INCLUSION or INVISIBILITY?

Nonverbal utterances are not considered words. Characters that are named are also considered speaking characters. Under rare circumstances, a group of nearly identical characters might speak at the exact same time or sequentially. Given their extreme homogeneous appearance, it is impossible to distinguish these characters from another. When this occurs, the coders are instructed to "group" the identical characters and code them as one unit."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Christina Shu Jien Chong's article in the Asian Pacific American Law Journal, "Whites occupied 83.5% of lead roles while minorities occupied 16.5%; 9.5% Black, 2% Latino, 2.5% Asian, 0.5% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chong|first=Christina|date=January 1, 2016|title=Where are the Asians in Hollywood?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17622">The Persian term for '''riddle''' is '''''chīstān''''', literally 'what is it?', a word that frequently occurs in the opening formulae of Persian riddles. However, the Arabic loan-word ''lughaz'' is also used.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 20, 24, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Persian rhetorical manuals almost always handle riddles, but Persian riddles have enjoyed little modern scholarly attention.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 14-18, 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in the assessment of A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, 'Persian literary riddles provide us with some of the most novel and intricate metaphors and images in Persian poetry'.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres and their histories==

Persian riddles occur in several different literary forms, and it is helpful to trace the history of the Persian riddle through these forms. It is assumed that folk-riddles circulated in Persian from early times, and riddles are prominent in Persian romances set in earlier, pre-Islamic times, perhaps indicating the earlier popularity of the form.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 12, 29-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Erotic allusions are common in medieval Persian riddles, as in other kinds of metaphorical description.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===

It is unclear how medieval Persian riddles were actually performed. Whereas the genre of conundrum known as ''mu‘ammā'' circulated in manuscripts without solutions, riddles were provided with their solutions in medieval and later manuscripts, so it is possible that poets would announce the solution before performing the riddle.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literary, descriptive riddles====

These riddles overlap with and blur into the literary genre of ''[[wasf]]'' (detailed, metaphorical description), usually appearing in the opening section (''[[Nasīb (poetry)|nasīb]]'') of a ''[[Qasida|qasīdah]]''. It seems clear that the literary riddle emerged from ''[[wasf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Mo’taman, ''Še‘rva adab-e f�arsi'' (Tehran 1346/1967–1968 [1st edn 1322/1943–1944]), pp. 333–37 (esp. p. 334), cited by Paola Orsatti, 'The Persian Literary Riddle: Marginal Notes and Critical Remarks on a Recent Study', ''Middle Eastern Literatures, Incorporating Edebiyat'', 15 (2012), 75-85, DOI: 10.1080/1475262X.2012.657394 (p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt; This genre includes the earliest attested Persian riddles, from around the ninth to eleventh centuries. Some examples may not originally have been riddles, but rather metaphorical descriptions that, in transmission, became divorced from their original contexts, coming to seem like riddles in the process. One example is this anonymous one, cited by [[Shams-i Qeys]] in his ''[[Kitāb al-mu‘jam]]'':

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
What is it that tears into small pieces
whatever falls in its toothless mouth?
If you put your fingers in its eyes
it will instantly prick up its ears.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The answer is 'scissors'.

As the hugely popular descriptive literature in the [[khorāsānī style]] became increasingly metaphorical, so too it necessarily became more riddle-like, and by the eleventh century an 'almost codified form of riddle' can be identified, though the boundary between riddle and description is very hard to draw: texts which are unambiguously to be categorised as riddles are not numerous and the process whereby the riddle emerged as a literary form is not altogether clear.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 20, 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; However, key exponents of the descriptive riddle form were the innovative poet [[Masud Sa'd Salman|Mas‘ūd Sā‘d Salmān]] (d. 1121), who composed at least twelve riddles or riddle-like descriptions, his successors [[‘Uthmān Mukhtārī]] (d. 1118×21) and [[Ḥakīm Sanā’ī]] (d. 1131×41), and [[Amīr Mu‘izzī]] (d. 1125), whose ''[[divan]]'' includes fourteen riddles.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 85-133.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the following riddle by Amīr Mu‘izzī, which involves a series of puns on the different meanings of the word ''tir'' ('rank, importance; Mercury, associated with scribes and scholars; arrow'):

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
What is that body that has received ''tir'' [importance] from the ''tir'' of the sky [Mercury]?
:It has the form of a ''tir'' [arrow]; it has set the empire as straight as a ''tir'' [arrow].
When it weeps, the soul will smile in the body;
:When it cries out, the ''tir'' [Mercury] will exult in the sky.
When it sheds tears, it displays precious jewels,
:Through its sound, it brings reports of struggles of the mind.
Whatever nature can conceive, it collates
:And comments on whatever the imagination generates.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 117-18, with reference to Paola Orsatti, 'The Persian Literary Riddle: Marginal Notes and Critical Remarks on a Recent Study', ''Middle Eastern Literatures, Incorporating Edebiyat'', 15 (2012), 75-85, DOI: 10.1080/1475262X.2012.657394 (p. 84).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Later literary riddles tend to be very obscure in style,&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 20-69 (esp. 24-27).&lt;/ref&gt; even to the point of being unsolvable today.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wisdom-contests in epic romance====

Several Persian romances include some kind of test of verbal wisdom. The earliest is [[Unsuri|‘Unṣurī's]] eleventh-century ''[[Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; but the one most clearly conforming to the riddle genre occurs in the renowned ''[[Shahnameh|Shāh Nāma]]'', when [[Manuchehr]] asks six Zoroastrian priests to test the wits of [[Zāl]] in his suit for [[Rūdāba]].&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 72-84.&lt;/ref&gt; These are less obscure than the descriptive riddles, tending to feature metaphors and tropes which anyone familiar with Persian poetic conventions could be expected to recognise.  For example, in the ''Shāh Nāma'' (taking just one variant of a text that varies dramatically from one manuscript to another),

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Another priest said: 'O proud warrior:
there are two noble and fleet horses
One of them is like a black sea,
the other glistens like white crystal.
They are both exerting themselves, racing in haste
But neither can catch the other.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Zāl answers this riddle as follows:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
The two running horses, black and white
that cannot catch each other in the race:
Know, O puzzler, that they are night and day,
in order that you may feel puzzlement.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

====Ethico-philosophical riddles====

A very specific type of riddle appears in the twelfth century, in ethico-philosophical epics, in a form probably invented by [[Uthman Mukhtari|‘Uthmān Mukhtārī]], who used it in his ''[[Hunar-nāma]]'': the riddle comprises ten couplets posing ethical questions, followed by two couplets in which the poet delivers his answers.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the following riddle (''Hunar-nāma'' couplets 343-52):

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
He said: 'What then is that yielding twig,
:the cloud of prosperity and the sun of liberality,
The face of generosity and the body of magnanimity,
:the essence of pleasure and the substance of gaiety,
The title of confirmation and the letter of conferral,
:the source of sustenance and the Fountain of Life,
The source of generosity and the origin of reward,
:the ocean of excellence and the mine of bounty,
The ornament and beauty of the seal and the dagger,
:the dwelling and haven of victory and conquest.
It is disdain for gold and scorn for coins,
:it is the boast of the reins and honours the pen.
Were the cloud to adopt its habits,
:it would shelter all men, indiscriminately.
If the sun left its traces as this thing does,
:mountains would turn into jewels and deserts to gold.
Its movements are the vanguards of reward,
:its forehead gives light to bounty's eyes.
In the time of struggle, it is stronger than the ocean,
:in the hour of giving, more generous than heaven.'
&lt;/poem&gt;

The narrator provides the following solution:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
I said: 'This is the hand of the free-giving king,
:Lord of the world and the kingdom's master.
So long as water, earth, fire and wind exist,
:may his grip on the world be absolute.'&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

====Occasional riddles====

Medieval Persian literature also attests to numerous ''qit‘a''s ([[quatrain|quatrains]]) posing varied, often [[Occasional poetry|occasional]], tests of wit.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mu‘ammā====

Persian also adopted the conundrum form ''mu‘ammā'' from Arabic. These conundra are in verse, do not include an interrogatory element, and involve clues as to the letters or sounds of the word. The main study is by Shama Anwari-Alhosseyni.&lt;ref&gt;''Loqaz und Mo‘ammā: ein Quellenstudie zur Kunstform der persischen Rätsels'' (Berlin, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk riddles===

Although folk riddles are not attested until relatively recently, it is assumed that they existed from ancient times onwards, predating and informing the medieval literary riddle tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the main collection remains that published by Charles Scott in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Charles T. Scott, ''Persian and Arabic Riddles: A Language-Centered Approach to Genre Definition'', Publication of the Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics, 39 (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1965). The Teheran collection was originally made by one Sean Sweeney and translated by Gilbert Lazard and Andreas Tietze: Scott p. 37 n. 1. The Afghan collection was made by Scott himself from graduate students at Columbia University: p. 49 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott identifies the following (sometimes overlapping) key forms in his riddles, which were collected in the earlier twentieth century in [[Teheran]] and [[Afghanistan]]:&lt;ref&gt;Charles T. Scott, ''Persian and Arabic Riddles: A Language-Centered Approach to Genre Definition'', Publication of the Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics, 39 (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1965), pp. 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Riddles with an equivalent number of syllables in each line. The most populous category. Many are just two lines long, but some extend to three (Teheran) or six (Afghanstan) and may rhyme.
* Riddles with the introductory formula ''ʔan čist (ke)...'' (Teheran) or ''u(ʔan) čis(t) ke'' (Afghanistan) ('what is that (which)...').
* Riddles structured around the connectives ''hæm ... hæm ...'' ('both ... and ...') (Teheran only). The solutions to these riddles are words with two meanings.
* Riddles comprising a single phrase (Afghanistan only).

Examples of the four types follow:

====čɪstan čɪstan čis====

Scott also records a riddle-game of a highly formulaic kind from Afghan informants. The speaker (S) requires the hearer (H) to guess a real-life family of their acquaintance by enumerating its members, concluding with the formula 'ešan zænu šuy' ('they, wife and husband') on the pattern of this example:&lt;ref&gt;Charles T. Scott, ''Persian and Arabic Riddles: A Language-Centered Approach to Genre Definition''Publication of the Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics, 39 (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1965), pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the hearer fails to guess the answer, they must pretend to grant a city to the speaker, through the following formula:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9029">'''Risk society''' is the manner in which modern [[society]] organizes in response to [[risk]]. The term is closely associated with several key writers on [[modernity]], in particular [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]].&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Ulrich Beck
|title=Risk Society, Towards a New Modernity
|location=London
|publisher=Sage Publications
|year=1992 
|pages=260
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in the 1980s and its popularity during the 1990s was both as a consequence of its links to trends in thinking about wider modernity, and also to its links to popular discourse, in particular the growing [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]] during the period.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to British sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]], a risk society is "a society increasingly preoccupied with the future (and also with safety), which generates the notion of risk,"&lt;ref&gt;Giddens and Pierson 1998, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the German sociologist [[Ulrich Beck]] defines it as "a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by [[modernisation]] itself (Beck 1992:21)".&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety /&gt;

Beck (1992:50)&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety /&gt; defined modernization as,

{{Quote box
|quote = "surges of technological rationalization and changes in work and organization, but beyond that includes much more: the change in societal characteristics and normal biographies, changes in lifestyle and forms of love, change in the structures of power and influence, in the forms of political repression and participation, in views of reality and in the norms of knowledge. In social science's understanding of modernity, the plough, the steam locomotive and the microchip are visible indicators of a much deeper process, which comprises and reshapes the entire social structure."

}}

==Background==

===Modernity and realism in science===
Beck and Giddens both approach the risk society firmly from the perspective of [[modernity]], "a shorthand term for modern society or industrial civilization...  modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society... which unlike any preceding culture lives in the future rather than the past." (Anthony Giddens)&lt;ref&gt;Giddens and Pierson p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw heavily on the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], the idea that as a society examines itself, it in turn changes itself in the process. In classical industrial society, the modernist view is based on assumption of realism in science creating a system in which scientists work in an exclusive, inaccessible environment.

==Implications==

===Environmental risks===
In 1986, right after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], Ulrich Beck, a sociology professor at the University of Munich, published the original German text, ''Risikogesellschaft'', of his highly influential and catalytic work (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt 1986). ''Risikogesellschaft'' was published in English as ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity'' in 1992. The ecological crisis is central to this social analysis of the contemporary period. Beck argued that environmental risks had become the predominant product, not just an unpleasant, manageable side-effect, of industrial society.

Giddens and Beck argued that whilst humans have always been subjected to a level of risk – such as [[natural disasters]] – these have usually been perceived as produced by non-human forces. Modern societies, however, are exposed to risks such as [[pollution]], newly discovered illnesses, crime, that are the result of the [[modernization]] process itself. Giddens defines these two types of risks as [[external risk]]s and [[manufactured risks]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manufactured risks]] are marked by a high level of [[human agency]] involved in both producing, and mitigating such risks.

As [[manufactured risks]] are the product of human activity, authors like Giddens and Beck argue that it is possible for societies to assess the level of risk that is being produced, or that is about to be produced. This sort of reflexive introspection can in turn alter the planned activities themselves. As an example, disasters such as [[Chernobyl]] and the [[Love Canal]] Crisis, public faith in the modern project has declined leaving public distrust in [[industry]], [[government]] and [[expert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social concerns led to increased regulation of the nuclear power industry and to the abandonment of some expansion plans, altering the course of modernization itself. This increased critique of modern industrial practices is said to have resulted in a state of [[reflexive modernization]], illustrated by concepts such as [[sustainability]] and the [[precautionary principle]] that focus on preventative measures to decrease levels of risk.

There are differing opinions as to how the concept of a risk society interacts with social hierarchies and class distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that social relations have altered with the introduction of manufactured risks and reflexive modernization. [[Risk]]s, much like [[wealth]], are distributed unevenly in a population and will influence quality of life.

[[Ulrich Beck|Beck]] has argued that older forms of class structure – based mainly on the accumulation of wealth – atrophy in a modern, risk society, in which people occupy [[social risk positions]] that are achieved through risk aversion. "In some of their dimensions these follow the inequalities of class and strata positions, but they bring a fundamentally different distribution logic into play".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck contends that widespread risks contain a 'boomerang effect', in that individuals producing risks will also be exposed to them. This argument suggests that wealthy individuals whose [[Capital (economics)|capital]] is largely responsible for creating pollution will also have to suffer when, for example, the contaminants seep into the water supply. This argument may seem oversimplified, as wealthy people may have the ability to mitigate risk more easily by, for example, buying bottled water. [[Ulrich Beck|Beck]], however, has argued that the distribution of this sort of risk is the result of [[knowledge]], rather than wealth. Whilst the wealthy person may have access to [[factors of production|resources]] that enable him or her to avert risk, this would not even be an option were the person unaware that the risk even existed. However, Risks do not only affect those of a certain social class or place, risk is not bias and can affect everybody no matter your class, nobody is free from risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|last2=Ritter|first2=Mark|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1992|isbn=978-0803983465|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] has argued that older forms of class structure maintain a somewhat stronger role in a risk society, now being partly defined "in terms of differential access to forms of self-actualization and empowerment".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens 1991, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] has also tended to approach the concept of a risk society more positively than [[Ulrich Beck|Beck]], suggesting that there "can be no question of merely taking a negative attitude towards risk. Risk needs to be disciplined, but active risk-taking is a core element of a dynamic economy and an innovative society."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Runaway World'', 1999, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that, in addition to being a [[writing system]], [[Runic alphabet|runes]] historically served purposes of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. This is the case from earliest epigraphic evidence of the [[Roman Iron Age|Roman]] to [[Germanic Iron Age]], with non-linguistic inscriptions and the ''[[alu (runic)|alu]]'' word. An ''[[erilaz]]'' appears to have been a person versed in runes, including their magic applications.

In medieval sources, notably the [[Poetic Edda]], the ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'' mentions "victory runes" to be carved on a [[viking sword|sword]], "some on the grasp and some on the inlay, and name [[Tiwaz rune|Tyr]] twice."

In early modern and modern times, related folklore and superstition is recorded in the form of the [[Icelandic magical staves]]. In the early 20th century, [[Germanic mysticism]] coins new forms of "runic magic", some of which were continued or developed further by contemporary adherents of [[Germanic Neopaganism]]. Modern systems of
'''runic divination''' are based on [[Hermeticism]], classical [[Occultism]], and the [[I Ching]].

==Historical evidence==
[[File:Brakteat von Djupbrunns.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bracteate]] G 205 (ca. 5th to 7th century), bearing the inscription ''[[alu (runic)|alu]]''.]]

===Tacitus===
Historically it is known that the [[Germanic peoples]] used various forms of divination and means of reading omens. [[Tacitus]] (''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' 10) gives a detailed account (98AD):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:They attach the highest importance to the taking of auspices and casting lots. Their usual procedure with the lot is simple. They cut off a branch from a nut-bearing tree and slice it into strips these they mark with different signs and throw them at random onto a white cloth. Then the state's priest, if it is an official consultation, or the father of the family, in a private one, offers prayer to the gods and looking up towards heaven picks up three strips, one at a time, and, according to which sign they have previously been marked with, makes his interpretation. If the lots forbid an undertaking, there is no deliberation that day about the matter in question. If they allow it, further confirmation is required by taking [[auspice]]s.&lt;ref name="BIRLEY-42"&gt;Birley (1999:42).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is often debated whether "signs" refers specifically to runes or to other marks; both interpretations are plausible and Tacitus does not give enough detail for a definite decision to be made.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Rives, ''Germania By Cornelius Tacitus'', Oxford University Press p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epigraphy===
[[File:Kylverstenen futhark.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The inscription on the [[Kylver stone]] ends with a stacked [[bind rune]] combining six [[Tiwaz rune]]s used to invoke the god [[Tyr]] and four [[Ansuz rune]]s to invoke the [[Æsir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Spurkland |first=Terje |authorlink= |title=Norwegian Runes and Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2005 |location= |pages=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=1-84383-186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The [[Ansuz rune|Ansuz]] and [[Tiwaz rune|Tiwaz]] runes in particular seem to have had magical significance in the early ([[Elder Futhark]]) period.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  The ''Sigrdrífumál'' instruction of  "name Tyr twice" is reminiscent of the double or triple "stacked Tyr" [[bindrune]]s found e.g. on [[Seeland-II-C]] or the [[Lindholm amulet]] in the ''aaaaaaaazzznnn-b- muttt'', sequence, which besides stacked Tyr involves multiple repetition of Ansuz, but also triple occurrence of [[Algiz]] and [[Naudiz]].
Many inscriptions also have apparently meaningless utterances interpreted as magical chants, such as ''tuwatuwa'' ([[Vadstena bracteate]]), ''aaduaaaliia'' (DR BR42) or ''g͡æg͡og͡æ'' ([[Undley bracteate]]), ''g͡ag͡ag͡a '' ([[Kragehul I]]).

[[Alu (runic)|Alu]] is a charm word appearing on numerous artifacts found in Central and Northern Europe dating from the [[Germanic Iron Age]]. The word is the most common of the early runic charm words and can appear either alone or as part of an apparent formula. The origin and meaning of the word are matters of dispute, though a general agreement exists among scholars that the word either represents amulet magic or is a metaphor (or [[metonym]]) for it.&lt;ref name=MACLEODMEES24&gt;Macleod and Mees (2006), 91-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few [[Viking Age]] [[magic ring|rings]] with runic inscriptions of apparently magical nature were found, among them the [[Kingmoor Ring]]. The phrase "runes of power" is found on two [[runestone]]s in Sweden, [[Stentoften Runestone|DR 357]] from Stentoften and [[Björketorp Runestone|DR 360]] from Björketorp. Runestones with curses include [[Skern Runestone|DR 81]] in Skjern, DR 83 in Sønder Vinge, [[Glavendrup stone|DR 209]] in Glavendrup, [[Tryggevælde Runestone|DR 230]] from Tryggevælde, DR 338 in Glemminge, and [[Saleby Runestone|Vg 67]] in Saleby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nielsen |first=M.

===Medieval sources===
The most prolific source for runic magic in the [[Poetic Edda]] is the  ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa ([[Brynhild]]) presents [[Sigurd]] with a [[memory-draught]] of ale that had been charmed with "gladness runes" (stanza 5), 
{|
|
:Biór fori ec þer /brynþings apaldr!
:magni blandinn  / oc megintíri;
:fullr er hann lioþa  / oc licnstafa,
:godra galdra  / oc gamanruna.
|
:"Beer I bring thee,  tree of battle,
:Mingled of strength  and mighty fame;
:Charms it holds  and healing signs,
:Spells full good,  and gladness-runes."&lt;ref&gt;translation and numbering of stanzas after the edition by [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
She goes on to give advice on the magical runes in seven further stanzas. In all instances, the runes are used for actual [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] ([[apotropaic]] or ability-enhancing spells) rather than for divination:
* "victory runes" to be carved on the sword hilt (stanza 6, presumably referring to the [[Tiwaz rune|''t'' rune]] named for [[Tyr]]&lt;ref name="Enoksen1"&gt;Enoksen, Lars Magnar. ''Runor: Historia, tydning, tolkning'' (1998) {{ISBN|91-88930-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;),
*  ''ølrunar '' "[[Alu (runic)|Ale]]-runes" (stanza 7, a protective spell against being bewitched by means of ale served by the host's wife; [[naudiz]] is to be marked on one's fingernails, and [[laukaz]] on the cup),
*''biargrunar'' "birth-runes" (stanza 8, a spell to facilitate [[childbirth]]),
*''brimrunar'' "wave-runes" (stanza 9, a spell for the protection of ships, with runes to be carved on the stem and on the rudder),
*''limrunar'' "branch-runes" (stanza 10, a healing spell, the runes to be carved on trees "with boughs to the eastward bent"),&lt;ref&gt;"Such runes were believed to transfer sickness from the invalid to the tree. Some editors, however, have changed ''limrunar'' ("branch runes") to ''lifrunar'' ("life-runes")" Bellows (1936), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''malrunar'' "speech-runes" (stanza 11, the stanza is corrupt, but apparently referred to a spell to improve one's rhetorical ability at the [[thing (assembly)|thing]]),
*''hugrunar'' "thought-runes" (stanza 12, the stanza is incomplete, but clearly discussed a spell to improve one's wit).&lt;ref&gt;"Here the list of runes breaks off, though the manuscript indicates no gap, and three short passages of a different type, though all dealing with runes, follow." Bellows (1936) p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poetic Edda also seems to corroborate the magical significance of the runes the ''[[Hávamál]]'' where [[Odin]] mentions runes in contexts of divination,{{dubious|date=November 2011}} of healing and of necromancy (trans. Bellows):
:"Certain is that  which is sought from runes / That the gods so great have made /   And the Master-Poet painted" (79)
:"Of runes heard I words, nor were counsels wanting /  At the hall of Hor" (111)
:"Grass cures the scab / and runes the sword-cut" (137)
:"Runes shalt thou find / and fateful signs" (143)
:" if high on a tree /  I see a hanged man swing /  So do I write  and color the runes /  That forth he fares /  And to me talks." (158)

Other oft cited sources for the practice of runic{{dubious|date=November 2011}} divination are chapter 38 of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Ynglinga Saga]], where [[Granmar]], the king of [[Södermanland]], travels to the [[Temple at Uppsala]] for the seasonal [[blót]]. "There, the chips fell in a way that said that he would not live long" (''Féll honum þá svo spánn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisource.org/wiki/Ynglinga_saga#Orusta_Ingjalds_konungs_og_Granmars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729193130/http://wikisource.org/wiki/Ynglinga_saga |date=2007-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source is in the [[Vita Ansgari]], the biography of [[Ansgar]] the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]], which was written by a monk named [[Rimbert]]. Rimbert details the custom of [[Cleromancy|casting lots]] by the pagan Norse (chapters 26-30).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/anskar.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The chips and the lots, however, can be explained respectively as a ''blótspánn'' (sacrificial chip) and a ''hlauttein'' (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson &lt;ref name=PAGE401&gt;Foote and Wilson (1970), 401.&lt;/ref&gt; would be "marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided."

[[Egils Saga]] features several incidents of runic magic. The most celebrated is the scene where Egil discovers (and destroys) a poisoned drink prepared for him, by cutting his hand and cutting runes on the drinking horn, and painting the runes with blood. While the motif of blood painted runes also appears in other examples of early Norse literature it is uncertain whether the practice of painting runes with blood is merely a literary invention or whether it had precedence in magical practice.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod and Mees (2006), 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern systems==
[[File:Runes.jpg|thumb|250px|Runic divination using ceramic tiles]]
In the 17th Century, [[Hermeticist]] and [[Rosicrucian]] [[Johannes Bureus]], having been inspired by visions, developed a Runic system based on the [[Kaballah]] and the Futhark which he called the ''Adulruna''.&lt;ref&gt;Åkerman Susanna ''Rose Cross over the Baltic: the Spread of Rosicrucianism in Northern Europe'' p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armanen runes]] "revealed" to [[Guido von List]] in 1902 were employed for magical purposes in [[Germanic mysticism]] by authors such as [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] and [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]], and after [[World War II]] in a reformed "pansophical" system by [[Karl Spiesberger]]. More recently, [[Stephen Flowers]], [[Adolf Schleipfer]], [[Larry E. Camp]] and others also build on List's system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Several modern systems of runic magic and runic divination were published from the 1980s onward. The first book on runic divination, written by Ralph Blum in 1982, led to the development of sets of runes designed for use in several such systems of [[fortune telling]], in which the runes are typically incised in clay, stone tiles, crystals, resin, glass, or polished stones, then either selected one-by-one from a closed bag or thrown down at random for reading.

Later authors such as [[Diana L. Paxson]]  and  [[Freya Aswynn]] follow Blum (1989)  in drawing  a direct correlation between runic divination and [[tarot divination]]. They may discuss runes in the context of "spreads" and advocate the usage of "rune cards".

Modern authors like Ralph Blum sometimes include a "blank rune" in their sets. Some were to replace a lost rune, but according to Ralph Blum this was the god [[Odin]]'s rune, the rune of the beginning and the end, representing "the divine in all human transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum|first=Ralph|title=The Book of Runes: 20th Anniversary Edition|year=2000|publisher=Eddison Sadd|isbn=1-85906-042-0|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ralph Blum===
In 1982, a modern usage of the runes for answering life's questions was apparently originated by [[Ralph Blum]] in his [[divination]] book ''The Book of Runes: A Handbook for the Use of an Ancient Oracle'', which was marketed with a small bag of round tiles with runes stamped on them. This book has remained in print since its first publication. The sources for Blum's divinatory interpretations, as he explained in ''The Book of Runes'' itself, drew heavily on then-current books describing the ancient [[I Ching]] divination system of China.

Each of Blum's seven books on runic divination deals with a specialized area of life or a varied technique for reading runes:
*''The Book of Runes: A Handbook for the Use of an Ancient Oracle: The Viking Runes'' (1982); revised 10th Anniversary Edition (1992); revised 25th Anniversary Edition (2007).
* ''The Rune Cards: Sacred Play for Self Discovery'' (1989); reissued as ''The Rune Cards: Ancient Wisdom For the New Millennium'' (1997). Rather than rune stones, this book uses images of the runes printed on card stock, much like a set of [[trading card]]s or [[tarot]] cards.
* ''The Healing Runes'' with co-author  Susan Loughan (1995) teaches methods for using runic divination in the context of health and personal integration.
* ''Rune Play: A Method of Self Counseling and a Year-Round Rune Casting Record Book'' (1996)
* ''The Serenity Runes: Five Keys to the Serenity Prayer'' with co-author Susan Loughan (1998); reissued as ''The Serenity Runes: Five Keys to Spiritual Recovery'' (2005) utilizes runic divination as a method for assisting [[self-help]] and recovery from addictions; the title is a reference to the well-known [[Serenity prayer]] widely used in the [[12-step program]] of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].
* ''Ralph H. Blum's Little Book of Runic Wisdom'' (2002).
* ''The Relationship Runes: A Compass for the Heart'' with co-author Bronwyn Jones (2003) shows how to use runic divination in matters of love and friendship.

Blum has also written books on the [[Tao Te Ching]], [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], and [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s.

===Stephen Flowers===
In the wake of a 1984 dissertation on "Runes and Magic", [[Stephen Flowers]] published a series of books under the pen-name "Edred Thorsson" which detailed his own original method of runic divination and magic, "odianism",&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, Edred. ''Runelore; A handbook of Esoteric Runology''&lt;/ref&gt; which he said was loosely based on historical sources and modern European [[hermeticism]]. These books were:
* ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_rMC8PJzC3IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Futhark: A Handbook of Rune Magic]'' (1984)
* ''Runelore: A Handbook of Esoteric Runology'' (1987)
* ''At The Well of Wyrd'' (1988) which was later reprinted under the title ''Runecaster’s Handbook: The Well of Wyrd.''
* ''Northern Magic: Rune Mysteries and Shamanism'' (2002).

Runic divination is a component of Flowers' "esoteric runology" course offered to members of his Rune Gild, as detailed in ''The Nine Doors of Midgard: A Curriculum of Rune-Work.''
Besides runic divination, Flowers also advocated the "runic gymnastics" (''Runengymnastik'')  developed in the 1920s by  [[Friedrich Marby]], under the name of "Rune-Yoga" (also "Runic Yoga", "Stadhagaldr").&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephan Grundy===
In 1990, [[Stephan Grundy]], a.k.a. Kveldulf Gundarsson, described runic magic as the active principle as opposed to passive interpretations based on runic divination. He held that runic magic is more active than the allegedly [[shamanic]] practice of [[Seiðr|seid]] practiced by the [[Seiðkona]]. Runic magic, he states, uses the runes to affect the world outside based on the [[archetype]]s they represent.&lt;ref&gt;Gundarsson (1990), 27; 211; 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Gundarsson's runic magic entails being in possession of a physical entity that is engraved with any or all of the individual runes or "staves", so as to practically work with their energies. The individual runes are reddened with either blood, dyes, or paints. The act of possessing the stave in its final form serves the purpose of affecting the world of form with "the rune might" of that particular stave. After use, the staves are discarded or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Gundarsson (1990), 33; 34; 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gundarsson holds that each rune has a certain sound to it, to be chanted or sung; the sound has in common the phonetic value by which it is represented.&lt;ref&gt;Gundarsson (1990),  37-156.&lt;/ref&gt; This act of singing or chanting is supposed to have more or less the same effect of using the staves in their physical form.&lt;ref&gt;Gundarsson (1990), 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The '''sharawadji effect''', not to be confused with [[sharawadgi]], is a [[musical perception]] or phenomenon regarding [[timbre]] and [[Texture (music)|texture]] described by Claude Shryer as, "a sensation of plenitude sometimes created by the contemplation of a complex [[soundscape]] whose beauty is inexplicable."&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Ellen and Harley, James. "Open Ears Festival of Music and Sound." ''Computer Music Journal'' 23.1 (1999): 79-82. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that sharawadji is not a stimulus, but rather a reaction to a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Musicworks 1998 p. 22"&gt;{{cite book |title=Musicworks |publisher=Music Gallery |issue=nos. 70-72 |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMY4AQAAIAAJ |access-date=13 September 2018 |pages=22 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shryer also elaborated on searching for this, "state of awareness," by the means of, "one tend[ing] an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context."&lt;ref&gt;Ulvaeus, edited by [[David Rothenberg]] &amp; Marta (2009). ''The Book of Music and Nature: An Anthology of Sounds, Words, Thoughts'' (Second edition. ed.). Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press. pp. 125. {{ISBN|9780819569356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One striking example of this effect is the appreciation of the sound of rumbling [[thunder]]: those who are being directly exposed to the element would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment. Simply understood, "sharawadji sounds belong to everyday life, to a known musical style. They become sharawadji only through decontextualization, through a rupture of meaning."&lt;ref name="Augoyard" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Seventeenth-century European travelers originally coined the term as an aesthetic effect that, "comes about as a surprise and will carry you elsewhere, beyond strict representation — out of context." The term ''sharawadji'' was speculated to originate from China and was understood as, "the beauty that occurs with no discernible order or arrangement".&lt;ref name="Augoyard"&gt;Augoyard, Jean François et al., eds. ''Sonic Experience: A Guide to Everyday Sounds''. Montreal ; Ithaca: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2006. Print. [http://xenopraxis.net/readings/augoyard_sonicexperiencecomplete.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

"All of us are searching for that enveloping soundscape that takes us beyond to indescribable realms of beauty, what the Persian philosophers once called the ''sharawadji effect''&lt;!--italics original--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, David (2013).

[[File:Pursuivant tabard.jpg|thumb|upright|A 20th-century English [[herald of arms|herald]]'s tabard]]
A '''tabard''' is a type of short coat that was commonly worn by men during the [[late Middle Ages]] and [[early modern period]] in Europe. Generally worn outdoors, the coat was either sleeveless or had short sleeves or shoulder pieces. In its more developed form it was open at the sides, and it could be worn with or without a belt. Though most were ordinary garments, often workclothes, tabards might be emblazoned on the front and back with a [[heraldry|coat of arms]] ([[livery]]), and in this form they survive as the distinctive garment of [[Officer of Arms|officers of arms]].

In modern [[British English|British]] usage, the term has been revived for what is known in American English as a [[Apron#Tabard|cobbler apron]]: a lightweight open-sided upper overgarment, of similar design to its medieval and heraldic counterpart, worn in particular by workers in the catering, cleaning and healthcare industries as [[Personal protective equipment|protective clothing]], or outdoors by those requiring [[high-visibility clothing]].

==Middle Ages==
[[File:the waterseller walters.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Waterseller of Seville (Velázquez)|The Waterseller of Seville]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]], c.1620, depicting a functional workman's tabard]]
A tabard (from the French ''tabarde'') was originally a humble outer garment of tunic form, generally without sleeves, worn by peasants, monks and foot-soldiers. In this sense, the earliest citation recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from c.1300.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{OED|tabard, n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tabard was the [[inn sign]] of the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] in [[Southwark]], London, established in 1307 and remembered as the starting point for [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s pilgrims on their journey to [[Canterbury]] in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', dating from about the 1380s.

By the second half of the 15th century, tabards, now open at the sides and so usually belted, were also being worn by [[knight]]s in military contexts over their [[armour]], and were usually emblazoned with their arms (though sometimes worn plain). The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' first records this use of the word in English in 1450.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Tabards were apparently distinguished from [[surcoat]]s by being open-sided, and by being shorter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}  In its later form, a tabard normally comprised four textile panels – two large panels hanging down the wearer's front and back, and two smaller panels hanging over his arms as shoulder-pieces or open "sleeves" – each emblazoned with the same coat of arms. Tabards became an important means of battlefield identification with the development of plate armour as the use of shields declined. They are frequently represented on [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and [[monumental brass]]es of the late 15th and early 16th centuries.

A very expensive, but plain, garment described as a tabard is worn by [[Giovanni Arnolfini]] in the [[Arnolfini Portrait]] of 1434 ([[National Gallery, London]]). This may be made of [[silk]] and or [[velvet]], and is trimmed and fully lined with fur, possibly [[sable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools |first=Lorne |last=Campbell |place=London |publisher=National Gallery |series=National Gallery Catalogues |year=1998 |ISBN=185709171X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[The Queen's College]], [[Oxford]], the scholars on the foundation were called tabarders, from the tabard (not in this case an emblazoned garment) which they wore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7JZAAAAMAAJ|title=Slang and Its Analogues Past and Present: A Dictionary, Historical and Comparative, of the Heterodox Speech of All Classes of Society for More Than Three Hundred Years : with Synonyms in English, French, German, Italian, Etc|last=Farmer|first=John Stephen|date=|publisher=Unknown|year=1903|isbn=|location=|pages=54|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surviving garment similar to the medieval tabard is the monastic [[scapular]]. This is a wide strip of fabric worn front back of the body, with an opening for the head and no sleeves. It may have a hood, and may be worn under or over a belt.

==British heraldry==
[[File:Thomas Hawley Clarenceux King of Arms.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hawley]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], depicted in his tabard on a [[grant of arms]] of 1556]]
By the end of the 16th century, the tabard was particularly associated with officers of arms. The shift in emphasis was reported by [[John Stow]] in 1598, when he described a tabard as:

{{quote|a Jacquit, or sleevelesse coat, whole before, open on both sides, with a square collor, winged at the shoulders: a stately garment of olde time, commonly worne of Noble men and others, both at home and abroade in the Warres, but then (to witte in the warres) theyr Armes embrodered, or otherwise depicte uppon them, that every man by his Coate of Armes might bee knowne from others: but now these Tabardes are onely worne by the Heraults, and bee called their coates of Armes in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Stow |authorlink=John Stow |title=A Survay of London |location=London |year=1598 |page=338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the case of Royal officers of arms, the tabard is emblazoned with the coat of arms of the sovereign. [[Private Officer of Arms|Private officers of arms]], such as still exist in [[Scotland]], make use of tabards emblazoned with the coat of arms of the person who employs them. In the [[United Kingdom]] the different ranks of officers of arms can be distinguished by the fabric from which their tabards are made. The tabard of a [[King of Arms|king of arms]] is made of [[velvet]], the tabard of a [[herald|herald of arms]] of [[satin]], and that of a [[pursuivant|pursuivant of arms]] of damask [[silk]].&lt;ref name=Sigurdharson&gt;{{cite web|title=A Review of the Historical Regalia of Officers of Arms |url=http://heraldry.sca.org/heraldry/laurel/Heralds_wear.html|publisher=heraldry.sca.org|accessdate=8 June 2012|author=Eirìkr Mjoksiglandi Sigurdharson|date=December 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving English herald's tabard is that of Sir [[William Dugdale]] as [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms]] (1677–1686).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Marks |editor2-first=Ann |editor2-last=Payne |title=British Heraldry: from its origins to c.1800 |publisher=British Museum |place=London |year=1978 |page=51, plate }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at one time the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards "athwart", that is to say with the smaller ("shoulder") panels at the front and back, and the larger panels over the arms; but this practice was ended during the reign of [[James II of England|James II and VII]].&lt;ref name=Sigurdharson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=A. C. |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |editor-first=J. P. |editor-last=Brooke-Little |editor-link=John Brooke-Little |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |publisher=Nelson |place=London |year=1969 |pages=31–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian heraldry==
In the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] year of the [[Queen of Canada]], the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] unveiled a new tabard for the use of the [[Chief Herald of Canada]]. This new royal blue tabard, for exclusively Canadian use and of uniquely Canadian design, is a modern take on the traditional look. The tabard differs from others of more traditional design in that the [[Royal Arms of Canada|Canadian royal arms]] appear on the sleeves, while the front and back of the tabard are covered with Native Canadian-inspired emblematic representations of the raven-polar bears of the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]]'s [[coat of arms]].

'''Tour-realism''' (T.R.) is a new trend in [[alternative tourism]]. It differs from both [[mass tourism]] and "independent tourism", a type of tourism involving absolutely no mediators in the tour organization. 
 
T.R. operators usually represent the country they live and work in. T.R. operators are known for having advanced knowledge of the culture and history of their country, as well as for having tight and constant connections with local population. Because they are residents of the country, T.R. operators are capable of providing unique services for foreign guests.

== Characteristics ==
Tour-realism, as a tourism subgenre, tends to have certain defining characteristics. Tour-realism is generally done in small groups of 3-5 persons, usually family members or groups of friends. The approach is individualized (not reliant on standard itineraries) and focuses on high-quality offerings, with  flexible choice of apartments and [[excursions]] that depend on the demands and wishes of the client. Accommodations are most often private villas, cottages etc., with an emphasis on creating an ''authentic'' experience as befits the culture and locale, again dependent on the wishes of the client. "Extras" in terms of excursions and services are built-in to create a personalized, unique experience for the client, and outings will include both the well-known and the obscure.

'''Travel technology''' (also called '''tourism technology''', and '''hospitality automation''') is the application of [[Information Technology]] (IT) or [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT) in the [[travel]], [[tourism]] and [[hospitality industry]].  One form of travel technology is [[Tracking (commercial airline flight)|flight tracking]].

Since travel implies locomotion, travel technology was originally associated with the [[computer reservations system]] (CRS) of the airlines industry, but now is used more inclusively, incorporating the broader tourism sector as well as its subset the hospitality industry. While travel technology includes the computer reservations system, it also represents a much broader range of applications, in fact increasingly so.  Travel technology includes [[virtual tourism]] in the form of [[virtual tour]] technologies.  Travel technology may also be referred to as ''e-travel'' / ''etravel'' or ''e-tourism'' / ''etourism'' ([[eTourism]]), in reference to "electronic travel" or "electronic tourism".

e-Tourism can be defined as the analysis, design, implementation and application of IT and e-commerce solutions in the [http://www.skypointindia.com/how-to-start-an-online-travel-agency-india.html travel&amp;tourism industry]; as well as the analysis of the respective economic processes and market structures and [[customer relationship management]].

From a communication science perspective, eTourism can be also defined as every application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) within both the hospitality and tourism industry, as well as within the tourism experience.

Travel technology is increasingly being used to describe systems for managing and monitoring travel, including travel tracking and [[Tracking (commercial airline flight)|flight tracking]] systems.

In other contexts, the term "travel technology" can refer to technology intended for use by travelers, such as light-weight laptop computers with universal power supplies or satellite Internet connections. That is not the sense in which it is used here.

== Applications ==
Travel technology includes many processes such as [[dynamic packaging]] which provide useful new options for consumers.  Today the [[tour guide]] can be a GPS tour guide, and the [[guidebook]] could be an [[audioguide]], [[podguide]] or [[I-Tours]], such as [[City audio guides]].  The [[biometric passport]] may also be included as travel technology in the broad sense.

[[XML|XML-based]] technologies have become increasingly important for the travel industry. XML can be used to support air reservation booking or to implement optional services and merchandising functions in the booking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openaxisgroup.org/functions.html|title=Research Vacation Spots by category and city|author=|date=|website=www.openaxisgroup.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important application of XML is the establishing of direct connections between Airlines and Travel Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Michael, ''Value Creation in Travel Distribution'', 2010, {{ISBN|0557612462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to create a generally accepted XML-standard, the Open Axis Group was founded.

=== Internet ===
The Internet has a powerful impact on hospitality and tourism. For many businesses and locations, the experience starts long before a traveler arrives--it begins with the first visit to the website, when a person sees photos of the location and gets a sense of what to expect. In the hospitality and tourism business, effective use of Internet technologies can improve revenue. Websites, blogs, online advertising, social media, online ordering and information repositories all help convince customers to choose a location or business.
Reservations Systems

Booking engines to allow easy access by consumers and travel professionals; the systems enable individuals to make reservations and compare prices. Many, like Expedia and Orbitz, are available through online interfaces. Booking engines cut costs for travel businesses by reducing call volume and give the traveler more control over their purchasing process.

=== Computer Systems ===
Because many tourism businesses are large and dispersed, they use computer systems to stay connected. Computer systems allow communication between branches and locations which makes it easier to streamline reservations and cross-company policies. They are also used internally to keep all of the staff on the same page and make it easier to access information that can improve the guest experience: guest preferences, housekeeping information and reservation details can all be kept on a single system.

=== Mobile Communication ===
Many travelers take some form of mobile communication device with them on the road, whether it is a tablet computer or a mobile phone. To keep customers advised of changes many tourism and hospitality businesses use mobile communication; they send delay notices, offer deals and sponsor location-based advertising. Depending on the type of business the communication might happen through emails, text messaging or GPS tagging, for example.

=== Technology in Travel Agency ===
The continuing evolution of information technology has had a considerable impact on the travel agency service industry. The widespread public use of the Internet has created a number of conditions that have been game-changers -- in both beneficial and detrimental ways -- to the modern travel agency. As a result, many travel agencies in the 21st century have had to make considerable adaptations to remain solvent and relevant.

[[File:Ibaya Sensaburo - Tokaido gojusan tsui - Walters 95568.jpg|thumb|As a husband passes by the place where his pregnant wife was brutally murdered, her ghost appears and hands their child to him. She then tells him the story of her murder and assists him as he takes revenge for her death. [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] 1845]]
In [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], a  '''vengeful ghost''' or '''vengeful spirit''' is said to be the [[ghost|spirit]] of a dead person who returns from the [[afterlife]] to seek [[revenge]] for a cruel, unnatural or unjust [[death]]. In certain cultures where [[funeral]] and [[burial]] or [[cremation]] [[ceremonies]] are important, such vengeful spirits may also be considered as unhappy ghosts of individuals who have not been given a proper funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Cultural background==
The concept of a vengeful ghost seeking retribution for harm that it endured as a living person goes back to ancient times and is part of many cultures. According to such legends and beliefs, they roam the world of the living as restless spirits, seeking to have their grievances redressed, and may not be satisfied until they have succeeded in punishing either their murderers or their tormentors.&lt;ref name="Hogle2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerrold E. Hogle|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Modern Gothic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmRwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA216|date=4 December 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-19435-5|pages=216–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cultures vengeful ghosts are mostly female, said to be women that were unjustly treated during their lifetime. Such women or girls may have died in despair or the suffering they endured may have ended up in early death caused by the [[abuse|ill-treatment]] or [[torture]] they were subject to.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Whitehead (bishop)|Henry Whitehead]], ''The Village Gods of South India'', Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1988 (First ed. 1921), {{ISBN|978-8120601376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exorcism]]s and appeasement are among the religious and social customs practiced by various cultures in relation to the vengeful ghost. The northern [[Aché people]] group in [[Paraguay]] [[Cremation|cremated]] old people thought to harbor dangerous vengeful spirits instead of giving them a customary [[burial]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Clastres]], ''Chronique des indiens Guayaki. Ce que savent les Aché, chasseurs nomades du Paraguay.'' Plon. Paris, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where the person has been killed and the body disposed of unceremoniously, the [[cadaver]] may be [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and reburied according to the proper funerary rituals in order to appease the spirit. Others have been known to salt and burn their body, the place where they were killed or the instrument that they were killed with.
