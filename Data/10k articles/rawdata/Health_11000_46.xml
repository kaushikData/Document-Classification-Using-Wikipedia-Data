The '''1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan''' was a period of mass starvation and drought that took place in the [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar ASSR]] as a result of [[war communism]] policy,{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression|date=October 1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1jsgYCoRioC|last1=Werth|last2=Panné|last3=Paczkowski|last4=Bartosek|last5=Margolin|first1=Nicolas|first2=Jean-Louis|first3=Andrzej|first4=Karel|first5=Jean-Louis|author1-link=Nicolas Werth|author3-link=Andrzej Paczkowski|pages=92–97; 116–21|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|editor-last=Courtois|editor-first=Stéphane|editor-link=Stéphane Courtois|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which 500,000{{sfn|Dronin|Bellinger|2005|p=98}} to 2,000,000{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=281}} peasants died. The event was part of the greater [[Russian famine of 1921–22]] that affected other parts of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]],{{sfn|Millar|2004|p=56}} in which up 5,000,000 people died in total.{{sfn|Millar|2004|p=270}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2011/pr-famine-040411.html|title=How the U.S. saved a starving Soviet Russia: PBS film highlights Stanford scholar's research on the 1921-23 famine|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=4 April 2011|website=Stanford News Service|language=|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roman Serbyn]], a professor of Russian and East European history, the Tatarstan famine was the first man-made famine in the Soviet Union and systematically targeted ethnic minorities such as [[Volga Tatars]] and [[Volga Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serbyn|first1=Roman|title=The first man-made famine in Soviet Union 1921-1923|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1988/458814.shtml|website=The Ukrainian Weekly|accessdate=28 April 2017|date=6 November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Soviet leadership had long sought to suppress [[Tatar nationalism]] in the USSR. Tatars were frequently charged with "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" and other revisionist crimes. Tatar leadership was executed or imprisoned, which many fled the USSR to Turkey for refuge. Collectivization of Tatar agriculture began in 1921. According to historian James Minahan, [[Crimean Tatars]] in particular "suffered proportionally greater population losses than any other Soviet national group during the first decades of Soviet rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXejvEgKs9oC&amp;pg=PA164|title=The Former Soviet Union's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook|last=Minahan|first=James|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781576078235|location=|pages=164|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming methods in the Tatar ASSR were outdated, similar to most non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union. In addition, very few indigenous Tatar proletariat existed due to Russian imperial dominance.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=154}}

==Famine==
In early spring of 1921, the [[Cheka]] reported massive protests and riots among peasants. By 23 March, reports began to describe the developments in some kantons as a "famine" and documented peasants starving to death and committing suicide. In response to the lack of food, many peasants prevented grain trucks from leaving Tatarstan and some refused to sow their fields.{{sfn|Dronin|Bellinger|2005|p=98}} The famine also saw a large rise in the number of children submitted to orphanages, with poorer parents leaving their children in state institutions and some just abandoning them on the streets to fend for themselves. Orphanages could not keep up with demand, and the Tatar ASSR government devoted resources to expand the number of institutions available. For example, the [[Sviyazhsk]] [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of Tatarstan|kanton]] had two orphanages, which kept 64 children in July 1920. By, January 1922, this had expanded to 12 orphanages with 704 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fjodorova|first1=Natalia A.|last2=Khanipova|first2=Ilnara I.|title=Struggle Against Homelessness and Neglect in Tatar ASSR in 1920s – The First Half of 1940s|journal=Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences|date=November 2015|volume=6|issue=6 S2|page=476|doi=10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n6s2p475|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/viewFile/8120/7784|publisher=MCSER Publishing|location=Rome, Italy|issn=2039-2117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1922, some villages had lost half their population.{{sfn|Dronin|Bellinger|2005|p=100}} The famine also led to a sharp decline in the number of livestock and farming equipment as starving peasants sold off their property or slaughtered the draft animals for food.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=3}} KGB records from the time note the deaths of at least 500,000 people in Tatarstan,{{sfn|Dronin|Bellinger|2005|p=98}} but more recent estimates conclude the actual value was much higher at 2,000,000.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=281}} Historian James Long approximates that roughly 13% of the Tatar ASSR population fled to other parts of the country while another 10% died.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=2}} This famine is also known as "terror-famine" and "famine-genocide" in Tatarstan.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Relief==
In the summer of 1922, the special committee ''Tatpomgol'' was established to cope with the famine.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=176}} By August 1922, ''Tatpomgol'' imported 8 million [[pood]] (Russian pounds) of food, including 2 million pounds of seed, with a loan.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=184}} From the affected regions, hundreds of thousands of people, mostly children, were evacuated to [[Central Asia]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarus]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=206}} Emergency feeding points were established throughout the republic.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=230}} The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government invited international organizations, such as [[Workers International Relief]] to assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlRc3KqcDygC&amp;pg=PA176|title=American Communism and Soviet Russia|last=Draper|first=Theodore|date=1960|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=|isbn=9781412816915|location=|pages=176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government provided aid to starving Tatars in from 1920 to 1923 through the [[American Relief Administration]].{{sfn|Millar|2004|p=56}}

==Aftermath==
Though the most hard-hitting phase of the famine ended in 1922, shortages, starvation, and illness continued in the Volga region throughout 1923 and into 1924,{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=3}} and the Soviet government settled ethnic [[Russians]] into the Tatar ASSR and in [[Idel-Ural]] region in this time causing the Tatars' share of the population to eventually decline to less than 50%.{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=304}} 

In 2008, the [[All-Russian Tatar Social Center]] (VTOTs) asked the [[United Nations]] to condemn the 1921–22 Tatarstan famine as [[genocide]] of [[Muslim]] Tatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Tatar Nationalists Ask UN to condemn 1921 famine as genocide|last=Globe|first=Paul|date=6 November 2008|website=Homin Ukraini}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaudet|first=Didier|date=June 2009|title=When the Bear Confronts the Crescent: Russia and the Jihadist Issue|url=https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/105451/CEFQ200905.pdf|journal=The China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly|publisher=Central Asia-Caucasus Institute &amp; Silk Road Studies Program|volume=7|issue=2|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''ADDitude'' was founded by Ellen Kingsley (an Emmy-winning television journalist) in 1998 to serve the parents of America's 2-3 million schoolchildren&lt;ref&gt;Salynn Boyles, [http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/news/20070904/many-kids-with-adhd-arent-diagnosed Many Kids With ADHD Aren’t Diagnosed], WebMD, September 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with ADD and ADHD, as well as adults, with the disorder. Kingsley founded ADDitude as a web site a few years after her oldest son, Teddy, was diagnosed with severe ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wusa9.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=56553 Ellen Kingsley: Former Channel 9 Reporter Dies], WUSA9.com, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''ADDitude'' became a print magazine two years later.

Kingsley succumbed to breast cancer on March 8, 2007. In her honor, ''ADDitude'' magazine started the Ellen Kingsley Award for ADHD Advocacy the same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.additudemag.com/addnews/37/2127.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">In [[Irish mythology]], the goddess '''Airmed''' (also given as '''Airmid''') was one of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]].  With her father [[Dian Cecht]] and brother [[Miach]], she healed those injured in the Second Battle of [[Magh Tuiredh]].&lt;ref name="CMT"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/cmt/cmteng.htm Cath Maige Tuired] (The [[Cath Maige Tuireadh|Second Battle of Mag Tuired]]), trans.

After her jealous father slew her brother, Miach, Airmed wept over her brother's grave.

Once again, their father lashed out, and scattered the herbs. For this reason, no living human knows all the secrets of [[herbalism]]. Only Airmed remembers.&lt;ref name="CMT"/&gt;

Along with Dian Cecht, Ochtriullach, and Miach, Airmed was one of the enchanters whose incantation sung over the well of Sláine was able to resurrect the dead.&lt;ref name="CMT"/&gt;

==Education==
Alyce Faye McBride received her [[Bachelor's degree]] from [[Oklahoma State University]] in 1966. While at Oklahoma State, she served as "queen" of [[Oklahoma_State_University#Academic_buildings|Willard Hall]], before it was transformed from a women's [[dormitory]] into its current role as the site of the University's College of Education.

Alyce Faye Cleese is on the American Board of National Theatre for London and the Board of Shakespeare Society for New York.  She is a visiting senior tutor for Massachusetts General Hospital.

==Honors==
She was honored by [[Harvard University]] for her work in psychotherapy,&lt;ref name=HOF/&gt; and was inducted into the [[Oklahoma State University College of Education]] Hall of Fame in 2007.&lt;ref name=HOF/&gt;

==Marriage to John Cleese and divorce==
After divorcing Dave Eichelberger (with whom she had two sons), she met actor [[John Cleese]] in 1990 and they married in 1992. They divorced in 2008, though details of the divorce settlement only became public knowledge in August 2009.&lt;ref name="divorce settlement"/&gt; Faye was represented by [[Fiona Shackleton]], divorce lawyer for [[Prince Charles]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

The film director and restaurant critic [[Michael Winner]], who accompanied the couple on their honeymoon in 1992,&lt;ref name="divorce settlement"/&gt; once asked the comic actor what he would do differently if he could live his life again. Cleese responded: "I wouldn't have married Alyce Faye Eichelberger and I wouldn't have made ''[[Fierce Creatures]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winner "Restaurant review: [MW] at Villa Principe Leopoldo, Switzerland", ''The Sunday Times'', 6 July 2008. Retrieved on 2008-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt; After the divorce was finalised financially, with Eichelberger receiving £12 million in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years, Cleese said, "What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine. ... I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship—such as children, or a conversation."&lt;ref name="divorce settlement"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/6043628/John-Cleese-in-12-million-divorce-settlement.html | title=John Cleese in £12 million divorce settlement | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=18 Aug 2009 | accessdate=May 21, 2016 | author=[[Andrew Pierce]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/6257906/John-Cleese-divorce-tour-the-first-review.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=John Cleese divorce tour: the first review | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | date=2009-10-03 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Scientific forum organizes Student Scientific Society and Council of Young Scientists of Bukovinian State Medical University supported by the Rector, Professor [[Taras Mykolayovych Boychuk|T.M.Boychuk]] and the University Scientific Department led by professor O.I.Ivashchuk.

Since 2003 our Conference has passed a long way from the usual annual forum for students and young scientists of the University to the All-Ukrainian scientific students’ conference with international participation and since 2004 has acquired the international status. In 2009 the Conference for the first time was included in the Register of scientific congresses, symposia and scientific conferences approved by the Ministry of Public Health and National Academy of Medical Sciences in Ukraine.

For ten years not only geography of scientific forum expanded, but its subjects too: from a medical conference it grew in medical and pharmaceutical. The IX International Medical and Pharmaceutical Conference of students and young scientists «New Technologies in Medicine» was attended by 545 participants, including 370 young scientists of [[Bukovinian State Medical University|BSMU]], 153 - out of medical schools, colleges, medical institutions from [[Vinnytsia]], [[Dnipro]], [[Donetsk]], [[Zaporizhia]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Kropyvnytskyi]], [[Kiev]], [[Lugansk]], [[Lutsk]], [[Lviv]], [[Poltava]], [[Odessa]], [[Simferopol]], [[Sumy]], [[Ternopil]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Khmelnitsky]], [[Cherkassy]], Chertkov, and  participants from [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[Transnistrian Moldovan Republic]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Poland]] and [[Czech Republic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2024">The '''Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale''' ('''BSDS''') is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] [[rating scale]] for [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Psychiatric Times |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/clinical-scales-bsds/bipolar-spectrum-diagnostic-scale-bsds |title=Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale (BSDS) |date=11 April 2013 |publisher=UBM Medica, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Ronald Pies]], and was later refined and tested by  [[Nassir Ghaemi|S. Nassir Ghaemi]] and colleagues. The BSDS arose from Pies's experience as a psychopharmacology consultant, where he was frequently called on to manage cases of "[[treatment-resistant depression]]".

Their English version of the scale consists of 19 question items and two sections. It differs from most scales in that it does not list separate items, but rather presents a short paragraph talking about experiences that people with bipolar spectrum disorders often have. The person checks off which phrases or experiences fit them. 

The scale was validated in its original version and demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity, meaning that most people with confirmed bipolar diagnoses scored high on the BSDS.&lt;ref name="pmid15708426"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nassir Ghaemi |first1=S |last2=Miller |first2=CJ |last3=Berv |first3=DA |last4=Klugman |first4=J |last5=Rosenquist |first5=KJ |last6=Pies |first6=RW |title=Sensitivity and specificity of a new bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=84 |issue=2-3 |pages=273–7 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15708426 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(03)00196-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSDS may do better than other scales at detecting types of bipolar disorder that do not involve a full manic episode, such as bipolar II or cyclothymic disorder.

The '''British Pharmacological Society''' is the primary UK learned society for [[Pharmacology|pharmacologists]] concerned with research into drugs and the way they work. Members work in academia, industry, regulatory agencies and the health services, and many are medically qualified. The Society covers the whole spectrum of pharmacology, including laboratory, clinical, and toxicological aspects.

Clinical pharmacology is the medical speciality dedicated to promoting safe and effective use of medicines for patient benefit. [[Clinical pharmacology|Clinical pharmacologists]] work as consultants in the [[National Health Service]] and many hold prominent positions in UK universities.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1931, in Oxford, by a group of about 20 pharmacologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W.F.|title=An early history of the British Pharmacological Society|date=1981|publisher=British Pharmacological Society|location=[Nottingham]|isbn=0950887706}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were brought together on the initiative of Professor J.A. Gunn, by a letter signed by Gunn, H.H. Dale, and W.E. Dixon and sent to the heads of departments for teaching pharmacology and of institutions for pharmacological research in Great Britain, with proposals for the formation of a pharmacological club. There were favorable replies to this letter, and most of the recipients met in [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]] on the evening of 3 July 1931, the day before the meeting of the Physiological Society. Gunn presided over the meeting. It was agreed that a Society should be founded to meet at least once a year for the reading of papers on pharmacological subjects and the discussion of questions of teaching and publications and to promote friendly relations between pharmacologists.&lt;ref name="British Pharmacological Society History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bps.ac.uk/aboutbps/ | title=About the BPS | author=British Pharmacological Society | date= | publisher=British Pharmacological Society | accessdate=2006-02-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223005024/http://www.bps.ac.uk/aboutbps/ | archivedate=2005-12-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Pharmacological Society An Early History of the British Pharmacologicals Society"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bps.ac.uk/SpringboardWebApp/userfiles/bps/file/AboutBPS/reducedEarly%20History%20of%20the%20BPS.pdf | title=An Early History of the British Pharmacological Society | author=British Pharmacological Society | date= | publisher=British Pharmacological Society | accessdate=2006-02-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212314/http://www.bps.ac.uk/SpringboardWebApp/userfiles/bps/file/AboutBPS/reducedEarly%20History%20of%20the%20BPS.pdf | archivedate=2014-03-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female member of the society was Mary Pickford (1935), and other early, eminent women include [[Marthe Vogt]] and [[Edith Bülbring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=AR|title=A brief history of British Pharmacological Society meetings|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|date=Mar 2006|volume=27|issue=3|pages=177–81|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2006.01.001|pmid=16458980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disabled Access Day''' is a biannual event in the United Kingdom that celebrates [[accessibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracey|first1=Emma|title=What are you doing on Disabled Access Day?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-30854173|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disabled Access Day campaign announces 2015 launch date|url=https://www.euansguide.com/news/disabled-access-day-campaign/|website=Euan's Guide|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first event was held on Saturday, January 17, 2015 and over 200 organisations took part across the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First ever Disabled Access Day launched|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/first-ever-disabled-access-day-launched.1421506522|website=Herald Scotland|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = More than 200 companies and venues give support to Disabled Access Day|url = http://www.homecare.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1567150/more-than-200-companies-and-venues-give-support-to-disabled-access-day|website = www.homecare.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next Disabled Access Day will be on the 16th March, 2019.
== History ==
Disabled Access Day came about after Paul Ralph, a powerchair user and [[Euan's Guide]] supporter, went to a ‘try it out day’ at his local bus company:

{{Quotation|“Prior to this, I had not used the bus network in my hometown because I was unsure how the ramp operated, how ticketing worked and if my powerchair would fit. I attended a demonstration organised by the local bus company with the opportunity to explore a stationary bus. Extra staff were on hand to explain the process of getting on and off safely. There was ample time to become more familiar with the layout of the bus and with what you need to know as a wheelchair using passenger. I’m now a frequent bus user.

Chatting with friends, I thought how great it would be if there were similar initiatives, including some more informal events, happening across the country on one specific day. The idea of encouraging disabled people to also try something new that day appeared and out of it came the idea of Disabled Access Day.”
|Paul Ralph||}}

In 2015, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster parliament]] passed a motion in support of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2014-15/700|title=Disabled Access Day|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion highlighted that several major attractions such as [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[St Paul’s Cathedral]] had signed up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2015/01/disabled-access-day-encourages-people-to-visit-somewhere-new.php|title=Disabled Access Day Encourages People To Visit Somewhere New|website=Londonist|last1=Laura|first1=Reynolds|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The first event was supported by over 200 museums, galleries, attractions and businesses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homecare.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1567150/more-than-200-companies-and-venues-give-support-to-disabled-access-day|title=More than 200 companies and venues give support to Disabled Access Day|website=www.homecare.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the first event, the second event more than quadrupled in size and was held on March 12, 2016 and the third Disabled Access Day was an extended weekend of activities during 10–12 March 2017. The event became biannual after 2017.

== Sponsorship ==
Disabled Access Day is sponsored by [[Euan's Guide]], the disabled access review website. Euan's Guide was founded by [[Euan MacDonald]], a powerchair user, and his sister Kiki. Information about accessibility for all places that hold events on Disabled Access Day can be found on the Euan's Guide website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disabled Access Day 2016 – save the date!|url = http://posabilitymagazine.co.uk/disabled-access-day-2016-save-the-date/|website = PosAbility Magazine {{!}} Disability Magazine|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major sponsors of the event include [[Barclays|Barclays plc]] and [[Sandcastle_Water_Park_(Blackpool)|Sandcastle Water Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">The '''drug policy of the [[Soviet Union]]''' changed little throughout the existence of the state, other than slowly becoming more repressive, although some differences in penalties existed in the different Union Republics. Policies were focused on [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] and criminalisation, rather than more liberal policies such as [[harm reduction]] and the rehabilitation of users and addicts.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

==Regulation==
Legislation against drugs first appeared in post-revolutionary Russia, in Article 104-d of the 1922 Penal Code of the [[RSFSR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk-toc-e.html |title=Criminal Code of the RSFSR (1934), Table of Contents |publisher=Cyberussr.com |date=1934-10-01 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; criminalising drug production, [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]], and possession with intent to traffic. The [[1924 Soviet Constitution]] expanded this legislation to cover the whole Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} http://constitution.garant.ru/history/ussr-rsfsr/1924/&lt;/ref&gt; The 1926 Penal Code of the RSFSR suggested imprisonment or corrective labour for between one and three years as punishment for these offences, depending on the scale of the offence committed. It is noteworthy that drug possession without intention to traffic and the personal use of drugs warranted no penalties at this time.

Drug regulation remained largely untouched in the Soviet Union until 1974, when the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] issued a Decree entitled 'On Reinforcement of the Fight Against Drug Addiction'. This Decree was reproduced in Article 224 of the Penal Codes of all the Republics of the USSR, and not only increased the penalties for the offences mentioned above to between ten and fifteen years' imprisonment, but for the first time criminalised possession of drugs without intent to traffic, bringing a penalty of up to three years in prison. Additional offences of 'seducing another person to narcotic drugs', punishable by up to five years' imprisonment, and the theft of narcotics, punishable by between five and fifteen years' imprisonment, were also created. The term 'narcotics' used here referred to all drugs listed by UN Conventions, not just [[opiates]].

A further decree issued in 1987 made a conviction for the above offences within a year of an earlier conviction for the same violation of the law liable to punishment of up to two years' imprisonment or corrective labor. Sergei Lebedev, the Chairman of the Association of Independent Advocates in Leningrad at the time, argued that the steady escalation of criminal penalties for drug use was "indicative of the Soviet authorities’ resignation to their complete inability to solve drug problems in a constructive and humane way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/923108.html |title=Drug Policy in the USSR |publisher=Drugtext.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610131643/http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/923108.html |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment was performed in various different ways depending on the substance the patient was addicted to. A physician would usually administer their drug of choice in small doses for maintenance. This was done to prevent the patient from experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

[[File:Logo ePORTUGUE Se final.png|thumb|The ePORTUGUÊSe logo]]
The ePORTUGUÊSe network&lt;ref name="eportuguese"&gt;ePORTUGUÊSe website http://www.who.int/eportuguese/en/&lt;/ref&gt; is a platform developed by the [[World Health Organization| World Health Organization (WHO)]] to strengthen collaboration among [[Portuguese-speaking countries]] in the areas of health information and capacity building of Human Resources for Health, therefore enhancing health information systems in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ungerer|first=Regina|title=Redes interconectadas: Gestion del conocimiento- Ejemplo de tres redes|year=2011|location=Brasília|isbn=978-85-7967-067-1|pages=51–69|url=http://10.134.1.5:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1040/1040.pdf?sequence=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ethnologue]], Portuguese is the sixth most spoken language in the world and there are more than 300 million speakers distributed through eight countries ([[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]], [[Portugal]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], and [[Timor-Leste]]) in four WHO Regional Offices ([http://www.afro.who.int/ AFRO ], [http://www.paho.org PAHO-AMRO ], [http://www.euro.who.int/en/home EURO] and [http://www.searo.who.int/en SEARO ]).
Portuguese is also the third most spoken language in the Western hemisphere and the most widely spoken in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition, Dallas, Tex.: SIL International, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, ePORTUGUÊSe received a recognition award for its contribution to the South-South and Triangular collaboration at the UN High Level and Directors General Meeting during the Global Development EXPO 2012 held in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref name="eportuguese"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Portuguese Speaking Countries- Program ePORTUGUESe WHO.jpg|thumbnail|right|Portuguese-speaking countries]]
* The ePORTUGUÊSe network was established in 2005, after the Ministerial Summit on Health Research held in [[Mexico City]] in November 2004. At this event, topics such as digital inclusion and the know-do gap were debated and [[WHO]] made a pledge to create health information networks in various languages as a way to contribute to the discussed challenge,.&lt;ref name=eportuguese /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministerial Summit on Health Research|url=http://www.who.int/rpc/summit/en/index4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2005 the ePORTUGUÊSe network was established, with the mission to develop a Portuguese health information network and strengthen the cooperation and knowledge exchange between the eight [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] speaking countries and WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ePORTUGUÊSe network goals|url=http://www.who.int/eportuguese/mission/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since its establishment, the ePORTUGUÊSe network&lt;ref name=eportuguese /&gt;  has been working as a facilitator by establishing alliances with health institutions from different countries. Its main purpose is to disseminate and distribute information in Portuguese, thereby reducing existing language barriers. By using diverse [[media (communication)|media]] resources,  ePORTUGUÊSe facilitates the access to relevant and up-to-date information that contribute to the work of [[health professionals]] in [[rural]] and distant areas can be facilitated.
* [[Brazil]] is now one of the main partners in south-south cooperation. Working together with [[Portugal]], it has developed the Health Cooperation Strategic Plan (PECS/CPLC) for the eight Portuguese speaking countries ([[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|CPLC]]), signed by the health ministers of those countries in an official ceremony in [[Estoril]], Portugal, in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community of Portuguese Language Countries|url=http://www.cplp.org/id-1787.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2010, [[WHO]] and [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|CPLC]] signed a cooperation agreement highlighting the commitment to use the ePORTUGUÊSe network,&lt;ref name=eportuguese /&gt; to encourage training and the strengthening of [[Health Information Systems Programme|health information systems]], particularly in [[underdeveloped countries]].
* The ePORTUGUÊSe network&lt;ref name=eportuguese /&gt;  provides support to Portuguese-speaking countries so that they can reach their [[Millennium Development Goals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4240">'''Electroejaculation''' is a procedure used to [[semen collection|obtain semen samples]] from sexually mature [[male mammals]]. The procedure is used for breeding programs and research purposes in various species, as well as in the treatment of an ejaculatory dysfunction in human males.

In humans, electroejaculation is usually carried out under a [[general anesthetic]].&lt;ref name="Aziz "&gt;{{cite book | last=Aziz | first=N. | last2=Agarwal | first2=A. | title=The Diagnosis and Treatment of Male Infertility: A Case-Based Guide for Clinicians | publisher=Springer International Publishing | year=2017 | isbn=978-3-319-56547-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1coDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA233 | access-date=2017-07-27 | page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electric probe is inserted into the [[rectum]] adjacent to the [[prostate gland]]. The probe delivers an AC voltage, usually 12–24 volts sine wave at a frequency of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a current limited to usually 500&amp;nbsp;mA, although some devices can generate currents of up to 1&amp;nbsp;A. The probe is activated for 1–2 seconds, referred to as a stimulus cycle. Ejaculation usually occurs after 2–3 stimulus cycles. Care must be taken when using currents greater than 500&amp;nbsp;mA, as tissue burns may result due to heating of the probe.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.beltroninst.com/ac1manual.pdf|title=Beltron Instruments AC-1 Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the [[pelvic muscles]] and [[ejaculation]]. This procedure is used frequently with large mammals, particularly [[Frozen bovine semen#How semen is collected|bulls]] and some domestic animals, as well as humans who have certain types of [[anejaculation]].  Electroejaculation has also been used for [[cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] where one would collect semen and stored in low temperatures with the intent of conserving genetic material and future revival.

In the practice of [[veterinary medicine]] and [[animal science]], it is common to collect semen from domestic [[ruminant]]s using electro-ejaculation without sedation or anesthesia. Only in [[goat]]s is mild sedation sometimes used. Because of the significant skeletal muscle contractions it causes, electroejaculation is not used in stallions — except in rare cases, under general anesthesia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42573">'''Employment and Support Allowance''' ('''ESA''') is a United Kingdom welfare payment for adults younger than the State Pension age who are having difficulty finding work because of their long-term medical condition or a disability. It is a basic income-replacement benefit paid in lieu of wages.

ESA superseded three older benefits: [[Incapacity Benefit]]; [[Income Support]] paid because of an illness or disability; and [[Severe Disablement Allowance]]. [[New Labour]] legislated for ESA at the very end of the Blair era and it became the main out-of-work sickness benefit for new claims during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]]. The [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] was quick to extend its scope: ministers gave the go-ahead for a compulsory reassessment of all long-term recipients of ESA’s predecessors and the transfer of those confirmed as unfit for work onto ESA.

One key feature of ESA is "conditionality": some recipients must take part in "work-related activity" in exchange for their payments. A second key feature is that recipients are liable to be repeatedly probed by a government-approved nurse about their state of health — a reflection of a policy belief that most conditions will improve over time, either spontaneously or as a result of medical intervention.

ESA is received by more than two million people. It has not achieved its aim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4641588.stm |title=Hutton unveils benefits shake-up |publisher=BBC News |date=24 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909145730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4641588.stm |archivedate=9 September 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — despite tougher eligibility criteria, "conditionality", and multiple medicals for established recipients — of reducing the sickness benefit caseload by one million by 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC|date=13 October 2016|title=Welfare reforms not made expected savings, says OBR|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37648864|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110050026/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37648864|archivedate=10 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Coalition’s long-serving Welfare Secretary, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], eventually concluded that ESA was “fundamentally flawed”. One of his successors, [[Damian Green]], added that it was “pointless” to repeatedly assess people with permanent disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37528568|title=Damian Green on ESA|date=1 October 2016|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004120121/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37528568|archivedate=4 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the government published a Green Paper envisaging an overhaul of ESA - no specific action has been taken as a result.

In 2018, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) began to repay money to ESA recipients who had been inaccurately reassessed, in circumstances where the recipients had been required to stop claiming their old benefit - usually Incapacity Benefit - and make a completely new claim for ESA. The department's approved health professionals had [[Criticism of the Work Capability Assessment|controversially]] reassessed these claimants' long-term disability against the DWP's new medical criteria, but the DWP itself had not tried to reassess their financial situation: evidence of any deterioration was not sought by the department, so none was taken into account when calculating what type of ESA was appropriate, and the rate of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=BBC|date=17 October 2018|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45892109|title=Benefits errors trigger £5000 refunds for ESA claimants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government plans to stop all ESA payments by 2023, if and when [[Universal Credit]] is fully rolled out.

==Who can claim?==
An individual can put in a claim for ESA if they satisfy all of these conditions:
* They live in the United Kingdom
* They are over the age of sixteen
* They have not reached their State Pension age
* They have a sick-note from their doctor

They will not be paid ESA if they are entitled to [[Statutory sick pay|Statutory Sick Pay]] (this usually means "if they have a job", but there are exceptions) and it is not possible to receive ESA at the same time as the other main out-of-work benefits, i.e. [[Jobseekers Allowance]], received by 440,000 people, or Income Support (given nowadays to 560,000 people, mainly lone parents). 

[[Universal Credit]], which is received by one million people nationally, can contain a component analogous to ESA.

==The scale of the allowance==
No money is paid for the first week. After that, the basic allowance is paid to the claimant until their [[Work Capability Assessment]] (WCA) at - in theory - week 13, after which a successful claimant might receive an enhanced level of payment (depending on the level of disability and whether they enter the work-related activity group or the support group after their assessment).

|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Only one of these components is payable per claim
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In April 2017, the work-related activity component was abolished for new claimants, even if they had ‘passed’ their WCA and been put in the work-related activity group; the same applies to successful reclaims, if more than a certain time has elapsed since the last period of receipt of ESA (long-term successful claimants who had a WCA before April 2017 continue to receive it). People receiving the support component are unaffected.

An enhanced disability premium of £15.90 a week may be paid to single people receiving the support component of income-related ESA; for a couple, the rate is £22.85 where one or both partners qualify.

In some circumstances, an additional severe disability premium of £62.45 a week may be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESA: what you'll get|publisher=gov.uk|url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202223227/https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get|archivedate=2016-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ESA==
ESA can be either ''contributory'' or ''income-related''.  If claimants have paid enough [[National Insurance]] they can claim contributory ESA for up to one year if they get the ''work-related activity component'', or indefinitely if they get the ''support component''. Income-related ESA is for people who have not paid enough National Insurance and is subject to a [[means test]] and certain other conditions (although the amount paid as contributions-based ESA can also be affected by financial circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/overview |title=Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2015-08-24 |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906030426/https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/overview |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Income-related ESA is not time-limited&lt;ref name=CAB&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment and Support Allowance|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/benefits_e/benefits_sick_or_disabled_people_and_carers_ew/employment_and_support_allowance.htm|publisher=Citizens Advice Bureau|accessdate=27 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312160318/http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/benefits_e/benefits_sick_or_disabled_people_and_carers_ew/employment_and_support_allowance.htm|archivedate=12 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not usually subject to Income Tax, but contribution-based ESA is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageuk.org.uk/money-matters/claiming-benefits/employment-support-allowance/what-is-employment-and-support-allowance/ |title=What is Employment and Support Allowance &amp;#124; Claiming benefits &amp;#124; Money matters |publisher=Age UK |date=2015-05-22 |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915073036/http://www.ageuk.org.uk/money-matters/claiming-benefits/employment-support-allowance/what-is-employment-and-support-allowance/ |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a spouse or partner is also receiving out-of-work benefits, this might affect entitlement.

Universal Credit is incorporating income-related ESA in stages. In the parts of the UK where it already has, contribution-based ESA has been rebadged as "new-style ESA".

==The claim process in detail==
Someone wanting to claim ESA will need a medical certificate, i.e. a sick-note, signed by their GP to say that they are not fully fit for work. The new claimant must then contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), usually by phone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/how-to-claim |title=Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2015-08-24 |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907154621/https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/how-to-claim |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who will log their claim and usually post them an ESA50 questionnaire to complete (except in rare circumstances where a full assessment is not required, such as when a doctor has officially certified the claimant as being likely to die within six months).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capability-for-work-questionnaire |title=Capability for work questionnaire - Publications |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821005636/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capability-for-work-questionnaire |archivedate=2015-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed form must then be sent in the envelope provided to the Health Assessment Advisory Service - the trading name of the assessment provider, Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capability for work questionnaire|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421191/esa-50-capability-for-work-questionnaire.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112214307/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421191/esa-50-capability-for-work-questionnaire.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a person has submitted a claim for ESA, they will normally be paid "assessment rate" ESA at the basic rate given above. At some point in this "assessment phase" a [[Work Capability Assessment]] will normally be carried out to determine whether the claimant: a) meets the criteria for receiving ESA long-term, or b) does not, in fact, qualify for ESA at all.

First, the ESA50 form, together with any other information sent with it by the claimant, will be read by a qualified healthcare professional, who will then decide on whether a face-to-face medical assessment is actually necessary: some people with severe disabilities can be granted ESA based solely on the documents supplied, if that is clear from the paperwork. For this reason, Maximus encourages new claimants to send as much relevant information as possible and give a detailed description of their disability when filling in the claim form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chdauk.co.uk/employment-and-support-allowance-esa |title=Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) &amp;#124; Health Assessment Advisory Service |publisher=Chdauk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918045856/https://www.chdauk.co.uk/employment-and-support-allowance-esa |archivedate=2016-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the DWP says it tries to make the claims process as straightforward as possible, the process of claiming can nevertheless be stressful for claimants (see [[Criticism of the Work Capability Assessment]]).  Many complain that their mental health deteriorated as a result of claiming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/27/inquiry-into-disability-benefits-deluged-by-tales-of-despair Inquiry into disability benefits 'deluged' by tales of despair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127112603/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/27/inquiry-into-disability-benefits-deluged-by-tales-of-despair |date=2017-11-27 }} ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing capability for work===

The [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP) contracted [[Atos]] to perform the core medical assessment, the Work Capability Assessment (WCA), when it introduced ESA. Maximus took over the contract - worth £170million a year to the US firm - from Atos in March 2015.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31590017 |title=Work capability assessments: One million disability checks planned - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827080419/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31590017 |archivedate=2015-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WCA's performance in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was reviewed by Professor Malcolm Harrington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington review 2010|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70071/wca-review-2010.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520080446/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70071/wca-review-2010.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington review 2011|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70102/wca-review-2011.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826005628/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70102/wca-review-2011.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington review 2012|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70123/wca-review-2012.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306215039/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70123/wca-review-2012.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 and 2014 by Dr [[Paul Litchfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Litchfield review 2013|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265351/work-capability-assessment-year-4-paul-litchfield.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826005631/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265351/work-capability-assessment-year-4-paul-litchfield.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Litchfield review 2014|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/380027/wca-fifth-independent-review.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110081227/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/380027/wca-fifth-independent-review.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assessment is often described as consisting of two separate assessments. In practice, if they have a face-to-face assessment, an individual claimant will experience only one assessment on the day (the decision-making is done afterwards). The two stages are:

* The "limited capability for work" assessment, which determines whether the claimant is entitled to ESA at all.
* The "limited capability for work-related activity" assessment, which tells the DWP whether somebody who has passed the first stage of the test is able to take part in "work-related activity". It also influences the rate of ESA paid to the claimant.
 
A DWP official makes the final decision on entitlement, based on all the available evidence.
====ESA terminology====
ESA is often loosely but inaccurately described as being for people who are "unfit for work", while the official term "limited capability for work" is not clear in its meaning. In fact, people on ESA can and do take suitable jobs when the opportunity arises, without their impairment necessarily having improved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2917434/Judas-Left-s-rage-benefits-activist-joins-75k-m-Anti-cuts-firebrand-s-job-disability-tests-firm.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Judas! Left's rage as benefits activist joins 'other side' for £75k | date=19 January 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722210426/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2917434/Judas-Left-s-rage-benefits-activist-joins-75k-m-Anti-cuts-firebrand-s-job-disability-tests-firm.html | archivedate=22 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; - on paper, relatively few people receiving ESA are incapable of any work whatsoever.

There are two groups of successful ESA claimants: the '''Work-Related Activity Group''' and the '''Support Group'''. People in the Support Group tend to have the more severe impairments, they are classed as having both "limited capability for work" and “limited capability for work-related activity” and they are not required to prepare for work. The Work-Related Activity Group contains people who also have "limited capability for work" but who do not have “limited capability for work-related activity”; they ''are'' required to participate in pre-employment coaching because they are considered by the DWP to be ''likely'' to work ''in the future'' - specifically, within two years.

====Limited capability for work====
At their WCA, an ESA claimant ''must'' be found to have "limited capability for work" in order to qualify at all. The testing process gauges the claimant’s ability to perform up to 17 activities; these activities are set out on the ESA claim form. For each activity, a claimant can score 15, 9, 6 or 0 points: the more severe their disability, the more points they will score. Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order to be entitled to ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total.

Other factors, such as some aspects of pregnancy, are also considered by the assessor, who will be a nurse, doctor, occupational therapist or physiotherapist; these factors do not operate on a points system but ''might'' nevertheless qualify the claimant for ESA.

====Limited capability for work-related activity====
This is, in theory, about whether a successful claimant of ESA is capable of taking part in interviews and pre-employment training, or whether their ability to do so is limited to a significant degree. As far as the way the WCA actually operates is concerned, this is about whether the claimant has one or more severe disabilities, affecting mobilising, manual dexterity, etc.

Success at this stage usually qualifies the claimant for the Support Group.

==Development of ESA==

===New Labour 1997–2001===

In May 1997, [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] was made Minister for Welfare Reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Field|publisher=Parliament.uk|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/frank-field/478|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607120725/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/frank-field/478|archivedate=2016-06-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He approved of the principle of self-help through mutual organisations such as [[friendly societies]], he thought the state should have only a small role to play in the provision of welfare, and he disliked means-testing and non-contributory entitlement. These ideas were out of step with those of the new Chancellor, [[Gordon Brown]], in particular, and Field's ministerial tenure was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2 July 2006|publisher=The Guardian|title=Frank Field: still thinking the unthinkable|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jul/02/publicservices.theobserver|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018165310/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jul/02/publicservices.theobserver|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Green Paper published in 1998 foreshadowed New Labour's approach to out-of-work benefit reform from that point on: being in work was vital and the government would encourage people on benefits to find jobs, using the carrot and the stick; the claimant's contribution would be to try to find work; and Incapacity Benefit would be partially means-tested, with people receiving an occupational pension incurring a deduction in the amount of Incapacity Benefit they would receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5553/1/Thatcherism_New_Labour_and_the_Welfare_State.pdf|title=Thatcherism, New Labour and the Welfare State|format=pdf|author=John Hills|date=August 1998|publisher=Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion: London School of Economics|accessdate=9 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226075526/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5553/1/Thatcherism_New_Labour_and_the_Welfare_State.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Labour 2001–2005===
In 2001, on the first full day of New Labour's second term in office, the [[Department of Social Security]] was amalgamated with the [[Department for Employment]] to form the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP). The new department set to work overhauling the eligibility test for sickness benefits and vastly expanding its scope.

====Replacing Incapacity Benefit====
A new benefit was envisaged that would "accentuate the positive" rather than lead recipients with moderate disabilities to feel that they were permanently incapacitated. However, policymakers acknowledged that some people really ''were'' incapable of all work so they needed a new medical test, one that would do more than just give a "yes or no" answer to the question of sickness benefit entitlement. The new test would need to do ''three'' things:

# Identify claimants who were already capable of work - they would get no sickness benefit at all
# Identify claimants at the other end of the disability spectrum, who were very disabled and could not be expected to work
# Identify claimants in the middle, who could be helped to find a job despite their disability

The belief in the DWP was that the new approach would not just ''cap'' the total number of people on sickness benefits, as Incapacity Benefit was supposed to have done, but ''actively reduce it'' to a small group of people with severe disabilities and another modestly-sized group who were undergoing fixed-term pre-employment training.

The new policy was expected to achieve its objective in four ways:
# The new benefit would be harder to get in the first place, because its eligibility test would be tougher
# All new recipients would be reassessed at appropriate intervals in the expectation that the health of many would improve
# Successful claimants with mid-range disabilities would be expected to prepare for a return to suitable work
# Once the new testing process had bedded in, there would be a mammoth re-evaluation of the claims of as many as two million long-term Incapacity Benefit recipients, in the belief that many were actually able to work

====The background trend====
While the new sickness benefit was still at the planning stage, the total caseload peaked in 2004. Since then, the background trend has been gradually ''downwards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-savings-and-incapacity-benefits#.VdWj8OtH3x4|title=Welfare savings and incapacity benefits|work=niesr.ac.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913175259/http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-savings-and-incapacity-benefits#.VdWj8OtH3x4|archivedate=13 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reason for this change in trajectory was demographic: in particular, World War Two "baby boomers" on sickness benefits had begun to draw their State Pension instead. Other specific reasons were: men suffering from industrial diseases, such as [[asbestosis]] and [[silicosis]], caused by working in mines, shipyards and other hazardous environments, were dying prematurely; eligibility criteria had become stricter since 1995; and the economy had improved and was creating more jobs.

===="Thinking the unthinkable"====
In February 2005, as another general election loomed, the BBC analysed New Labour's record on welfare reform:
{{quote| Thinking the unthinkable on the welfare state has been one of the New Labour mantras since before the party was elected in 1997. So it has been a disappointment to many [...] on the Labour benches that, eight years later, the thinking has still to produce any concrete results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2 February 2005|title=Blair thinks the unthinkable?|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4228645.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the same day, the Welfare Secretary [[Alan Johnson]] announced plans to replace Incapacity Benefit with two new benefits: "Disability and Sickness Allowance", for people deemed too ill to work; and "Rehabilitation Support Allowance", paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Allowance to less disabled people, who would be "supported" by the DWP back into work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2 February 2005|publisher=BBC News|title=Incapacity Benefit to be replaced|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227991.stm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202134224/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227991.stm|archivedate=2 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, no benefits with these names ever materialised, and the policy behind "Rehabilitation Support Allowance" was still being debated more than a decade later.

====Atos gets the contract====
In March 2005, there was a sign of action on the ground: [[Atos]] was awarded the contract to work with the DWP to build the software programme that would be used in the assessment of claims for the allowance that would take the place of Incapacity Benefit. The firm, which was already carrying out the DWP's existing disability assessments, would employ hundreds more healthcare professionals to carry out the new test once it went live - in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=18 March 2005|title=DWP hires Atos Origin to provide medical assessments|publisher=Personnel Today|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/dwp-hires-atos-origin-to-provide-medical-assessments/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018073433/http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/dwp-hires-atos-origin-to-provide-medical-assessments/|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Labour 2005–2010===
This term of office was notable for the high turnover of Welfare Secretaries:

# [[David Blunkett]]: 6 months in post
# [[John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness|John Hutton]]: 20 months in post
# [[Peter Hain]]: 7 months in post
# [[James Purnell]]: 16 months in post
# [[Yvette Cooper]]: 11 months in post

In January 2006, [[John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness|John Hutton]] published a White Paper outlining the government's latest plans for welfare reform: the benefit that would replace Incapacity Benefit would be called Employment and Support Allowance and its "gateway" assessment would be transformed. Over the course of a decade, Hutton expected the number of people on Incapacity Benefit to fall by one million, thereby saving £7billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new deal for welfare: empowering people to work |publisher=White Paper |date=January 2006 |url=http://dwp.gov.uk/docs/a-new-deal-for-welfare-empowering-people-to-work-full-document.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128102031/http://dwp.gov.uk/docs/a-new-deal-for-welfare-empowering-people-to-work-full-document.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4641588.stm |title=UK Politics &amp;#124; Hutton unveils benefits shake-up |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-01-24 |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909145730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4641588.stm |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting [[Welfare Reform Act 2007|Welfare Reform Bill]] was introduced to Parliament for consideration in July 2006. On 3 May 2007, the bill received royal assent and a week later [[Tony Blair]] announced his decision to leave Downing Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2007|title=Blair will stand down on 27 June|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6639945.stm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023012828/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6639945.stm|archivedate=23 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Freud report====
Blair appointed [[David Freud]], a former vice-chairman of investment banking at [[UBS]], as an advisor on out-of-work benefit reform in December 2006. Freud's 2007 report - dubbed "the Freud report" but officially titled ''Reducing dependency, increasing opportunity: options for the future of welfare to work'' - called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, for substantial resources to be made available to help people on [[Incapacity Benefit]] back into work, and for a single [[working age]] benefit payment to replace Housing Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Freud Report| url=https://www2.learningandwork.org.uk/sites/default/files/policy_downloads/freud_review.pdf| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509091630/https://www2.learningandwork.org.uk/sites/default/files/policy_downloads/freud_review.pdf| archivedate=2016-05-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His central thesis was that spending on "delivery" - such as schemes to get people back to work  - would save money in the long run because there would be fewer people being paid money in the form of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/lord-freud|title=The Rt Hon Lord Freud|work=www.gov.uk|accessdate=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909154230/https://www.gov.uk/government/people/lord-freud|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/art/RSjpsj1feb14.pdf|title=Talking Universal Credit: In conversation with Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform|author=Roy Sainsbury|format=pdf|date=2014|publisher=Policy Research Unit, University of York|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060243/http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/art/RSjpsj1feb14.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DWP coined the term Invest to Save to describe this idea and referred to it in-house as "the AME-DEL switch".

In July 2008 a Green Paper was published, which [[James Purnell]] said was "inspired by the reforms proposed by David Freud". It declared that "between 2009 and 2013, all Incapacity Benefit claimants will be reassessed using a medical assessment called the Work Capability Assessment" that would divide them into three groups: fit for work; unfit for work but fit for "work-related activity"; or fit for neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2008|title=No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238741/7363.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119021619/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238741/7363.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[Paul Gregg (academic)|Professor Paul Gregg]] was asked by the DWP to conduct a feasibility study of "conditionality" - a compulsory ''quid pro quo'' - as it might be applied to sickness benefit claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 2008|title=Fair rules for welfare reforms|author=Bristol University|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2008/6040.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702020849/http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2008/6040.html|archivedate=2016-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When responding to the Gregg Review, the DWP said that the study had recommended that conditionality be applied to "the vast majority of people in receipt of Employment and Support Allowance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future|publisher=DWP|date=December 2008|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238683/7506.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018073630/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238683/7506.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ESA introduced====
In October 2008, ESA and its eligibility test, the [[Work Capability Assessment]], were introduced for new claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/23/welfare-benefits-economy |title=The benefits of welfare reform outweigh the risks |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723182724/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/23/welfare-benefits-economy |archivedate=2015-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers were disappointed to find that the total number of people on sickness and incapacity benefits went ''up'', largely as a result of the [[financial crisis of 2008]] and the consequent rise in background unemployment.

Plans were made to tighten up the eligibility criteria still further - something that would set the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme back by two years. The Welfare Secretary wrote that these and other planned changes would ensure that "only those who are genuinely incapable of work" would get full ESA - other sickness benefit recipients would have to comply with plans drawn up with the DWP's private partners to get them back to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future|publisher=DWP|date=December 2008|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238683/7506.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018073630/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238683/7506.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010 manifesto====
The Labour Party manifesto, drafted by [[Ed Miliband]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=19 March 2010|publisher=The Guardian|title=Ed Miliband promises radical Labour election manifesto|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/19/labour-ed-miliband-radical-manifesto|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018165244/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/19/labour-ed-miliband-radical-manifesto|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published before the general election in 2010, declared that if Labour won:
{{quote|More people with disabilities and health conditions will be helped to move into work from Incapacity Benefit and Employment and Support Allowance, as we extend the use of our tough-but-fair work capability test. This will help to reduce the benefit bill by £1.5 billion over the next four years.

===Coalition 2010–2015===
In early 2011, the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme got underway using a more stringent version of the WCA and the caseload's falling trend resumed - until the middle of 2013, when the caseload began to grow again after fresh guidance had to be issued on how to judge fitness for work.

By 2015, the picture was clear: in the absence of the huge fall in recipients prophesied by the architects of ESA, and in spite of the broadly downward natural long-term trend, the total caseload was little different from when ESA was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quarterly Benefits Summary|date=May 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/477328/dwp-stats-summary-nov-2015.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201165033/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/477328/dwp-stats-summary-nov-2015.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reflection of this failure of ESA to achieve its goal of shifting large numbers of people off benefits and into work, the cost to the Exchequer of out-of-work sickness benefits ''did not fall at all'' after ESA was introduced: the annual cost is now predicted to ''rise'' to £14 billion or more in the course of 2016, largely because more people than anticipated have gone into the Support Group - particularly since the second half of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/Executive_summary_Welfare_trends_2015.pdf|publisher=Office for Budget Responsibility|title=Executive Summary: Welfare trends report 2015|accessdate=16 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618154632/http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/Executive_summary_Welfare_trends_2015.pdf|archivedate=18 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underpayment scandal====
Roughly 70,000 claimants were paid between £5,000 and £20,000 too little from 2011 to 2016 because the DWP did not ensure they got their correct entitlement when they were moved from incapacity benefit on to employment and support allowance.  A [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] report accused the DWP of haste over the transfer while failing to take legal advice or make basic checks. Evidence that people were underpaid was disregarded and warnings from its own policy advisors that it should delay and sort out the issues before proceeding were ignored.  The report said the DWP’s lack of urgency - it took six years to start to deal with the error - showed “a culture of indifference” to people being paid too little. [[Meg Hillier]] said the affair demonstrated “weakness at the highest levels” of the DWP. “Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA” she said.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/disability-claimants-owed-340m-after-dwp-blunder-say-mps Disability claimants owed £340m after DWP blunder, say MPs] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016: ESA "fundamentally flawed"===
In January 2016, the Conservative Welfare Secretary, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], announced that ESA was "fundamentally flawed" and declared that a brand new policy, which would get nearly all ESA recipients back to work, would be unveiled within weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Daily Mail|title=Duncan Smith bid to get 2 million on sick benefits back to work|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3404200/Duncan-Smith-bid-2million-sick-benefits-work-Work-Pensions-secretary-call-shake-fundamentally-flawed-system.html|date=January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160118134812/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3404200/Duncan-Smith-bid-2million-sick-benefits-work-Work-Pensions-secretary-call-shake-fundamentally-flawed-system.html|archivedate=2016-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hint of what that policy might be was given in a detailed report on ESA published the following month by [[Reform (think tank)|Reform]], the right-of-centre think-tank:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Reform|title=Working welfare: a radically new approach to sickness and disability benefits|url=http://www.reform.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ESA-2-report.pdf|date=February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208045449/http://www.reform.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ESA-2-report.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Effectively, ESA would be abolished: the amount of money paid each week to the claimant would be reduced to the level of [[Jobseekers Allowance]]
* The resultant savings would be ploughed back into the [[Personal Independence Payment]] to balance the drop in ESA
* The WCA might be replaced by another assessment that set out to identify any barriers to work faced by the claimant, but which would play no role in determining eligibility to benefits
* As a way to "[[Nudge theory|nudge]]" claimants towards overcoming those barriers, extra money might be made available to fund a tailored programme of rehabilitation - although participation in this could be made a ''requirement'' of continued receipt of the benefit.

In March 2016, Duncan Smith unexpectedly resigned after a clash with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[George Osborne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC|date=19 March 2016|title=Iain Duncan Smith quits over planned disability benefit changes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418234840/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687|archivedate=18 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his resignation letter, "IDS" complained that there was "not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the Government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced". Duncan Smith's replacement, [[Stephen Crabb]], declared that there would be no new welfare policies, other than those set out in the Conservative Party manifesto of 2015, in that parliamentary term - thereby  scotching IDS's plan.

In October 2016, [[Damian Green]] announced a consultation exercise on reforming the WCA. Two years on, no concrete action has been taken as a result by the DWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Work capability assessment overhaul for disabled|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37810701|publisher=BBC News|date=31 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225190230/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37810701|archivedate=25 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fetal hydantoin syndrome''', also called '''fetal dilantin syndrome''' is a group of defects caused to the developing fetus by exposure to  [[teratology|teratogenic]] effects of [[phenytoin]] or [[carbamazepine]]. Dilantin is the [[brand name]] of the drug phenytoin sodium in the United States, commonly used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]].

It may also be called '''congenital hydantoin syndrome''',&lt;ref name="pmid18479711"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicolai J, Vles JS, Aldenkamp AP |title=Neurodevelopmental delay in children exposed to antiepileptic drugs in utero: a critical review directed at structural study-bias |journal=J.

About one third of children whose mothers are taking this drug during pregnancy typically have [[Small for gestational age|intrauterine growth restriction]] with a [[microcephaly|small head]] and develop minor dysmorphic craniofacial features and limb defects including hypoplastic nails and distal phalanges ([[birth defects]]).

The '''Foundation for Focused Ultrasound Research''' ('''FFUS''') is an [[United States|American]] non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] charity designed to promote both education and research within the area of medical applications of focused ultrasound ([[HIFU]]).

== History ==
The Foundation was formed on the third of January in 2005, and received charity status in November of the same year. In October 2005 the Foundation hosted the 5th International Symposium on Therapeutic Ultrasound, at [[Harvard Medical School]], which resulted in the largest-ever gathering of world experts in the use of ultrasound for the treatment of [[cancer]] and other disorders.  Under the Foundation's charter it operates as an unincorporated [[Voluntary association|association]].

== Activities ==
The Foundation compiles and reports on web-based news related to focused [[ultrasound]] in therapeutic and diagnostic medicine, organizes and assists with symposia, discussions, and meetings pertaining to diagnostic and therapeutic focused ultrasound as well as student-related research programs. There is a strong concentration in high intensity focused ultrasound ([[HIFU]]). The Association promotes collaborations between clinical and research groups via written and oral communication.

'''Fredda Blanchard-Fields''' was a professor of psychology at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s School of Psychology. As director of the "School of Psychology’s Adult Development Laboratory", Blanchard-Fields led research efforts that address social-cognitive processes in everyday life, from adolescence to older adulthood. Recognizing that a great deal of psychological research has focused on ways in which cognitive abilities in adulthood decline with older age, Blanchard-Fields, as a [[gerontologist]], and her colleagues focused on investigating domains in which adults continue to grow and develop throughout the lifespan and contribute to their competence in the social realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120106135950.htm|title=Why are older people happier?|last=|first=|date=2012-01-12|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hilite.org/archives/34103 HiLite Online | Students at this school are fueled to participate in community service activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234657/http://hilite.org/archives/34103 |date=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-12-31/features/0312310082_1_older-adults-older-workers-young-adults|title=Golden years can be enriching|last=Dembner|first=Alice|date=2003-12-31|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14886">Cases of '''HIV/AIDS in Peru''' are considered to have reached the level of a concentrated [[epidemic]]. According to a population-based survey conducted in [[Peru]]’s 24 largest cities in 2002, adult [[HIV]] prevalence was estimated to be less than 1 percent (0.6 percent among pregnant women; 0.4 percent among males; and 0.1 percent among females). The survey demonstrated that cases are unevenly distributed in the country, affecting mostly young people between the ages of 25 and 34. As of July 2010, the cumulative reported number of persons infected with HIV was 41,638, and there were 26,566 cases of AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the male/female ratio for AIDS diagnoses in 2009 was 3.02 to 1.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/peru_profile.pdf | title=HIV/AIDS Health Profile for Peru | publisher=United States Agency for International Development | date=September 2010 | accessdate=October 31, 2018 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107023708/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/peru_profile.pdf | archivedate= November 7, 2011|deadurl=yes}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS ([[UNAIDS]]) estimates 76,000 [[Peruvian people|Peruvians]] are HIV-positive, meaning that many people at risk do not know their status. There were 3,300 deaths due to AIDS in Peru in 2007 (UNAIDS, 2008), down from 5,600 deaths in 2005.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

Among Peru’s reported cases of HIV/AIDS, 77 percent are in [[Lima]] and [[Callao]] – the capital city area (United Nations General Assembly Special Session report, 2010). Sexual transmission accounts for the majority (97 percent) of cases, followed by mother-to-child transmission (2 percent), and contaminated blood and blood products (1 percent) (UNGASS, 2010). The prevalence among men who have sex with men ([[Men who have sex with men|MSM]]), which was 14 percent nationally and 23 percent in Lima in 2005, has continued to rise in recent years, while among [[sex workers]] prevalence remains low (0.6 to 2 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez J et al. "High HIV and ulcerative transmitted infection incidence estimates among men who have sex with men in Peru: awaiting an effective preventive intervention". ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'', 2009, '''51'''(Suppl. 1): S47–S51&lt;/ref&gt; In five Central American countries, the annual HIV incidence was 5.1% among men who have sex with men, while an incidence of 3.5% has been found among men who have sex with men who attended public health clinics in Lima, Peru.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Report"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2010/20101123_globalreport_en.pdf | title=UNAIDS Report on the global AIDS epidemic | publisher=[[UNAIDS]] | author=Sidibé, Michel | authorlink=Michel Sidibé | isbn=978-92-9173-871-7 | edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent analysis by Alarcon-Villaverde indicated MSM account for a large proportion of HIV incidence (55 percent) in Peru (UNAIDS, 2009). In addition, transsexuals who are sex workers are the most affected population, with an estimated prevalence between 32 percent and 45 percent (UNGASS, 2010).&lt;ref name="UNGASS Peru 2008-2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/monitoringcountryprogress/2010progressreportssubmittedbycountries/peru_2010_country_progress_report_es.pdf | title=Informe Nacional sobre los progresos realizados en la aplicación del UNGASS Perú, durante el período 2008-2009 | publisher=UNGASS Peru | date=March 30, 2010 | accessdate=October 31, 2018 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012184041/http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/monitoringcountryprogress/2010progressreportssubmittedbycountries/peru_2010_country_progress_report_es.pdf |language=es | archivedate= October 12, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 96 percent of [[female sex workers]] (FSWs) report having used a condom with their last client (MOH, 2003), the frequency of condom use among male sex workers is only 42 percent (UNGASS 2008). HIV/AIDS incidence in the main prisons in Peru is approximately 1.1 percent ([[Instituto Nacional Penitenciario]] [INPE], 2005), and [[condom]] use by prison inmates is low (32.8 percent reported in 2004) (INPE, 2005).&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

Blood safety is also a concern. Several reported cases of HIV infection in 2006 and 2007 have been attributed to [[blood transfusions]] received through public health services (MOH, 2007).&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

Infections with [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]], and [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] in men and women and [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]] in women are factors in the increasing risk of HIV transmission in Peru. According to the 2009 Demographic and Health Survey, 14 percent of the women surveyed among those reporting history of sexual intercourse reported having sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms.&lt;ref name="UNGASS Peru 2008-2009"/&gt; Inadequate and ineffective treatment of STIs is common in Peru. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) is common. Also of significant concern is the high HIV prevalence among prison inmates. Given the relatively low level of [[sexual education]], limited condom use, and risky sexual behaviors practiced by some subpopulations, including multiple sex partners, there is a significant potential for the further spread of HIV in Peru. According to the 2008 UNGASS report, less than 5 percent of schools offer sex education, including information about HIV (USAID 2010). One study by Klausner and Mendoza (2002) of young people aged 18 to 30 in 34 neighborhoods in Lima, [[Chiclayo]], and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] demonstrated that 18 percent had more than one sex partner in the last year, 8 percent had more than one partner in the last three months, and condom use was low.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

==National response==
Peru was one of the first countries in [[Latin America]] to adopt a syndromic management approach to STIs and offer [[prophylaxis]] for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission, although currently PMTCT coverage is only 56 percent, according to the 2010 UNGASS report. Peru’s strategy to prevent STIs was called a model for the [[Andes|Andean region]], and in 2000, [[UNAIDS]] cited Peru’s HIV/AIDS prevention program as one of the best in the world. Soon after, however, political turmoil, an economic crisis, and repeated changes in key personnel combined to undermine MOH operations, including the STI program. In a major restructuring of the MOH in 2002 and 2003, several vertical programs, including the [[National AIDS Program]] (NAP), were merged. This was accompanied by a reduction in funding and management capacity for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]] (TB), child [[immunization]], and other programs. All aspects of the NAP suffered. In 2004, the MOH began reconstituting its HIV/AIDS program, with the goals of limiting the expansion of the epidemic by preventing new infections and providing appropriate and effective care and support to those who have HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

In 2007, a new Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007–2011 was designed based on evidence-based strategies. Most-at-risk populations (MARPs) were included as one of the most important target populations. The Plan proposed nine strategic objectives, including prevention, care, and policy issues. One strategic objective was the reduction of HIV and STIs among MSM, FSW, and prison inmates. The Plan proposed the following activities: promotion and distribution of condoms, advocacy for promotion and access to services, improvement of STI/HIV services, STI/HIV facilities, treatment of STIs, strengthening the peer-educator strategy, and strengthening community-based organizations of MSM and FSW. Since the plan was designed to guide HIV/STI activities for 2007–2011, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria projects in Peru (especially the sixth round) used it as a framework for their activities.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

Public health services are the main source of care for HIV/AIDS and STIs in Peru, most of which are delivered by the MOH, regional health authorities, and the social security system. In coordination with the MOH, other state sectors, such as the Ministry of Education and the [[Ministry for Women and Social Development]], have programs directed at educating and protecting adolescents and children and preventing HIV/AIDS by promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing high-risk behaviors. Education efforts for HIV prevention in schools are being implemented as part of activities financed by [[the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and [[the United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

Peruvians living with HIV/AIDS are protected by Law 26626, enacted in 1996, which recognizes fundamental rights of autonomy, confidentiality, and nondiscrimination and guarantees provision of medical treatment according to the state’s capacity. HIV testing for pregnant women is mandatory where there is a risk (although this is criticized by human rights observers), and the state is required to provide integral care (including treatment) to all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). According to the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF Towards Universal Access report, only 48 percent of HIV-infected people in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were receiving it in 2007.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

The activities supported by the Global Fund represent a large proportion of the investment in HIV/AIDS in the country, though the Government of Peru is funding most of the costs of procuring antiretroviral drugs. Peru has obtained funding for HIV/AIDS activities through the Global Fund's rounds two, five, and six. The initial activities emphasized the provision of highly active [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ART), but later projects emphasized prevention.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt; Peru directs more than 5% of its HIV prevention spending toward prevention programmes for men who have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://files.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/20111130_UA_Report_en.pdf | title=Progress report 2011: Global HIV/AIDS response: Epidemic update and health sector progress towards Universal Access | publisher=WHO | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An opportunity in these prevention efforts is to target HIV positive individuals through internet communication and cell phone messages to support intervention delivery for HIV treatment adherence and prevention of secondary HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1472-6947-7-24 | title=Access, use and perceptions regarding Internet, cell phones and PDAs as a means for health promotion for people living with HIV in Peru | author=Walter H Curioso &amp; Ann E Kurth | journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making | year=2007 | volume=7 | issue=24 | doi=10.1186/1472-6947-7-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Country Coordinating Mechanism]] (CCM), established for coordinating activities supported by the Global Fund, is the only multisectoral coordinating mechanism in the country. Under the CCM, governmental ministries, organizations of PLWHA and those affected by TB, [[nongovernmental organizations]], [[faith-based groups]], academia, and international organizations oversee and coordinate Peru’s response to the epidemic. The CCM steered the development of the [[Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS]] for 2007-2011.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt;

There are currently four national organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS in Peru. The group with the largest reported impact of 1,000 people is the Asociación Solas y Unidas, which was founded in 1999. Their principal activities include sexual and reproductive health training, gender and leadership for women living with HIV/AIDS, professional training and career support for impoverished women living with HIV/AIDS, education and training for children affected by HIV/AIDS, and nutritional support for low-income families affected by HIV/AIDS (Directory of Associations of People Living with HIV/AIDS, USAID 2004). Also working with these populations are the Alianza en Accion +, Coordinadora Peruana de Personas Viviendo con VIH/SIDA, and GAM Renacer. Overall, the populations these organizations work with have limited access to anti-retroviral therapies, psychosocial support, home-based services, while there is more access to nutritional guidance and TB screening and treatment through the national Ministry of Health health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Publications/docs/hivaidsdirectory.pdf | title=PLWHA Directory | publisher=USAID / Population, Health and Nutrition Information (PHNI) Project | date=July 2002 | accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USAID Support==
Through USAID, Peru received $1.2 million in fiscal year (FY) 2009 for essential HIV/AIDS programs and services. USAID’s HIV/AIDS programs in Peru are implemented as part of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt; Thanks to this support, Peru’s health indicators-such as life expectancy, fertility rate, and infant and maternal death rates- have improved steadily over the past several decades. However, troubling differences exist, particularly between rural and urban populations, made worse by poverty and low education levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usaid.gov/pe/downloads/health-englishversion-february2011.pdf | title=Health Fact Sheet | publisher=USAID/Peru | date=February 2011 | accessdate=November 1, 2018| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027232324/https://www.usaid.gov/pe/downloads/health-englishversion-february2011.pdf | archivedate= October 12, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there remain to be significant challenges associated with enacting successful prevention efforts in Peru, in particular in the rural regions where there is limited access and where some communities do not even have a word for ‘prevention’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unfpa.org.pe/publicaciones/publicacionesperu/MINSA-UNFPA-Aproximacion-Cualitativa.pdf | title=Una aproximación cualitativa a la prevención del VIH-Sida en dos comunidades nativas de Ucayali | publisher=Ministerio de Salud (MINSA) / Fondo de Población de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA) | date=2009 | accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthcare in China''' consists of both public and private medical institutions and insurance programs. About 95% of the population has at least basic health insurance coverage. Despite this, public health insurance generally only covers about half of medical costs, with the proportion lower for serious or chronic illnesses. Under the "Healthy China 2020" initiative, China is currently undertaking an effort to cut healthcare costs, and the government requires that insurance will cover 70% of costs by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/26/c_135131604.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/11/01/is-china-facing-a-health-care-crisis/chinas-health-care-reform-far-from-sufficient&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The Chinese government is working on providing affordable basic healthcare to all residents by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinabusinessreview.com/chinas-healthcare-reform-how-far-has-it-come/&lt;/ref&gt; 
China has also become a major market for health-related multinational companies. Companies such as [[AstraZeneca]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], and [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] entered the Chinese market and have experienced explosive growth. China has also become a growing hub for health care research and development.&lt;ref name=McKinsey/&gt; 

The above applies to [[Mainland China]].  [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] maintain their own separate universal healthcare systems.

==History==
[[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) has been practiced for years, and served as the basis for health care in China for much of its history. Western-inspired [[evidence-based medicine]] made its way to China beginning in the 19th Century. When the Communist Party took over in 1949, health care was nationalized, a national "patriotic health campaign" attempted to address basic health and hygiene education, and basic primary care was dispatched to rural areas through barefoot doctors and other state-sponsored programs. Urban health care was also streamlined. However, beginning with [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] in 1978, health standards in China began to diverge significantly between urban and rural areas, and also between coastal and interior provinces. Much of the health sector became privatized. As state-owned enterprises shut down and the vast majority of urban residents were no longer employed by the state, they also lost much of the social security and health benefits. As a result, the majority of urban residents paid almost all health costs out-of-pocket beginning in the 1990s, and most rural residents simply could not afford to pay for health care in urban hospitalities.

===System reform===
Since 2006, China has been undertaking [[Healthcare system reform in China|the most significant health care reforms]] since the Mao era. The government launched the New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) in 2005 in an overhaul of the healthcare system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, some 800 million rural residents gained basic, tiered medical coverage, with the central and provincial governments covering between 30-80% of regular medical expenses.&lt;ref name=reform&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/02779536/1999/00000048/00000007/art00396 The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties.] Authors: Carrin G.1, ''and others'' Source: Social Science and Medicine, Volume 48, Number 7, April 1999, pp.961-972(12)&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of medical insurance has increased in urban areas as well. By 2011 more than 95% of the total population of China had basic health insurance, though out-of-pocket costs and the quality of care varied significantly.&lt;ref name=McKinsey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank Le Deu|title=Health care in China: Entering ‘uncharted waters’|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/health_systems_and_services/health_care_in_china_entering_uncharted_waters|publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|accessdate=November 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health infrastructure in Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities were approaching developed-world standards, and are vastly superior compared to those operated in the rural interior.

==Current healthcare system==
{{Further information|Healthcare system reform in the People's Republic of China}}

All major cities have hospitals specializing in different fields, and are equipped with some modern facilities. Residents of urban areas are not provided with free healthcare, and must either pay for treatment or purchase health insurance. The quality of hospitals varies. The best medical care in China is available in foreign-run or joint venture Western-style medical facilities with international staff available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and a few other large cities. They are highly expensive; treatment there can often cost up to ten times more than a public hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[needs citation]&lt;/ref&gt; Public hospitals and clinics are available in all Chinese cities. Their quality varies by location; the best treatment can usually be found in public city-level hospitals, followed by smaller district-level clinics. Many public hospitals in major cities have so-called V.I.P. wards or ''gaogan bingfang''. These feature reasonably up-to-date medical technology and skilled staff. Most V.I.P. wards also provide medical services to foreigners and have English-speaking doctors and nurses. V.I.P. wards typically charge higher prices than other hospital facilities, but are still often cheap by Western standards. In addition to medical facilities providing modern care, traditional Chinese medicine is also widely used, and there are Chinese medicine hospitals and treatment facilities located throughout the country. Dental care, cosmetic surgery, and other health-related services at Western standards are widely available in urban areas, though costs vary.

Historically, in rural areas, most healthcare was available in clinics providing rudimentary care, with poorly trained medical personnel and little medical equipment or medications, though certain rural areas had far higher-quality medical care than others. However, the quality of rural health services has improved dramatically since 2009. In an increasing trend, healthcare for residents of rural areas unable to travel long distances to reach an urban hospital is provided by family doctors who travel to the homes of patients, which is covered by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/acs_health.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426180827/http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/acs_health.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-04-26|title=Health Information - Beijing, China - Embassy of the United States|work=usembassy-china.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/beijing/how-to/page/beijing-healthcare-health-system-medical-services|title=Accessing Medical Services and Hospitals|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=15 June 2016|work=Angloinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/China/China-Guide/Health/Health-care-in-China|title=China Guide: Health care in China, Doctors, clinics and hospitals: Health care is widely available in China|work=Just Landed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/04/04/china-bringing-quality-health-services-to-rural-residents|title=China: Doctors on Wheels Bring Quality Care to Rural Residents|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Reform of the health delivery system in urban areas of China has prompted concerns about the demand and utilization of Community Health Services Centres (CHC); a recent study, however, found that insured patients are less likely to use private clinics and more likely to use CHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qian|first1=D|title=Determinants of the Use of Different Types of Health Care Provider in Urban China: A racer illness study of URTI|journal=Health Policy|year=2010|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/determinants-of-the-use-of-different-types-of-health-care-pr.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.06.014|volume=98|issue=2–3|pages=227–35|pmid=20650539|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strains of [[Avian influenza|avian flu]] outbreaks in recent years among local poultry and birds, along with a number of its citizens, have caused great concern for China and other countries. While the virus is currently mainly animal-human transmissible (with only two well documented cases of human-human have been to the present known of to scientists), experts expect an avian flu [[pandemic]] that would affect the region should the virus morph to be human-human transmissible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/avian-flu-humans.htm] 2006. FIC. Accessed 17 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent outbreak is the pig-human transmission of the ''Streptococcus suis'' bacteria in 2005, which has led to 38 deaths in and around [[Sichuan]] province, an unusually high number. Although the bacteria exists in other pig rearing countries, the pig-human transmission has only been reported in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/cei/taf/emergingdiseasenotice_files/strep_suis_china.htm "''Streptococcus suis'' Outbreak, Swine and Human, China"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327033408/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/cei/taf/emergingdiseasenotice_files/strep_suis_china.htm |date=2010-03-27 }} August 2005.

As of 2004, in more undeveloped areas it is advised to only drink bottled water as [[cholera]], among other diseases, is spread through the water supply. As of 2012, food and water safety remains an issue.

Another major problem are the "black ambulances", or illegal, privately run, for-profit ambulance services. As there is a shortage of ambulances belonging to hospitals in major cities, many private businessmen are now operating fleets of unauthorized ambulances, often staffed by untrained personnel and with no medical equipment, and charging the patients. Despite a government crackdown, the number of private ambulances is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/758937.shtml|title=Dangerous wail of the sirens - Global Times|work=globaltimes.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaffordable medications are another gaping hole in the Chinese safety net. This forces workers to save as much as possible in order to weather family medical emergencies, which acts to depress domestic consumption, leaving no alternative to the traditional unsustainable export and investment driven economic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23670744|title=China drug costs: The human price|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cross-sectional study between 2003 and 2011 showed remarkable increases in health insurance coverage and inpatient reimbursement were accompanied by increased use and coverage. The increases in services use are particularly important in rural areas and at hospitals. Major advances have been made in achieving equal access to insurance coverage, inpatient reimbursement, and basic health services, most notably for hospital delivery, and use of outpatient and inpatient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meng|first1=Qun|last2=Xu|first2=Ling|last3=Zhang|first3=Yaoguang|last4=Qian|first4=Juncheng|last5=Cai|first5=Min|last6=Xin|first6=Ying|last7=Gao|first7=Jun|last8=Xu|first8=Ke|last9=Boerma|first9=J Ties|last10=Barber|first10=Sarah L|title=Trends in access to health services and financial protection in China between 2003 and 2011: a cross-sectional study|journal=The Lancet|date=3–9 March 2012|volume=379|issue=9818|pages=805–814|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612602785|accessdate=7 September 2014|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(12)60278-5|pmid=22386034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, with substantial urbanisation, attention on health care has been changed. Urbanisation offers opportunities for improvements in population health in China (such as access to improved health care and basic infrastructure) and substantial health risks including air pollution, occupational and traffic hazards, and the risks conferred by changing diets and activity. Communicable infections should also be re-focused on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gong|first1=Peng|last2=Liang|first2=Song|last3=Carlton|first3=Elizabeth J|last4=Jiang|first4=Qingwu|last5=Wu|first5=Jianyong|last6=Wang|first6=Lei|last7=Remais|first7=Justin V|title=Urbanisation and health in China|journal=The Lancet|date=3–9 March 2012|volume=379|issue=9818|pages=843–852|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673611618783|accessdate=7 September 2014|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(11)61878-3|pmc=3733467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 China had about 1,938,000 physicians (1.5 per 1,000 persons) and about 3,074,000 hospital beds (2.4 per 1,000 persons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://219.235.129.58/reportYearQuery.do?id=2500&amp;r=0.5684486212210947 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323195017/http://219.235.129.58/reportYearQuery.do?id=2500&amp;r=0.5684486212210947 |archive-date=2014-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Health expenditures on a [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) basis were US$224 per capita in 2001, or 5.5 percent of gross domestic product ().{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some 37.2 percent of public expenditures were devoted to health care in China in 2001.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, about 80 percent of the health and medical care services are concentrated in cities, and timely medical care is not available to more than 100 million people in rural areas. To offset this imbalance, in 2005 China set out a five-year plan to invest 20 billion [[renminbi]] (RMB; US$2.4 billion) to rebuild the rural medical service system composed of village clinics and township- and county-level [[hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meesen|first1=B|author2=B Bloom|title=Economic Transition, Institutional Changes And The Health System: Some Lessons From Rural China|journal=Journal of Economic Policy and Reform |year=2007 |volume=10 |issue=3 |url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/economic-transition-institutional-changes-and-the-health-sys.html |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a shortage of doctors and nurses in China. More doctors are being trained, but most aim to leave the countryside in favor of the cities, leaving significant shortages in rural areas.&lt;ref name="China Medical Board"&gt;{{cite web|title=China Medical Board|url=http://www.chinamedicalboard.org/|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 it was reported that [[ticket resale]] was widely practised at [[Beijing Tongren Hospital]] and [[Peking University First Hospital]]. Advance tickets for outpatient consultation are sold by the hospitals for 200 yuan, but sold on for as much as 3,000 yuan. An eye doctor commented that the appointment fees did not reflect the economic value of doctors' skills and experience and that the scalpers were  selling the doctor's appointment at a price the market is prepared to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scalped: At China's creaking hospitals, illegal ticket touts defy crackdown|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-healthcare-scalpers-idUSKCN0X82O1|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=Reuters|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical training==
The Chinese medical education system is based on the British model. While some medical schools run three-year programs, hospitals tend to recruit physicians who graduated from five-year programs, while big-name hospitals only accept MDs, which takes seven years of study, including the five years of undergraduate studies, followed by the completion of a PhD in medicine. Once a student graduates from medical school, he or she must work 1–3 years in a university-affiliated hospital, after which the student is eligible to take the National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE) for physician certification, which is conducted by the National Medical Examination Center (NMEC). If the candidate passes, he or she becomes a professional physician, and is certified by the Ministry of Health. It is illegal to practice medicine in China as a physician or assistant physician without being certified by the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmec.org.cn/English/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630120927/http://www.nmec.org.cn/English/english.htm |archivedate=2016-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians are allowed to open their own clinics after practicing medicine for five years.

==Traditional and modern Chinese medicine==
{{see also|Medicine in China|Traditional Chinese medicine|Medical missions in China|Pharmacy in China|Pharmaceutical industry in China}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}

[[China]] has one of the longest recorded history of medicine records of any existing civilization. The methods and theories of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] have developed for over two thousand years. Western medical theory and practice came to China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, notably through the efforts of [[Protestant missions in China 1807-1953|missionaries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Edward V. | last = Gulick | year = 1975 | title = Peter Parker and the Opening of China | publisher = Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 95, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep. 1975) | location = |pages = 561–562 | author-link=Edward V. Gulick}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which together founded [[Peking Union Medical College]]. Today Chinese [[traditional medicine]] continues alongside western medicine and traditional physicians, who also receive some western medical training, are sometimes primary care givers in the clinics and pharmacies of rural China.  Various traditional preventative and self-healing techniques such as [[qigong]], which combines gentle exercise and meditation, are widely practiced as an adjunct to professional health care.

Although the practice of traditional Chinese medicine was strongly promoted by the Chinese leadership and remained a major component of health care, Western medicine gained increasing acceptance in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, the number of physicians and [[pharmacist]]s trained in [[Western medicine]] reportedly increased by 225,000 from 1976 to 1981, and the number of physicians' assistants trained in Western medicine increased by about 50,000. In 1981 there were reportedly 516,000 senior physicians trained in Western medicine and 290,000 senior physicians trained in traditional Chinese medicine. The goal of China's medical professionals is to synthesize the best elements of traditional and Western approaches.

In practice, however, this combination has not always worked smoothly. In many respects, physicians trained in traditional medicine and those trained in Western medicine constitute separate groups with different interests. For instance, physicians trained in Western medicine have been somewhat reluctant to accept unscientific traditional practices, and traditional practitioners have sought to preserve authority in their own sphere. Although Chinese medical schools that provided training in Western medicine also provided some instruction in traditional medicine, relatively few physicians were regarded as competent in both areas in the mid-1980s.

The extent to which traditional and Western treatment methods were combined and integrated in the major hospitals varied greatly. Some hospitals and medical schools of purely traditional medicine were established. In most urban hospitals, the pattern seemed to be to establish separate departments for traditional and Western treatment. In the county hospitals, however, traditional medicine received greater emphasis.

[[Traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional medicine]] depends on [[Chinese herbology|herbal treatments]], [[acupuncture]], [[acupressure]], [[moxibustion]] (burning of herbs over acupuncture points), "[[Fire cupping|cupping]]" (local suction of skin), [[qigong]] (coordinated movement, breathing, and awareness), [[tui na]] (massage), and other culturally unique practices. Such approaches are believed to be most effective in treating minor and chronic diseases, in part because of milder side effects. Traditional treatments may be used for more serious conditions as well, particularly for such acute abdominal conditions as [[appendicitis]], [[pancreatitis]], and [[gallstone]]s; sometimes traditional treatments are used in combination with Western treatments. A traditional method of [[Orthopedics|orthopedic]] treatment, involving less immobilization than Western methods, continued to be widely used in the 1980s.

==Primary care==
After 1949 the Ministry of Public Health was responsible for all health-care activities and established and supervised all facets of health policy. Along with a system of national, provincial, and local facilities, the ministry regulated a network of industrial and [[State-Owned Enterprise|state enterprise]] [[hospital]]s and other facilities covering the health needs of workers of those enterprises. In 1981 this additional network provided approximately 25 percent of the country's total health services.

Health care was provided in both rural and urban areas through a three-tiered system. In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people; given their importance as health care providers, particularly in rural areas, the government introduced measures to improve their performance through organised training and an annual licensing exam.&lt;ref name="Policy Brief 8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloom|first1=Gerald|author2=Kate Hawkins|title=Lessons from the Chinese  Approach to Health System  Development|journal=IDS in Focus Policy Briefing|date=June 2009|issue=8|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/IFPBChina8.1.pdf}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the "rural collective health system" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year [[medical school]]s. Utilisation of health services in rural areas has been shown to increase as a result of the rise in income in rural households and the government's substantial fiscal investment in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=Gerald|title=Partnerships for development –  lessons from a health project in China|journal=DFID Briefing|date=April 2008|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/storage/Chinapartnershippolicybrief1.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511025258/http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/storage/Chinapartnershippolicybrief1.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=G|title=Building Institutions For An Effective Health System: Lessons From China's Experience With Rural Health ReformS|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2011|volume=72|issue=8|pages=1302–1309|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/building-institutions-for-an-effective-health-system-lessons.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.02.017|pmid=21439699}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.
However, primary care in China has not developed as well as intended. The main barrier has been the scarcity of suitably-qualified health professionals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Xiaoyun|last2=Zhao|first2=Shichao|last3=Zhang|first3=Minmin|last4=Hu|first4=Dan|last5=Meng|first5=Qingyue|title=The development of rural primary health care in China’s health system reform|journal=Journal of Asian Public Policy|date=16 February 2015|volume=8|issue=1pages=88–101|doi=10.1080/17516234.2015.1008195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3871">The '''Hungarian Food Safety Office''' ('''HFSO''') operated as the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] partner institution of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) from 2003 to 2012 in conformity with the [[European Union|EU]] requirements.  One of its priority was to assess the health risks derived from [[food]] and indirectly from feed, to liaise with international and Hungarian authorities, and to communicate with the public on food safety issues. From 2012, these tasks are performed by the [[National Food Chain Safety Office]], which was established by the integration of the Central Agricultural Office and HFSO.

==Scientific risk assessment==
One of the major responsibilities of HFSO was the scientific [[risk assessment]] relating to [[food safety]], taking into account up-to-date scientific findings of recognised international institutions.  The scientific risk assessment is based on identifying potential hazards, defining their characteristics, assessing their incidence and frequency and describing the risk.  HFSO is responsible for assessing risks relating to concrete events, furthermore by analysing the data of annual official inspections concerning various [[Agriculture|agricultural]], [[Technology|technological]], [[Environment (systems)|environmental]] and [[Biological hazard|biological]] [[Impurity|contaminants]], [[pesticide residue]]s and natural [[Toxicity|toxic]] [[Poison|substance]]s in raw and processed food.  Based on the risk assessment, it forwards a proposal concerning the priority of [[inspection]]s in the forthcoming period and participates in international risk assessment projects relating to individual [[Chemical accident|chemical]] and [[Microbiology|microbiological]] contaminants.

==National and international relations==
Fostering national and international relations was another important responsibility of HFSO.  Before the establishment of the [[National Food Chain Safety Office]], this institution had been the Hungarian partner organization of the European Food Safety Authority.  In addition, HFSO was the designated contact point in the EU [[Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed]] (RASFF), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Food Safety Emergency Network (INFOSAN Emergency) and [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]/WHO [[Codex Alimentarius]].

==The role of communication==
Food is a product that the vast majority comes into direct contact with day-by-day as a [[consumer]], [[Food industry|food maker]], and [[customer]].  The third core function of HFSO was to fill the gap, in providing credible, up-to-date information for both experts and the general public concerning food safety, which also reflects the latest scientific achievements.  HFSO aimed to raise consumer awareness among the general public, which will enable consumers to reject products and services that are dubious from a food hygiene and food safety point of view, and to become aware of and abide by fundamental principles.

==Regular publications==
*HFSO Newsletters (published every two weeks; HU-EN bilingual publication)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mebih.hu/index.php/hu/kiadvanyok/hirlevel.html HFSO Newsletters].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
HFSO worked with a small staff (18 people) under the supervision of the [[Minister of Agriculture (Hungary)|Ministry of Rural Development]].  All members of HFSO were [[Civil service|public servant]]s.  Its general director was Mária Szeitzné Szabó.

'''Hyperthymic temperament''', or '''hyperthymia''', from Greek ''hyper'' ("over", meaning here ''excessive'') + [[Thumos|θυμός]] ("spirited"), is a proposed personality type characterized by an exceptionally positive mood and disposition. It is generally defined by increased energy, vividness and enthusiasm for life activities as opposed to dysthymia. Hyperthymia is similar to but more stable than [[hypomania]] with complete absence of irritability or negative mood effects.&lt;ref name="wiktionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hyperthymia|title=hyperthymia - Wiktionary|publisher=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Guide to Mood Disorders|author1=Dubovsky, S.L.|author2=Dubovsky, A.N.|date=2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|isbn=9781585627653|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qC2umbulUIwC|page=39|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of the hyperthymic temperament include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/418724{{subscription needed}}{{clarify|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increased energy and [[productivity]]
* short sleep patterns
* vividness, activity [[Extraversion and introversion|extroversion]]
* self-assurance, self-confidence
* strong will
* extreme talkativeness
* tendency to repeat oneself
* [[risk]]-taking/sensation seeking
* breaking [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]]
* very strong [[libido]]
* love of attention
* low threshold for [[boredom]]
* generosity and tendency to overspend
* emotion sensitivity
* cheerfulness and joviality
* unusual warmth
* expansiveness
* tirelessness
* irrepressibility, irresistible, and infectious quality

The clinical, psychiatric understanding of hyperthymia is evolving. Studies have shown that hyperthymic temperament promotes efficient performance of complex tasks under time pressure or extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaracz |first1=Marcin |last2=Paciorek |first2=Przemysław |last3=Buciński |first3=Adam |last4=Borkowska |first4=Alina |title=Affective temperament and executive functions in emergency medicine professionals |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=168 |issue= |pages=192–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25063957 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2014.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this positive characterization, hyperthymia can be complicated with depressive episodes manifesting as a softer form of bipolar illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/439472_5|title=Beyond Antidepressants: Bipolar Spectrum Illness Presenting as Complicated or Refractory Mood Disorders in Primary Care|last=Manning|first=J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of agreement on its definition, implications or whether it is [[pathological]]. It is not known where to place hyperthymia on the [[affective spectrum]].

Hyperthymia manifesting intermittently or in an unusual way may mask [[hypomania]] or another psychiatric disorder. Hyperthymia can be most accurately diagnosed by a psychologist or psychiatrist with the help of a patient's family and/or close friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68636">'''Infections associated with diseases''' are those that are associated with possible [[Infection|infectious]] [[Etiology (medicine)|etiologies]], that meet the requirements of [[Koch's postulates]]. Other methods of causation are described by the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] and [[Evidence-based medicine]]. [[Koch's postulate]]s have been altered by some [[epidemiologist]]s based upon [[DNA sequencing|sequence-based detection]] of distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences in [[tissue sample]]s. Using this method, absolute statements are not always possible regarding [[Causality|
causation]]. Since this is true, higher amounts of distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences would be in those exhibiting disease compared to controls since inoculating those without the pathogen is [[unethical]]. In addition, the DNA load should drop or become lower with the resolution of the [[disease]]. The distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences load should also increase upon recurrence.

Other conditions are met to establish cause or association including studies in [[disease transmission]].  This means that there should be a high disease occurrence in those carrying an [[pathogen]], evidence of a [[serology|serological]]response to the pathogen, and the success of [[vaccination]] prevention. Direct [[microscopy|visualization]] of the pathogen, the identification of different [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s, [[imunology|immunological responses]] in the [[Host (biology)|host]], how the infection is spread and, the combination of these should all be taken into account to determine the [[probability]] that an infectious agent is the cause of the disease. A conclusive determination of a causal role of an infectious agent for in a particular disease using Koch's postulates is desired yet this might not be possible.&lt;ref name="Tijsse-KlasenKoopmans2014" /&gt;

The leading cause of death worldwide is [[cardiovascular disease]], but infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in [[infant]]s and children.&lt;ref name="LeeNguyen2015"/&gt;

==Other causes==
Other causes or associations of disease are: a [[uncompromised|compromised immune system]], environmental toxins, [[radiation exposure]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[lifestyle choices]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and [[genetics]]. Diseases may also be multifactorial, requiring multiple factors to induce disease.

==Epidemiology==
Infectious pathogen-associated diseases include many of the most common and costly chronic illnesses. The treatment of chronic diseases accounts for 75% of all US healthcare costs (amounting to $1.7 trillion in 2009).&lt;ref name="Almanac2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/sites/fightchronicdisease.org/files/docs/2009AlmanacofChronicDisease_updated81009.pdf|title=Almanac of Chronic Disease|publisher=Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease|year=2009|page=23|chapter=The Role of Chronic Disease in Higher Health Costs and Lower U.S. Economic Growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of first examples of systematic study of disease causation was [[Avicenna]], in the tenth century. The history of infection and disease were observed in the 1800s and related to the one of the tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The cause of [[viral encephalitis]] was discovered in Russia based upon epidemiological clustering of cases. The virus causing this illness was isolated in 1937. The rash typical of Lyme borreliosis was identified the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Tijsse-KlasenKoopmans2014"/&gt; Historically, some chronic diseases were linked or associated with infectious [[pathogens]].&lt;ref name="Knobler2004PagesXItoXII"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83716/|title=The Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Defining the Relationship, Enhancing the Research, and Mitigating the Effects: Workshop Summary|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|date=1 July 2004|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08994-4|editor1-last=Knobler|editor1-first=Stacey L|pages=xi–xii|chapter=PREFACE|editor2-last=O'Connor|editor2-first=Siobhán|editor3-last=Lemon|editor3-first=Stanley M|editor4-last=Najafi|editor4-first=Marjan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knobler2004Page2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83701/|title=The Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Defining the Relationship, Enhancing the Research, and Mitigating the Effects: Workshop Summary|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|date=1 July 2004|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08994-4|editor1-last=Knobler|editor1-first=Stacey L|page=2|chapter=SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT|editor2-last=O'Connor|editor2-first=Siobhán|editor3-last=Lemon|editor3-first=Stanley M|editor4-last=Najafi|editor4-first=Marjan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knobler2004Pages13to14"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83680/|title=The Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Defining the Relationship, Enhancing the Research, and Mitigating the Effects: Workshop Summary|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|date=1 July 2004|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08994-4|editor1-last=Knobler|editor1-first=Stacey L|pages=13–14|chapter=OVERVIEW|editor2-last=O'Connor|editor2-first=Siobhán|editor3-last=Lemon|editor3-first=Stanley M|editor4-last=Najafi|editor4-first=Marjan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--For an infectious pathogenic microbe that has been noted to frequently accompany a disease, there are several logical possibilities that can explain this observed association: [[File:Chlamydia pneumoniae.jpg|thumb|275px|right|An [[epithelium|epithelial cell]] infected with [[Chlamydia pneumoniae]] bacteria.]]

:* The pathogen is an "innocent bystander" that plays no causal role in the etiology of the disease, but for some reason is more prevalent in patients with the disease (perhaps because the disease compromises the immune response, for example).
:* The pathogen predisposes to disease development (increases the risk of getting the disease), but the pathogen does not cause the disease (for example, genital herpes increases the risk of acquiring HIV).
:* The pathogen is a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of the disease: in other words, the pathogen can cause the disease, but does so only in combination with one or more other causal factors (such as host genetic factors, or toxin exposure).
:* The pathogen is a direct and singular cause of the disease, but this causality has yet to be proven.

Determining whether a pathogen plays a causal role in a chronic disease is often difficult for the following reasons:

:* The time between contracting an infectious pathogen and the appearance of the first disease symptoms can be lengthy, sometimes decades.
:* An infectious pathogen may not cause disease in every person.
:* An infection may be asymptomatic in its acute phase (when first contracted), and so go unnoticed; symptoms may only appear much later — in the form of a chronic disease.
:* Sometimes, only specific strains of a pathogen are linked to a disease; other strains of the same microbe may be harmless.
:* A pathogen may precipitate the disease only in combination with one or more other causal factors.
:* There may be more than one pathogen that can precipitate a given disease.
:* A given pathogen may not always cause the same disease — infection with it may lead to one of several different diseases.
:* There may be pathogens that are not readily detectable that play a causal role in a disease.
:* For obvious ethical reasons, you cannot inoculate infectious pathogens into humans to see if these do cause the disease or not.
:* A pathogenic microbe may cause disease by relatively easy to track ''direct'' means, such as by infecting and destroying cells; or may cause disease via more complex and convoluted ''indirect'' means, such as through the damage created by inflammatory [[cytokines]] or [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] processes that are induced by the microbial infection (for example, tuberculosis infection induces an inflammatory cytokine that then itself causes severe tissue damage).&lt;ref name="PMID_19275693" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID_20015961" /&gt;
:* A pathogenic microbe may not necessarily be present in the diseased tissues or organs (bacterial toxins for example can travel and damage tissues at sites distant from the infection site; and inflammatory or autoimmune processes precipitated by infectious pathogens can also act at tissue sites far removed from the infection).--&gt;

The '''International Vaccine Institute''' (IVI) is an independent, nonprofit, international organization that was founded on the belief that the health of children in developing countries can be dramatically improved by the use of new and improved [[vaccines]]. Working in collaboration with the international scientific community, public health organizations, governments, and industry, IVI is involved in all areas of the vaccine spectrum – from new vaccine design in the laboratory to vaccine development and evaluation in the field to facilitating sustainable introduction of vaccines in countries where they are most needed.

Created initially as an initiative of the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]] (UNDP), IVI began formal operations as an independent international organization in 1997 in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. Currently, IVI has 35 countries and the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. The Institute has a unique mandate to work exclusively on vaccine development and introduction specifically for people in developing countries, with a focus on neglected diseases affecting these regions.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1992, Dr. Seung-Il Shin, then Senior Health Advisor for the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], initiated a study to explore the feasibility of establishing an international institute devoted to vaccine research and development within the framework of the Children’s Vaccine Initiative (CVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/seung-il-shin|title=Seung Il Shin - Founder &amp;amp; Board Director @ Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the results of Dr. Shin’s feasibility study, in 1993 the UNDP adopted a formal proposal to establish the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). In 1994, following a call for proposals to host IVI in the Asia Pacific region, the UNDP and the Republic of Korea reached an agreement to host the center in Seoul. In 1995, UNDP opened an interim IVI office on the campus of Seoul National University and the Institute began its initial work and organizational development.

[[File:Establishment Agreement Signing.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Signing of the IVI Establishment Agreement]]

=== Foundation ===
In 1995 and 1996, the UNDP and the South Korean government jointly developed the basic framework and Constitution of IVI. In order to establish IVI as an independent international organization, the UNDP and Korean government elected to establish the institute through an intergovernmental agreement of UN member states, as sanctioned in the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties of 1969]].

On October 28, 1996, the IVI Establishment Agreement opened for signatures at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City. Representatives of [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Romania]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Uzbekistan]], and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] were the first to sign the agreement, followed shortly thereafter by [[Senegal]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].

In 1997 more countries followed, with [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tajikistan]], and Turkey signing the Agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IX-3&amp;chapter=9&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 1997, The IVI Establishment Agreement entered into force following the submission of instruments of ratification by South Korea, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. The IVI Establishment Agreement entered the [[Treaty series#United Nations|United Nations Depository of Treaties]] under Chapter IX. HEALTH, section 3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 24, 1998 the IVI Headquarters Agreement was signed at a formal ceremony at [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP headquarters]] by South Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon. [[Hong Soon-young|Hong Soon-Young]] and IVI Board Chairman, [[Barry Bloom|Dr. Barry Bloom]]. The Headquarters Agreement established IVI as a legal entity with diplomatic immunity in South Korea,, becoming the first international organization to be headquartered in South Korea. In accordance with IVI’s independent status, the Institute formally separated from the UNDP in 1998. 
[[File:IVI Building (1).jpg|thumb|290x290px|IVI Headquarters]]

=== Headquarters building ===
The IVI headquarters building, located in [[Seoul National University]]’s Research Park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was designed by a consortium consisting of [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samwoo Architects]] of South Korea and [https://www.payette.com/ Payette Associates] of Boston, USA. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2003. The building houses laboratories, animal facilities, offices, an auditorium, and a library. A separate 1,300m² pilot plant facility, intended for the production of test lots of vaccines for training and evaluation purposes, was constructed but never completed due to a lack of funding.

== Previous activities ==

=== Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) 2000-2006 ===

IVI’s first major initiative, Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) was a program of research and technical assistance to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines against [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[shigellosis]] into public health programs for the poor in developing countries. From 2000 to 2006, IVI’s DOMI program carried out vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, and research studies in [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. &amp;nbsp;At the conclusion of the DOMI program, IVI synthesized the diverse epidemiological, clinical, economic, and behavioral findings of these studies in order to facilitate informed decision-making by policymakers at the national level on the use of vaccines against the diseases targeted by DOMI. The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] was the primary funder of the DOMI program with a US$40 million contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2003-2004|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2005|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea.|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI typhoid ====

The DOMI Typhoid program was initiated to address the barriers of access to [[Typhoid vaccine|typhoid vaccines]] in the developing world and to accelerate the introduction of modern typhoid vaccines in countries where they were needed. DOMI Typhoid utilized the Vi-[[Polysaccharide]] (Vi-PS) vaccine because it is easily and inexpensively produced by manufacturers in developing countries, it is given in a single dose, and it is relatively thermostable. DOMI Typhoid operated in five study sites: [[Hechi|Heichi]], China; [[Kolkata]], India; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Karachi]], Pakistan; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI experts conducted disease surveillance, disease burden studies, cost-of-illness studies, socio-behavioral studies, and vaccine demonstration projects. IVI presented the accumulated evidence from DOMI Typhoid in case studies to officials in each host country. As a result, policymakers in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam agreed to introduce school-based typhoid vaccination campaigns on a pilot basis. Results from China uncovered a previously unknown growing incidence rate of [[Paratyphoid fever|paratyphoid A]] infections in China’s [[Guangxi|Guangxi province]], which led to IVI launching its Paratyphoid in China project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI cholera ====

The DOMI Cholera program sought to develop and accelerate the use of an affordable [[cholera vaccine]] in [[cholera]]-endemic countries. DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: [[Matlab (Bangladesh)|Matlab]], Bangladesh; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Kolkata]], India; [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], Mozambique; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI’s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam’s [http://www.vabiotech.com.vn/?lang=en VaBiotech.] At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech’s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam’s [http://nihe.org.vn/en/home-c10902.htm National Institute of Health and Epidemiology] following a technology transfer from the [[University of Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]], was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use. 

==== DOMI shigellosis ====
IVI established the DOMI [[Shigellosis]] program with the ultimate goal of accelerating the development and introduction of a safe and protective shigella vaccine to control epidemic and endemic disease. Between 2000 and 2004, the DOMI Shigella program ran disease surveillance sites in 6 locations across Southeast Asia: [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh; [[Hebei]], China; [[Karachi]], Pakistan and neighboring villages; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Nha Trang]], Vietnam; and [[Saraburi Province]], Thailand. The program enhanced understanding of what an effective shigella vaccine will need and established an accurate disease burden in the countries where it operated. The program first evaluated an oral shigella vaccine (SC602) in Bangladesh, but it failed to elicit an immune response. The high disease burden, serotype diversity, and high levels AMR discovered at IVI's surveillance sites underscored the need for a vaccine that protects against all common strains of the disease. As a result, IVI’s Division of Laboratory Sciences initiated a multiyear program to sequence the Shigella genome and identify common proteins in different Shigella species that could be used to develop a vaccine against all common strains of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotavirus Diarrhea Program 1999-2010 ===
IVI initiated the Rotavirus Diarrhea Program to provide policymakers in developing countries with the disease burden evidence and economic data needed to ensure the inclusion of [[Rotavirus vaccine|rotavirus vaccines]] in their [[Vaccination schedule|national immunization programs]]. Running from 1999 to 2010, the program conducted disease surveillance and economic studies in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Vietnam]]. In 2007, in collaboration with Vietnam’s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), IVI conducted a Phase II trial of [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK’s]] RotaRix rotavirus vaccine in [[Khánh Hòa Province|Khanh Hoa]], Vietnam. &amp;nbsp;In 2009, in collaboration with NIHE, [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], IVI completed a phase III trial of Merck’s RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine in [[Nha Trang]] Vietnam, where it vaccinated 900 infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2009|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

=== Dengue Vaccine Programs 2002-2016 ===

==== The Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI''')''' ====
The Pediatric [[Dengue fever|Dengue]] Vaccine Initiative was a product development partnership launched by IVI to accelerate the introduction of safe and effective [[dengue vaccine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for children in dengue-endemic countries. From 2002 to 2010, PDVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. PDVI made many contributions to dengue vaccine development, including:

* Development of a dengue vaccine partnership and global research network to develop, evaluate, and introduce dengue vaccines. Working with Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institute of Health]], and [[Sanofi Pasteur]], PDVI provided technical advice and support for the efficacy and clinical trials of their respective dengue vaccine candidates and established a consortium of field sites in dengue-endemic countries across Asia and the Americas.
* Establishment of two regional Dengue Prevention Boards in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas to disseminate information and make recommendations regarding the control of dengue through immunization.
* Collaboration with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to develop a free user-friendly software, [http://www.denguevaccine.org/resource-search/?types%5B%5D=2 DenguEcon], which can be used by policymakers to determine the economic impact of dengue.

In 2010, PDVI transitioned into the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2010|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2011|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI) ====
The successor to PDVI, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative was an IVI-led consortium with the [[World Health Organization]], [[Sabin Vaccine Institute|the Sabin Vaccine Institute]], the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR), and the [http://ivac.jhu.edu/ International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. DVI continued the work of PDVI and focused on laying the groundwork for dengue vaccine decision-making and vaccine introduction in endemic areas. Each consortium member was responsible for a specific component: WHO – information and guidance documents, and regulatory training activities; Johns Hopkins – dengue vaccine financing and strategic demand forecasting; and Sabin – communications and advocacy. Besides leading the consortium, IVI generated evidence for decision-making such as disease burden, country vaccine introduction cases and a global investment case. From 2010 to 2016, DVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[Gabon]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. From 2013-2015, with funding from [[Germany]]’s [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education &amp; Research (BMBF)]], IVI continued support for preclinical development of dengue vaccines by Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]] and Vietnam’s VaBiotech. After the 2016 licensure of [[Sanofi|Sanofi Pasteur’s]] Dengvaxia vaccine, the DVI project came to a close and its IVI staff transitioned to a new project, the Global Dengue &amp; [[Aedes]]-Transmitted Disease Consortium (GDAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivi.int/wp-content/uploads/kboard_attached/11/201610/IVI%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf|title=IVI 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ivi.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6/15/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signatory Countries of the IVI ===
As of January 2011, IVI includes 40 countries and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)''' as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty without the need for ratification, acceptance of approval. These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve '''Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines''', and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)'''. A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.

In short, in addition to the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]], 40 countries include [[Bangladesh]], [[Liberia]]**, [[Republic of Korea]]**, [[Bhutan]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], [[Brazil]]**, [[Mongolia]]**, [[Senegal]], [[China]]**, [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]]**, [[Ecuador]]**, [[Nepal]], [[Sweden]]**, [[Egypt]], [[Netherlands]]**, [[Tajikistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Oman]]**, [[Thailand]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]]**, [[Turkey]], [[Jamaica]], [[Panama]], [[Uzbekistan]]**, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Vietnam]]**, [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Peru]]**, [[Lebanon]], [[Philippines]]**, [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[India]], [[Kuwait]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivi.int/about_us/signatory_countries.html Governance. 'Signatory Countries.']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Kazuhiko Hasegawa'''|長谷川 和彦|Hasegawa Kazuhiko|born 5 January 1946}} is a Japanese [[film director]]. He won the award for Best Director at the [[1st Yokohama Film Festival]] for ''[[The Man Who Stole the Sun]]''.&lt;ref name="yokohama79"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/yokohama-eigasai/01-1979/01_1979_shou.html |script-title=ja:第1回ヨコハマ映画祭 １９７９年日本映画個人賞|accessdate= 2010-01-09|language= Japanese |publisher= [[Yokohama Film Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Hasegawa began his career in film at [[Nikkatsu]] in the early 1970s as a scriptwriter on such [[Pink film#Second wave (The Nikkatsu Roman Porno era 1971–1982)|''Roman porno'']] projects as [[Chūsei Sone]]'s ''Love Bandit Rat Man'' (1972), Yukihiro Sawada's ''[[Retreat Through the Wet Wasteland]]'' (1973) and [[Tatsumi Kumashiro]]'s ''Evening Primrose'' (1974). He also served as Assistant Director on the 1972 ''[[Woman on the Night Train]]'' and several other ''Roman porno'' films for Nikkatsu.&lt;ref name="jmdbkh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0284260.htm|script-title=ja:長谷川和彦|publisher=JMDB|accessdate=2011-11-14|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharp237"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema|year=2008|publisher=FAB Press|location=Guildford|isbn=978-1-903254-54-7|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jacoby38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Alexander|title=A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors|year=2008|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-1-933330-53-2|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Nikkatsu, he made his debut as a director in the October 1976 ''[[The Youth Killer]]'', produced by [[Art Theatre Guild|ATG]], a provocative study of alienation focusing on a young killer. In 1979, he directed his second film, the black comedy ''[[The Man Who Stole the Sun]]'',&lt;ref name="jacoby38"/&gt; which won him the Best Director award at the 1979 [[Yokohama Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="yokohama79"/&gt; This was Hasegawa's last film and although he never returned to directing, he was one of the founding members of the [[Director's Company]] in 1982 where he devoted himself to helping young directors.&lt;ref name="sharp237"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacoby38"/&gt;

He has also occasionally appeared as an actor, including a role in [[Banmei Takahashi]]'s 1982 {{nihongo|''Wolf''|狼|Ōkami}}, produced by Director's Company, and later in [[Seijun Suzuki]]'s 1991 ''[[Yumeji]]''.&lt;ref name="jmdbkh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacoby38"/&gt;

'''Meralda Elva Junior Warren''' (born 28 June 1959) is an artist and poet of the [[Pitcairn Island]]s, a remote [[British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. She works in both English and [[Pitkern language|Pitkern]], the island's distinctive [[creole language]]. Her book, ''Mi Base side orn Pitcairn'', written with the island's six children, is the first to be written and published in both English and Pitkern. As an artist, she works with [[tapa cloth]], a Polynesian tradition. She has also published a cookbook featuring Pitcairn Island cuisine. 

Warren has also served as the island's nurse, its only police officer, a [[ham radio operator]], and as a member of the territory's governing council, among many other roles.

==Biography==
Warren was born on Pitcairn Island on 28 June 1959, the second child of Jacob Ralph "Chippie" Warren (1920–2007) and Mavis Mary Brown (born 1936).&lt;ref name="PUCPitcairnersIndex"&gt;Pacific Union College Pitcairn Islands Study Center. [http://library.puc.edu/pitcairn/pitcairn/Pitcairners/index.shtml Who Are the Pitcairners?]. Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren is the sister of [[Jay Warren]] (born 1950) who served as the third mayor of the Pitcairn Islands (2004–2007), and previously as the colony's 29th magistrate (1991–1997).&lt;ref name="PUCPitcairnersIndex" /&gt; She is a first cousin of [[Mike Warren (mayor)|Mike Warren]] (born 1964), the colony's fourth mayor (2007–2014).&lt;ref name="PUCPitcairnersIndex" /&gt; She is the descendant of mutineers from the famed [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny on the ''Bounty'']] (1789) and of the Tahitian men and women who journeyed with the mutineers in settling the island in 1790.&lt;ref name="PUCPitcairnersIndex" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WarrenAboutMe"&gt;Warren, Meralda [http://www.meraldaonpitcairn.com/aboutme.htm "About Me and about my mum Mavis"] on Maimiti Haven Artworld (personal website).

New York: Simon and Schuster, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.xiii–xvii}}

===Artist, poet, author and many other jobs===
Warren is a poet, and the author of two books, including ''Mi Base side orn Pitcairn'' ("My Favourite Place on Pitcairn"), written with children on Pitcairn Island. It is the first book written and published in [[Pitkern language|Pitkern]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.government.pn/shop/books.html Pitcairn Island Books] at The Government of the
Pitcairn Islands online portal. Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BPC"&gt;Bounty-Pitcairn Conference 2012. [http://2012bpc.com/special.htm Special Meralda Warren Tapa Exhibit at BPC 2012]. Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her works include a cookbook, ''Taste of Pitcairn'' featuring the cuisine of the Pitcairn Islands, and poetry in both Pitkern and English. Pitkern is an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole language]] derived from eighteenth-century English and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]. She writes poetry in both English and Pitkern.

In 2007, Warren revived Pitcairn's tradition of art created on [[tapa cloth]], a woven bark cloth common in [[Polynesian culture]]. Her works have been displayed in museums and galleries in [[Tahiti]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donoghue, Tim.

She is the first recipient from the Pitcairn Islands.&lt;ref name="BPC" /&gt;

Pitcairn has a small population. The island's 48 residents often serve in several capacities or jobs.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|pp.31}} Warren describes her many roles on her personal website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Travelling with patients to New Zealand and Tahiti and taking up Nursing, Radio Operator for the shore to ship skeds from ZBP station and twice daily contact with Auckland international Radio telephone link, Working in our Co-op store, Council member for many years as well as being the Governors appointee member to council a few times, Becoming the first female Police &amp; Immigration Officer for a few years. Lands Commission president, Lands court member, Bee keeper since 1978. ASL operator for siesmic Vault, Installing wireless networking throughout Adamstown, Duncan cleaner, Contract Lawnmowing jobs, and many misc jobs inc Tourism and Entertainment. PHEWWwww. it became apprent to me that what I enjoy most is my art. (T)his is getting pushed aside whilst I am working these time consuming no pay or low paid positions which was making me very tired and yes....Bitchy{{sic}}&lt;ref name="WarrenAboutMe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning in 1996, Warren served as [[Law enforcement in the Pitcairn Islands|the island's only police officer]]. However, since no one had been arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties involved issuing driving licences and stamping visitors' passports.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|pp.30–31}} Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job because everyone on the island had a "job". The island's jail was described as "the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites", and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|pp.31}} When the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal, a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices, stating "It was glaringly obvious...that their standard of policing was not really adequate."&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|pp.31}}

Warren was [[Pitcairn Islands general election, 2004|elected on 15 December 2004]] to the [[Island Council (Pitcairn)|Island Council]]. As a radio operator, she broadcasts under the call sign VP6MW.&lt;ref name="WarrenAboutMe" /&gt;

===Pitcairn's sexual abuse trial===
{{Main|Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004}}
Warren was an outspoken critic of accusations that the island's girls had been sexually abused when young, and the prosecution of a selected number of Pitcairn's male residents. She claimed that young girls on Pitcairn customarily became sexually active after age 12, a practice of underage sex that had been accepted as a Polynesian tradition since the settlement of the island in 1790. One resident, Olive Christian, said of her girlhood, "We all thought sex was like food on the table."&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt; 

Many Pitcairn Island men blamed the British police for persuading the women involved to press charges. Some of the women agreed, and advocated a [[conspiracy theory]] that the trial was, in Warren's words, "a British plot to jail the [community's] able-bodied men and 'close' the island", and that the British officials "picked on all the viable young men, the ones who are the backbone of this place".&lt;ref name="marks"&gt;Marks, Kathy.[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/growing-up-on-pitcairn-we-all-thought-sex-was-like-food-on-table-547980.html "Growing up on Pitcairn: 'We all thought sex was like food on table'"], ''The Independent'' (London), 29 September 2004. (link dead 27 November 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the island's residents denied or excused the allegations.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|p.85}} During the trial, Warren circulated a poem titled "Is Seven a Lucky Number?" that criticized the British government and lawyers' attempts to impose British law against their island's traditions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;“There’s never an age consent set in our Laws
Oh 16 is in the British clause
What book they choose
What next law will they ruse
Why must these Seven men be used”&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|p.132}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the case wore on, Warren reflected that "the bottom had fallen out of our world … We lost our trust for each other."&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|p.85}} Her brother, Jay Warren, who was accused of "indecent assault", was the only defendant among the seven accused to be acquitted on 24 October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Fickling, David.

Warren was convicted of assault during a drunken disagreement with another resident when the two were angered by tensions over the sexual abuse matter. The case was prosecuted by a Crown prosecutor and tried by a New Zealand magistrate. Warren was fined NZ$60. The case cost the British government NZ$40,000 to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;{{rp|p.179}}

'''National Honey Month''' is a celebratory and promotional event held annually during the month of September in the [[United States]].

Its purpose is to promote [[Beekeeping in the United States|American beekeeping]], the beekeeping industry, and [[honey]] as a natural and beneficial sweetener.

September is significant for honey producers as it is the month that marks the end of the honey collection season for many beekeepers in the United States.

;History
The [[List of commemorative months|awareness month]] was initiated by The National Honey Board, a [[United States Department of Agriculture|United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)]] founded and overseen organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
{{see also|Twelve-step program#History |l1=Twelve-step program: History}}

The first meetings began in February 1982 in [[Southern California]] by several AA members to focus specifically on smoking cessation. These AA members began meeting under the name Smokers Anonymous in [[Los Angeles]]. Shortly thereafter another group independently started in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NICASITEHIST"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief History of Nicotine Anonymous | format = PDF | author = Nicotine Anonymous | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | url = http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070923032832/http://nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, a [[Manhattan, New York]] group of meetings formed independently, also formed by recovering AA members, specifically to  address their smoking [[addiction]]. They called themselves "AA for Non-Smokers".  During the same period, two groups started in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Then in May 1985, Maurice Z., a [[California]] member, authored an article for [[Reader’s Digest]]. Thousands of letters poured in from people wanting to know more about this new Twelve-Step fellowship. That year Smokers Anonymous groups started independently in [[Woodstock, NY]] and in [[Islip, NY]]. Within a year there were a hundred meetings identified.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

In 1986 the group members met for their first conference  in [[Bakersfield, California]] to form a fellowship, originally known as ''Smokers Anonymous''.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NICASITEHIST"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief History of Nicotine Anonymous | format = PDF | author = Nicotine Anonymous | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | url = http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070923032832/http://nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups met again in 1987 in [[Monterey, California]]. In April 1988, the fellowship’s first official World Services Conference was held in [[San Francisco]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The fellowship was renamed Nicotine Anonymous in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at the 1990 World Services Conference because the Smokers Anonymous trademark was not available, but also, importantly, the delegates decided the focus of recovery should be on the drug nicotine rather than any single nicotine delivery system.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

In 2000, "NicA" was selected to abbreviate Nicotine Anonymous at the annual World Service Conference.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NICASITEHIST"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief History of Nicotine Anonymous | format = PDF | author = Nicotine Anonymous | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | url = http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070923032832/http://nicotine-anonymous.org/admin/prod_images/Brief%20History%20of%20Nicotine%20Anonymousrevised.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://nicotine-anonymous.org/overview1.html|website=Nicotine Anonymous|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nicotine Anonymous: The Book|publisher=Nicotine Anonymous World Services|location=Dallas, TX|isbn=0-9770115-5-0|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Adapted with permission of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] World Services, Inc., the [[Twelve Traditions]] are utilized by Nicotine Anonymous as fundamental guiding principles. Nicotine Anonymous operates with an elected, all volunteer, nine member board of officers and a set of [[by-laws]]. The board meets regularly to discuss how to be of service to the organization including organizing its annual World Service Conference and monitoring a number of appointed committee coordinators and the Nicotine Anonymous World Service home office located in [[Dallas, TX]]. The office keeps regularly updated meeting lists, manages the website and its online store, distributes NicA literature and free Meeting Starter Kits, and serves as a resource for members or any interested nicotine user.{{fact|date=August 2017}} There are no dues or fees for NicA membership, as stated in Tradition Three: "the only requirement for Nicotine Anonymous membership is a desire to stop using nicotine."&lt;ref name="NICATRADITIONS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/pubs_content.php?pub_id=19 |title=Nicotine Anonymous Publications, Literature and Pamphlets |accessdate=2008-05-01 |date=2008-05-01 |author=Nicotine Anonymous |publisher=Nicotine Anonymous World Services |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501022443/http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/pubs_content.php?pub_id=19 |archivedate=2008-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicotine Anonymous Steps &amp; Traditions|url=http://nicotine-anonymous.org/basics.html|website=Nicotine Anonymous|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison ==
There are several commercial and nonprofit programs supporting smoking cessation programs in the United States. Low-cost options, in addition to Nicotine Anonymous, are sponsored by groups such as The [[American Cancer Society]], The [[American Lung Association]], The [[American Heart Association]] and The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Commercial programs include cognitive-behavioral group therapy, [[nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacement therapies]] and [[bupropion]]. Combinations of these approaches, marketed in commercial packages such as Smokeless and Smoke Stoppers, are licensed to treatment providers and conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis. These are in addition to local programs ran by regional treatment facilities.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GREEN2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Green |first=Amanda |author2=Yancy, William S. |author3=Braxton, Loretta |author4= Westman, Eric C.  |title=Residential Smoking Therapy |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=275–280 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.2003.11114.x |date=April 2003 |pmid=12709094 |pmc=1494850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weekly NicA meeting is ongoing and therefore unique among the array of treatment options because nicotine users and ex-nicotine users can enter and leave the process as they please. Most other treatment programs are structured as limited duration programs, with only a certain number of sessions, making it difficult for members to pick it up midway through or begin when a program is not being offered.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt;

In 1996, NicA ranked twelfth in size among the thirteen twelve-step organizations studied by Klaus Makela.&lt;ref name="MAKELA1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Makela |first=Klaus |title=Alcoholics Anonymous as a Mutual-help Movement: A Study in Eight Societies |year=1996 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |isbn=0-299-15004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsorship and lifetime attendance is not emphasized as much as in other [[twelve-step program]]s. The average meeting size is about seven people.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt;

Although both drinking and smoking are recognized by many respondents as imposing burdens on the family,&lt;ref name="ROBIN1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robin |first=Room |title=Patterns of family responses to alcohol and tobacco problems |journal=Drugs and Alcohol Review |volume=15 |issue=2 |date=June 1996 |pages=171–181 |doi=10.1080/09595239600185821 |pmid=16203367}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no auxiliary support groups for friends and family of smokers related to NicA; as [[Al-Anon]] meetings were created for friends and family members of [[alcoholics]]. Nicotine Anonymous World Services does, however, offer a pamphlet, ''Are You Concerned About Someone Who Smokes or Chews Tobacco?'' with information for friends and family of nicotine users.&lt;ref name="NICAPUBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/pubs_content.php?pub_id=7 |title=Nicotine Anonymous Publications: Pamphlets in English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110001732/http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/pubs.php|archivedate=January 10, 2013|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
{{see also|Twelve-step program#Effectiveness |l1=Twelve-step program: Effectiveness}}

Success in achieving smoking abstinence using current smoking therapies such as Nicotine Anonymous, cognitive-behavioral group therapy, nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion (Zyban) ranges from 9% to 40% in different studies.&lt;ref name="GREEN2003"/&gt; Alcoholics and drug addicts have better smoking cessation success rates when attempting to quit smoking early in recovery.&lt;ref name="SUSSMAN2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sussman | first = S. | title = Smoking cessation among persons in recovery |  journal = Substance Use and Misuse | volume = 37 | issue = 8 – 10 | year = 2002 | pages = 1275–1298 | pmid = 12180567 | issn = 1082-6084 | doi = 10.1081/JA-120004185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining psychosocial and pharmacological treatments increases smoking cessation success rates.&lt;ref name="HUGHES2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hughes | first = John R. | title = Motivating and Helping Smokers to Stop Smoking | journal = Journal of General Internal Medicine | issn = 0884-8734 | volume = 18 | issue = 12 |date=December 2003 | pages = 1053–1057 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2003.20640.x | pmid = 14687265 | pmc = 1494968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture, hypnosis, inpatient treatment, and Nicotine Anonymous have not been shown effective thus far.&lt;ref name="FIORE2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fiore |first=Michael C. |author2=Bailey, William C. |author3=Cohen, Stuart J. |author4=Dorfman, Sally Faith |author5=Goldstein, Michael G. |author6=Gritz, Ellen R. |author7=Heyman, Richard B. |author8=Jaén, Carlos Roberto |author9=Kottke, Thomas E. |author10=Lando, Harry A. |author11=Mecklenburg, Robert E. |author12=Mullen, Patricia Dolan |author13=Nett, Louise M. |author14=Robinson, Lawrence |author15=Stitzer, Maxine L. |author16=Tommasello, Anthony C. |author17=Villejo, Louise |author18=Wewers, Mary Ellen |title=Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: Clinical Practice Guideline |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service |date=June 2000 |location=[[Rockville, MD]] |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=hstat2.chapter.7644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a controlled study 205 alcoholics, with heavy tobacco dependence (an average of 26.8 cigarettes per day) and three months or more of continuous abstinence from drugs and alcohol, were placed at random in one of three treatment groups: an American Lung Association Quit Program plus Nicotine Anonymous meetings group, a behavioral counseling plus physical exercise group, or a behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group.  The effectiveness of the treatment programs was measured at post-treatment, six months, and twelve-months following post-treatment based on self-reports confirmed by confirmed biochemical and informant reports. Immediately following treatment the behavior counseling and exercise group had the highest quit percentage (60%) followed by the behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group, with the ALA quit program plus NicA group at 31%. At the six-month follow up all groups had similar percentages of members maintaining abstinence from tobacco (29%, 27%, and 21%, respectively) and also at twelve-months (27%, 27%, and 26%, respectively). Out of all the participants, only 4% relapsed on alcohol or drugs. The alcohol relapse rate did not differ by treatment group.&lt;ref name="MARTIN1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=M.E. |author2=Calfas, K.J. |author3=Patten, C.A. |author4=Polarek, M. |author5=Hofstetter, C.R. |author6=Noto, J. |author7= Beach, D.  |title=Prospective evaluation of three smoking interventions in 205 recovering alcoholics: one-year results of Project SCRAP-Tobacco |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |issn=1939-2117 |date=February 1997 |volume= 65|issue=1 |pages=190–194 |pmid=9103749 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.65.1.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
In a survey of 104 smokers (ages 18 and older) 78% reported they believed spiritual resources could be helpful in an attempt to quit smoking. In the same survey, male smokers, ages 31 and over, and females were found to be significantly more open to using spiritual resources in the smoking cessation process than controls. Heavy smokers, those smoking more than fifteen cigarettes per day, were also significantly more receptive to encouragement of spiritual resources in an attempt to quit.&lt;ref name="GONZALES2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gonzales | first = David |author2=Redtomahawk, Donovan |author3=Pizacani, Barbara |author4=Bjornson, Wendy G. |author5=Spradley, Janet |author6=Allen, Elizabeth |author7= Lees, Paul  |date=February 2007 | pages = 299–303 | doi = 10.1080/14622200601078582 | journal = Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research | title = Support for spirituality in smoking cessation: Results of pilot survey | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a770733791~db=all | volume = 9 | pmid = 17365761 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholism|Alcoholics]] may have experienced twelve-step approaches to recovery and therefore may be more open to the possibility that same approach can be used to initiate and maintain abstinence from tobacco use.&lt;ref name="HURT2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hurt | first = Richard D. |author2=Patten, Christi A.  | title = Treatment of Tobacco Dependence in Alcoholics  | journal = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-306-47939-7 | doi = 10.1007/b100495 | pages = 335–359 | publisher = Kluwer Academic | location = New York | pmid=12638636 | series = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | editor1-last = Galanter | editor1-first = Marc | editor2-last = Begleiter | editor2-first = Henri | editor3-last = Deitrich | editor3-first = Richard |display-editors = 3 | editor4-last = Gallant | editor4-first = Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of ''Nicotine Anonymous: The Book'' published results of an internal survey of members showing that 25% of members responding to a survey on the topic reported they had prior twelve-step experience.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt; Many smokers do not see group treatment as a potentially useful.&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lichtenstein |first=E |author2=Hollis, J.  |title=Patient referral to a smoking cessation program: who follows through? |journal=Journal of Family Practice |volume=34 |issue=6 |date=June 1992 |pages=739–744 |pmid=1593248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
A NicA pamphlet, ''Tips for Gaining Freedom from Nicotine'', was reviewed in 1999 by a [[convenience sample]] of twelve professional colleagues of psychologist Edward Lichtenstein. These professionals were asked to review the cessation tips from the pamphlet and rate them on whether they were cognitive, behavioral, or neither. To that extent, they also rated how consistent the tips were with current cognitive-behavioral cessation techniques. It was found that many of the tips were very consistent with modern cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment programs. The cognitive behavioral tips included setting dates, making commitments, planning things to keep one's mind off smoking, having something to fidget with, having something to put in one's mouth, rewarding oneself when goals have been met, remembering that discomfort associated with withdrawal will subside within two weeks. One tip was found to be spiritual, "Pray instead of puff".&lt;ref name="LICHTENSTEIN1999"/&gt; Since 1999 many of the NicA pamphlets have been updated and current versions may not contain the information analyzed.&lt;ref name="NICAPUBS"/&gt;

Regulations such as pre-harvest intervals also often prevent harvest of crop or livestock products if recently treated in order to allow residue concentrations to decrease over time to safe levels before harvest. Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns.&lt;ref name=EPAres&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/eroe/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail.viewInd&amp;lv=list.listByAlpha&amp;r=224028&amp;subtop=312|title=Pesticide Residue|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these chemical residues, especially derivatives of chlorinated pesticides, exhibit [[bioaccumulation]]  which could build up to harmful levels in the body as well as in the environment.&lt;ref name=chlorinatedpest&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Walter J Crinnion. |title=Chlorinated Pesticides: Threats to Health and Importance of Detection |journal=Environmental Medicine. |volume=14 |pages=347–59 |year=2009 |pmid=20030461 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persistent organic pollutant|Persistent chemical]]s can be magnified through the [[food chain]] and have been detected in products ranging from meat, poultry, and fish, to vegetable oils, nuts, and various fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=fattyfood&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Stephen W.C.

==Definition==
{{See also|Pesticides}}
A pesticide is a substance or a mixture of substances used for killing  [[pest (animal)|pests]]: organisms dangerous to cultivated plants or to animals. The term applies to various pesticides such as [[insecticide]], [[fungicide]], [[herbicide]] and [[nematocide]].&lt;ref&gt;US Environmental (July 24, 2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/index.htm What is a pesticide?] epa.gov. Retrieved on October 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of pesticides to crops and animals may leave residues in or on food when it is consumed, and those specified derivatives are considered to be of toxicological significance.&lt;ref&gt;IPCS INCHEM (1975),[http://www.inchem.org/documents/jmpr/jmpmono/v075pr40.htm ] Retrieved on October 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
From post-World War II era, chemical pesticides have become the most important form of [[pest control]]. There are two categories of pesticides, first-generation pesticides and second-generation pesticide. The first-generation pesticides, which were used prior to 1940, consisted of compounds such as [[arsenic]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]]. These were soon abandoned because they were highly toxic and ineffective. The second-generation pesticides were composed of synthetic organic compounds. The growth in these pesticides accelerated in late 1940s after Paul Müller discovered [[DDT]] in 1939. The effects of pesticides such as [[aldrin]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[chlordane]], [[parathion]], [[captan]] and [[2,4-D]] were also found at this time.&lt;ref name="pubs.caes.uga.edu"&gt;Pesticide Usage in the United States: History, Benefits, Risks, and Trends; Bulletin 1121, November 2000, K.S.

Last updated Oct. 22, 2012, http://people.oregonstate.edu/~muirp/pesthist.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Those pesticides were widely used due to its effective pest control. However, in 1946, people started to resist to the widespread use of pesticides, especially [[DDT]] since it harms non-target plants and animals. People became aware of problems with residues and its potential health risks.&lt;ref name="pubs.caes.uga.edu"/&gt; In the 1960s, [[Rachel Carson]] wrote ''[[Silent Spring]]'' to illustrate a risk of [[DDT]] and how it is threatening [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lobe, J (Sept 16, 2006), "WHO urges DDT for malaria control Strategies," Inter Press Service, cited from Commondreams.org. Retrieved on September 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Each country adopts their own agricultural policies and  [[Maximum Residue Limit]]s (MRL) and [[Acceptable Daily Intake]] (ADI). The level of food additive usage varies by country because forms of agriculture are different in regions according to their geographical or climatical factors.

Pre-harvest intervals are also set to require a crop or livestock product not be harvested before a certain period after application in order to allow the pesticide residue to decrease below maximum residue limits or other tolerance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preharvest Interval|url=http://npic.orst.edu/health/phi.html|website=npic.orst.edu|publisher=National Pesticide Information Center|accessdate=30 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, restricted entry intervals are the amount of time to allow residue concentrations to decrease before a worker can reenter an area where pesticides have been applied without protective equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pesticides - Re-entry Interval : OSH Answers|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/pesticides/reentry.html|website=www.ccohs.ca|publisher=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety|accessdate=30 March 2018|language=en|date= 2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Some countries use the International Maximum Residue Limits -[[Codex Alimentarius]] to define the residue limits; this was established by [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1963 to develop international food standards, guidelines  codes of practices, and recommendation for food safety. Currently the CODEX has 185 Member Countries and 1 member organization (EU).&lt;ref&gt;CODEX International Food Standards (Oct 23, 2012)[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/en/] Retrieved on October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
{{See also|Pesticides in the European Union}}
In September 2008, the European Union issued new and revised Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for the roughly 1,100 pesticides ever used in the world. The revision was intended to simplify the previous system, under which certain pesticide residues were regulated by the Commission; others were regulated by Member States, and others were not regulated at all.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. (2008). [http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/protection/pesticides/index_en.htm Plant Protection - Pesticide Residues]. [http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/protection/pesticides/explanation_pesticide_residues.pdf Fact Sheet].&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Pesticide residues in New Zealand}}
[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] develops the standards for levels of pesticide residues in foods through a consultation process. The [[New Zealand Food Safety Authority]] publishes the maximum limits of pesticide residues for foods produced in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/policy-law/legislation/food-standards/|title=Food Standards|publisher=New Zealand Food Safety Authority|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Monitoring of pesticide residues in the UK began in the 1950s. From 1977 to 2000 the work was carried out by the Working Party on Pesticide Residues (WPPR), until in 2000 the work was taken over by the Pesticide Residue Committee (PRC). The PRC advise the government through the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the [[Food Standards Agency]] (FSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CRD |url=http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/prc.asp?id=824#History_of_residues_monitoring_in_the_UK |title=CRD &amp;#124; About PRiF &amp;#124; The Role of the PRiF |publisher=Pesticides.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the US, tolerances for the amount of pesticide residue that may remain on food are set by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], and measures are taken to keep pesticide residues below the tolerances. The US EPA has a web page for the  allowable tolerances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/40cfr180_04.html |title=Protection of Environment |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |date=2004-07-01 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to assess the risks associated with pesticides on human health, the EPA analyzed individual pesticide active ingredients as well as the common toxic effect that groups of pesticides have, called the cumulative risk assessment. Limits that the EPA sets on pesticides before approving them includes a determination of how often the pesticide should be used and how it should be used, in order to protect the public and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/health/human.htm#healtheffects|date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[USDA]] also routinely check food for the actual levels of pesticide residues.

A US organic food advocacy group, the [[Environmental Working Group]], is known for creating a list of fruits and vegetables referred to as the Dirty Dozen; it lists produce with the highest number of distinct pesticide residues  or most samples with residue detected in [[USDA]] data. This list is generally considered misleading and lacks scientific credibility because it lists detections without accounting for the risk of the usually small amount of each residue with respect to consumer health.&lt;ref name="Winter2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winter|first1=Carl K.|last2=Katz|first2=Josh M.|title=Dietary Exposure to Pesticide Residues from Commodities Alleged to Contain the Highest Contamination Levels|journal=Journal of Toxicology|date=2011|volume=2011|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2011/589674|pmid=21776262|pmc=3135239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gribble2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gribble|first1=Gordon W.|title=Food chemistry and chemophobia|journal=Food Security|date=3 March 2013|volume=5|issue=2|pages=177–187|doi=10.1007/s12571-013-0251-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Organic Produce Can Make America Less Healthy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-09/how-organic-produce-can-make-america-less-healthy|accessdate=20 May 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=9 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over 99% of samples of US produce had no pesticide residue or had residue levels well below the [[EPA]] tolerance levels for each pesticide.&lt;ref name="PDP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pesticide Data Program|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/2016PDPAnnualSummary.pdf|publisher=USDA|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
In Japan,  pesticide residues are regulated by the [[:ja:食品衛生法|Food Safety Act]].

Pesticide tolerances are set by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] through the Drug and Food Safety Committee. Unlisted residue amounts are restricted to 0.01ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |date=May 2006 |title=The Japanese Positive List System for Agricultural Chemical Residues in Foods |publisher=The Japan Food Chemical Research Foundation |url=http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/FFCRHOME.nsf/pages/MRLs-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In China, the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] and the [[Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Agriculture]] have jointly established mechanisms and working procedures relating to maximum residue limit standards, while updating them continuously, according to the [[Food safety in China|food safety law]] and regulations issued by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture Released MRL Standards|url=http://www.chinapesticide.gov.cn/doc10/10122912.html|work=China Pesticide Information Network|publisher=Press Office of the Ministry of Agriculture|accessdate=16 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227041753/http://www.chinapesticide.gov.cn/doc10/10122912.html|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China released 85 kinds of food pesticide maximum residue limits|url=http://cn.agropages.com/News/NewsDetail---2978---NewsCn.htm|publisher=World agricultural network Chinese network|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From '''GB25193-2010'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum Residue Limits for 12 Pesticides|url=http://down.foodmate.net/standard/sort/3/25573.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|archiveurl=GB 25193-2010 食品中百菌清等12种农药最大残留限量  http://down.foodmate.net/standard/sort/3/25573.html|archivedate=29 July 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to '''GB28260-2011''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum Residue Limits for 85 Pesticides|url=http://down.foodmate.net/standard/sort/3/28878.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|archiveurl=GB 28260-2011 食品安全国家标准 食品中阿维菌素等85种农药最大残留限量  http://down.foodmate.net/standard/sort/3/28878.html|archivedate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Maximum Residue Limits for 12 Pesticides to 85 pesticides, they have improved the standards in response to Chinese national needs.

== Health impacts ==
{{main|Health effects of pesticides}}
Many pesticides achieve their intended use of killing pests by [[neurotoxicity|disrupting the nervous system]]. Due to similarities in brain biochemistry among many different organisms, there is much speculation that these chemicals can have a negative impact on humans as well.&lt;ref name=neurotox&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Marina Bjørling-Poulsen |author2=Helle Raun Andersen |author3=Philippe Grandjean. |title=Potential developmental neurotoxicity of pesticides used in Europe |journal=Environmental Health. |volume= 7|pages= 50|year=2008 |pmid=18945337 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-50 |pmc=2577708}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are [[epidemiological]] studies that show positive correlations between exposure to pesticides through occupational hazard, which tends to be significantly higher than that ingested by the general population through food, and the occurrence of certain cancers.&lt;ref name=Damalas&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=ChristosA. Damalas |author2=IliasG. Eleftherohorinos. |title=Pesticide Exposure, Safety Issues, and Risk Assessment Indicators |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume=8 |pages=1402–19 |year=2011 |pmid=21655127 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8051402 |issue=5 |pmc=3108117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although  most of the general population may not exposed to large portion of pesticides, many of the pesticide residues that are attached tend to be lipophilic and can bio-accumulate in the body.&lt;ref name=chlorinatedpest/&gt;

According to the [[American Cancer Society]] there is no evidence that pesticide residues increase the risk of people getting cancer.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; They advise washing fruit and vegetables before eating to remove both pesticide residue and other undesirable contaminants.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-common-questions |accessdate=12 December 2015 |date= 9 April 2015 |title=ACS Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention – Common questions about diet and cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese incidents ===
In China, a number of incidents have occurred where state limits were exceeded by large amounts or where the wrong pesticide was used. In August 1994, a serious incident of [[pesticide poisoning]] of [[sweet potato]] crops occurred in Shandong province, China. Because local farmers were not fully educated in the use of insecticides, they used the highly-toxic pesticide named [[parathion]] instead of [[trichlorphon]]. It resulted in over 300 cases of poisoning and 3 deaths. Also, there was a case where a large number of students were poisoned and 23 of them were hospitalized because of vegetables that contained excessive pesticide residues.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Pesticide Pollution and Its Countermeasures in China Xu Hui, Qian Yi, Peng Bu-zhuo, Jiang Xiliu and Hua Xiao-mei Ambio Vol. 32, No. 1 (Feb., 2003), pp. 78-80 Published by: Springer Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/4315337&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child neurodevelopment ===

Children are thought to be especially vulnerable to exposure to pesticide residues, especially if exposure occurs at critical windows of development. Infants and children consume higher amounts of food and water relative to their body-weight have higher surface area (i.e. skin surface) relative to their volume, and have a more permeable blood-brain barrier, and engage in behaviors like crawling and putting objects in their mouths, all of which can contribute to increased risks from exposure to pesticide residues through food or environmental routes.&lt;ref name=pediatrics&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Bernard Weiss |author2=Sherlita Amler |author3=Robert W. Amler. |title=Pesticides |journal=Pediatrics |volume=113 |pages=1030–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15060196 |issue=4 Suppl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurotoxins and other chemicals that originate from pesticides pose the biggest threat to the developing human brain and nervous system{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. Presence of pesticide metabolites in urine samples have been implicated in disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, behavioral and emotional problems, and delays in development{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. There is a lack of evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between long-term, low-dose exposure to pesticide residues and neurological disease, partly because manufacturers are not always legally required to examine potential long-term threats{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11259">The '''Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS''' ('''PACHA''') was a commission formed by President 
[[Bill Clinton]] in 1995 to provide recommendations on the US government's response to the [[AIDS]] epidemic.  President [[George W. Bush]] and Secretary [[Tommy G. Thompson]] renewed the Council's charter on July 19, 2001.  All ten existing members of the Council were dismissed by President Donald Trump on 28 December 2017, following the resignation of six members in June 2017 in protest at Trump's health policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/12/29/trump-administration-fires-all-members-of-hivaids-advisory-council/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_aids-council-445pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory|title=Trump administration fires all members of HIV/AIDS advisory council|work=The Washington Post|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The '''Council''' was not the first Presidential inquiry into [[HIV]]. In 1987, [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed the [[President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic]] (1987–88) to investigate the [[AIDS]] epidemic. This was followed by the [[National Commission on AIDS]] (1989-1993).

== Criticism ==
{{Update|section|date=April 2016}}
Critics have said they lack confidence in PACHA and note that the Council as reorganized under [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] held only two meetings in 2002 and issued only five recommendations to the White House. By comparison, the [[President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic]] (Watkins Commission) submitted 597 recommendations to the [[Reagan Administration]].

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] released a report in February 2004 entitled [[Scientific Integrity in Policymaking]] that said that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] intentionally appointed under-qualified individuals to PACHA as part of a broader effort to manipulate the government's scientific advisory system by providing the appearance of expert advice while controlling the advice given.

Critics pointed to the appointment of Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a Texas-based doctor known for rejecting the use of condoms to prevent the spread of [[HIV]] and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and for his advocacy of [[abstinence]]-only programs despite negligible evidence that they reduce pregnancy rates among young people.

Six members of the committee resigned in June 2017, citing as the reason that the president, "has no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and—most concerning—pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease".
In December 2017 Trump dismissed all the remaining 16 members.
Gabriel Maldonado, a former member of PACHA, said in a Washington Post article "Like any administration, they want their own people there," identifying "ideological and philosophical differences" and that many of the remaining members, including her, were appointed by former President Barack Obama.  "I was co-chair of the disparities committee," Maldonado added, "so much of my advocacy and policy references surrounded vulnerable populations, addressing issuing of diverse communities, specifically looking at the impacts of the LGBT community, namely, the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS to people of color, gay men, transgender women...and a lot of those key vulnerable populations are not being prioritized in this administration."
Newsweek stated that there were fears that "the charter for PACHA will be re-written with renewed focus on abstinence and religious, non-evidence based public health approaches." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/29/man-monster-trump-under-fire-dismissing-entire-hivaids-council-fedex-letter&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The representation of the body in Primal’s software is derived from medical scan data that has been interpreted by a team of Primal anatomists and translated into three-dimensional images by graphics specialists. The anatomy visuals are accompanied by three-dimensional animations that demonstrate function, biomechanics and surgical procedures.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''Salma Kikwete''' (born 30 November 1963) is a Tanzanian educator, activist, and politician who served as the [[First Lady of Tanzania]] from 2005 to 2015 as the wife of [[Tanzanian President]] [[Jakaya Kikwete]].&lt;ref name=jis&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Her Excellency Salma Kikwete|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/tanzania-visit-09/first-lady-profile.html|work=Jamaica Information Service|publisher=|date=2009-11-23|accessdate=2012-08-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804002412/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/tanzania-visit-09/first-lady-profile.html|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salma Kikwete originally worked as a teacher for more than twenty years.&lt;ref name=jis/&gt;

In 2005, the government launched a national campaign for voluntary [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] testing in [[Dar es Salaam]]. Salma Kikwete and her husband were among the first in the country to be tested.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Tanzanian leader takes Aids test |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6899134.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=|date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, she was Vice President of the Eastern Region of the [[Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS]] (OAFLA).&lt;ref name=jis/&gt; In 2012, the First Lady Salma Kikwete, former [[Botswana]] [[President of Botswana|President]] [[Festus Mogae]] and ten other African figures partnered with [[UNESCO]] and [[UNAIDS]] to support the Eastern and Southern Africa Commitment on HIV Prevention and Sexual Health for Young People, which was launched in November 2011.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Leaders to lobby for HIV Prevention and Sexual Health for Youth in Eastern and Southern Africa |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/hiv-and-aids/single-view/news/leaders_to_lobby_for_hiv_prevention_and_sexual_health_for_youth_in_eastern_and_southern_africa/ |work=[[UNESCO]] |publisher=|date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikwete also founded the ''Wanawake na Maendeleo'', or Women in Development (WAMA), a [[nonprofit]] which promotes development among women and children.&lt;ref name=jis/&gt;

Over a year after her husband left office, Salma Kikwete was appointed to a seat in the [[National Assembly of Tanzania|National Assembly]] by President [[John Magufuli]] on 1 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Karin Mngodo, [http://allafrica.com/stories/201703030412.html "The Salma Kikwete story"], ''The Citizen'', 3 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Siriraj Medical Museum''', nicknamed the '''Museum of Death''', is a medical [[museum]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Siriraj Medical Museum is open to the public and is a valuable resource for medical professionals and students. This museum consists of five small medical museums: Ellis Pathological Museum, Congdon Anatomical Museum, Sood Sangvichien Prehistoric Museum and Laboratory, Parasitology Museum, and Songkran Niyomsane Forensic Medicine Museum.

==Ellis Pathological Museum==
As the very first museum to be part of Siriraj Hospital, the Ellis Pathological Museum was founded by Prof. Dr. Aller G. Ellis, M.D., an American pathologist who began the practice of collecting disease-identified specimens of patients for his pathology class. The museum showcases the top killers of Thai people, heart disease and cancer, and different types of congenital anomalies along with proper treatment and preventive measures.

==Congdon Anatomical Museum==
Understanding human anatomy is at the core of the study of medicine. This museum has a collection, established by Dr Edgar Davidson Congdon, of more than 2,000 organs available for anatomical education. The museum displays the anatomical structure of all the systems of the human body, ranging from conception to reproductive age. Different forms of multiple births can be found on display. The range of muscles in the human body, the smallest of which is the size of an eyelash and the biggest of which is the size of a leg can also be seen. On display is a masterful dissection of the whole-body nervous and arterial system by Dr Patai Sirikarun, the one and only exhibit of its kind in the world.

==Sood Sangvichien Prehistoric Museum and Laboratory==
In 1960, Dr [[Sood Sangvichien]], a specialist in anatomy and anthropology, joined an excavating mission at the archaeological site at Chorakhe Phueak in Kanchanaburi Province. The site is considered to be one of Thailand's most significant prehistoric excavation sites. There, he had the opportunity to study the tools, appliances, ornaments, and earthenware that were buried with the skeletons. He collected these objects and they became the first exhibits at his museum, officially open to the public in 1972. The museum takes visitors back to prehistoric civilization, when pieces of a Homo erectus skeleton known as "Lampang man" were found in Thailand. "Lampang man" lived approximately 1,000,000 – 400,000 years ago, making him a contemporary of "[[Peking man]]". The exhibit includes tools from three different ages, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, aged over 1,000,000 – 4,000 years, as well as beads, colourful stones and various designs of painted earthenware.

==Parasitology Museum==
Dr Vichitr Chaiyaporn, the founder of this museum, collected parasites from his patients. They are displayed here with a presentation of their life cycle and natural habitat. A wide variety of parasites, ranging from those that are not visible to the naked eye (protozoa), to those up to a metre-long (flat worms) are on display, in addition to information about types of food, cooking processes favouring growth of the parasites, disease-carrying insects, venomous animals, and preventive measures.

==Songkran Niyomsane Forensic Medicine Museum==
Forensic medicine is the application of medical and scientific methodology to the identification of the causes of unnatural death. The exhibits include displays of skulls and various body parts in glass cases, many of them from [[murder]] victims, evidence that Dr Songkran Niyomsane, a forensic pathologist, collected in the course of his career.

This museum includes the [[mummy|mummified]] remains of the first known [[serial killer]] in modern Thai history, [[Si Ouey Sae Urng]], erroneously romanized on the exhibit as "Si Quey" (''sae'' signifies a [[China|Chinese]] clan name, in this case the family of ''Urng'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Si Quey was a [[cannibal]] who preyed on children in the 1950s, first murdering them and then eating them. He was finally caught, convicted, and executed. His mummified remains were put on display as a deterrent to others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/read/dead-baby-watching-at-bangkoks-medical-museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sisters of St. Joseph''', also known as the '''Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph''' and abbreviated '''C.S.J.''' or '''S.S.J.''', is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[congregation (Catholic)#Congregations as a historical category of religious institutes|religious congregation]] of women founded in [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], [[France]], in 1650. This Congregation has approximately 14,000 members worldwide: about 7,000 in the United States; 2,000 in France; and are active in fifty other countries.

==Composition==
{{Josephology}}
The [[Religious sister|Sister]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of Saint Joseph comprise three international congregations (Lyons, Chambéry, and Annecy) and four federations (French, Italian, US, and Canadian), representing more than 14,000 Sisters worldwide and founded by joseph romanos

==Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon==
The Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of Lyons number nearly 1,000, serving in four provinces (Maine, Mexico, India and Europe) in fifteen countries. The Sisters operate many Catholic schools and hospitals in France, the United States, Canada, Japan and England. In India they operate hospitals, homes, and orphanages.

===Foundation===
The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph was founded by [[Jean Paul Medaille|Jean-Pierre Medaille]] (although older accounts attribute his to his brother, Jean Paul). Medaille sought to establish an ecclesiastically approved congregation of women who would profess simple vows, live in a small group, with no specific apostolates and would dress in a common garb of the women of their day. The original six sisters were Anna Brun, an orphan; Marguerite Burdier; war widow, Claudia Chastel; Anna Chraleyer; Anna Vey, age 15; and Francoise Eyraud, a hospital administrator, served as superior of the new community for 30 years.&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csjboston.org/HISTORY.htm |title="Our Story", Sisters of St. Joseph, Boston |access-date=2013-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116161231/http://www.csjboston.org/History.htm |archive-date=2013-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of LePuy, France, Henri de Maupas gave the foundation canonical status. Although the Congregation celebrates October 15, 1650 as its beginning, there is evidence that points to an earlier founding, more likely between 1646 and 1650.&lt;ref name=Lyon&gt;[http://csjwinslowmaine.org/history.htm "History", Sisters of S. Joseph of Lyon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053212/http://www.csjwinslowmaine.org/history.htm |date=2002-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the women made ribbon and lace that gave them some income to support themselves. In turn they taught others to make lace and ribbon.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

The new Congregation enjoyed rapid growth, expanding into eighteen houses during the first decade. By the time of the [[French Revolution]], almost 150 years later, the Sisters had spread to twelve dioceses in the southeast corner of France. The Congregation of Saint Joseph was disbanded during the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=us&gt;[http://www.csjoseph.org/our_heritage.aspx "Our Heritage", U.S.Federation Sisters of Saint Joseph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321013044/http://www.csjoseph.org/our_heritage.aspx |date=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convents and chapels of the community were confiscated in 1793. The Sisters were forced to choose between returning to their families or leaving France to join communities in other countries. Some Sisters who remained became [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. Three in [[Dauphiné]] and two in [[Haute-Loire]] were sent to the [[guillotine]] because they refused to take the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|Civil Oath]]. Others were imprisoned at St-Didier, [[Feurs]] and [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]].

===Post-Revolutionary France===
The congregation was re-established in 1807 by [[Jeanne Fontbonne|Mother Saint John Fontbonne]] in [[Lyon, France]].&lt;ref name=phila&gt;[http://ssjphila.org/new/ministries/history "History", Sisters of Saint Joseph Philadelphia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529072431/http://ssjphila.org/new/ministries/history |date=2013-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As word of the Sisters' services and good deeds grew, dioceses throughout France requested the services of the restored Congregation. Houses were established in the dioceses of Lyon, Chambéry, Annecy, Gap, Bourg, and Bordeaux.&lt;ref name=Lyon/&gt;

In 1902 many French houses of the congregation were closed by the Government, in consequence of which a large number of Sisters left for Denmark, Russia and the United States. In 1996 the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg re-joined the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon as part of the latter's European Province.&lt;ref name=Lyon/&gt;

====Sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambery====
The center of the Congregation is in Rome. Other Provinces and Regions are located in Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, India, Italy, Mozambique, Norway, Pakistan, Sweden and Tanzania. The order has approximately 1,800 sisters in 18 countries.

=====History=====
In 1812 a colony of Sisters of St. Joseph was sent from Lyon to [[Chambéry]], in Savoy, France&lt;ref name=chambery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sistersofsaintjoseph.org/index.php?category=4|title=Sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambery|website=sistersofsaintjoseph.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Mother St. John Marcoux. She in turn sent sisters to Turin and to Pignerole in the Piedmont, thus giving rise to new branches of Saint Joseph sisters. In 1843 Mother Félicité became Mother Superior. More than eighty houses rose under her direction, and when, in 1861, a state normal school was opened at Rumilly, Savoy, France. it was placed in charge of the sisters. Meanwhile, the Chambéry sisters had been constituted a diocesan congregation, but as years went on a stronger administration became necessary.

The rule was therefore revised to meet the requirements of a generalate, and papal approbation was granted in 1874 by rescript of Pius IX. Under the new form of government the congregation is subject to a Superior General, whose term of office is six years and is divided into provinces, each possessing a novitiate. The novices, after two years probation, make annual vows for two years, after which they bind themselves by perpetual vows. The rule is based on that of St. Augustine.

====Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg====
{{Main|Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg}}
In 1819 a foundation from the motherhouse in Lyon was established in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Belley-Ars|Diocese of Belley]] under the leadership of Mother Saint Joseph Chaney. In 1823 the Sisters of that diocese formally separated from community in Lyon. They became a new and independent diocesan congregation under the leadership of Reverend Mother Saint Benoit Cornillon and the authority of Bishop Alexander Devie. Several other foundations spread from France throughout the world. In 1996 the Bourg congregation merged with the founding congregation of Lyon, as part of the latter's European Province.

====Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy====
The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy is an international congregation of about 500 sisters serving in the Congo, England, France, Gambia, India, Ireland, Senegal, Switzerland, Tanzania and Wales.&lt;ref name=Annecy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistersofstjoseph.org.uk/alluvium_004.htm|title=Where we are|first=SISTERS OF ST. JOSEPH OF ANNECY ENGLISH|last=PROVINCE|website=www.sistersofstjoseph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====History=====
In 1833, an SSJ community was founded in Annecy. The new Congregation grew and developed, and their first mission in India was established in 1849. A provincial house and novitiate are located in [[Visakhapatnam]] (once known as Waltair), [[Andhra Pradesh]].

In the summer of 1864, two Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy set out on a voyage from India to the UK to open a community in the small town of Devizes, Wiltshire, England. In 1946, Llantarnam Abbey in Wales was bought by the Sisters of St. Joseph and is home to a large community of Sisters. The Sisters farm the adjoining land. [[Llantarnam Abbey]] in [[Cwmbran]], South [[Wales]] stands on the site of a medieval Cistercian monastery. The Tŷ Croeso ecumenical retreat centre adjoins the Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tycroesocentre.co.uk/index.php?section=12|title=llantarnam abbey :: Ty Croeso Centre|website=www.tycroesocentre.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight houses in the United Kingdom, under the provincial house and novitiate at Llantarnam Abbey. The congregation now numbers 60, in charge of 10 elementary day and boarding-schools, with an attendance of about 2000. In [[Scotland]] at [[Blairs College|St Mary's College, Blairs]], 15 sisters have charge of the household arrangements and work of the college.

On March 19, 2015 the Bhubanwswar Province of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy opened St. Joseph's Hospital in the city of Agartala, Tripura, India.

==US Federation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph==
The Federation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph is a union of all the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the United States who claim a common origin in the foundation at LePuy, France in 1650. It was formed in 1966 and includes approximately 6,500 members of 16 Congregations throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

Member congregations are:

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet===
This congregation is composed of almost 1,200 vowed sisters who minister in four provinces and two vice provinces. The Congregational Center is located in Sunset Hills, a suburb of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

In the year 1834 Most Rev. [[Joseph Rosati]], Bishop of St. Louis, Missouri, called at the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at [[Lyon]] and asked Mother St. John Fontbonne, the superior, to send a colony of sisters to America to undertake instruction of deaf-mute children. The financial aid necessary was obtained through the Countess de la Roche Jacquelin. The bishop accepted six sisters to instruct the children, and in addition, two others to teach the deaf.&lt;ref name=stlouis&gt;[http://www.csjsl.org/our-heritage/history-of-the-st.-louis-province.php "History of the St. Louis province", Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Louis Province] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331035725/http://www.csjsl.org/our-heritage/history-of-the-st.-louis-province.php |date=2014-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 1836 the first six sisters set sail from [[Le Havre]], France on the ship ''Natchez''. After seven weeks at sea, they arrived in New Orleans March 5, where they were met by the Bishop of St. Louis and Rev. Timon, afterwards Bishop of Buffalo. Bishop Rosati had arranged for them to stay with the Ursuline Sisters in the city and met with them the next day. (He planned to travel north with them to St. Louis.) The sisters enjoyed the hospitality of the Ursulines for two weeks, learning much about life in the United States. The sisters also told them to disguise their religious habit when going abroad and while traveling to St. Louis as there was anti-Catholic feeling among some residents.&lt;ref name=stlouis/&gt;

The sisters boarded the steamer, the ''George Collier'', traveled up the Mississippi and reached St. Louis on 25 March 1836. Through Holy Week the sisters resided with the Daughters of Charity, who had a hospital near the Cathedral. On April 7, three of the sisters, accompanied by Bishop Rosati and Father Fontbonne, travelled by boat for [[Cahokia, Illinois]], a former French colonial town, where they opened a school for French and Creole settlers at the request of a Vincentian missionary.&lt;ref name=albany/&gt; On September 12, the remaining sisters settled in a log cabin in the village of [[Carondelet, St. Louis|Carondelet]], about five miles south of the city of St. Louis. At the time the sisters arrived at St. Louis, this humble house was occupied by the Sisters of Charity, who cared for a few orphans there who were soon transferred to a new building. Many institutions have been started from the origin of these sisters and continue their good works. St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf, St. Joseph’s Academy; Fontbonne College, now [[Fontbonne University]], all were founded among the sisters at the convent at Carondelet.&lt;ref name=stlouis/&gt;

In 1847 the first foundation outside St. Louis was made in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], followed shortly by foundations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1851); Hamilton, Ontario (1852); Wheeling, West Virginia (1853); and Canandaigua (1854); Flushing (Brentwood)(1856); Rochester; and Buffalo, all in New York state, which had received many Irish Catholic immigrants. In 1851 Bishop Joseph Cretin went to Carondelet to ask Mother Celestine to send the Sisters of St. Joseph to his new diocese in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]; four sisters reached there by steamboat on 3 November. In 1853 Bishop McCloskey requested sisters for [[Cohoes, New York]]. On April 15, 1858, one German, one Irish, and two native-born sisters arrived by train in [[Oswego, New York]] in the midst of a snowstorm, to establish a school for Catholic immigrants.&lt;ref name=albany&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csjalbany.org/index.cfm/History/|title=History|website=www.csjalbany.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 the Flushing community sent three pioneer sisters to [[Ebensburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=baden&gt;[http://www.stjoseph-baden.org/default.aspx Sisters of St. Joseph, Baden, Pennsylvania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620223612/http://www.stjoseph-baden.org/default.aspx |date=2013-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the rapid growth of the institute and the increasing demand for sisters from all parts of the United States, the superiors of the community by 1860 had to figure out how to give stability and uniformity to the growing congregation. They called a general chapter in May 1860, to which representatives from every congregational house in America were called. Mother St. John Facemaz was elected first superior general for a term of six years. Shortly afterward, she traveled to Rome to present a copy of the Constitution for Vatican approval. In September 1863, [[Pope Pius IX]] issued a degree of commendation. Final approbation was received, dated May 16, 1877. This approval established the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet as a congregation of pontifical right, and unified their communities in various dioceses with the mother-house at Carondelet (now part of St. Louis, Missouri).

During the Civil War, the order sent [[Nuns of the Battlefield|nuns to serve as Army nurses]]. However, the head of Army nurses [[Dorothea Dix]] distrusted them; her anti-Catholicism and ignorance of the nuns undermined her ability to work with Irish and German sisters, whom she ridiculed as unfeeling.&lt;ref&gt;Barbra Mann Wall, "Called to a Mission of Charity: The Sisters of St. Joseph in the Civil War," ''Nursing History Review'' (1998) Vol. 6, pp. 85–113&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}{{Better source|reason=Citation is from a book by an author who tends to publish nothing but praises to catholic nurses.|date=August 2016}} In 1910 the congregation divided into four provinces. The Sisters are known for their work in education and health care, and their activism in opposing the [[death penalty]].

The Sisters of St. Joseph of Savannah were established at Savannah in 1867, in charge of the boys' orphanage, and soon afterward became an independent diocesan congregation. In 1876 the orphanage was transferred to [[Washington, Georgia]], and with it the mother-house of the congregation. In 1912 the Sisters opened an academy for women in Augusta which became Mount Saint Joseph. They eventually moved the mother house to [[Augusta, Georgia]]. In 1922 the Sisters voted to incorporate themselves into the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, becoming the Augusta Province.

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Saint Louis, Missouri====
The St. Louis, Missouri Province comprises the houses of the congregation in the [[Archdioceses]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|St. Louis]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Chicago]], and the [[Diocese]]s of St. Joseph, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City–Saint Joseph|Kansas City]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Indianapolis|Indianapolis]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria|Peoria]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville|Belleville]], Alton, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver|Denver]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette|Marquette]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay|Green Bay]], Mobile, and the Diocese of Oklahoma. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Georgia joined as a separate province in 1922 and became part of the St. Louis Province in 1961.

In St. Louis, Missouri the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet St. Louis sponsor Saint Joseph Institute for the Deaf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjid.org/|title=St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf -|website=www.sjid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Joseph's Academy (St. Louis)|Saint Joseph's Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjosephacademy.org/|title=St. Joseph's Academy -  An All-Girls’ High School in St. Louis|website=www.stjosephacademy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fontbonne University]], and Ascension Health;&lt;ref name="Ascension Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascensionhealth.org|title=Home - Ascension|website=www.ascensionhealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Kansas City, Missouri, they sponsor Saint Teresa Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stteresasacademy.com/|title=St. Teresa's Academy|website=St. Teresa's Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Avila University]].
[[File:CSJ Administration Center, St. Paul.jpg|thumb|Administration Center of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet &amp; Consociates, St. Paul Province]]

====Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet and Consociates, St. Paul Province====
In 1851, four Sisters arrived in the village of St. Paul, Minnesota, to establish the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Paul Province. A log cabin became the first site of [[Saint Joseph's Academy (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Saint Joseph's Academy]] in early November 1851, a day and boarding school for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richardson |first=Mary Jo |title=St. Joseph’s Academy, St. Paul |url=http://www.mnopedia.org/place/st-joseph-s-academy-st-paul |work=MNopedia |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |date=2017-01-11 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1853, in response to the [[1852–60 cholera pandemic|cholera epidemic]], the sisters turned the school into the first site of [[St. Joseph's Hospital (St. Paul, Minnesota)|St. Joseph's Hospital]], which was also the state of Minnesota's first hospital.

The growth of the St. Paul congregation began with the entrance of its first postulants, Ellen Ireland and her cousin Ellen Howard, in the summer of 1858. By then the pattern of response to need had been firmly set with the opening of St. Joseph Academy in St. Paul, Long Prairie Indian Mission, St. Anthony's School in Minneapolis, and St. Joseph Hospital and Cathedral School in St. Paul. Orphans were taken care of in all these institutions.

In 2016, the St. Paul Province celebrated its 175th year. Its ministries range from young adult spirituality to immigrant and refugee services. Through these ministries, St. Paul Sisters and Consociates strive to foster the common good through advocacy, creative arts, education, healthcare, social service, and spirituality.

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Albany Province====
The Albany Province (formerly Troy, New York) is formed of the houses established in the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany|Albany]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse|Syracuse]], New York. The Albany Province of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet founded and sponsor the [[College of St. Rose]], Albany, New York, named in honor of St. [[Rose of Lima]], the first canonized saint in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csjalbany.org/|title=Welcome to the CSJ Albany Website!|website=www.csjalbany.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Los Angeles Province====
Los Angeles is the youngest of the four provinces of the Congregation of St. Joseph of Carondelet.  Already well known in the eastern part of the country with provinces established in St. Louis, St. Paul, and Albany, the Sisters of St. Joseph received an appeal from two pioneer bishops in the West.  Santa Fe bishop John Baptist Lamy, and the newly installed bishop of Tucson, John Baptist Salpointe, wrote to Carondelet in the late 1860s asking for sisters to establish a school in Tucson, Arizona.  
Seven Sisters began the long journey to the west in April 1870, traveling on the newly completed transcontinental railroad to San Francisco, by steamer to San Diego, and by covered wagon across the American Desert to Tucson, Arizona.  Their first school, the future St. Joseph’s Academy, opened on June 6, 1870, eleven days after their arrival in Tucson.  
Ministries spread rapidly from this early beginning with schools opening in Arizona and California.  Close to the Sisters’ hearts was the education and care of their beloved Native Americans.  By 1873, the Sisters had opened a school for the Papago Indians at San Xavier del Bac.  Within a few years, they were ministering at Fort Yuma, St. Anthony’s in San Diego, St. Boniface School in Banning, and St. John’s Mission School in Komatke.  
When Bishop Salpointe opened St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson in 1880, health care became an important part of the Sisters’ ministry. Over the years, the Sisters sponsored and operated hospitals in Arizona, California, Washington, and Idaho until recent developments in health care led them to transfer ownership and sponsorship to a Catholic health system.  
As the majority of ministries increased in California, Los Angeles was selected as seat of the western province and established in 1903.  Academies were established as early as 1882, Mount St. Mary’s College (now University) was founded in 1925, and Sisters were teaching in parish schools in five states.  Work with the deaf, a treasured tradition since the first days in St. Louis, flourished for many years in Oakland and San Francisco. In 1925, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lewiston, Idaho, joined the Carondelet congregation.  In 2011, the Sisters of the Vice Province of Japan joined the Los Angeles Province as a region.
From the first days in Arizona, education and health care merged naturally into other forms of care of the dear neighbor.  Over the years, and especially after Vatican II, the Sisters’ work has expanded and diversified, including parish service, adult education, spiritual direction and retreat work, direct service of the poor, and justice activities.

The congregation established foundations in [[Hawaii]] in 1938, in [[Japan]] in 1956 and in [[Peru]] in 1962. These have flourished and attracted native-born members. The Hawaii community became a vice-province in 1956, the Japan and Peru communities in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csjhawaii.org/|title=Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet - Hawaii Vice-Province - Home Page|website=www.csjhawaii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governance====
The superior general and four general councillors, elected every six years by the whole congregation, form the general governing body, assisted by a superior provincial and four provincial councillors in each province. The provincial officers are appointed by the general officers every three years, as are the local superiors of all the provinces.

In each provincial house, as in the mother-house, a novitiate is established. The term of postulantship extends from three to six months, the term of novitiate two years, after which annual vows are taken for a period of five years, when perpetual vows are taken. All are received on the same footing, all enjoy the same privileges, and all are subject to the same obedience which assigns duties according to ability, talent, and aptitude.

Although an interchange of members of the various provinces is allowed and made use of for general or particular needs, the autonomy of each province is safeguarded. The constitutions, while establishing on a solid basis the idea of a general government, allow no small share of local initiative and carefully provide for local needs. In this way too much centralization or peril to establishments working in accordance with local and special exigencies is guarded against.

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia===
In 1847 the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, in response to an appeal of Bishop Kenrick, sent four members of the community to Philadelphia to take charge of St. John's Orphan Asylum, until that time under the Sisters of Charity. The Know-Nothing spirit, which had but a short time previously led to the Philadelphia riots was still rampant, and the sisters had much to suffer from bigotry and difficulties of many kinds. Shortly afterwards they were given charge of several parochial schools, and thus entered on what was to be their chief work in the coming years.

In October 1858, under the patronage of [[St. John Neumann]], the congregation in Philadelphia began to take a more definite development by the establishment of a mother-house at Mount St. Joseph, Chestnut Hill. When the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Louis formed a generalate in 1863 (approved later by the Holy See), the congregation of Philadelphia preserved its autonomy, by the wish of the bishop. When the number of religious members increased to between three and four hundred, and the works entrusted to them became so numerous and varied as to necessitate an organization more detailed and definite, steps were undertaken to obtain the papal approbation, which was received in 1895.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjphila.org/|title=Sisters of Saint Joseph - Uniting God, Neighbor and All Creation|website=www.ssjphila.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War, detachments of sisters nursed the sick soldiers in Camp Curtin and the Church Hospital, Harrisburg. Despite anti-Catholic sentiments from doctors and soldier-nurses who did not appreciate the sisters' presence, the sisters worked at the camp until its closure in April 1864. Shortly after, under Surgeon General Smith, they undertook more active duty on the floating hospital, [[Hospital Ships of the Sanitary Commission#Hospital Ships of the Peninsula Campaign|Whilldin]], which received the wounded from both sides at the battle of Yorktown, and other southern battle-fields.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For two thirds of the 1900s, the group supplied teachers to hundreds of elementary and secondary schools in the Philadelphia area, educating generations of children and young adults. The trademark white triangle that was worn as part of the sisters' veil was present until 1974. The changes in life style and ministry that were common in Catholic religious institutes of women in the late 1960s took a little longer to catch up with this group who held on to convent living in traditional parish settings as well as a modified habit and veil up to the mid-1980s.

From a membership high of close to 2,500 is the mid-sixties, the current 2017 membership is under 750 with most of the membership in full or partial retirement.

===Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York===
The Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood is an independent diocesan congregation. 
In the spring of 1856 the Right Rev. [[John Loughlin (bishop)|John Loughlin]], first Bishop of Brooklyn, applied to the mother-house at [[Philadelphia]] for sisters, and two religious were named for the new mission, joined during the same year by a sister from Buffalo. St. Mary's Academy, Williamsburg, was opened on September 8, 1856, and in the following year a parochial school was inaugurated. In 1860 the mother-house, novitiate, and boarding school were removed to Flushing, Long Island, whence the activity of the sisters was gradually extended over the diocese. In 1903 the mother-house and novitiate were again transferred to Brentwood, New York, where an academy was opened the same year.

Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood sponsor, among other ministries: [[Saint Joseph's College (New York)]], [[St. Joseph High School (Brooklyn)]], [[The Mary Louis Academy]], [[Fontbonne Hall Academy]], [[Sacred Heart Academy (New York)]], [[Bishop Kearney High School (New York City)]] and [[Academia Maria Reina]]

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden, Pennsylvania===
In 1869 the Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood, (then located in Flushing, New York) sent three pioneer sisters to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania: Sisters Hortense Tello, Xavier Phelan, and Sister Austin Keane, a native of nearby Loretto, Pennsylvania, who  had been baptized by Father [[Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin|Demetrius Gallitzin]], the pioneering priest in western Pennsylvania. Five days after their arrival in Ebensburg, the three St. Joseph Sisters opened a day-school and a boarding-school, Mount Gallitzin Seminary for Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjoseph-baden.org/|title=Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden|website=Sisters of St. Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902  a four-story school and convent to serve as both Mt. Gallitzin Academy and their new motherhouse was dedicated in Baden. Their original motherhouse in Ebensburg was remodeled into an infant home where they nurtured newborns and toddlers from 1923 to 1959.&lt;ref name=Witt&gt;[http://www.stjoseph-baden.org/about-us.aspx Witt, Sally.

From 1926 to 1948, 15 Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden ministered in China.  Their mission in Hunan Province included an orphanage and hospital.  Sister Theresa Joseph Lung, a native of Hunan who entered the congregation in 1933, remained in China after the sisters left and died there in 1994. The community has sheltered refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bosnia, and Kosovo, and has been instrumental in helping them find homes in this country. In 1997, the sisters started Girls they established a separate non-profit corporation to operate Villa St. Joseph, a non-sectarian, 120-bed, long-term care facility with a specialized unit for Alzheimer's patients.&lt;ref name=Witt/&gt;

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston===
[[File:Sisters of St Joseph Convent Allston-Brighton.JPG|thumb|Sisters of St Joseph Convent Allston-Brighton]]
In 1873 four Sisters of St. Joseph of Brooklyn (now Brentwood) arrived at St. Thomas parish in [[Jamaica Plain]]. They found a city filled with new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe who had joined the earlier Irish immigrants. Four days after their arrival the sisters opened an elementary school for girls in the basement of the church. 200 students applied the first day. By 1877, with the acceptance of 30 boys, St. Thomas School became the first co-educational Catholic school in New England. In the Archdiocese of Boston, the sisters opened, staffed, and/or sponsored over 125 educational institutions, including schools for children with special needs.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

Sisters of St. Joseph, Sister John Berchmans and Sister Elizabeth, were among those who volunteered to care for people during the influenza epidemic of 1918. During the Depression, they fed the hungry from their kitchen doors. In the 1950s, four Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston were missioned to New Mexico to teach in parish schools. Since that time sisters have ministered in Santa Rosa, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Clovis, and Springer, New Mexico. San Ricardo Parish in Lima, Peru, became the home to a group of Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston in 1965.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Buffalo===
The Sisters of St. Joseph were introduced into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo|Diocese of Buffalo]] in 1854, when three sisters from [[Carondelet, St. Louis|Carondelet]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], made a foundation at [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Two years later one of these sisters was brought to Buffalo by Bishop Timon to assume charge of Le Couteulx St. Mary's Institution for the instruction of deaf mutes, which had lately been established. The novitiate was removed from Canandaigua to Buffalo in 1861. The community developed rapidly and soon spread through different parts of the diocese. By 1868 the sisters were sufficiently strong to direct their own affairs, and elected their own superior, thus forming a new diocesan congregation. In 1891 the mother-house and novitiate were removed to the outskirts of the city, where an academy was erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjbuffalo.org/|title=Sisters of St. Joseph - Buffalo|website=www.ssjbuffalo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Watertown, New York===
In 1880 several sisters from the mother-house at Buffalo made a foundation at Watertown, New York, which was later strengthened by the accession of another sister from the Erie mother-house. Sister M. Josephine Donnelly, formerly of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Erie is considered by some to be the foundress of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Watertown., as she remained when other sisters moved on to start a foundation in Michigan. From Watertown as a centre missions were opened in other parts of the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjwatertown.org|title=Sisters of St. Joseph|website=Sisters of St. Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambery, West Hartford, Connecticut===
Jane Sedgwick of [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], desired to establish a Catholic school in Lee, Massachusetts. Since there weren't enough sisters in the United States to aid in the running of the school, Jane eventually went to Rome to appeal to Pope Leo XIII to send help. In 1885, five sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambéry arrived in Lee to open the school.&lt;ref name=chambery/&gt;
The [[novitiate]] was transferred to Hartford, Connecticut in 1898. The foundation spread into Connecticut and eventually into other parts of the United States.

===Congregation of Saint Joseph===
In 2007, seven congregations of the Sisters of Saint Joseph in the central United States merged to form an entirely the new Congregation, which is now called the '''Congregation of Saint Joseph'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csjoseph.org/our_founding_communities.aspx "Our Founding Communities", Congregation of Saint Joseph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714175545/http://www.csjoseph.org/our_founding_communities.aspx |date=2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation numbered about 700 as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csjoseph.org/who_we_are.aspx Congregation of St. Joseph website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422222958/http://www.csjoseph.org/who_we_are.aspx |date=2015-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille====
{{Main|Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille}}
In 1854 Sisters were sent from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg house in France to establish a house at [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], in the [[Diocese of Natchez]]. In 1863 a novitiate was opened at [[New Orleans]]. After establishing a central house in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the Sisters extended their ministry to the poor and suffering of Louisiana and Mississippi, opening schools, hospitals and an orphanage.

In 1907, the group in Argyle, Minnesota established a convent and school in [[Crookston, Minnesota]] In 1907 a convent was established at [[Superior, Wisconsin]] by seven Sisters from Cincinnati. Schools have since been opened among the French Canadians in Minnesota and Wisconsin

By 1962, the Bourg Congregation had six provinces, three in Europe and three in the United States, with missions in Africa and Latin America. In July 1977, the six provinces voted to become two separate congregations, one based in Europe, the other in America. On November 30, 1977, Rome officially declared the three American provinces to be a new Congregation in the Church: the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]]. The name Medaille was chosen because it is the family name of the Jesuit priest who helped found the Sisters in 1650 and because the Sisters were geographically located in the north, central and southern areas of the United States. Sister Janet Roesener of Cincinnati, Ohio was chosen the first superior general.

In 1986 and in 1994 decisions were made to merge the three provinces into five regions headed by a Congregational Leadership Office consisting of a president and three general councilors, in Cincinnati. The five regions consist of Baton Rouge, Cincinnati, Crookston, Minnesota, New Orleans, and the Twin Cities.

The sisters worked as teachers in a number of parish schools; opened and staffed St. Joseph Academy from 1892 until its closure in 1972; sponsored Good Samaritan Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital in [[Kokomo, Indiana]] (previously Howard County Hospital, now St. Vincent Kokomo Hospital),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kokomotribune.com/news/local_news/update-st-joseph-hospital-changes-name-to-st-vincent-kokomo/article_9efa2c92-fe36-11e4-86c6-2bb0f99709b2.html|title=UPDATE: St. Joseph Hospital changes name to St. Vincent Kokomo|last=Tribune|first=Josh Sigler Kokomo|work=Kokomo Tribune|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started the [http://hsj.freeservers.com/ Hospice St. Joseph] mission in Port-au-Prince, Haiti (now administered by the Diocese of Norwich, CT.)

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Wheeling, West Virginia====
[[File:Mount Saint Joseph building from parking lot.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Motherhouse]]

In 1853 seven sisters from Carondelet, Missouri, opened a private orphanage and hospital in Wheeling, and in 1856 took possession of a building chartered by the Assembly of Virginia for a hospital. From 19 October 1860, the community was independent of the St. Louis mother-house. During the Civil War the hospital was rented by the Government and the sisters enrolled in government service. After the war and the reorganization of the hospital on its present lines, the sisters extended their activities to various parts of the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjwhg.org/|title=Sisters of St. Joseph of Wheeling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motherhouse was included in the [[Mount Saint Joseph (West Virginia)|Mount Saint Joseph]] listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], added in 2008.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/ohio/07001418.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Mount Saint Joseph|date=July 2007|accessdate=2011-09-01 |author=Wheeling National Heritage Area Corporation|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Wichita, Kansas====
In 1883, Mother Stanislaus Leary of Rochester, New York stopped in Kansas en route to Arizona, and opened a mission which would develop into the Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia. In August 1887, four Sisters of St. Joseph were commissioned to go from Concordia, Kansas, to open a parochial school at Abilene, Kansas, at that time in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Leavenworth]]. In the fall of 1887, word was received from Rome that the state of Kansas had been divided into dioceses. At the direction of Bishop Fink, who did not wish to lose the sisters from his diocese, the Abilene sisters constituted themselves a separate congregation with an act of incorporation of March 25, 1888. The following year the Right Rev. L. M. Pink, Bishop of Leavenworth, decided that these Sisters should belong to his diocese exclusively, and in so doing they became the nucleus of a new diocesan congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph, having their motherhouse established at Abilene, under the title of Mount St. Joseph's Academy.

The congregation increased in numbers and soon branched out, doing parochial school work throughout the diocese. In 1892 the name of the Diocese of Leavenworth was changed to Kansas City, Kansas, and for the time being the Sisters of St. Joseph were diocesan Sisters of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas|Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City]]. In 1896, when the re-division of the three Kansas dioceses, was begun, Bishop Fink of Kansas City, had their motherhouse transferred from Abilene to Parsons. But after the division was made the following year, Parsons was in the Wichita diocese, and the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph being in Parsons, the congregation belonged to the Wichita Diocese, having mission-houses in both the Diocese of Concordia and the Diocese of Kansas City. In 1907 a colony of these Sisters opened a sanitarium at Del Norte, Colorado, in the Diocese of Denver.

In 1950, the congregation responded to the need for medical services in Kyoto, Japan. Three sisters began a mission which today sponsors a kindergarten, day nursery, medical services for senior citizens, a disabled children's hospital, and a special education school.

===Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Augustine, Florida===
At the close of the American Civil War, the most Reverend Augustin Verot, Bishop of Savannah and Administrator Apostolic of Florida, visited his native city of LePuy where he challenged the Sisters of St. Joseph to come to St. Augustine. Many sisters volunteered. The chosen eight were Sister Marie Sidonie Rascle, Superior: and Sisters Marie Julie Roussel, Marie Josephine Deleage, Marie Clemence Freycenon, St. Pierre Borie, Marie Joseph Cortial, Julie Clotilde Arsac, and Marie Celenie Joubert. They arrived in Florida at Picolata Landing on the shores of the St. Johns River, September 2, 1866.

The sisters from France adjusted heroically to a different language, culture, and climate with joy and faith. They welcomed new members as they mourned the disproportionate number of those who succumbed to disease and unhealthy conditions. At the direction of Bishop Verot, the sisters were sent to six missions throughout Florida and Georgia. Their primary ministry was to black people. Owing to the departure of the Sisters of Mercy from the city, the education of the whites also devolved on the new community.

By 1876 the sisters in Georgia had been separated from those in France, but the sisters in Florida were established as a province of LePuy. At the close of the century, provincial government was abruptly terminated by Bishop John Moore. This brought about the establishment of the Diocesan Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of St. Augustine, Florida, in 1899.
To maintain their charitable works and to provide self-support, the sisters erected academies. These institutions served as centers of catechetical work until they were relinquished and replaced by parochial and diocesan schools. The sisters augmented their resources by such means as lace-making and private lessons in art, music, and language.

During the years of rapid expansion in the developing Church of Florida, and with the support of Archbishop Joseph P. Hurley, the majority of the sisters gave their time to education, which included instruction of students who were deaf, blind, developmentally disabled, or otherwise handicapped. Gradually they became more involved in the multi-faceted aspects of health care; and they assumed work with the aging, unwed mothers, and migrants. The Congregation opened schools in Puerto Rico in the fifties. Two decades later in 1976, the sisters in Puerto Rico became an independent institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjfl.org|title=- Home|website=www.ssjfl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange (California)===
[[File:Eureka CA St. Joseph Hospital.JPG|thumb|St. Joseph Hospital, Eureka CA]]
The Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange is among the youngest of the American congregations and traces its roots through the St. Joseph congregations of La Grange, Illinois; Concordia, Kansas; Rochester, New York; and Carondelet, Missouri.

The Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange were established in 1912 by Mother Bernard Gosselin. She and eight sisters left LaGrange, Illinois, near Chicago to establish what is now [[St. Bernard's High School (Eureka, California)|St. Bernard's High School]] in [[Eureka, California]]. As the Congregation grew, the Sisters were better able to address more of the needs of the area. The [[1918 flu pandemic]] presented a new challenge to the community. The Sisters responded as best they could at the time, but they realized that by establishing a hospital they could provide a health care service which would effectively address the personal, social and spiritual needs of the area. In 1920, the Sisters opened St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka. Today the hospital is by far the largest medical facility on Coastal California north of its even larger medical facility located in [[Santa Rosa, California]], as well as others in Southern California.

By 1922, the Sisters were teaching in several Southern California areas and recognized that the community could better develop its ministries by moving the Motherhouse to [[Orange, California|Orange]]. The first ministries of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange were in education and health care. Schools and hospitals were staffed primarily by the Sisters and in the 1940s and 1950s the number of institutions directed by the Congregation increased steadily. In the 1940s the Sisters extended their work in health, education and religious instruction to the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia.

Today, the Congregation’s commitment to education is expressed in a variety of forms including elementary, secondary, university and other adult education. The commitment to extend their healing mission is expressed through acute care hospitals, rehabilitation programs, home health care, community education, primary care clinics, and wellness programs. The works of the Congregation have expanded, however, beyond education and health care to also include such things as helping new immigrants, feeding the hungry, giving shelter to the homeless, and fostering spiritual development.

The Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange are one of three sponsoring religious communities of [[Loyola Marymount University]] in Los Angeles. They also have a special partnership with the Western American Province of the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] dating back to the 1968 signing of the Marymount Accords when St. Joseph's College of Orange merged with Marymount College of Los Angeles and assumed the Marymount name. Five years later, Marymount College merged with Loyola University of Los Angeles as the school assumed its current name, Loyola Marymount University.

Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange sponsor the following institutions: [[Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, San Francisco|École Notre-Dame-des-Victoires]], San Francisco; Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles; [[Mission Hospital (Mission Viejo, California)|Mission Hospital]], Mission Viejo; [[Queen of the Valley Medical Center (Napa, California)|Queen of the Valley Medical Center]], Napa; [[St. Jude Medical Center]], Fullerton; and [[Rosary High School (Fullerton, California)|Rosary High School]], Fullerton (1965–1976).

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon, Winslow, Maine===
In 1906 Father Joseph Forest requested of the Sisters of St. Joseph to come to the Diocese of Portland, Maine. With the bishop's approval, eight Sisters made their way to Maine where they would staff a parochial school and a girls' boarding school in Jackman. The need was for bilingual teachers and none of the Sisters were familiar with English. They made haste to learn words and expressions so they could communicate with the children. At the time of their arrival, there were approximately 80 families in Jackman, mostly of Canadian origin so they spoke French. Children came from miles around, even from Canada, to be educated by the Sisters. Many of the children went home only at the end of the school year because of transportation and harsh weather. A second group of Sisters came into Maine in 1909, this time in South Berwick. The site of the convent was the former Paul's Hotel, where Lafayette had stayed on one of his trips to the United States. The Sisters became known primarily for their education apostolate in the diocese.

The Sisters in Maine maintained their link with the Motherhouse in Lyon, France through frequent correspondence as well as the regular canonical visits from the Mother General or one of her assistants. Only in 1958, as the number of Sisters increased sufficiently to establish a Province in Maine did the Congregation appoint a provincial superior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csjwinslowmaine.org/history.htm Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon, Winslow, Maine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504000734/http://www.csjwinslowmaine.org/history.htm |date=2015-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Springfield (Massachusetts)===
In September 1880, seven Sisters of St. Joseph were sent from [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Long Island]], to take charge of a parochial school at Chicopee Falls, [[Massachusetts]]. They were followed, two years later, by seven Sisters for [[Webster, Massachusetts|Webster]], and in 1883 by twelve more for the cathedral parish school in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. In 1885 the Springfield mission was constituted the motherhouse of an independent diocesan congregation.

Among the ministries sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Springfield are Mont Marie Child Care Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjspringfield.com/childcare.htm|title=The Sisters of St. Joseph|date=8 July 2005|website=SSJSpringfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mont Marie Health Care Center, Inc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjspringfield.com/healthcare.htm|title=The Sisters of St. Joseph|date=8 July 2005|website=SSJSpringfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mont Marie Senior Residence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjspringfield.com/seniorresidence.htm|title=The Sisters of St. Joseph|date=8 July 2005|website=SSJSpringfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mont Marie Labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjspringfield.com/ecology.htm|title=The Sisters of St. Joseph|date=8 July 2005|website=SSJSpringfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, there were about 250 Sisters the Springfield Congregation continuing to serve through a variety of ministries.&lt;ref name=Springfield/&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Fall River (Massachusetts)====
In 1902 nine Sisters of St. Joseph from the mother-house at Le Puy took charge of the school in the French parish of St-Roch, Fall River, Massachusetts. The accession of other members from the mother-house enabled the community to take charge of three other schools in the city attached to French parishes. In 1906 St. Theresa's Convent was formally opened as the provincial house of the community, which was legally incorporated in the same year, and a novitiate was established. In the mid 1970s, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Fall River merged with the Springfield Congregation.&lt;ref name=Springfield&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssjspringfield.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html|title=The Sisters of St. Joseph|date=8 July 2005|website=SSJSpringfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Rutland, Vermont====
In 1873 the Rev. Charles Boylan of [[Rutland (town), Vermont]] petitioned the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Long Island]], for sisters to take charge of his school. Several sisters were sent, and a novitiate was opened at Rutland on October 15, 1876. The Sisters of Saint Joseph founded [[Mount Saint Joseph Academy (Rutland, Vermont)|Mount Saint Joseph Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msjvermont.org/|title=Mount St. Joseph Academy - Rutland|website=Mount St. Joseph Academy - Rutland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Sisters of St. Joseph of Rutland, Vermont joined the Springfield community which also covers Worcester, the Berkshires, Rhode Island and even Louisiana and Uganda.&lt;ref name=Springfield/&gt;

==Federation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Canada==
On September 20, 1966, the six separate Canadian congregations: Toronto, Hamilton, London, Peterborough, Pembroke and Sault Ste. Marie, formed the Canadian Federation.

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto===
The mother house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Toronto was established from Le Puy, France, in 1851 by Mother Delphine Fontbonne and three other Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia. They took charge of an already established orphanage at 100 Nelson Street (now Jarvis). The city was filled with Irish immigrants who had fled the ravages of famine at home, and the Sisters attended to the needs of orphans, widows and people who were sick and dying.&lt;ref name=Toronto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csj-to.ca/|title=Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto - A mission of community. A vision of unity.|website=www.csj-to.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the mother house was at Morrow Park in north Toronto. The sisters taught in many schools across Canada since their establishment in the country. In Toronto, some of their schools included: [[St. Joseph's Morrow Park Catholic Secondary School]], [[St. Joseph's College School]], [[Michael Power/St. Joseph High School|St. Joseph's Islington]], and [[Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School|St. Joseph's Commercial]]. They also established [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] and [[St. Joseph's Health Centre|St. Joseph's Hospital]], and for many years ran the Sacred Heart Orphanage and the [[Providence Healthcare (Toronto)|House of Providence]] for poor persons, among many other charities. In higher education, the sisters established St. Joseph's College in the [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|University of St. Michael's College]].&lt;ref name=Toronto/&gt;

Their current mother house is on O'Connor Drive in Toronto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easternconstruction.com/portfolio/residential/sisters-st-joseph-toronto-residence|title=Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto Residence - Eastern Construction|website=www.easternconstruction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and their works continue under the mantle of [http://www.fontbonneministries.ca Fontbonne Ministries].

===Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada===
In 2012, four congregations (Hamilton, London, Peterborough and Pembroke) decided to come together to form a new congregation – The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada.

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Hamilton (Ontario)====
The first Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada came to Toronto from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia, in the fall of 1851. In 1852 five sisters from the mother-house at [[Toronto]] established a foundation at [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], where they at once opened an orphanage and began their work in the parochial schools of the city. On the erection of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, Ontario|Diocese of Hamilton]] in 1856, the community became a separate diocesan congregation, and a few months later a novitiate was established at Hamilton. By the passage of the Separate Schools Bill in 1856 the sisters were given control of the education of the Catholic children of the city. The congregation gradually extended its activities to other parts of the diocese. The Neighbour to Neighbour Program, St. Joseph’s Women’s Immigrant Centre and Hamilton Out of the Cold are but three more recent (25 years) local initiatives where the Sisters have been instrumental in the start-up.&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csjcanada.org/founding-communities|title=Founding Communities - CSJ|website=www.csjcanada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of London====

There were eight graduates in this class.]]The community of Sisters of St. Joseph at London was founded in 1868 by five sisters from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto. These sisters opened an orphan asylum the following year in 1867. On 18 December 1870, the congregation became independent, with a [[novitiate]] of its own. Sister Ignatia Campbell was appointed [[superior general|Superior General]] in 1870 and held office until 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csjcanada.org/founding-communities|title=Founding Communities - CSJ|website=www.csjcanada.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On 15 February 1871, the Sisters of St. Joseph of London, Ontario, were legally incorporated. Several missions were opened in various parts of the diocese, and in 1888 a hospital was established at London, to which was attached a training school for nurses.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Peterborough====
In 1890, at the request of Bishop R.A. O'Connor, Bishop of Peterborough, twenty sisters of the Toronto congregation formed a new congregation in the diocese of Peterborough. Mother Austin Doran was elected General Superior. The sisters staffed the newly opened St. Joseph’s Hospital in Peterborough. In 1895 the congregation began its teaching apostolate in the city of Peterborough. A House of Providence was established in 1900 to accommodate not only the elderly poor but orphans of the diocese.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;

====Sisters of St. Joseph of Pembroke====
In 1921, in response to a request from Bishop Ryan for teachers to staff the rural areas of the Ottawa Valley schools, twenty-seven Sisters of St. Joseph of Peterborough from three mission houses located in the diocese of Pembroke, formed into a new congregation with the motherhouse in Pembroke. In 1946, they opened their first hospitals and Homes for the Aged in western Canada. By 1964, they were able to establish a mission in Peru which is still operating today with a growing community of Peruvian Sisters. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Pembroke sponsor the Stillpoint House of Prayer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stillpoint.ca|title=STILLPOINT House of Prayer|website=www.stillpoint.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sisters of St. Joseph of Sault Ste. Marie===

*Sisters of Saint Joseph of Cuneo: The Congregation was founded in Cuneo October 10, 1831, through the work of Canon John Manassero, prior and pastor of the Cathedral. The sisters devoted their efforts to the education of poor girls, orphans and the care of sick people in their homes. In particular, they lent their generous service as nurses in the "lazareto" during the cholera epidemic, which leads to death about a tenth of the population. Sister St. John, after just three days of activities was struck by the disease and gave her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suoresangiuseppecuneo.it/index.php/le-nostre-radici/a-cuneo|title=A Cuneo|first=|last=admin|website=www.suoresangiuseppecuneo.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other foundations==
The '''Sisters of St. Joseph of Saint-Vallier''' were instituted in 1683 at Saint-Vallier, France, by the Abbey of Saint-Vallier, who would later become Quebec City’s second bishop. They had originally been part of the large Congregation of St. Joseph that was founded in 1650 at Puy en Velay. Upon the creation of their order, the Sisters took charge of the small hospital in Saint-Vallier. The congregation survived the French Revolution because of its small size and state of destitution. But the Combes Laws (1901 and 1904) closed the schools of the religious communities and forbade the sisters from teaching. One sister who had come from Quebec, Thérèse de Jésus (Cécile Drolet), suggested to the Mother General that the congregation find a new home in Canada. She was sent to Quebec City in April 1903 and presented a request to Monsignor Bégin, who approved the congregation’s move to his diocese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrimoine-religieux.com/en/our-churches/sisters-of-saint-joseph-of-saint-vallier/ Sisters of St. Joseph of Saint-Vallier]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3212">The '''Starfish Project''' is a [[UK]]-based [[non-profit|not-for-profit]] therapy programme which helps people who [[stuttering|stammer]] or [[stuttering|stutter]] to overcome their speech  through the use of [[diaphragmatic breathing]] (also known as ''costal breathing'').  The programme also teaches participants to reassess negative emotions surrounding their stammering through the use of avoidance reduction therapy (see [[stuttering therapy]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starfishproject.co.uk/about-starfish-project.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Participants attend a three-day residential course near [[Hailsham]] in the UK during which a diaphragmatic breathing technique and non-avoidance strategies are taught. Following this initial course, participants are able to attend additional follow-up courses at the same venue without charge from the Starfish Project as often as they feel necessary.  Course participants are also encouraged to make use of a list of phone contacts of other course participants and can attend free support meetings at various locations around the UK. 

Anne Blight, founder of the Starfish Project, has been working with people who stammer for many years, first as a volunteer with the Association for Stammerers in the UK, then with its successor organisation The British Stammering Association. Anne Blight was previously involved in the early days of [[McGuire Programme]] before founding the Starfish Project in 1998.

In 2016, the Starfish Project announced its first courses outside of the UK. The Starfish Project had been invited to start courses for people who stammer in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC) countries. Courses are scheduled quarterly in [[Dubai]] with instruction in English and monthly at various cities within the GCC countries with instruction in Arabic.  

Although diaphragmatic breathing may be an effective way for people who stammer to manage their condition, it should not be regarded as a cure and, while anecdotally effective, the existence of beneficial outcomes for people who stammer from diaphragmatic breathing-based therapies such as the Starfish Project is not supported by specific peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.starfishproject.co.uk/what-the-papers-say.htm] and [http://www.starfishproject.co.uk/what-the-papers-say-more.htm] for a selection of third-party newspaper and magazine clippings.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar breathing technique is used by several other stammering treatment initiatives including the programme offered by the [[Del Ferro Institute]] in [[Amsterdam]] (where the application of diaphragmatic breathing to stammering was first developed) and the [[McGuire Programme]].

'''''State v. Strasburg''''', 110 P. 1020 (Wash. 1910), was a case decided by the [[Washington Supreme Court]] that held that a [[statute]] eliminating the [[insanity defense]] was unconstitutional.  The court likened the exclusion of evidence of insanity to a denial of trial by jury.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York: 2004, p. 623&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Strasburg, described as "an unknown and penniless stranger", was convicted of assault after shooting Otto Peeck in a saloon in Seattle. Lawyers saw the Strasburg case as an opportunity to have the Washington law that forbade insanity defenses declared unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=May Knock Out Insanity Law|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3990512/leadup_to_decision_in_state_v/|accessdate=8 January 2016|work=Tacoma Times|agency=UPI|volume=7|issue=141|date=June 2, 1910|page=8|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the Supreme Court declaring the law unconstitutional was said to be expected to reverse the convictions of "scores" of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holds Insanity May Be Defense in Criminal Case|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3990507/holding_in_state_v_strasburg_announced/|accessdate=8 January 2016|work=Oregon Daily Journal|agency=UPI|volume=9|issue=163|date=September 12, 1910|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suicide in Guyana''' is a serious social problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=modules in social studies|last=Ramsawak and Umraw|first=Rampersad and Ralph|publisher=caribbean educational publisher|year=2003|isbn=9768014067|location=La Romaine, Trinidad}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Guyana]] is [[List of countries by suicide rate|ranked first]] in [[suicide]]s per capita worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Does Guyana Have The Highest Suicide Rate In The World?|url = http://www.medicaldaily.com/suicide-rates-highest-guyana-may-be-explained-clustering-effect-306982|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 40% of people who commit suicide in Guyana poison themselves by consuming agricultural [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref name="carries continent"&gt;{{cite web
| url=  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3DEnjSkLx8

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most famous case of suicide in Guyana was the [[Jonestown|mass suicide of over 900 members]] of [[Jim Jones]]' [[Peoples Temple]] in 1978, although some sources regard the events as a mass murder.
Although this occurred in Guyana, the leader of this cult along with the followers were all foreigners and not Guyanese nationals.

== Statistics ==
Domestic data on suicide in Guyana is limited, as the country's available health literature is focused mainly on infectious tropical diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudatsikira &amp; Muula|title=Prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation among school-going adolescents in Guyana: results from a cross sectional study|journal=Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health|date=23 August 2007|volume=3|issue=13|doi=10.1186/1745-0179-3-13|url=http://cpementalhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-0179-3-13|accessdate=20 August 2016|ref=RM}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[World Health Organization]] report indicated that Guyana had a suicide rate of 44.2 per 100,000 people, and that for every single female suicide, there were 3.2 male suicides. By comparison, neighboring [[Suriname]] had a suicide rate of 27.8 per 100,000, and [[Venezuela]]'s rate was 2.6 per 100,000.

Ethnic Indians have been seen to make up the vast majority of suicides in Guyana, though their share of overall suicides dropped from 85% in 2004 to 75% in 2009. The ethnic groups categorized as "other" were seen to make up most of the difference. Indians accounted for 48% of all deaths in both years, which is 4% higher than their population share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gampat|first1=Ramesh|title=Guyana: From Slavery to the Present|date=7 July 2015|publisher=Xlibris US|edition=Vol 2 Major Diseases|accessdate=20 August 2016|ref=GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

== Possible causes ==

A 2003 World Bank report stated that the political process in Guyana is often fought with so much time and energy that "little [is] left to undertake the many policies necessary to facilitate growth and development," while the IMF in 2001 acknowledged "poor governance" as a major obstacle to the reduction of [[absolute poverty]] rates, which are among the highest in the region. Poor governance on the national level has led to inefficiencies and strained the abilities of local and regional authorities to provide basic services and guarantee [[rule of law]]. Distribution of land and water rights, payment of taxes, court cases, and the issuance of gun and driver's licenses are all frequently found to be fraudulent. This basic ill-governance has fed a sense of mistrust and frustration among the population, reduced investments in constructive economic projects, and has led to the growth of a [[shadow economy]]. This in turn has lowered tax revenues, further reducing the government's spending power and ability to fight poverty and repair basic infrastructure. However, the role of economic insecurity as a leading factor in suicide rates remains a controversial issue in Guyana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kruijf|first1=Johannes Gerrit De|title=Guyana Junction: Globalisation, Localisation, and the Production of East Indianness|date=2006|publisher=Dutch University Press|pages=100–105|accessdate=20 August 2016|ref=KJG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is the rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the country, which is third-highest in the Caribbean region. Several studies have reported an association between HIV/AIDS and suicidal ideation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooperman|first1=N.A|last2=Simoni|first2=J.M.|title=Suicidal ideation and attempted suicide among women living with HIV/AIDS|journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date=2004|volume=28|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s10865-005-3664-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10865-005-3664-3|accessdate=20 August 2016|ref=CS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=AJ|last2=Aktinson|first2=J|last3=Risser|first3=JHM|last4=McCurdy|first4=SA|last5=Useche|first5=B|last6=Padgett|first6=PM|title=The prevalence of suicidal behaviours in a group of HIV-positive men|journal=AIDS Care|date=18 Jan 2007|pages=574–576|doi=10.1080/09540120500274992|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540120500274992|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=H|last2=Hampton|first2=AJ|last3=Yu|first3=X|last4=Heaton|first4=RK|title=HNRC China Collaboration Group: Depression and suicidality in HIV/AIDS in China|date=2006|volume=94|issue=1-3|pages=269–275|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.04.013|url=http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(06)00185-6/abstract|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government response ==

Attempts by the government to address the issue have been stymied by political divisions. A bill was voted down in 2016 which would have amended the country's laws in order to decriminalize suicide, implemented the 2014 Mental Health Strategic Plan and a 5-year National Suicide Prevention Plan which were both crafted by the previous government, and allocated funds to treat mental health and suicide as national priorities. Speakers for the parliamentary majority argued that the manner in which the legislation was framed both politicized and trivialized the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gov’t votes down opposition’s ‘political’ motion on suicide|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2016/news/stories/08/06/govt-votes-oppositions-political-motion-suicide/|accessdate=20 August 2016|work=Stabroek News|date=6 August 2016|ref=SN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sclogolarge.png|thumb|Official Logo]]The '''Suitcase Clinic''' is a [[humanitarian]] [[student organization]] that has offered free [[Public services|services]] and supplies to the uninsured, [[homeless]] and [[low-income]] [[communities]] of [[Berkeley, California]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] since 1989. The organization strives to promote the health and overall well-being of underserved individuals through service provision, [[cooperative learning]], empowerment, and collective action among community and professional volunteers, students, and participants.&lt;ref name="official site"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Info |publisher=Suitcase Clinic |url=http://www.suitcaseclinic.org/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its three clinics operate at the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, the St. Mark's Episcopal Church, and the Dwight Way Women's Shelter.

Students of the organization plan, manage, and carry out all clinic operations. Its student-centered model has inspired the formation of other student-run free clinics such as the [[UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 23, 2010 |title=UCSD Students and Staff Offer Free Healthcare |newspaper=La Prensa San Diego |url=http://laprensa-sandiego.org/stories/ucsd-students-and-staff-offer-free-healthcare/ |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UCLA Mobile Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Impact: student-run clinics|url=http://health.universityofcalifornia.edu/2012/07/25/community-impact-student-run-clinics/ |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Founded in the summer of 1989 by a group of first year students of the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]–[[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] [[UC Berkeley–UCSF Joint Medical Program|Joint Medical Program]], the Suitcase Clinic was formed to provide specialized services to a population which was receiving inadequate health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bonnie Azab Powell |date=March 8, 2006 |publisher=UC Berkeley News |title=Suitcase Clinic student volunteers are changing the world, one bare footstep at a time |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/03/08_suitcase.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a mobile [[clinic]] traveling by [[van]] directly to the clients, the present organization now operates out of three drop-in centers, and is structured around the principles of [[public health]], [[social welfare]], community [[activism]] and [[empathy]].&lt;ref name="official site" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency - Suitcase Clinic|url=http://volunteer.truist.com/vccc/org/10443507871.html|accessdate=February 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412005900/http://volunteer.truist.com/vccc/org/10443507871.html|archivedate=April 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization embodies a [[holistic]] view of health, considering physical, mental, [[emotional]] and [[social]] well-being as equally necessary.&lt;ref name="official site" /&gt;

==Agenda==
Staffed on an entirely [[Volunteering|volunteer]] basis by a variety of students and professionals from throughout the Bay Area, the organization is administered by [[undergraduates]], with policy decided upon through [[consensus]] via the central Planning Committee legislative organ. Participating undergraduates are either currently enrolled in, or have already completed, a training and certification course offered by the [[#Suitcase Clinic Class (HMS 98/198)|Health and Medical Sciences Program]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Medical students operate out of the five-year UCB–UCSF Joint Medical Program, and [[optometry]] students hail from the [[UC Berkeley School of Optometry]] at Minor Hall. Professionals from within both the city of [[Berkeley, CA]] and the university cooperate with these students in order to offer medical, chiropractic, legal, and social assistance to a largely homeless and low-income clientele.

The fundamental agents of the Suitcase Clinic are the undergraduate [[caseworker (social work)|caseworker]]s, who serve as advocates for clients. They are responsible for recording the social history of their client, and for ensuring that their client has received the services desired. Additional roles include establishing and maintaining positive relationships, making referrals to other agencies, providing follow-ups, fostering a non-judgmental social environment, and taking an active interest in the welfare of the client and community. Services currently offered by the three drop-in centers include [[health care]], [[medication]], [[physical examinations]], hygienic supplies, vision screening, [[legal counsel]], meals, footwashing, [[chiropractic]], [[hair cutting]] and [[massage therapy]].

==Subdivisions==
The Suitcase Clinic is an umbrella organization comprising five unique subdivisions:

===General Clinic===
The General Clinic is the oldest of the Suitcase Clinic's three drop-in centers, and receives up to forty clients per night on average. Clients often walk for hours daily and have limited access to showering facilities. Here, they can receive feet washing, [[podiatry]], [[nail clippers]], [[emery board]]s, [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] creams and sprays, and clean socks. Dental services consist of teeth cleanings, and chiropractic services provide adjustments given by professionals. [[Haircutting]] is performed by students, who also dispense general health education and referrals for housing and insurance. Legal counsel, generally pertaining to overdue warrants, landlord–tenant disputes, and applying for financial assistance, is provided by volunteers from the East Bay Community Law Center. Medical services offer basic care and education, on-site treatment, health consultations, referrals, and free influenza vaccinations during the flu season. Medication and supplies can be issued at the discretion of the on-site [[physician]] if necessary. Optometry services perform preliminary eye examinations for clients, and if glasses are necessary, they can be provided to the client at no cost.

===Women's Clinic===
The Women's Clinic opened during the fall of 1996 with the intent of further reaching out to the low-income, homeless, neglected, and abused women and children who had previously formed a minority at the General Clinic. This branch offers unique resources such as [[homeopathy]], [[manicure]], and children's services, and cares for roughly thirty clients per night on average.

===Youth/LGBTQ+ Clinic===
The Youth Clinic is the most recently established drop-in center, having opened in September 2000. It is tailored specifically towards the Bay Area's homeless and street-identified youth, and popular resources include [[acupuncture]], regularly held dinners, and [[handicraft|arts and crafts]]. The city of Berkeley is a frequent destination for disenfranchised and neglected youth, due to the city's long history of [[social activism]] and inclusiveness. Despite this image, there are few actual resources available within the city to serve the specific needs of hard-to-reach street-identified youth, due in part to a reluctance amongst this population to deal with the bureaucratic intake and formal processing methods of traditional institutions. The city of Berkeley estimates that youth between the ages of thirteen and twenty-three account for 100–200 of the homeless population within the city, and youth living on the street are extremely vulnerable to [[suicide]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[sexually transmitted infections]], [[traumatic injury]], [[infectious diseases]] such as [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[asthma]] and [[Ectoparasitic infestation|infestations]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.suitcaseclinic.org/youth/|title=Youth / LGBTQ+ Clinic|date=2009-10-19|work=The Suitcase Clinic|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===SHARE===
SHARE, an [[acronym]] for "Searching How to Achieve Respect and Empowerment", was officially launched in May 1996. It is a discussion and advocacy group with the goal of strengthening the solidarity of the Suitcase Clinic's diverse community . Led by trained student facilitators, SHARE provides a uniquely open forum, allowing clientele to discuss current affairs and exchange opinions with student volunteers through presentations, movies, community participation and political action.

===Suitcase Clinic Class (HMS 98/198)===
Health and Medical Science (HMS) 98/198 is a course offered at [[UC Berkeley]] which provides the training requisite for the operations in the three clinics. The class is entirely organized and run by student volunteers.&lt;ref name="Steinbach paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinbach|first=Alan|author2=Swartzberg, John |title=The Berkeley Suitcase Clinic: Homeless Services by Undergraduate and Medical Student Teams|journal=Academic Medicine|date=May 2001|volume=76|issue=5|pages=524|doi=10.1097/00001888-200105000-00058 |url=http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2001/05000/The_Berkeley_Suitcase_Clinic__Homeless_Services_by.58.aspx|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students delve into topics of public health, in social welfare, in cultivating empathy and compassion, and in working with the homeless or other underserved populations. The first six weeks cover caseworker training, and the remainder of the semester is spent addressing specific topics such as drug and alcohol abuse, [[mental health]], and personal accounts of homelessness.

'''Third Pandemic''' is the designation of a major [[bubonic plague]] [[pandemic]] that began in [[Yunnan]] [[Province (China)|province]] in [[China]] in 1855.&lt;ref name="Cohn"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohn | first = Samuel K. | authorlink = | title = The Black Death Transformed: Disease and Culture in Early Renaissance Europe | publisher = A Hodder Arnold | year = 2003 | location =  | url = | isbn= 0-340-70646-5 | page = 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This episode of bubonic plague spread to all inhabited continents, and ultimately more than 12 million people died in [[India]] and China, with 10 million people killed in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5890/773 Infectious Diseases: Plague Through History], sciencemag.org&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[World Health Organization]], the pandemic was considered active until 1960, when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.az/books?id=3_65UNS3sbAC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=World+Health+Organization,+1959,+Third+Pandemic+200+per+year&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VsMv_w8RcT&amp;sig=SxKUO5OTTiqINoWw1hiF1pC5Muc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivyLvD-sHZAhUHFiwKHcc6CccQ6AEITTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=World%20Health%20Organization,%201959,%20Third%20Pandemic%20200%20per%20year&amp;f=false|title=The Ultimate Book of Top Ten Lists: A Mind-Boggling Collection of Fun, Fascinating and Bizarre Facts on Movies, Music, Sports, Crime, Ce|last=ListVerse.com|date=2009-11-03|publisher=Ulysses Press|isbn=9781569758007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name refers to this pandemic being the third major bubonic plague outbreak to affect European society. The first was the [[Plague of Justinian]], which ravaged the [[Byzantine Empire]] and surrounding areas in 541 and 542. The second was the [[Black Death]], which killed at least one third of Europe's population in a series of expanding waves of infection from 1346 to 1353.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Nicholas Wade]] |title=Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html |quote=The great waves of plague that twice devastated Europe and changed the course of history had their origins in China, a team of medical geneticists reported Sunday, as did a third plague outbreak that struck less harmfully in the 19th century. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 31, 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualty patterns indicate that waves of this late-19th-century/early-20th-century pandemic may have been from two different sources.  The first was primarily bubonic and was carried around the world through ocean-going trade, through transporting infected persons, [[rat]]s, and cargoes harboring [[flea]]s. The second, more virulent strain, was primarily [[pneumonic plague|pneumonic]] in character with a strong person-to-person contagion. This strain was largely confined to [[Asia]], in particular [[Manchuria]] and [[Mongolia]].

==Pattern of the pandemic==
The bubonic plague was endemic in populations of infected ground [[rodent]]s in [[central Asia]], and was a known cause of death among migrant and established human populations in that region for centuries. An influx of new people due to political conflicts and global trade led to the distribution of this disease throughout the world.

===Origin in Yunnan Province of China===

A [[natural reservoir]] or nidus for plague is located in western Yunnan and is an ongoing health risk today. The third pandemic of plague originated in this area after a rapid influx of [[Han Chinese]] to exploit the demand for minerals, primarily copper, in the latter half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name = "benedict96"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benedict|first1=Carol|title=Bubonic plague in nineteenth-century China|date=1996|publisher=Stanford Univ. Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=978-0804726610|pages=47, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, the population had exploded to over 7 million people. Increasing transportation throughout the region brought people in contact with [[Xenopsylla cheopis|plague-infected fleas]], the primary vector between the [[yellow-breasted rat]] (Rattus flavipectus) and humans. People  brought the fleas and rats back into growing urban areas, where small outbreaks sometimes reached epidemic proportions.  The plague spread further after  disputes between Han Chinese and [[Hui Muslim]] miners in the early 1850s erupted into a violent uprising known as the [[Panthay rebellion]], which led to further displacements (troop movements and refugee migrations). The outbreak of the plague helped recruit people into the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the plague began to appear in [[Guangxi]] and [[Guangdong]] provinces, Hainan Island, and later the Pearl River delta including [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and [[Hong Kong]]. While [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William McNeil]] and others thought that the plague was brought from the interior to the coastal regions by troops returning from battles against the Muslim rebels, Benedict suggests that the evidence favors the growing and lucrative opium trade that began after about 1840.&lt;ref name = benedict96/&gt;

In the city of Canton, beginning in March 1894, the disease killed 60,000 people in a few weeks. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague. Within two months, after 100,000 deaths, the death rates dropped below epidemic rates, although the disease continued to be endemic in Hong Kong until 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pryor|first1=E.G.|title=The Great Plague of Hong Kong|journal=Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.|date=1975|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political impact in colonial India===
[[File:Directions for searchers, Pune plague of 1897.jpg|thumb|175px|Directions for searchers, Pune plague of 1897]]

Plague came to [[British India]] in 1896, most likely from Hong Kong where the epidemic had been festering since 1894.  Over the next thirty years, the country would lose 12.5 million people to the disease.  Almost all cases were [[Bubonic plague|bubonic]], with only a very small percentage changing to [[pneumonic plague]]. (Orent, p.&amp;nbsp;185) The disease was initially seen in port cities, beginning with Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]), but later emerged in [[Pune]], [[Kolkata]], and [[Karachi]] (now in [[Pakistan]]).  By 1899, the outbreak spread to smaller communities and rural areas in many regions of India.  Overall, the impact of plague epidemics was greatest in western and northern India—in the provinces then designated as Bombay, Punjab, and the United Provinces—while eastern and southern India were not as badly affected.

The colonial government's measures to control the disease included quarantine, isolation camps, travel restrictions and the exclusion of [[India's traditional medical practices]]. Restrictions on the populations of the coastal cities were established by Special Plague Committees with overreaching powers, and enforced by the British military.  Indians found these measures culturally intrusive and, in general, repressive and tyrannical.  Government strategies of plague control underwent significant changes during 1898–1899.  By that time, it was apparent that the use of force in enforcing plague regulations was proving counter-productive and, now that the plague had spread to rural areas, enforcement in larger geographic areas would be impossible.  At this time, British health officials began to press for widespread vaccination using [[Waldemar Haffkine]]’s plague vaccine, although the government stressed that inoculation was not compulsory.  British authorities also authorized the inclusion of practitioners of indigenous systems of medicine into plague prevention programs.

Repressive government actions to control the plague led the Pune nationalists to criticise the government publicly. On 22 June 1897, the [[Chapekar brothers]], young Pune [[Hindu]]s, shot and killed  [[Walter Charles Rand]], an Indian Civil Services officer acting as Pune Special Plague Committee chairman, and his military escort, Lieutenant Ayerst. The action of the Chapekars was seen as terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9QycqW1qogC&amp;pg=PA152 |page=152 |title=An International History of Terrorism: Western and Non-western Experiences |last=Zaman |first=Rashed Uz |chapter=Bengal terrorism and the ambiguity of the Bengali Muslims |editor=Jussi H. Nhimaki |editor2=Bernhard Blemenau |editor3=Jussi Hanhim Ki |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=0415635403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also found the nationalist press guilty of incitement.  Independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] was charged with sedition for his writings as editor of the [[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]] newspaper. He was sentenced to eighteen months rigorous imprisonment.

Public reaction to the health measures enacted by the British Indian state ultimately revealed the political constraints of medical intervention in the country. These experiences were formative in the development of India's modern public health services.{{Citation needed|reason=Sep 2009|date=September 2009}}

Each of these areas, as well as [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and other areas of Europe, continued to experience plague outbreaks and casualties until the 1960s.  The last significant outbreak of plague associated with the pandemic occurred in Peru and [[Argentina]] in 1945.

==Disease research==
Researchers working in Asia during the "Third Pandemic" identified plague vectors and the plague bacillus. In 1894, in Hong Kong, Swiss-born French bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]] isolated the responsible bacterium (''[[Yersinia pestis]]'') and determined the common mode of transmission. In 1898, French researcher [[Paul-Louis Simond]] demonstrated the role of fleas as a vector.

The disease is caused by a bacterium usually transmitted by the bite of [[flea]]s from an infected host, often a [[black rat]]. The bacteria are transferred from the blood of infected rats to the rat flea (''[[Xenopsylla cheopsis]]''). The bacillus multiplies in the stomach of the flea, blocking it. When the flea next bites a mammal, the consumed blood is regurgitated along with the bacillus into the bloodstream of the bitten animal. Any serious outbreak of plague in humans is preceded by an outbreak in the rodent population. During the outbreak, infected fleas that have lost their normal rodent hosts seek other sources of blood.  The bacterium that causes this disease, ''Yersinia pestis'', was named after Yersin.  His discoveries led in time to modern treatment methods, including [[insecticide]]s, the use of [[antibiotic]]s and eventually plague [[vaccine]]s.

The British colonial government in India pressed medical researcher [[Waldemar Haffkine]] to develop a plague vaccine.  After three months of persistent work with a limited staff, a form for human trials was ready.  On January 10, 1897 Haffkine tested it on himself.  After the initial test was reported to the authorities, volunteers at the Byculla jail were used in a control test, all inoculated prisoners survived the epidemics, while seven inmates of the control group died.  By the turn of the century, the number of inoculees in India alone reached four million.  Haffkine was appointed the Director of the Plague Laboratory (now called [[Haffkine Institute]]) in Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waldemar Mordekhaï Haffkine (1860-1930).

'''Trinity Health''' is a national, not-for-profit Catholic health system operating 93 hospitals in 22 states, including 120 continuing care locations — including home care, hospice, PACE and senior living facilities. Based in [[Livonia, Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20121102/FREE/121109962 |title=Crain's Detroit Business : Subscription Center |publisher=Crainsdetroit.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity Health employs more than 120,000 people including 5,300 physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity-health.org/about-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity Health operates facilities in the U.S. states of Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and South Dakota.

Trinity Health is sponsored by Catholic Health Ministries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity-health.org/board-of-directors |title=Board of Directors &amp; Members of Catholic Health Ministries - Trinity Health, Livonia, Michigan (MI) |publisher=Trinity-health.org |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; an entity established by the Roman Catholic Church to oversee the healing ministry and Catholic identity of Trinity Health.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
In May 2000, Trinity Health was formed through a merger between Holy Cross Health System in [[South Bend, Indiana]], and Mercy Health Services in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The new organization initially comprised 25 health ministries across seven states—California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and Ohio—with 45,000 employees and 7,000 physicians. Trinity Health’s headquarters were established first in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and later in Novi, Michigan. At the time, Trinity Health was the 10th largest health system in the nation and the fourth largest Catholic health care system in the country, by total number of hospitals and total bed count, respectively. It operated 47 acute-care hospitals, 432 outpatient facilities, 32 long-term care facilities, and numerous home health offices and hospice programs in 10 states.

==Divestures==

In 2015, Trinity divested three of their financially struggling facilities to for-profit [[Prime Healthcare Services]], including:

St. Joseph Mercy Port Huron Hospital, [[Port Huron, Michigan]]- sold September 2015 in a $37.5 million transaction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20150901/NEWS01/150909988/port-huron-hospital-sale-brings-name-change-improvements&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy Suburban Hospital, [[East Norriton, Pennsylvania]]- sold in March 2015 in a $35 million transaction;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/health-care/2015/09/mercy-suburban-hospital-sale-prime-healthcare.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Michael's Medical Center]], [[Newark, New Jersey]]- sold to Prime Healthcare in a $62 million bankruptcy sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njbiz.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20160407/NJBIZ01/160409839/prime-healthcare-takeover-of-st-michaels-gets-final-approval-needed&amp;template=mobileart&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and religious directives ===
As a Catholic health care provider, Trinity Health hospitals embrace and follow the ''Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services'', issued by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. The directives guide health care facilities in making decisions about care and services in a way that is consistent with Catholic faith beliefs.

'''Vision therapy''' (also known as '''vision training''', or '''VT''') is used to improve vision skills such as eye movement control, eye coordination, contrast sensitivity, and perception.  It primarily focuses on improving visual skills in amblyopia and many binocular vision anomalies including accommodative disorders, vergence disorders, eye movement disorders,&lt;ref&gt;Scheiman and Wick, pages 221-228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin and Borsting, pages 421-424, 487-488&lt;/ref&gt; and the training of [[stereopsis]].  VT involves a series of procedures carried out in both home and office settings, usually under professional supervision by an [[Optometrist]].&lt;ref name="AOA2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://optometry.ohio.gov/visiontherp.stm | title=Definition of Optometric Vision Therapy and/or Training | publisher=Ohio State Board of Optometry | accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orthoptics]] is a similar discipline, but primarily involves exercises which work on eye alignment for patients with [[strabismus]].  Many [[Ophthalmology|strabismic surgeons]] have an orthoptist in-house.

Vision therapy can be prescribed when a comprehensive eye examination indicates that it is an appropriate treatment option. The specific program of therapy is based on the results of standardized tests and the person's signs and symptoms. Programs typically involve eye exercises and the use of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[prism]]s, [[Optical filter|filters]], occluders, specialized instruments, and computer programs. The course of therapy may last weeks to several years, with intermittent monitoring by the eye doctor.&lt;ref name="AOA2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aoa.org/x7856.xml | title = Vision Therapy | accessdate = 2012-05-05 | publisher = American Optometric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AOA3"&gt;{{cite news | title = Vision Therapy | date = 1999-06-25 | publisher = American Optometric Association | url = http://www.aoa.org/x5411.xml | work = Information for Health Care and Other Allied Professionals A Joint Organizational Policy Statement of the American Academy of Optometry and the American Optometric Association | accessdate = 2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Vision therapy encompasses a wide variety of non-surgical methods&lt;ref name="Aetna"&gt;Aetna. [http://www.aetna.com/cpb/data/CPBA0489.html Aetna Clinical Policy Bulletins: Vision Therapy.] Retrieved August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; to treat disorders of vergence (eye crossing and un-crossing), accommodation (eye focusing and un-focusing), and eye movements (pursuits and saccades).  Vergence and accommodation influence each other through the "Accommodative Convergence / Accommodation" (AC/A) pathway,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aao.org/bcscsnippetdetail.aspx?id=16eb0f96-fa78-436b-8841-e4a5fc8a622c&lt;/ref&gt; so disorders of accommodation can often be related to disorders of vergence and vice versa.  Disorders of accommodation and vergence can lead to eyes which appear too crossed or too uncrossed under ordinary situations, eyes which have extra trouble focusing or unfocusing ([[accommodative hysteresis]]) under ordinary circumstances, or eyes which feel abnormally strained ([[asthenopia]]) when performing tasks that most people have no trouble with.

===Levels of Binocular Sensory Fusion===
* [[Stereopsis]]
* Flat fusion
* Superimposition
* Simultaneous perception

===Amblyopia and Strabismus===
[[Amblyopia]] (when the brain never learns how to use an eye, also known as a "lazy eye") is a condition which optometric and ophthalmological traditions generally agree upon and both treat similarly.  Amblyopia, which can also often lead to eyes which do not attend well to visual targets ([[strabismus]], a "turned eye") until the brain can learn to use that eye.  Ambloypia is treatable with glasses and eye patching (or drops, sometimes called "wet patching"), to give the best correctable vision possible to the amblyopic eye while blurring the better-seeing eye so that the brain must be forced to use the amblyopic eye ("break suppression") and develop good vision for it.  Children, whose brains are still [[neuroplasticity|neuroplastic]], have better outcomes after amblyopia treatment than adults.  Rarely, a child with amblyopia may also have developed a condition known as anomalous sensory correspondence (or [[anomalous correspondence), where the child has learned to attend to visual targets using a part of the retina which is not the central fovea.

==Treatment philosophies==
There is a long-standing and heated controversy between ophthalmologists and optometrists about which visual conditions can be treated, how best to treat them, the extent to which the certain visual tasks impact a person's life, and how effective vision therapy can be at improving higher-level functions such as coordination and cognition.  This has led to several different philosophies and approaches to training the visual system, as well as several branches of alternative medicine.  While both ophthalmological and optometric journals have published peer-reviewed studies on therapies and outcomes, ophthalmological journals have tended to lump alternative medicine practices in with optometric practices.  To add further confusion, some vocal proponents of alternative medicine practices have been optometrists.

There exist a few different broad classifications of vision treatment philosophies, which have been traditionally divided between Optometrists, Ophthalmologists, and practitioners of alternative medicine:

* '''Orthoptic Vision Therapy''', also known as [[orthoptics]].
Orthoptics is a field pertaining to the evaluation and treatment of patients with disorders of the visual system with an emphasis on binocular vision and eye movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/allied-health-professions/careers-in-the-allied-health-professions/orthoptist/ | title=Orthoptist | accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly practiced by [[orthoptists]], [[optometrists]], behavioral optometrists, [[Pediatric ophthalmology|pediatric ophthalmologists]], and general [[ophthalmologists]], traditional orthoptics addresses problems of [[asthenopia|eye strain]], visually induced [[headaches]], [[strabismus]], [[diplopia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and visual related skills required for [[reading (process)|reading]].

* '''Behavioral Vision Therapy''', or '''visual integration vision therapy''' (also known as [[behavioral optometry]]).&lt;ref name="AOA1"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology. [http://www.aao.org/education/library/cta/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=1224 Complementary Therapy Assessment: Vision Therapy for Learning Disabilities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001031817/http://www.aao.org/education/library/cta/loader.cfm?url=%2Fcommonspot%2Fsecurity%2Fgetfile.cfm&amp;PageID=1224 |date=2006-10-01 }} Retrieved August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alternative Vision Therapy''': There have been a number of other approaches which have not been studied in traditional medicine, though which some patients feel give them relief.  These methods are commonly under scrutiny by ophthamlological and optometric journals.  These alternative therapies are commonly practiced by unlicensed professionals, though a minority of optometrists also provide them.

===Orthoptic Vision Therapy===
{{main|Orthoptics}}
Orthoptics aims to treat [[binocular vision]] disorders such as [[strabismus]], and [[diplopia]]. Key factors involved include: Eye Movement Control, Simultaneous Focus at Far, Sustaining Focus at Far, Simultaneous Focus at Near, Sustaining Focus at Near, Simultaneous Alignment at Far, Sustaining Alignment at Far, Simultaneous Alignment at Near, Sustaining Alignment at Near, Central Vision (Visual Acuity) and Depth Awareness.&lt;ref name="College of Optometrists in Vision Development"&gt;COVD. {{cite web |url=http://www.covd.org/Home/ChildrensVisionLearningMonth/17VisualSkills/tabid/274/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725200754/http://www.covd.org/Home/ChildrensVisionLearningMonth/17VisualSkills/tabid/274/Default.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }} Retrieved July 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the exercises used are:
*Near point of [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] exercises (i.e. "pencil push-ups"),
*Base-out prism reading, stereogram cards, computerized training programs are used to improve fusional vergence.&lt;ref name="emedicine"&gt;Bartis, MJ. ''[http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic553.htm Convergence Insufficiency.]'' eMedicine. January 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The wearing of [[convex lenses]]
*The wearing of [[Biconcave lens|concave lenses]]
* "Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises" also employ various eye exercises, however, these are designed to alleviate vestibular disorders, such as dizziness, rather than eye problems.&lt;ref name="dizziness-and-balance1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/treatment/rehab/cawthorne.html |title=Cawthorne-Cooksey Exercises for Dizziness |publisher=Dizziness-and-balance.com |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antisuppression exercises - this is being less commonly practiced, although occasionally it may be used.

There is widespread acceptance of orthoptic therapy indications for:
*Convergence insufficiency.  Patients who experience eyestrain, "tired" eyes, or diplopia (double vision) while reading or performing other near work, and who have convergence insufficiency may benefit from orthoptic treatment.  Patients whose outward drift occurs at distance rather than at near distance are less ideal candidates for treatment.

===Behavioral vision therapy ===
Behavioral VT aims to treat problems including difficulties of visual attention and concentration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14vision-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | title=Concocting a Cure for Kids With Issues | work=NY Times | date=March 10, 2010 | accessdate=9 May 2014 | author=JUDITH WARNER}}&lt;/ref&gt; which behavioral optometrists classify as visual information processing weaknesses.  These manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cpe.vt.edu/gttc/presentations/8eStagesofChange.pdf | title=The Stages of Change | publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University | accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners assert that poor eye tracking may impact reading skills, and suggest that vision training may improve some of the visual skills helpful for reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-100112-072059/unrestricted/Eyetracking_and_prompts_for_improved_learning_final.pdf | title=Eye Tracking And Prompts For Improved Learning | publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute | accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral Vision Therapy is practiced primarily by optometrists who specialize in the area. Historically, there has been a difference in philosophy among optometry and medicine regarding the efficacy and relevance of vision therapy:  Major organizations, including the [[International Orthoptic Association]] and the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] have concluded that there is no validity for clinically significant improvements in vision with Behavioral Vision Therapy, and therefore do not practice it.&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt; However, major optometric organizations, including the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]], and the [[Optometric Extension Program]], support the assertion that non-strabismic visual therapy does address underlying visual problems which are claimed to affect learning potential.  These optometric organizations are careful to distinguish, though, that vision therapy does not directly treat learning disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Vision, learning and dyslexia.

Vision therapy treatment aims to train: Gross Visual-Motor skills, Fine Visual-Motor skills, Visual Perception, Peripheral Vision, Contrast &amp; Color Perception.&lt;ref name="College of Optometrists in Vision Development"/&gt;

====Exercises====
Some of the exercises in VT involve the use of:
*Loose prisms, near point of convergence - for vergence training
*Loose lenses (concave and convex), lens flippers, near point of accommodation - for accommodative training
*Stereoscopes, stereogram cards, vectographs, anaglyphs, amblyoscopes, synoptophores, computerized training programs, and base-out reading prism - for fusion and vergence training
*Marsden balls, rotation trainers, and saccadic fixators for eye movement training
*Visigraph / ReadAlyzer reading eye movement trackers
*Balance board/beams
*Directional sequencers

====Efficacy====
In 1988, a review of 238 scientific articles was published in the ''Journal of the American Optometric Association'' widely defined vision therapy as "a clinical approach for correcting and ameliorating the effects of eye movement disorders, non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions, focusing disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus, and certain visual perceptual (information processing) disorders." - and thereby did not discriminate between orthoptic and behavioral visual therapy. The paper was positive about vision therapy generally: "It is evident from the research that there is scientific support for the efficacy of vision therapy in modifying and improving oculomotor, accommodative, and binocular system disorders, as measured by standardized clinical and laboratory testing methods for patients of all ages for whom it is properly undertaken and employed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3283203 |year=1988 |title=The efficacy of optometric vision therapy. The 1986/87 Future of Visual Development/Performance Task Force |journal=Journal of the American Optometric Association |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=95–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent (2005) review concluded less positively that: ''"Less robust, but believable, evidence indicates visual training may be useful in developing fine stereoscopic skills and improving visual field remnants after brain damage. As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises in the remainder of the areas reviewed, and their use therefore remains controversial."''&lt;ref name="Rawstron"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15825744 |year=2005 |author1=Rawstron |first1=J.

D |last3=Elder |first3=M. J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, noted neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] published a case study about "Stereo Sue", a woman who had regained her [[stereo vision]], absent for 48 years, after undergoing vision therapy. The article was published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, which is fact-checked but not peer-reviewed, very few details were given of the exact therapies used and the article discussed only one case of [[stereopsis recovery]].&lt;ref name=Sacks&gt;{{cite news | author=Oliver Sacks | title=A Neurologist's Notebook: "Stereo Sue" | publisher=The New Yorker | date=June 19, 2006 | page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the woman described by Sacks, [[Susan R. Barry|Susan Barry]], a neurobiology professor at Mt. Holyoke College, subsequently published a book, "Fixing My Gaze." The book discusses multiple case histories and details the therapy procedures and the science underlying them.

A systematic review of the literature on the effects of vision therapy on visual field defects published in 2007 concluded that it was unclear to what extent patients benefited from [[vision restoration therapy]] (VRT) as "no study has given a satisfactory answer." The authors concluded that ''scanning compensatory therapy'' (SCT) seemed to provide a more successful rehabilitation, and simpler training techniques, therefore they recommended SCT until the effects of VRT could be defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.103853 |pmid=17135455 |pmc=2077942 |title=The effect of visual training for patients with visual field defects due to brain damage: A systematic review |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=555–64 |year=2007 |last1=Bouwmeester |first1=L |last2=Heutink |first2=J |last3=Lucas |first3=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 review of the literature concluded that "there is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioral optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioral optometrists ... a large majority of behavioral management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated."&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.2008.00607.x |pmid=19154276 |title=A critical evaluation of the evidence supporting the practice of behavioural vision therapy |journal=Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=4–25 |year=2009 |last1=Barrett |first1=Brendan T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than for [[strabismus]] (such as intermittent [[exotropia]]&lt;ref name="Zhang KK 2007"/&gt;) and [[convergence insufficiency]], the consensus among ''ophthalmologists'', ''orthoptists'' and ''pediatricians'' is that non-strabismic visual therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Rawstron/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helveston"/&gt; In 1998, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]], and [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]] issued a policy statement regarding the use of vision therapy specifically for the treatment of ''learning problems'' and ''dyslexia.'' According to the statement: "No scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of eye exercises ('vision therapy')... in the remediation of these complex pediatric neurological conditions."&lt;ref name=JointStatement1998&gt;{{cite web | publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, American Academy of Ophthalmology. | url=http://www.aao.org/about/policy/upload/Learning-Disabilities-Dyslexia-and-Vision.pdf | title=Policy Statement: Learning Disabilities, Dyslexia, and Vision | date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2004, the American Academy of Ophthalmology released a position statement asserting that there is no evidence that vision therapy retards the progression of ''[[myopia]]'', no evidence that it improves visual function in those with ''[[hyperopia]]'' or ''[[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]],'' or that it improves ''vision lost through disease processes.''&lt;ref name=AAOph2004&gt;{{cite web | publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology | url=http://www.aao.org/education/guidelines/cta/training.cfm | title=Complementary Therapy Assessment: Vision Training for Refractive Errors | year=2004 | accessdate=2008-04-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015183505/http://aao.org/education/guidelines/cta/training.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also supported by the International Orthoptic Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/ |title=International Orthoptic Association |publisher=Internationalorthoptics.org |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Statement mentioned above&lt;ref name="JointStatement1998" /&gt; was criticised at the time by Merrill Bowan, a vision therapy enthusiast, for being biased, with the author of a rebuttal concluding "The AAP/AAO/AAPOS paper contains errors and internal inconsistencies. Through highly selective reference choices, it misrepresents the great body of evidence from the literature that supports a relationship between visual and perceptual problems as they contribute to classroom difficulties.".&lt;ref name=Bowan&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12387562 |year=2002 |author1=Bowan |first1=M. D |title=Learning disabilities, dyslexia, and vision: A subject review--a rebuttal, literature review, and commentary |journal=Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.) |volume=73 |issue=9 |pages=553–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also states that the Joint Statement presents an unsupported opinion by implication that Optometrists claim that vision therapy cures the learning problem.  A similar criticism could be leveled at the 2004 American Academy of Ophthalmology paper which implies that vision therapy is claimed to treat "vision lost through disease processes".  There is a common theme that critics of vision therapy seem to do by placing vision therapy under the same banner with alternative therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70167-X |pmid=10570700 |title=Alternative and Controversial Treatments for Attention-Deficit/hyperactivity Disorder |journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=977–92 |year=1999 |last1=Baumgaertel |first1=Anna }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By implication, the lack of evidence for the alternative therapies is cited as a lack of evidence for vision therapy.  No supporting evidence is given that vision therapy is actually used to treat eye disease or vision lost through disease processes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some optometrists take a slightly different view. In 1999 a joint statement by the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]] and [[Optometric Extension Program|Optometric Extension Program Foundation]] reported: "Many visual conditions can be treated effectively with spectacles or contact lenses alone; however, some are most effectively treated with vision therapy....Research has demonstrated that vision therapy can be an effective treatment option for ''ocular motility problems, non-strabismic binocular disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, accommodative disorders (and) visual information processing disorders.''"&lt;ref name=Optometry1999&gt;{{cite web | publisher=American Academy of Optometry | url=http://covd.org/Portals/0/Vision-Therapy%20-%20JOPS%20AAO%20&amp;%20AOA.pdf | title=Vision Therapy a joint organizational policy statement | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners in Behavioral optometry (also known as ''functional optometrists'' or ''optometric vision therapists'')  practice methods that have been characterized as a [[alternative medicine|complementary alternative medicine]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Torin Monahan. [http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/vision.pdf "Vision Control and Autonomy Constraints: Managed Care Confronts Alternative Medicine."] June 1998.

The consensus among Ophthalmologists, Orthoptists and Pediatricians is that "visual training" in non-strabismic Behavioural Vision therapy lacks documented scientific evidence of effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Rawstron/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helveston"/&gt; Although Ophthalmologists and Orthoptists believe that exercises can improve [[binocular vision]] control, they believe it does not purely improve monocular [[visual acuity]] such as that in [[amblyopia]] (rather, occlusion is the therapy of choice),&lt;ref name="Georgievski Z 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09273970701631975 |pmid=18058356 |title=Orthoptists' Management of Amblyopia—A Case-Based Survey |journal=Strabismus |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=197–203 |year=2009 |last1=Georgievski |first1=Zoran |last2=Koklanis |first2=Konstandina |last3=Leone |first3=Josie }}&lt;/ref&gt; change a person's [[refractive error]].

==== Behavioral optometry====
Behavioral optometry is a branch of optometry that explores how visual function influences a patient's day-to-day activities.  Vision therapy is a subset of behavioral optometry.  In general, vision therapists attempt to improve vision, and therefore day-to-day [[well-being]], of patients using "eye exercises," prism, and lenses, with more emphasis on the patient's visual function.  Among schools of medicine, ophthalmology does not see merit in the procedures surrounding many of behavioral optometry's practices, arguing that there have not been enough studies of high enough merit to warrant practicing of vision therapy.

===== Techniques =====
In a 2008, vision scientist Brendan Barrett published a review of behavioral optometry at the invitation of the UK [[College of Optometrists]]. Barrett wrote that behavioral optometry was not a well-defined field but that it was sometimes said to be an "extension" to optometry, taking a [[holistic]] approach: practitioners of the therapy use techniques outside mainstream optometry to "influence the visual process". Barrett discussed these techniques under ten headings:

*Vision therapy for accommodation/vergence disorders&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; eye exercises and training to try and alleviate these disorders. There is evidence that convergence disorders may be helped by eye exercises,{{mcn|date=September 2018}} but no good evidence exercises help with accommodation disorders. 
*The underachieving child&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; therapies claimed to help children with [[dyslexia]], [[dyspraxia]] and [[attention deficit disorder]] &amp;ndash; a "vulnerable" target market. There is no evidence that behavioral optometry is of any benefit in relation to these conditions.
*Prisms for near binocular disorders and for producing postural change&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the use of "yoked" prisms to redirect a person's gaze and bring about a range of claimed benefits including postural improvements and increased wellbeing.{{mcn|date=September 2018}} There is a lack of evidence for the effect this approach may have.
*Near point stress and low-plus&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the use of special lenses to adjust near-field vision, even for people who would not normally need glasses. This is claimed to bring about postural benefits and relieve visual stress.{{mcn|date=September 2018}} Some research has been carried out in this area and its effectiveness remains "unproven".{{mcn|date=September 2018}}
*Use of low-plus lenses at near to slow the progression of myopia{{mcn|date=September 2018}}
*Therapy to reduce myopia{{mcn|date=September 2018}}
*Behavioural approaches to the treatment of strabismus and amblyopia{{mcn|date=September 2018}}
*Training central and peripheral awareness and syntonics{{mcn|date=September 2018}}
*Sports vision therapy
*Neurological disorders and neurorehabilitation after trauma/stroke.&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt;

Barrett noted the lack of published controlled trials of the techniques. He found that there are a few areas where the available evidence suggest that the approach might have some value, namely in the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease or injury—but he found that in the other areas where the techniques have been used, the majority, there is no evidence of their value.&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt; In contrast, [[Steven Novella]] points out that the only condition that there is good quality scientific evidence for is convergence disorders. This points out a problem that is common with Complementary or integrative medicine, a type of [[Alternative medicine]], is that a promising use for treating a single disorder is applied to a wide range of disorders for which there is no evidence.&lt;ref name="Vision therapy quackery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Vision Therapy Quackery|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/vision-therapy-quackery/|website=Science Based Medicine|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eye exercises=====
The eye exercises used in vision therapy can generally be divided into two groups; those employed for "strabismic" outcomes and those employed for "non-strabismic" outcomes, to improve eye health.  
Ophthalmologists and orthoptists do not endorse these exercises as having clinically significant validity for improvements in vision. Usually, they see these perceptual-motor activities being in the sphere of either [[speech therapy]] or [[occupational therapy]].

Some of the exercises used are
*Near point of [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] training, or the ability for both eyes to focus on a single point in space,
*Base-out prism reading, [[stereoscopy|stereogram]] cards, computerized training programs are used to improve fusional vergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1199429-treatment | title=Convergence Insufficiency Treatment &amp; Management | publisher=Medscape | accessdate=8 May 2014 | author=Michael J Bartiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The wearing of [[convex lenses]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ophth.wisc.edu/news/kushner_book/Eye%20Muscle%20Problems%20In%20Children%20and%20Adults.pdf | title=Eye Muscle Problems in Children and Adults: A Guide to Understanding | author=Burton J. Kushner | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The wearing of [[Biconcave lens|concave lenses]]
* "Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises" also employ various eye exercises, however, these are designed to alleviate vestibular disorders, such as dizziness, rather than eye problems.&lt;ref name="dizziness-and-balance1"/&gt;
* Antisuppression exercises - this is no longer commonly practiced, although occasionally it may be used.

The eye exercises used in Behavioural Vision Therapy, also known as Developmental Optometry is practiced primarily by Behavioural Optometrists.  Behavioral Vision Therapy aims to treat problems including difficulties of '''visual attention and concentration''', which may manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another.

Some of the exercises{{clarify|date=July 2013}} used are:
*Marsden balls
*Rotation trainers
*Syntonics
*Balance board/beams
*Saccadic fixators
*Directional sequencers

Fusional Amplitude and Relative Fusional Amplitude training{{clarify|date=July 2013}}
*Designed to alleviate [[convergence insufficiency]]. The CITT study (Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial) was is a randomized, double-blind multi-center trial (high level of reliability) indicates that Orthoptic Vision Therapy is an effective method of treatment of convergence insufficiency (CI). Both optometry and ophthalmology were co-authors of this study.
*Designed to alleviate intermittent [[exotropia]]&lt;ref name="Zhang KK 2007"/&gt; or other less common forms of strabismus.

Certain [[do-it-yourself]] eye exercises are claimed by some to improve [[visual acuity]] by reducing or eliminating [[refractive errors]].  Such claims rely mainly on [[anecdotal evidence]], and are not generally endorsed by orthoptists, ophthalmologists or optometrists.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/eyequack.html | title=Eye-Related Quackery |date = April 2009| publisher=Quackwatch | first=Russell |last=Worrall|author2=Nevyas, Jacob  |author3=Barrett, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllAboutVision&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/buysmart/see_clearly.htm | title=The See Clearly Method: Do Eye Exercises Improve Vision? |date = December 2006| publisher=AllAboutVision.com |author1=Rob Murphy |author2=Marilyn Haddrill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese school children always do eye exercises twice per day during school, which are compulsory.

The German optician [[Hans-Joachim Haase (optician)|Hans-Joachim Haase]] developed a method to correct an alleged misalignment. His method, called the ''[[MKH method]]'', is not recognized as an evidence-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-2002-32883 |title=Bessern Prismen nach Hans-Joachim Haase die Stereosehschärfe? |trans-title=Do prisms according to Hans-Joachim Haase improve stereoacuity? |language=de |journal=Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde |volume=219 |issue=6 |pages=422–8 |year=2002 |last1=Kromeier |first1=Miriam |last2=Schmitt |first2=Christina |last3=Bach |first3=Michael |last4=Kommerell |first4=Guntram }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-2006-927268 |title=Beeinflussen Prismen nach H.-J.

===== Conceptual basis and effectiveness =====
Behavioral optometry is largely based on concepts which lack plausibility or which contradict mainstream [[neurology]], and most of the research done has been of poor quality.&lt;ref name=sbm&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Science-Based Medicine |title=A Science Lesson from a Homeopath and Behavioral Optometrist |accessdate=1 March 2015 |author=Novella, Steven |authorlink=Steven Novella |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-science-lesson-from-a-homeopath-and-behavioral-optometrist/ |date=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[chiropractic]], there seems to be a spectrum of scientific legitimacy among practitioners: at one extreme there is some weak evidence in support of the idea that myopia may be affected by eye training;&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt; at the other extreme are concepts such as "syntonic phototherapy" which proposes that differently colored lights can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

A review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach.&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt; In 2008 Barrett concluded that "the continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioural management approaches, and the paucity of controlled trials in particular, represents a major challenge to the credibility of the theory and practice of behavioural optometry."&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt;

Behavioral optometry has been proposed as being of benefit for children with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[autism]] – this proposal is based on the idea that since people with these conditions often have abnormal eye movement, correcting this may address the underlying condition. Evidence supporting this approach is however weak; the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] and the [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]] have said that learning disabilities are neither caused nor treatable by visual methods.&lt;ref&gt;Wolraich ''et al''. 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4zNkiMA_SggC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq=Behavioral%20optometry%20autism&amp;pg=PA269 pp. 269-270].&lt;/ref&gt;

===== History =====
Behavioral optometry is considered by some optometrists to have its origins in [[Orthoptics|orthoptic]] vision therapy. However, Vision therapy is differentiated between strabismic/orthoptic vision therapy (which many Optometrists, [[Orthoptist]]s and [[Ophthalmologist]]s practice) and non-strabismic vision therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8014367 |year=1994 |author1=Birnbaum |first1=M.

===Alternative Vision Therapy===
Alternative vision therapies include methods that some patients feel subjectively help them.  Many optometrists and ophthalmologists are skeptical of the efficacy of these methods and practices, though some have been found to have at least a basis in studied principles to some limited degree (such as syntonics and [[melanopsin]], TBI and tinted lenses, and the adoption of EMDR by the VA Hospital in the USA).

* The [[Bates method]]
* The [[Neo-Reichian]] approach
* [[Iridology]]
* Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ([[EMDR]])

==Controversy==
Some physicians are skeptical about the efficacy of "vision therapy" stating that it lacks data and is mostly anecdotal.&lt;ref name="stlbeacon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/17515/vision_therapy_part_2|title=Ophthalmologists express skepticism about vision therapy|date=30 Nov 2010|publisher=St. Louis Beacon|author=Jo Seltzer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720014459/http://stlbeacon.org/#!/content/17515/vision_therapy_part_2|archivedate=2013-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics along with the American Academy of Ophthalmology "essentially declared war" on developmental optometry, as Judith Warner wrote in a New York Times article.&lt;ref name="stlbeacon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14vision-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=Concocting a Cure for Kids With Issues|publisher=|date=10 March 2010|author=Judith Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within the field of optometry the U.K. College of Optometrists noted the "Continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioral management approaches" in the second college of Optometrists report.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics is also critical of behavioral optometry. In 2009 it reviewed 35 years of the literature in support of vision therapy and issued a statement — in conjunction with other ophthalmological associations — condemning the therapy and its contention that it could help with learning disabilities. Visual problems, it claimed, are not the basis for learning disabilities.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; It issued a stern warning about the seductions of treatments that sound convincing but aren’t based on science: "Ineffective, controversial methods of treatment such as vision therapy may give parents and teachers a false sense of security that a child’s learning difficulties are being addressed, may waste family and/or school resources and may delay proper instruction or remediation."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; The website by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus states: "Behavioral vision therapy is considered to be scientifically unproven" and "There is no evidence that vision therapy delays the progression or leads to correction of myopia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/108 |title=Vision Therapy — AAPOS |publisher=Aapos.org |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Various forms of visual therapy have been used for centuries.&lt;ref name="Helveston"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2005.06.003 |pmid=16310470 |title=Visual Training: Current Status in Ophthalmology |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=140 |issue=5 |pages=903–10 |year=2005 |last1=Helveston |first1=Eugene M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of vision therapy was introduced in the late nineteenth century for the non-surgical treatment of [[strabismus]]. This early and traditional form of vision therapy was the foundation of what is now known as [[orthoptics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2007.01576.x |pmid=17997777 |title=Victorian orthoptists' performance in the photo evaluation of diabetic retinopathy |journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Ophthalmology |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=733–8 |year=2007 |last1=Georgievski |first1=Zoran |last2=Koklanis |first2=Konstandina |last3=Fenton |first3=Adam |last4=Koukouras |first4=Ignatios }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the twentieth century, orthoptists, working with [[ophthalmologists]], introduced a variety of training techniques mainly designed to improve binocular function. In the second half of the twentieth century, vision therapy began to be used by optometrists and paramedical personnel to treat conditions ranging from uncomfortable vision to poor reading and academic performance. It has also been claimed specifically to improve eyesight, and even to improve athletic performance.&lt;ref name="Helveston"/&gt;

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, most vision therapy is done by optometrists, while traditional orthoptics continues to be practiced by orthoptists and ophthalmologists. Based on assessments of claims and studies of published data, ophthalmologists claim that, except for near point of convergence exercises, vision therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Helveston"/&gt;

A '''water stop''' or '''water station''' on a [[rail transport|railroad]] is a place where [[Steam locomotive|steam train]]s stop to replenish [[water]]. The stopping of the train itself is also referred to as a "water stop". The term originates from the times of [[steam engine]]s when large amounts of water were essential. Also known as '''wood and water stops''' or '''coal and water stops''', since it was reasonable to replenish engines with [[fuel]] as well when adding water to the boiler. 

During the very early days of steam locomotives, water stops were necessary every 7–10 miles (11-16 km) and consumed much travel time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofallen.org/pdf/DrivingTourBrochure1.pdf. "History of Allen"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a brochure about [[Allen, Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|For example, a section of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] running in the [[Mojave Desert]] between [[Ludlow, California|Ludlow]] and [[Amboy, California|Amboy]] had water stops spaced every 5–10 miles: Lavic, [[Ragtown, California|Ragtown]], Ash Hill, Klondike, [[Siberia, California|Siberia]], [[Bagdad, California|Bagdad]],&lt;ref&gt; see [https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.557016,-115.745065&amp;spn=0.40,0.40 Google Maps], all eight of them being [[ghost town]]s now.&lt;/ref&gt;}} With the introduction of [[Tender (rail)|tender]]s (a special car containing water and fuel), trains could run 100–150 miles (160–240&amp;nbsp;km) without a refill. 

To accumulate the water, water stops employed [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s and tank ponds. The water was initially pumped by [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s, or by [[hand pump]]s often by the train crew themselves. Later, small steam and gasoline engines were used.&lt;ref&gt;Maury Klein (2000) "The Life &amp; Legend of [[E.H. Harriman]]", UNC Press, {{ISBN|0-8078-2517-4}}  [https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_SNYTCjjkC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22water+stops%22+train&amp;sig=K-o1TwgrRE3TMKnorBQtxwhgrTM p. 142]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the U.S. railroad system expanded, large numbers of tank ponds were built by damming various small [[Stream|creeks]] that intersected the tracks in order to provide water for water stops.  [[Largemouth bass]] were often stocked in tank ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Charles F., ''Black Bass &amp; the Fly Rod'', Stackpole Books (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod, Lyons &amp; Burford Publishers (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many water stops along new railways evolved into new settlements. When a train stopped for water and was positioned by a water tower, the [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] swung out the [[spigot]] arm over the water tender and "jerked" the chain to begin watering. This gave rise to a 19th-century slang term "Jerkwater town" for towns too insignificant to have a regular [[train station]].&lt;ref&gt;Irving Lewis Allen (1993) "The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech",  Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-509265-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=j41z0yeKbeIC&amp;pg=PT39&amp;dq=%22water+stops%22+train&amp;sig=tLaxiUXHul8gvck1N7YNwJ6BvKI#PPT39,M1 p. 254]&lt;/ref&gt; Some water stops grew into established settlements: for example, the town of [[Coalinga, California]], formerly, ''Coaling Station A'', gets its name from the original coal stop at this location.&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|1018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, with the replacement of steam engines by [[diesel locomotive]]s many of the then obsolete water stops, especially in deserted areas, became ghost towns.

Isolated water stops were among favorite [[ambush]] places for [[train robber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Roy R. Roberg, Jack L. Kuykendall (1993) "Police &amp; Society", Wadsworth Pub. Co. {{ISBN|0-534-19872-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=esuORZ40n6IC&amp;q=%22water+stops%22+train&amp;dq=%22water+stops%22+train&amp;pgis=1 p. 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5403">'''Weather pains''', '''weather-related pain''', or '''meteoropathy''' is a phenomenon that occurs when people with conditions such as [[arthritis]] or limb injuries claim to feel pain, particularly with changes in [[barometric pressure]], [[humidity]] or other weather phenomena.&lt;ref name="pain"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/safety/2005-02-21-health-pressure_x.htm Scientists still mulling causes of weather-related pain], by April Chan, USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://arthritis.about.com/od/weather/Weather_Arthritis_Barometric_Pressure_Affect_Humidity_Climate.htm Weather &amp; Arthritis - Barometric Pressure Affect - Humidity - Climate], About&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific evidence, however, does not support a connection between weather and arthritic pain and concludes that it is largely or entirely due to perceptual errors such as [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smedslund|first1=G|last2=Hagen|first2=KB|title=Does rain really cause pain?

==History==
The perceived relationship between changes in weather and pain has been recorded since the classical Roman age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120912044051/http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=2201  Influence of Weather on Report of Pain], by Robert N. Jamison, PhD, International Association for the Study of Pain Newsletter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] was the first to note, in about 400 B.C., that many illnesses were related to changes in season.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen S. Weathering. New York: M. Evans, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The large body of folklore about how weather affects pain is reflected by traditional sayings and expressions, such as "aches and pain, coming rains," "feeling under the weather," and "ill health due to evil winds."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The first publication of documented changes in pain perception associated with the weather was in the ''American Journal of the Medical Sciences'' in 1887. This case report described a person with [[phantom limb]] pain who concluded that "approaching storms, dropping barometric pressure and rain were associated with increased pain complaint."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Shutty MS, Cunduff G, DeGood DE|title=Pain complaint and the weather: weather sensitivity and symptom complaints in chronic pain patients|journal=Pain|year=1992|volume=49|issue=2|pages=199–204|pmid=1608646|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(92)90143-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most investigations examining the relationship between weather and pain have studied people diagnosed with [[arthritis]]. After reviewing many case reports, Rentshler reported in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' in 1929 that there was strong evidence that "warm weather is beneficial and [[barometric pressure]] changes are detrimental to patients with arthritis."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Countering the 1929 barometric pressure claim, in a 2016 article entitled "Do Your Aches, Pains Predict Rain?" professor of atmospheric sciences Dennis Driscoll is reported as stating: "People need to realize that the pressure changes associated with storms are rather small." In fact, Driscoll observes that the changes associated with a storm are about equivalent to what a person experiences in going up an elevator in a tall building. So far, there have not been many reports of people with arthritis hobbled by elevator rides in the medical literature.&lt;ref name=MedicineNet/&gt;

A study published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2017 examined reports of joint or back pain from millions of doctor visits between 2008 and 2012 as recorded by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], the U.S. health system for the elderly. It compared these to rain data as recorded by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], but found no correlation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/20/the-rain-plain-has-effect-pain/THQuG8xZKv8r4QkEJHw6qL/story.html The rain, it’s plain, has no effect on pain]&lt;/ref&gt;
