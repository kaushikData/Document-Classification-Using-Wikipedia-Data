'''Inácio José de Alvarenga Peixoto''' (1744–1793) was a [[Colonial Brazil]]ian [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]] poet and lawyer. He wrote under the pen name '''Eureste Fenício'''.

It is attributed to him the design of the [[flag of Minas Gerais]].

==Biography==
Peixoto was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], to Simão Alvarenga Braga and Maria Braga. He studied at the Jesuit College in Rio and would later graduate in [[Law]] at the [[University of Coimbra]], where he met and befriended [[Basílio da Gama]], another Brazilian poet.

After he graduated, he served as ''[[:pt:juiz de fora|juiz-de-fora]]'' in [[Sintra]]. Returning to Brazil, he was [[senator]] of the city of [[São João del Rei]] and the ''[[:pt:Ouvidor|ouvidor]]'' of the [[:pt:Comarca do Rio das Mortes (Minas Gerais)|Comarca of Rio das Mortes]].

Due to overdue taxes, Peixoto would adhere to the unsuccessful [[Inconfidência Mineira|1789 Minas Conspiracy]], alongside the poets [[Tomás António Gonzaga]] and [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]], the priest [[José da Silva e Oliveira Rolim]] and the ''[[alférez (rank)|alférez]]'' [[Tiradentes|Joaquim José da Silva Xavier]] (a.k.a. "Tiradentes").

[[Joaquim Silvério dos Reis]], a member of the Conspiracy, betrayed the movement before it could take place. Peixoto was then captured, arrested and sent to [[exile]] in [[Ambaca]], [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], where he died.

Peixoto was married to poet [[Bárbara Heliodora (1758–1819)]], having with her four children. It is said{{by whom|date=February 2016}} that, after Peixoto was exiled, Heliodora's mental health began to gradually decline to the point of [[dementia]].

In [[logic]], an '''''{{lang|la|argumentum a contrario}}''''' (Latin: 'argument from the contrary'), also known as '''appeal from the contrary''', denotes any proposition that is argued to be correct because it is not disproven by a certain case. It is the opposite of the [[analogy]]. When analogy is allowed, ''a contrario'' is forbidden and vice versa.  Arguments ''a contrario'' are often used in the legal system as a way to solve problems not currently covered by a certain system of laws. Although it might be used as a [[Formal fallacy|logical fallacy]], arguments ''a contrario'' are not by definition fallacies.

In law, the use of the ''argumentum a contrario'' finds its footing in the Latin maxim: ‘‘''ubicumque lex voluit dixit, ubi tacuit noluit''’’ that runs as follows: If the Legislator wished to say something, he would do that expressly. Accordingly, one may posit that non-mentioning about something on the part of Legislator leads to the conclusion that the Legislator wanted to be silent in a given matter. However, the full sense of this argument is reflected in the Latin maxim: ‘‘''qui dicit de uno, negat de altero''’’ (‘‘''qui dicit uno, negat de altero''’’), meaning of which is: Who says one thing negates the other one.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, Restrictions on the Use of Analogy in Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 3/2016 (v. 37), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal examples==
*"§ 123 of the X-Law says that green cars need to have blue tires. Therefore, red cars don't have to have blue tires."
Here the argument is based on the fact that red cars are not green cars and therefore § 123 of the X-Law cannot be applied to them. This requires the law to be [[Statutory interpretation|interpreted]] to determine which solution would have been desired if the lawmaker had considered red cars. In this case it's probably safe to assume that they only wanted to regulate green cars and not regulate cars of other colors.

On the other hand, this example:
*"§ 456 of the Y-Law says that it's irrelevant whether a message is sent by letter or by telegraph. Therefore, messages cannot be sent by [[fax machines]]."
As with the example above, the argument is based on the fact that the law does not mention something (in this case, faxes), but leaps to the interpretation that they must therefore not be used. Here, the belief that lawmakers intentionally excluded fax machines is less reasonable than the assumption that fax machines did not exist at this time and that, were the law passed today, they would have been mentioned. Here the ''a contrario'' argument is used fallaciously in two ways: it places the letter of the law above its intent, and mistakes a [[time, place, and manner]] law {{em|regulating}} letters and telegraphs, for a law only {{em|authorizing}} letters and telegraphs, which is it not.

Novel legal cases often hinge on more [[Cogency|cogent]] arguments of the form:
*"§§ 455–457 of the Y-Law specifically cover messages sent by letter or by telegraph, and do not mention fax machines or electronic mail, and thus cannot be held to apply to either of the latter."
Depending upon the intent and scope of the law, it may be held by the court to apply to the previously unaccounted-for situation by analogy, or to not apply because the cases are insufficiently analogous, such that a legislative change to the law's wording would be required for such an expansion of scope.  Cases raising such questions are increasingly common as technology introduces capabilities that are somewhat but not exactly analogous to those provided by older technologies. A high-profile example of the use of ''argumentum a contrario'' (rejected by the court) in such a case is ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]''.

'''Auvergnat''' or '''Auvergnat language'''&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Auzias, Jean-Paul Labourdette ''Petit Futé'' Auvergne - 2017 Flammarion Groupe 2017&lt;/ref&gt; ([[endonym]]: ''auvernhat'') is a language or dialect spoken in [[France]] in part of the [[Massif Central]] and in particular, in most of [[Auvergne]], the province that gives it its name.

Since there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing languages from dialects, there is no real consensus on the structural nature of Auvergnat. It is generally classified as a dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] but some linguists and academics consider it a [[Romance language]] in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Pierre Bonnaud ''Grammaire générale de l'auvergnat à l'usage des arvernisants'' Chamalières; Cercle Terre d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Reichel, ''Grand dictionnaire général auvergnat-français'', Nonette Créer editions 2005 {{ISBN|2-8481-9021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With around 80,000 speakers in the Auvergne region at the beginning of the 21st century, the language appears to be seriously threatened.

== Classification ==
Auvergnat falls under the following categories and subcategories: Indo-European, Italic, Romance, Italo-Western, Gallo-Iberian, Gallo-Romance, Occitan.

==Geographical distribution==
[[Image:Termieras de l'auvernhat.png|thumb|300px|Auvergnat dialect boundaries]]
[[Image:Delimitacion de l'auvernhat.png|thumb|300px|Auvergnat dialect delimitation]]

The effective borders of Auvergnat do not completely coincide with those of the current Region of Auvergne or the historical region of Auvergne but can be described as follows:

* The entire [[département]] of the [[Puy-de-Dôme]]
* a large section of the département of [[Cantal]], largely centered on Saint-Flour and Mauriac.  It is to be noted that Aurillac and the Pierrefort Canton speak a dialect called ''carladézien'', a form of [[languedocien]], with Auvergnat conjugations and the rest largely similar to standard [[languedocien]].
* The larger portion of the [[Haute-Loire]] aside Yssingeaux which speaks [[Vivaro-Alpine]],
* the southern half of [[Allier]], or the Bourbonnais province, near [[Montluçon]] and [[Vichy]], with the northern half toward Moulins traditionally speaking French.
* A large fringe of eastern [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]], in the département of [[Corrèze]], near [[Ussel, Corrèze|Ussel]] and [[Bort-les-Orgues]]. This is a transition zone between Auvergnat and Limousin
* The communities of Noirétable and La Chamba in the western side of the département of [[Loire (department)|Loire]].

===A more precise view on Auvergnat boundaries===
There are strong oppositions between Pierre Bonnaud&lt;ref&gt;Bonnaud, Pierre, "Géographie linguistique. L'exemple de l'Auvergne" in ''Revue d'Auvergne'', 87, 4, 1973 pp 287–339&lt;/ref&gt; (for whom the Auvergnat is a language of its own, see the light orange line on the map – note it is including the easternmost part of the Marchois dialect) and for instance Roger Teulat.&lt;ref&gt;Teulat, Rogièr, "Per una definicion d'un espaci occitan del centre-nòrd (auvernhat)", in ''Quasèrns de linguistica occitana'', 10, 1981, Clermont-Ferrand (ISSN 0338-2419).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language boundaries====
* 1: Latin pratus (meadow) &gt; pra (Occitan, Francoprovençal) vs. pré (French)
* 2: Latin nepos (nephew) &gt; nebot (Occitan) vs. neveu… (French, Francoprovençal)
Light blue area labelled fr is for French-Langue d'Oïl. Light purple area labelled frp is for Francoprovençal.

====Dialect boundaries====
* 0: No paroxyton in the north – defines the Marchois dialect, a name often given to the Occitan spoken in the Croissant area. The area labelled m is the one of the Marchois dialect.
* 3: The ca/cha boundary separated Northern Occitan (Limousin, Auvergnat, Vivaro-Alpine, Marchois) and Southern Occitan (Gascon, Languedocien, Provençal). It is part of the Auvergnat boundary, along with 7, in Cantal. Area lm is for the Limousin dialect, va for Vivaro-Alpine, lg for Languedocien.
* 4: Feminines in ''–ada'' have lost intervocalic ''d'' and became ''–aa'': this separates Auvergnat and Vivaro-Alpine (almost the same boundary for first person indicative present in ''–o'' [u], another characteristic of Vivaro-Alpine).

====Definition boundaries====
These are not characteristic of Auvergnat as a whole but allow for defining a boundary:
* 5 and 6: These match the Core Auvergnat, according to Pierre Bonnaud. They may be used for the western boundary of Auvergnat. Area 5 has the pronunciation [jaR] of ''èr'' (around [ɛR]), area 6 has the palatalisation of 'cl'' to [kʎ] or [çʎ].
* 7: Southeastern boundary has an opposition between ''dreita'' and ''drecha''
* 8: This is for the southern boundary: the plural of ''braç'' has the same pronunciation than the singular; only the article allows differentiation.

Note that most Occitanists use rather 7 than 8 to define the southern boundary.

====Internal variation====
Note some of the definition boundaries allow defining an internal variation. The most traditional one between Lower or Northern Auvergnat and Upper or Southern Auvergnat is the mutation of ''s'' before [k], [p], and [t] (line 9). Lower Auvergnat, defined by Teulat, is the light green area labelled 1 on the map. Upper Auvergnat, defined by Teulat, is the light brown-yellow area labelled 2 on the map. A broader area (light yellow) is generally defined. A Northwestern Auvergnat may be defined as well by 5 and 6. The Northeastern (East of 5 and 6, North of 9) has, according to Bonnaud, a stronger influence from French phonetics (a bit like Marchois).

==Subdialects==

Auvergnat is most often categorized in the [[Northern Occitan]] dialect group, along with [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]] and [[Vivaro-Alpine]].

There are two primary distinctions in Auvergnat:

* Northern Auvergnat (''nord-auvergnat'', also ''bas-auvergnat'') in Puy-de-Dôme and Allier (Bourbonnais) and Haute-Loire north of [[Brioude]].
** In the south of Allier (Bourbonnais), the local ''nord-auvergnat'' has been heavily influenced by French, but Auvergnat linguistic traits remain dominant.  This transition zone to French, called locally ''le Croissant'', includes the northern fringe of Limousin.  See also the article on [[Bourbonnais]].
* Southern Auvergnat (''sud-auvergnat'', also ''haut-auvergnat'') spoken in Cantal, Haute-Loire (with a part of Ardèche and most of Lozère).

The suggestion that Auvergnat is an independent language, distinct from Occitan, has found little resonance with linguists, especially Romance linguists.  It is strongly defended by those who espouse the ''norme bonnaudienne'' a standardization of Auvergnat.

== Linguistic vitality and usage ==

An understanding of the vitality and overall usage of Auvergnat can be garnered from a survey carried out in 2006 in the Auvergne region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifop.com/europe/sondages/opinionf/pratiqueslanguesregionales.asp IFOP 2006 Survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220061832/http://www.ifop.com/europe/sondages/opinionf/pratiqueslanguesregionales.asp |date=December 20, 2008 }} for the Auvergne [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans|Institut d'études occitanes]]. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest group of the two languages spoken in the Auvergne region is referred to as ''patois'' (78% of the population) compared with other regional terms, with certain cultural identities emerging, such as ''auvergnat'' (10%), ''occitan'' (8%), ''bourbonnais'' (5%) or ''langue d'oc'' (4%).

The regional language, whether Occitan (in the whole of the Auvergne region) or Oïl (the north of Allier), represents a strong presence in the region:

* 61% claim to understand their regional language more-or-less, with 22% claiming to understand it easily or perfectly.
* 42% claim to be able to speak it more-or-less, with 12% claiming it as easy.
* 29% claim to read Auvergnat more-or-less, with 10% claiming it easy.
* 17% claim to write Auvergnat more-or-less, with 4% declaring it easy.

A large part of the population that understands or speaks even a little or, moreover, fluently, neither know how to write nor read in that language.

Language learning is found to be essential within the home, according to the survey, (grandparents noted as 61%, or other family members at 50%) with a very weak result from the schools (10%). Herein is found the problem of language-transmission when dependent upon State sponsorship.  40% of adults who did not teach their language to their children report regretting it at the time of the survey.  This feeling is reported more strongly among the 35 or less demographic, at 58%.  The desire to learn the local language is reported strongly, with increasing representation among the young, reported at 23%. According to the survey the desire to incorporate local language learning in schools is as follows: Haute-Loire (53%), Puy-de-Dôme (51%) et Cantal (74%). The desire to teach to their own children is strong (41%) and is stronger still with the 35 and under demographic (58%). 71% of the region's inhabitants are favorable to the idea of maintaining the regional language and culture, with a stronger result in the 35-and-unders (76%). To achieve this desire, different institutions are expected to play a role (in percentage of those surveyed):

* France 3 Auvergne, the local television channel should offer regional language programming (54%)
* The Region (54%), National Education (43%), the Culture Ministry (42%) and the communities are seen by most Auvergnats as the most correct venues to develop and pass on the Auvergnat language and culture.

'''Avigdor HaKohen Miller''' (August 28, 1908 &amp;ndash; April 20, 2001) was an American [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[rabbi]], author, and lecturer. He served simultaneously as a communal [[rabbi]], ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' of [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], and as a [[teacher]] in [[Beis Yaakov]].

== Life and career ==
Avigdor Miller was born Victor Miller in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. Miller was a [[kohen]]. Although he attended public school, only [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] was spoken at home. After school, he went to learn in an afternoon [[Talmud Torah]]. When he finished his regular classes at the Talmud Torah, the school arranged for him to learn privately with Rav Avrohom Eliyahu Axelrod, a [[Lubavitcher]] [[Hasid]]. The Talmud Torah was unable to pay Axelrod, but he continued to teach Miller anyway. Miller would never forget that Axelrod continued to teach him without being paid, and spoke about him with appreciation.&lt;ref name="Rav Avigdor Miller: The Later Years"&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm?contentid=16510&amp;mode=a&amp;contentname=Rav_Avigdor_Miller:_The_Later_Years&amp;recnum=4&amp;sectionid=14 Rav Avigdor Miller: The Later Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506135036/http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm?contentid=16510&amp;mode=a&amp;contentname=Rav_Avigdor_Miller%3A_The_Later_Years&amp;recnum=4&amp;sectionid=14 |date=May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{verify source|date=January 2017}}

=== Yeshiva University ===
At age 17, Miller went to [[New York City]] to attend [[Yeshiva University|Yeshiva College]]. He was elected student body president, and was also the ''[[Torah reading|baal korei]]''. He graduated from both YU and [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary|RIETS]], attaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Semikha|rabbinical ordination]], respectively.

Rabbi [[Moshe Bick]], known as the ''Mezubizher Rav'', who arrived in the United States in 1927, was one of Rabbi Miller's early [[chavruta|study partners]].

While a student at [[Yeshiva University|YU]], Miller joined a ''[[chavurah]]'' together with five other young men (who were all to become notable [[Hareidi]] rabbis) to study [[Mussar literature|Mussar]] from the ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]]'' ''[[Mesillas Yesharim]]''. The organizer of the ''chavurah'' was [[Yaakov Yosef Herman]], a builder of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in [[New York City]] of the early 20th-century. Herman encouraged Miller to travel to [[Europe]] to learn Torah in the [[yeshiva]]s there. Miller met Rabbi [[Isaac Sher]], the son-in-law of Rabbi [[Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Slabodka)|Nosson Tzvi Finkel]], who was in New York collecting funds for the [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka yeshiva]] at the time. Sher did not raise much money, since this was during the [[Great Depression]]. But Sher would later declare this to be his most successful trip to America, since he was able to recruit and bring such a bright student to Slabodka.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Slabodke, Lithuania ===
In 1932, at the age of 24, Miller arrived in Europe to study at the Slabodka yeshiva in [[Vilijampole|Slabodke]], [[Lithuania]]. While there, he studied under Rabbi Sher. As a student in Slabodka, Miller was compelled to wear a coat during the summer, in order to conceal the multitude of overlapping patches that were his trousers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Rabbi Shulman of Slabodka, a son-in-law of Sher, introduced Miller to Ettel Lessin, daughter of Rabbi [[Yaakov Moshe Lessin]] of Slabodka. They were married in 1935.

In the preface to all his books, and on many of his tapes, Miller stated that everything that is un-sourced should be considered the teachings of Rabbi Sher, whom he considered his primary rabbi.

=== Chelsea, Massachusetts ===
In 1938, due to the rise of [[Nazism]] and the tensions leading up to [[World War II]], Miller sought to return to the United States with his wife and two children. The American [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Kaunas|Kovno]] at the time was a public high-school classmate and acquaintance of Miller's from Baltimore. He arranged passage for Miller's wife and children, who were not [[United States]] citizens.

Upon returning to the U.S., Miller became rabbi of [[Congregation Agudath Shalom]] in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levine|first1=Yitzchok|title=The Walnut Street Shul|url=http://personal.stevens.edu/~llevine/Walnut%20Street%20Shul.pdf|work=Hamodia Magazine|issue=8/20/2004|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the community was taken aback by Miller's audacious pedagogy, and the sheer volume of his Torah presentations, attempting in vain to restrain his unconventional approach. Within a few years however, the community had changed their minds, desiring for Miller to stay longer.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Brooklyn, New York ===
In 1944, Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]], ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' of [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], hired Miller to become its ''[[mashgiach ruchani]],'' in which position he served until 1964. In 1945, he also assumed the pulpit of the [[Young Israel]] of Rugby in [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn]]. In 1975, with neighborhood demographics changing, Miller established the Bais Yisroel of Rugby Torah Center on [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] in [[Midwood, Brooklyn]], which served as the main vehicle of his Torah dissemination until his death.

Miller also lectured at many yeshivas and [[Beis Yaakov]] schools throughout the years.

==Death and burial==
Miller was taken to [[Maimonides Medical Center]] shortly after [[Passover]], 2001. Though his physical health was deteriorating, his mental acuity remained intact until his death on Friday morning, April 20, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;27 Nisan 5761&lt;/ref&gt;

At a memorial service the following Sunday, Miller was eulogized by Rabbi Yosef Rosenblum, the ''rosh yeshiva'' of [[Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher]]; Rabbi [[Shmuel Berenbaum]], ''rosh yeshiva'' of [[Mir yeshiva (Brooklyn)|Mir yeshiva]]; Rabbi [[Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg]], ''rosh yeshiva'' of ''[[Torah Ore]]'', who was in America on a visit from [[Jerusalem]]; and Miller's son-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel Brog.

Rabbi [[Simcha Bunim Cohen]], a grandson-in-law of Miller, noted that Miller's descendants married into the esteemed families of Torah scholars such as Rabbi [[Shmuel Ehrenfeld]], the [[Mattersburg|Mattersdorf]]er Rav (&amp; Cohen's grandfather); Rabbi [[Reuven Grozovsky]]; Rabbi [[Aaron Kotler]] and Rabbi [[Baruch Sorotzkin]], ''rosh yeshiva'' of [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]].

Miller's body was transported to Israel, where a funeral was held at the [[Mir yeshiva (Jerusalem)|Mir Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem with a crowd of 25,000 people in attendance. He was eulogized by Rabbi [[Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Mir)|Noson Tzvi Finkel]] (the Mirrer rosh yeshiva), Rabbi [[Moishe Sternbuch]] and others. Rabbi [[Matisyohu Salomon]] was in Israel at the time, and he also delivered a moving eulogy.

Miller was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]] in ''chelkat Tashach''.

At a later event at the end of the [[Shiva (Judaism)|week of mourning]], Rabbi [[Yaakov Perlow]], the [[Novominsk (Hasidic dynasty)|Novominsk]]er [[Rebbe]], head of [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]] and a pupil, remembered Rabbi Miller’s first days as ''mashgiach'' at Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin.

After his death, a synagogue, Nitei Avigdor ({{lang-he|נטעי אביגדור}}), was founded in Miller's name in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], Brooklyn. The synagogue includes a library of Miller's tapes. The founder and rabbi of the synagogue is Rabbi Avrohom Shlomo Yabo, known as the Lemberger Rov, who also gives lectures based on Miller's teachings.

== Legacy ==
Miller was known within Orthodox Jewish circles as a master orator, having superb command of the [[English language]]. His personal magnetism drew students, young and old, from all Jewish backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Miller authored several books about [[Jewish history]], Jewish thought, [[Evolutionary Theory]], and other subjects.

Over a span of 50 years, more than 2,500 lectures by Miller in English were published as [[Compact Cassette|tape cassettes]], as well as several in Yiddish, of which several hundred thousand copies were sold. He gave most of his lectures in his Midwood synagogue. Topics covered are Torah education, ideology, and [[self-help]]. A range of ''[[sefer (Hebrew)|sefarim]]'' were compiled by his students from these lectures, called ''Q&amp;A Thursday Nights With Rabbi Miller.''

Miller sought to awaken his audiences to the fundamental principle that there is a plan and purpose to every minute detail of life in this world, and he wished to make them happy and excited about its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|gx_NgHIBRt4|Montage of him speaking about the Apple }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
Miller was outspoken in his belief that the [[Holocaust]] was a divine response to Jewish cultural assimilation in Europe. He wrote:
{{Cquote | Hitler was not only sent by Heaven, but was sent as a ''kindness'' from Heaven...Because assimilation and intermarriage are worse than death...and the German Jews and others ignored the Torah-teachers and refused to desist from their mad race into assimilation, the Nazis were sent to prevent them and rescue them before they were swallowed up by the nations.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake My Glory'' (Brooklyn, 1980), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://forward.com/articles/195467/a-visit-to-germany-reawakens-fears-of-an-ultra-ort/?p=3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miller was a staunch opponent of [[Zionism]], in both its religious and secular forms, and was known to help the [[Satmar]] Hasidim translate their anti-Zionist ads in ''[[The New York Times]]''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. He was also a well-known opponent of the [[Theory of Evolution]].

Miller stated that the victims of the [[Kent State shootings]] were "bums and they deserved to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;https://torasavigdor.org/rav-avigdor-miller-on-july-4th-and-the-wicked-liberals/&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller had sharp views about African-Americans and the apartheid in South Africa. Of President Lincoln he stated “... I hold it against him that he set free the blacks.  Don’t think it’s being prejudiced, the blacks were doing wonderful.  They were learning to be decent and civilized under their white masters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Q&amp;A 2 Thursday Nights with Rabbi Avigdor Miller|last=Miller|first=Betzalel|publisher=Unknown|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his funeral in Jerusalem, his son said that he had instructed all his descendants to speak only Yiddish with their families.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Quotes ==
Miller has been noted for his ability to summarize ideas into easily digestible [[soundbite]]s. He once said, "Learning [[musar literature|Musar]] teaches one how to live, but learning ''[[Bava Kamma]] is'' living."
&lt;!-- * "[[Global warming]] is a concoction of the [[liberalism|liberal]]s; it is nothing to worry about." No context for this quote - Eliyak --&gt;

[[File:Bamboo Curtain.svg|thumb|300x|The Bamboo Curtain in 1959. The Curtain itself is in black. Note that at the time, [[Laos]] was allied with the [[United States]], as the [[Communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] did not take over the country until 1975. Also, [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] had not yet been [[fall of Saigon|united]]. The boundaries of the now-independent [[former Soviet republics]] are anachronistically shown for context.]]

The '''Bamboo Curtain''' was the [[Cold War]] political demarcation between the [[Communist states]] of [[East Asia]], particularly the [[People's Republic of China]], and the [[capitalist]] and non-Communist states of East, [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. To the north/northwest lay Communist China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and others. To the south and east lay capitalist/non-Communist India, Japan, Indonesia, and others. In particular, following the [[Korean War]], the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] became an important symbol of this Asian division (though the term ''Bamboo Curtain'' itself is rarely used in that specific context).

The colorful term ''Bamboo Curtain'' was derived from ''[[Iron Curtain]]'', a term used widely in Europe from the 1940s to the early '90s to refer to that region's Communist boundaries.  It was used less often than ''Iron Curtain'' in part because while the latter remained relatively static for over 40 years, the ''Bamboo Curtain'' shifted frequently and was somewhat less precise. It was also a less accurate description of the political situation in Asia because of the lack of cohesion within the East Asian Communist Bloc, which resulted in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. During the Cold War, Communist governments in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[Vietnam]] and later [[Laos]] were allies of the [[Soviet Union]], though they sometimes cooperated with China, while [[Cambodia]]'s [[Pol Pot]] [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|regime]] was loyal to China. After the [[Korean War]], North Korea avoided taking sides between the Soviets and China. (Since the end of a Communist bloc in Asia, North Korea remains on good terms with both [[Russia]] and China, although relations between the countries have been strained in modern times.)

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China, the Chinese authorities put sections of the ''curtain'' under a lock-down of sorts, forbidding entry into or passage out of the country without permission from the [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese government]]. Many would-be refugees attempting to flee to capitalist countries were prevented from escaping. Occasional relaxations led to several waves of refugees into the [[British Hong Kong|then-British]] crown colony of [[Hong Kong]].

Improved relations between China and the [[United States]] during the later years of the Cold War rendered the term more or less obsolete,&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Vondas, "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P0McAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Cl0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=bamboo%20curtain&amp;pg=6873%2C551907 Bamboo Curtain Full of Holes, Pitt Profs Say After China Visits]", ''Pittsburgh Press'', 17 October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; except when it referred to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and the divide between allies of the US and allies of the [[USSR]] in Southeast Asia. Today, the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea is typically described as the DMZ. ''Bamboo Curtain'' is used most often to refer to the enclosed borders and economy of [[Myanmar|Burma]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Kaplan, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/09/lifting-the-bamboo-curtain/306945/ Lifting the Bamboo Curtain]", ''The Atlantic'', September 2008. Retrieved February 2009. https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200809/burma&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Petty and Paul Carsten, "[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/laos-wto-idUSL3E8LO2Q520121025 After decades behind the bamboo curtain, Laos to join WTO]", ''Reuters'', 24 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (though this began to open in 2010). The Bamboo Curtain has since given way to the business model called the [[bamboo network]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6381">The [[Bible]] ({{lang-it|Bibbia}}) has been translated into [[Italian language|Italian]] many times since the first printed translation, the so-called ''Malermi Bible'', by [[Nicolò Malermi]] in 1471. The Bible of CEI ([[Conferenza Episcopale Italiana]]) is the official version of the [[Roman Catholicism in Italy|Italian Catholic Church]]. Prior to the initial publication of the CEI edition in 1971, the most common Italian translation of the bible was that of Archbishop [[Antonio Martini]], published from 1769–1781. The 1607 Italian translation by [[Giovanni Diodati]] is the standard reference used in Italian Protestantism; a revised edition of this translation in modern Italian, ''Nuova Diodati'', was published in 1991.

==Early translations==

The first printed translation of the Bible into Italian was the so-called ''Malermi Bible'', by [[Nicolò Malermi]] in 1471 from the [[Latin]] version [[Vulgate]]. 
Other early [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] translations into Italian were made by the [[dominican Order|Domenican]] ''Fra Zaccaria of Florence'' in 1542 (the New Testament only) and by ''Santi Marmochino'' in 1543 (complete Bible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Carlo Maria | last=Martini | authorlink=Carlo Maria Martini | year=1980 | title=La Parola Di Dio Alle Origini |isbn=978-88-7652-350-2|page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protestant]] translations  were made by [[Antonio Brucioli]] in 1530, by ''Massimo Teofilo'' in 1552 and by Giovanni Diodati in 1607 who translated the Bible from Latin and Jewish documents; Diodati's version is the reference version for Italian Protestantism. This edition was revised in 1641, 1712, 1744, 1819 and 1821. A revised edition in modern Italian, ''Nuova Diodati'', was published in 1991.

The most used [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Bible translation in Italian before the 1971 CEI edition was that of Archbishop Antonio Martini. It was published from 1769 to 1771 ([[New Testament]]) and 1776 to 1781 ([[Old Testament]]), and it was formally approved by the [[papacy]]. It consists of parallel columns of Latin Vulgate and Italian with long and detailed notes based mainly on the [[Church Fathers]] writings. The translation is based on the Vulgate checked with the original Greek and Hebrew texts (Martini was assisted in interpreting the Old Testament by a [[rabbi]]). It also includes a list of the main [[Textual variants in the New Testament|textual variants]] for each book. In the 1870 edition, the notes were rewritten and shortened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Il valore giuridico e letterale della Bibbia - Mons A.Martini - del 1778 |url=http://www.utopia.it/allegati/placet_bibbia_martini.htm#98uh |language=Italian |accessdate=21 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016054358/http://www.utopia.it/allegati/placet_bibbia_martini.htm#98uh |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1858–1860 the [[Jewish]] [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] translated part of the Old Testament into Italian.

==20th-century translations==
Major Bible editions published in the 20th century include:
* ''la Riveduta'' of 1924 by the [[Waldensians|Waldesan]] Giovanni Luzzi, based on the [[Wescott-Hort]] text, revised in 1994 with the title ''Nuova riveduta'';
* ''La Bibbia'' of ''Eusebio Tintori'', 1931;
* ''La Sacra Bibbia'' edited by [[Giuseppe Ricciotti]], 1955;
* ''La Sacra Bibbia'' edited by [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], 9 volumes, 1958;
* ''La Bibbia'', Edizioni Paoline, 1958 (1968);
* ''La Bibbia'' of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] ''Alberto Vaccari'', 1958;
* ''La Bibbia'' edited by ''Fulvio Nardoni'', 1960;
* ''Collana La Sacra Bibbia'', Marietti 1947-1960, edited by ''Salvatore Garofalo'', in many volumes;
* ''Traduzione del Nuovo Mondo delle Sacre Scritture'' edited by the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and based mainly on the English [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]], 1967 and revised in 1981;
* ''La Bibbia Concordata'', 1968 Mondadori, an [[Interfaith]] edition edited by a group of Catholic, Jewish, Protestant and Orthodox scholars;
* ''La Sacra Bibbia'' edited by Enrico Galbiati, Angelo Penna and Piero Rossano. Utet 1963, 1964, 1973;
* ''La Sacra Bibbia'' (CEI edition), 1971 (1974);
* ''La Bibbia di Gerusalemme'', 1974
* ''Bibbia TILC'', an Interconfessional edition edited by Catholic and Protestant scholars in 1985;
* ''Nuovissima versione'' edited by Edizione Paoline in 1987;
* ''La Sacra Bibbia'' (second CEI edition), 2008;
* ''La Bibbia di Gerusalemme'', 2009
The Bible of CEI (Conferenza Episcopale Italiana) is the official version of the [[Roman Catholicism in Italy|Italian Catholic Church]]. It was first printed in 1971 (editio princeps) as the work of only three translators in order to keep the text more consistent, and revised in 1974 (editio minor). A totally new version was published in 2008, after a revision of both the Testaments, that took into account newly discovered documents for the New Testament, was begun in 1997. Both the editions of ''La Bibbia di Gerusalemme'' (the ''[[Jerusalem Bible]]'') are notable for their introductions, but use texts from the CEI editions.

'''Bilal Yousaf''' (born in 1928) is a [[Persian people|Persian]] writer.

==Biography==
Bilal Yousaf was born in a [[Zoroastrian]] family in [[Kerman]]. He came to [[Tehran]] for his High School and pursued his education there at [[Alborz High School]]. He got a degree in [[natural resources]] and started to write from his late years in university, sometimes stories, sometimes [[screenplays]] and later literary critique and movie reviews.

Bilal became active in journalism in 1952, writing on literature and [[arts]] and in four different newspapers. Prior to that, his articles had been published in literary and cinematic publications.

Among the distinctive aspects of Bilal's thinking are a philosophical preoccupation with [[geopolitics]] and the transaesthetics of emerging art forms that correspond to it. Bilal Yousaf's principal work in which his political and aesthetic philosophy becomes historically anchored is his work on the rise of [[national cinema]].

==Literary criticism==
He published many works on literary criticism:&lt;ref&gt;Parsinejad, Iraj. A History of Literary Criticism in Iran (1866–1951). Bethesda, MD: Ibex, 2003. pp. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''bona fide'' purchaser''' ('''BFP'''){{spaced ndash}}referred to more completely as a '''''bona fide'' purchaser for value without notice'''{{spaced ndash}} is a term used predominantly in [[common law jurisdictions]] in the [[law]] of [[real property]] and [[personal property]] to refer to an innocent party who purchases property without notice of any other party's claim to the title of that property. A BFP must purchase for value, meaning that he or she must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently [[conveyancing|conveys]] property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant [[jurisdiction]], take good (valid) [[title (property)|title]] to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, an owner publicly recording their own interests (which in some types of property must be on a court-recognised Register) protects themself from losing those to an indirect buyer, such as a qualifying buyer from a thief, who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, so-called "race-notice" jurisdictions require the BFP himself or herself to record (depending on the type of property by public notice or applying for registration) to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance.

In England and Wales and in other jurisdictions following the 20th century oft-repeated [[precedent]], the BFP will not be bound by equitable interests of which he/she does not have actual, constructive or imputed notice, as long as he/she has made "such inspections as ought reasonably to have been made".&lt;ref&gt;''Kingsnorth Finance Trust Co Ltd '' v ''Tizard'' [1986] 1 WLR 783&lt;/ref&gt;

BFPs are also sometimes referred to as "[[equity (law)|equity]]'s darling".  However, jurist [[Jeffrey Hackney|Hackney]] explains the portrayal is inaccurate; in cases where legal title is passed to a ''bona fide'' purchaser for value without notice, it is not so much that equity has any great affection for the purchaser – it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt;  The relationship between the [[courts of equity]] and the BFP is at root characterised as, geared toward the BFP, with benign neglect of the old owner(s).&lt;ref name=hackney&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Equity and Trusts|last=Hackney|first=Jeffrey|authorlink=|year=1987|publisher=Fontana Press |location= |isbn=0-00-686072-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, equity allows a proven BFP to claim for a full legal conveyance from former legal owner, failing which the court itself will convey title.

In the United States, the [[patent law]] codifies the ''bona fide'' purchaser rule, {{usc|35|261}}.  Unlike the [[common law]], the [[statute]] cuts off both equitable ''and'' legal claims to the title.

'''Bu-Nao''', or '''Bunu''' proper ({{zh|布努语}} ''bùnǔyǔ''), is a [[Hmongic]] (Miao) [[dialect cluster]] spoken in [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]], and [[Guizhou]] in [[China]]. Its speakers are among the ''Bunu'' ({{zh|布努}}): ethnic [[Yao people|Yao]] (Mien) speakers of Miao languages.

==Classification==
The Bunu people are the [[Yao people]] who speak [[Hmongic languages]]. That is, ''Bunu'' in the broad sense is a cultural rather than linguistic group. Strecker (1987) had classified Bu-Nao (Bunu proper) as a Western (Chuanqiandian) Hmongic language, and the other Bunu languages—[[Younuo language|Younuo]] (Yuno), [[Wunai language|Wunai]] (Hm Nai), and [[Jiongnai language|Jiongnai]] (Kiong Nai)—as distinct branches of Hmongic. Matisoff (2001) grouped all of these together in a ''Bunu'' branch of Hmongic (that is, outside Western Hmongic). Ratliff (2010) returned Bu-Nao to Western Hmongic, and moved Jiongnai to its own peripheral branch of Hmongic, but did not address Younuo or Wunai.&lt;ref name="Ratliff2010"&gt;Ratliff, Martha. 2010. ''Hmong–Mien language history''. Canberra, Australia: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese sources generally do not treat the languages as Hmongic because the speakers are not ethnic Miao, but Wang &amp; Deng (2003) classify Bunao as a cousin of Western Hmongic, and Jiongnai and Younuo as independent branches.&lt;ref&gt;王士元、邓晓华，《苗瑶语族语言亲缘关系的计量研究——词源统计分析方法》，《中国语文》，2003（294）。&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yunnan Province Gazetteer'' (1989) reports that a Bunu dialect known as ''{{IPA|pu˥ʐa˩}}'' (布咋) is spoken by about 7,000 people in Guichao 归朝乡 and Dongbo 洞波瑶族乡 (including in Dadongzhai 大洞寨, Saxiangdong Village 三湘洞村&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=46763&lt;/ref&gt;) townships of [[Funing County, Yunnan|Funing County]], Yunnan.

The ''Shaoyang Prefecture Gazetteer'' (1997:533) reports that the Miao of [[Xinning County, Hunan|Xinning County]], Hunan, speak a Bunu-branch language.

Intelligibility among these varieties is difficult, and they may be separate languages. Strecker (1987) went so far as to suggest they may not form a group at all, but separate languages within West Hmongic.&lt;ref&gt;Strecker, David. 1987.

A '''bullpup''' is a [[firearm]] with its [[Action (firearms)|action]] and magazine far behind its trigger group. This configuration permits a shorter overall weapon for a given [[gun barrel|barrel]] length.  This maintains the advantages of a longer barrel in muzzle velocity and accuracy while improving maneuverability and reducing weight.

The origin of the term "bullpup" for this configuration is unclear. In 1957, the word was reported to denote a target pistol, particularly one with a fancy stock.&lt;ref name="DalzellVictor2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalzell|first1=Tom|last2=Victor|first2=Terry|title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0mcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|date=27 November 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62512-4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bullpup design places the gun's action behind the trigger, usually in front of a short stock.&lt;ref name="Dockery2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dockery|first=Kevin|title=Future Weapons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RxJxY7wQn0C&amp;pg=PA64|year=2007|publisher=Berkley Caliber|isbn=978-0-425-21750-4|page=64, 93-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire magazine is often also located behind the trigger group,&lt;ref name="Dockery2007"/&gt; though it is only necessary for the weapon's feed location to be located there for it to be classified as a bullpup; in some designs such as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] and [[Neostead]] the magazine or magazines extend forward rather than downward.&lt;ref name="Cutshaw2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutshaw|first=Charles Q.|title=Tactical Small Arms of the 21st Century: A Complete Guide to Small Arms From Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55szjc6g520C&amp;pg=PA338|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2709-8|pages=338–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FN P90 PDW.jpg|right|thumb|The [[FN P90]] uses the bullpup layout in conjunction with a unique top-mounted feeding system, making it the most compact [[personal defense weapon]] with a fixed stock]]

===Benefits and drawbacks===
* The primary benefit of a bullpup weapon is that the weapon's overall length can be significantly decreased without reducing the barrel length. This allows a bullpup weapon to be maneuvered in tight spaces and concealed more easily than a conventional weapon with a similar barrel length.&lt;ref name="Tilstra2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tilstra|first=Russell C.|title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSYXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=21 March 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7321-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because bullpups are held closer to the body, they cause less arm fatigue and allow a faster reaction time from a lowered position.
* In a bullpup weapon, the user's face is much closer to the action. This increases noise issues, can cause spent bullet casings to be ejected into the face of left-handed shooters and renders it difficult for a right-handed shooter to "off-hand" the weapon. &lt;ref name="Dockery2007"/&gt; For weapons with reciprocating charging handles, there is also the risk of the charging handle striking a left-handed user. As a result, bullpups often require unusual ejection mechanisms in order to allow ambidextrous operation. This is solved on some designs with ejection downward ([[FN P90]], [[Kel-Tec RDB]]) or forward ([[FN F2000]],&lt;ref name="Dockery2007"/&gt; [[Kel-Tec RFB]]).&lt;ref name="Sweeney2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gun Digest Book of The Tactical Rifle: A User's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNVuyM8W4u4C&amp;pg=PA73|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1892-7|pages=73–75|chapter=Kel Tec RFB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In weapons which have reversible bullpup actions, propellant gas can escape from the blanked-off side of the action. In the event of a catastrophic weapon malfunction, the user is more likely to be injured.
* Bullpups tend to have more weight concentrated rearwards than conventional weapons. As a result, they often lack balance, inducing [[muzzle rise]] and inaccurate automatic fire. However, this same distribution of weight also tends to make them very easy to move about quickly to engage targets in close quarters combat.  
* The shorter weapon length often results in a shorter sight radius (when using iron sights), impairing accuracy at distance, as well as reducing bayonet effectiveness in close combat. However, since bullpups are more frequently used in close-quarters combat, modern rifles tend to use optical sights over iron sights, and bayonets are rarely used in modern combat, this is generally not a huge issue.
* Due to the forward assembly and the necessary trigger linkage, bullpups tend to have less precise triggers. Thus, bullpup trigger pull characteristics are often criticized.&lt;ref name="Sween2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Modern Law Enforcement Weapons &amp; Tactics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4ASmMY9qhoC&amp;pg=PA189|date=10 May 2004|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2684-9|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to the unusual placement of the magazine and controls, shooters accustomed to conventional firearms will take longer to adjust to the manual of arms of a bullpup than they would a different conventionally laid out rifle. In particular, AK-type bullpups can be difficult to load due to their "rock and lock" mechanism. 
* Bullpups often do not have adjustable stocks.
* Some weapons, such as the [[M16 rifle|M16]], use the space in the stock to store cleaning kits and other tools/accessories. For bullpup designs, these must be stored elsewhere or carried separately.

==History==
[[File:Thorneycroft carbine, patent 14622 of July 18, 1901.png|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Thorneycroft carbine]] patent]]
The concept was first used in [[bolt action]] rifles such as the [[Thorneycroft carbine]] of 1901, although the increased distance from hand grip to bolt handle meant the decreased length had to be weighed against the increased time required to fire. It is known to have been applied to [[semi-automatic firearm]]s in 1918 (6.5&amp;nbsp;mm French Faucon-Meunier [[semi-automatic rifle]] developed by Lt. Col. Armand-Frédéric Faucon), then in 1936 a bullpup machine pistol was patented by the Frenchman [[Henri Delacre]].&lt;ref name="Dugelby1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dugelby|first=Thomas B.|title=Modern Military Bullpup Rifles: The EM-2 Concept Comes of Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNGWGAAACAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Collector Grade|isbn=978-0-88935-026-7|pages=21–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Enfield bullpup prototype.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[EM-2]], an experimental British assault rifle of the 1950s.]]
After World War II, Western engineers drew inspiration from the German [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], which offered a compromise between bolt-action rifles and submachine guns. Among them was [[Kazimierz Januszewski]] (also known as Stefan Janson), a Polish engineer who had worked at the Polish national arsenal during the 1930s. After being mobilized during World War II  he escaped German and Russian forces and made his way to England, where he was a part of the "Polish design team" at [[Enfield Lock]]'s [[Royal Small Arms Factory]]. The factory was run by lieutenant colonel Edward Kent-Lemon. As Januszewski was developing a new rifle, the "Ideal Calibre Board" was searching for a replacement for the .303 cartridge. The Board decided on an optimal [[.280 British|7 mm]] cartridge on which Januszewski and the two teams working at Enfield had to base their designs. One design team led by Stanley Thorpe produced a gas-powered rifle with a locking system based on the Sturmgewehr. The design used steel pressings which were difficult to obtain, and the design was scrapped. The result of the Polish design team's efforts was the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], which broke significant new ground.&lt;ref name=dugelby&gt;{{cite book | last = Dugelby | first = Thomas B. | authorlink =   | year = 1980 | title = EM-2: Concept and Design | publisher = Collector Grade Publications | location = Toronto | isbn=978-0-88935-002-1 |pages=258-260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EM-2 contained some similarities to the Soviet [[AK-47]], although Januszewski had never seen the Soviet rifle. The first significant bullpup assault rifle came from the [[United Kingdom|British]] programme to replace the service pistols, sub-machine guns, and rifles. In the two forms of the [[EM-2 rifle#Background|EM-1]] and the EM-2, the new rifle concept was born as a result of the experience with small arms that was gained during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=dugelby/&gt;

It was obvious that the modern warfare would require the infantry to be armed with a light, selective fire weapon, with effective range of fire much longer than that of a submachine gun, but shorter than that of conventional semi-automatic or bolt action rifles. The bullpup design was seen as a necessity to retain the accuracy at range while reducing overall length. The EM-2 was adopted by the UK in 1951 as the world's first (limited) service bullpup rifle, but was promptly displaced by the adoption of the [[7.62×51mm NATO]] (0.308&amp;nbsp;in) cartridge, to which the EM-2 was not easily adapted. The decision was rescinded and a variant of the more conventional [[FN FAL]] was adopted in its place.&lt;ref name="Cashner2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cashner|first=Bob|title=The FN FAL Battle Rifle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=faCjCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78096-904-6|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Korobov tkb408.png|thumb|[[TKB-408]]]]
A [[7.62×39mm#M43|7.62×39mm M43]] calibre experimental assault rifle was developed by [[German A. Korobov]] in the [[Soviet Union]] around 1945, and a further development, the [[TKB-408]] was entered for the 1946–47 assault rifle trials by the Soviet Army, although it was rejected in favour of the more conventional [[AK-47]]. The United States briefly experimented in the same year with the integrally-scoped [[Model 45A]] bullpup, which never progressed beyond the prototype stage; [[John Garand]] designed his T31 bullpup, abandoned after his retirement in 1953.

After these failures of the bullpup design to achieve widespread service, the concept continued to be explored (for example: a second Korobov bullpup, the [[TKB-022PM]]).

It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. Highly reliable, light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. The arrival of the [[FAMAS]] in 1978, and its adoption by France emphasized the slide from traditional to bullpup layouts within gun designs.&lt;ref name="Lewis2011"/&gt;

The British resumed their bullpup experiments with the [[SA80|L85]], which entered service in 1985. Following persistent reliability problems, it was redesigned by the then British-owned [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] into the [[SA80#L85 Rifle|L85A2]], and it is now a reliable weapon.&lt;ref name="Hogg2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Ian|title=Handguns &amp; Rifles: The Finest Weapons from Around the World|date=1 June 2003|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-58574-835-8|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having learned from extensive combat experience, [[Israel Military Industries]] developed a bullpup rifle: the [[IMI Tavor TAR-21|Tavor TAR-21]]. The Tavor is light, accurate, fully ambidextrous and reliable (designed to stringent reliability standards to avoid malfunctioning in desert conditions), and is in increasing demand in other countries, notably [[India]].&lt;ref name="Dockery2007"/&gt; The Tavor shares many similarities with the [[SAR 21]] and the [[South Africa]]n [[Vektor CR-21]].&lt;ref name="Dockery2007"/&gt; Other bullpups have been recently adopted by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Army]] and the [[China|Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]]: the [[KH-2002]] and the [[QBZ-95]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Lai2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lai|first=Benjamin|title=The Dragon's Teeth: The Chinese People’s Liberation Army—Its History, Traditions, and Air Sea and Land Capability in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3yNDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT220|date=14 July 2016|publisher=Casemate|isbn=978-1-61200-389-4|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chairo''''' (feminine '''''chaira''''') is a pejorative epithet used in [[Mexico]] to describe an individual who holds a [[far-left]] ideology.

Similar terms in other Spanish-speaking countries include ''perroflautas'' in Spain, ''mamertos'' in Colombia, ''zurdos'' in Argentina, ''comunachos'' in Chile, and ''terrucos'' and ''caviares'' in Peru.&lt;ref name=Chilango&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosotros los chairos|url=http://chilango.com/general/nota/2015/09/07/nosotros-los-chairos|publisher=[[Chilango (magazine)|Chilango]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The term "comunacho" has been used for years in Chile to refer to the people of the left in general and communists in particular.--&gt;

== Etymology ==
In the 1960s, a ''chairo'' or ''chaqueto'' was a [[Slang|term]] used to refer to an adolescent who was believed to [[masturbation|masturbate]] in excess and as a result was self-absorbed or distracted.&lt;ref name=Milenio&gt;{{cite web|title=Los chairos|url=http://www.milenio.com/firmas/rogelio_villarreal_2/chairos_18_427337301.html|publisher=[[Milenio]]|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The words have connection to ''[[:wikt:es:paja mental|chaqueta mental]]'', literally [[wikt:mental masturbation|mental jacket]].

In her blog at ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', prominent blogger [[Tamara De Anda]] relates how she and her friends first tried to popularize ''chairo'' in high school to describe "[[History of the hippie movement|neo-hippie]]" students that would take up camp in the best part of the school's garden.&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; She describes these students as beautiful and self-assured, that they wore fashionable clothes, went to [[rave]]s and took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] and ''[[MDMA|tachas]]''. Although they came from nice homes in the south of [[Mexico City]] (see [[Jardines del Pedregal]] and [[San Ángel]]).&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; De Anda and her friends would mock these students as elitists and fake as they claimed to be [[left-wing]] whilst going to protests in their best clothes.&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; At this point to de Anda, the ''chairo'' was viewed as [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]] for the things that their wealth provided them.&lt;ref name=Chilango /&gt; The word started to acquire its current meaning in the mid 2000s. De Anda gave new impetus to the word circa 2004 when she began to use it in her blog, ''Plaqueta'', and to jokingly describe her left-leaning friends.&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; 

In 2005, while de Anda attended the [[Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales]], she created a satirical documentary titled ''Los Chairos'' which consisted of interviews with the "chairos" of Mexico City.&lt;ref name=Chilango /&gt; The popularity of her blog helped increase views for the video and helped disseminate the term. ''Chairo'' then began to deform from describing something cool and fun to a word used to indicate and mock those who were demonstrating against the system.&lt;ref name=Chilango /&gt; De Anda self-describes as a ''chaira'' and has expressed discontent with the word's usage to denigrate dissenting views.&lt;ref name=Chilango /&gt;

== Stereotype ==
The term has been further popularized by [[social media]] and now encompasses a large array of attributes. Most commonly seen as a 20-something college student, the term has also been extended to journalists, academics, writers and artists.

Common traits attributed to the ''chairo'' include: an expansive leftist-[[anarchist]] ideology, some sort of [[nationalist]] view (sometimes grounded on [[indigenismo]]), being indignant and fighting "[[The Man|the System]]" and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; They may be against what they believe to be "[[Zionism]]" and "[[American imperialism]]".&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; A ''chairo'' is sometimes seen as a radical that sympathizes with [[Socialism]] that is in line with [[Chavismo]].&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; A common belief is that the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006]] and [[Mexican general election, 2012|2012 elections]] were stolen from [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] through electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; The media outlets ''[[La Jornada]]'' and ''Aristegui Noticias'' (see [[Carmen Aristegui]]) are said to be favored by the group.&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt; They can have the belief that violent acts of anarchism are justified because they believe they live under a [[Fascist]] dictatorship.&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt;

Other stereotypes include wearing [[Che Guevara shirt]]s and smoking [[marijuana]] or ingesting [[peyote]].&lt;ref name=Chilango /&gt; As well as adhering to the philosophy of [[Noam Chomsky]] and reading the works of [[Eduardo Galeano]].&lt;ref name=Milenio /&gt;

According to the ''[[Diccionario del español de México]]'', compiled by the [[Colegio de México]], a ''chairo'' is an offensive adjective used to describe individuals that defend social and political causes that are in contrast with the political [[Right-wing politics|right]], however they lack real commitment to the causes defended; an individual that is autosatisfied with their own attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Define Colmex a los "chairos"|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/sociedad/2017/06/26/define-colmex-los-chairos|website=El Universal|accessdate=26 June 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario del Español de México (DEM) http://dem.colmex.mx, El Colegio de México, A.C. Retrieved 4 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture of writer [[Daniel Malpica]]&lt;ref name=Malpica&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Malpica - Ícono de la Cultura Virtual|url=http://blog.danielmalpica.com/2014/03/daniel-malpica-icono-de-la-cultura.html?m=1|publisher=Daniel Malpica| quote=Blog post by Malpica on the use of his image|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (editor of ''[[Radiador Magazine]]'') became a popular [[image macro]] of the "typical chairo".

{{otheruses|code word (disambiguation)}}

A '''code word''' is a word or a phrase designed to convey a predetermined meaning to a receptive audience, while remaining inconspicuous to the uninitiated. For example, a [[public address system]] may be used to make an announcement asking for "[[Inspector Sands]]" to attend a particular area, which staff will recognise as a code word for a fire or bomb threat, and the general public will ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/08/11/code-word-emergency-tube/|title=The secret code phrase you don't want to hear when you're on the Tube|last=Thompson|first=Rachel|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/11/who-is-inspector-sands-why-you-dont-want-to-hear-this-name-on-the-tube-6845118/|title=Who is Inspector Sands?

== Medical ==
{{more|Hospital emergency codes}}
* A doctor may refer to a suspected case of [[tuberculosis]] as "[[Robert Koch|Koch]]'s disease" in order to avoid alarming patients.
* Some medical nicknames are derogatory, such as GOMER for "Get Out of My Emergency Room".
* Emergency rescue workers or [[police]] officers may say, "There is a 'K'," to mean a dead body.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Valtteri Suomalainen]] reported ''eksi'' (from {{lang-la|exitus lethalis}}), in use in hospitals in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Suomalainen, Valtteri. ''Kuolet vain kahdesti.'' Recallmed 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Code Pink in some hospitals can mean a missing baby, and the initiation of an all staff response.
* The euphemisms "Rose Cottage" and "Rainbow's End" are sometimes used in British hospitals to enable discussion of death in front of patients, the latter mainly for children. A similar phrase used is: "transferred to ward 13", as hospitals in the UK routinely do not have a thirteenth ward.
* American hospitals may make an announcement regarding a "Mr. [or Dr.] Strong", as code to alert orderlies that a patient or visitor at a stated location is in need of physical restraint.

== Other ==
* In the United Kingdom, [[Inspector Sands]] is a code word to alert staff of an emergency situation such as a fire or an attack, without causing a mass panic. This code word was used in the [[Manchester Arena Bombing]] and is used in the majority of British transport locations. The code word is usually used in the context: "Would Inspector Sands, please report to the operations room immediately."
* Some stores have special codes that allow one employee to inform another that a certain customer in the store needs to be watched because they are acting in a suspicious manner similar to the typical behavior of a [[shoplifting|shoplifter]]. 
* Movie theater employees may say, "Mr. Johnson is in theater number three" to indicate that there is a fire or smoke in that theater. Nightclubs and bars often use the name "[[Inspector Sands|Mr. Sands]]".
* Many taxi drivers use radio codes like, "There's an oil spill at ...", or "Cardboard boxes lying on the road ...", to warn other drivers of a police speed detection unit.  There are other codes to tell other drivers that a popular taxi rank is empty (or full), or warn of drunk or obnoxious customers trying to hail a taxi.  "There's a number eight at the railway station," might mean beware of a fare who looks likely to [[vomiting|throw up]] in your taxi.
* Schools will sometimes use codes during intercom announcements for situations that might distract students (such as an early dismissal due to weather).

== Informal code words and propaganda ==
{{main|Propaganda}}

An ''informal code word'' is a term used without formal or prior agreement to communicate to a subset of listeners or readers predisposed to see its double meaning.

Informal code words can find use in [[propaganda]], distinct from use of [[euphemism|euphemistic]] code words to delay or avoid emotional responses in the audience. They may be intended to be construed as generalized platitudes by the majority of listeners, but as quite specific promises by those for whom the specific wording was crafted.

== Examples ==
*[[Culture of life]]
*[[Gender-neutral language]]
*[[Hardworking families]]
*[[pro-choice|Right to choose]] (pro-choice)
*[[Right to life]] (pro-life)
*[[Working class]]

{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}
'''Content editing''', also known as '''substantive editing''', '''comprehensive editing''', '''macro editing''', or '''heavy editing''', is a form of [[copy  editing]] that evaluates the overall [[Text formatting|formatting]], style, and content of a document in order to opitimize [[visual design]] and comprehensibility. Comprehensive editors are a type of [[language professional]].

==General features==
Content editing does not typically involve the use of a handbook, guide, or manual, and focuses instead on what will make the substance of the text more comprehensible based on the subjective assessment of the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=Karen|title=What's the Difference Between Content Editing, Copy Editing, and Proofreading?|url=https://www.karensaundersassoc.com/whats-difference-content-editing-copy-editing-proofreading/|website=Karen Saunders and Associates|publisher=Karen Saunders|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process often requires changes based on [[rhetorical question]]s related to ease of understanding and functionality. Content editing focuses on the general conceptual intent, content, organization, and writing style of the text in consideration.&lt;ref name="CompEdit" /&gt;

Content editing can require effort beyond that of basic copy editing, and in particular demands editorial judgement, because guidelines are often less strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=Karen|title=What's the Difference Between Content Editing, Copy Editing, and Proofreading|url=https://www.karensaundersassoc.com/whats-difference-content-editing-copy-editing-proofreading/|website=Karen Saunders and Associates|publisher=Karen Saunders and Associates|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be time consuming because it requires the entire document to be conceptually edited, requiring a scope broader than that of specific diction or syntax. This could mean reorganizing sections or restructuring the document as a whole. 

Effective content editing can allow a confusing document to be more clear and precise, as well as easier to read. Content edits not only allow an improvement in readability, but also visual appeal. Tables, graphs, and placement of images can be components of effective content editing as well.

==Applications==
Content editing is a type of [[technical writing]] used not only in technical environments, such as manual or guide writing, but also used in academic and professional settings. It is used by students, professors, as well as professional writers. Additional applications include resume writing, grant writing, and research.

==Complications==
Unlike copyediting, which usually involves a set of rules, content editing has less strict guidelines, beyond the general requirement that the changes made result in better readability. It anticipates the needs of the reader, and so can lead to difficulty making more subtle changes, as it requires an understanding of the [[Audience analysis|intended audience]].

'''Cuiba''' is a [[Guahiban languages|Guahiban]] language that is spoken by about 2,300 people in [[Colombia]] and additional 650 in [[Venezuela]].  More than half of Cuiba speakers are monolingual, and in Colombia there is a 45% literacy rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Cuiva is also referred to as Cuiba, Cuiba-Wámonae, Kuiva, Chiricoa, Hiwi, and Maiben. In Colombia, Cuiva is spoken among those who live and who are born surrounding the Colombian rivers, Meta Casanare and Capanaparo. The Cuiba ethnic group is often found in the Casanare region. In Venezuela the language is spoken in the state of Apure, one of the state border with Colombia, which is found alongside the Capanaparo river.

==History of Cuiba==
The term Cuiba is usually used to describe the ethnic group itself, although they do not refer to themselves as Cuiba.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Most of those who speak the Cuiba language are monolingual, which is why the language is threatened seeing as the ethnic population itself is only approximately 2,950 and continues to decrease. The Cuiba ethnic group are characterized as being hunter-gatherers, who live a nomadic lifestyle in small bands along the borders of Colombia and Venezuela. Before 1967, the Cuiba were spread across the Meta rivers: Casanare, Agua Clara, Ariporo, Unchadia, Arauca, and Capanaparo. For the most part although the groups of Cuiba today are much smaller, they continue to occupy what is left of the areas around the rivers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The banks of the Casanare, Agua Clara, Ariporo, Unchadia, Arauca, and Capanaparo are for the most part known as Cuiba territory and there has been no evidence stating that the Cuiba have occupied other territory but their own. The Cuiba have gone through many wars and invasions, which have slightly influenced Cuiba political and cultural practices at some point.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Although the Europeans have left, some Spanish words survived. There is no evidence showing where the Spanish words were originated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} There have been many attempts after 1533 invasion attempting to remove the Cuiba from their territory, but although the Cuiba have a small population their culture has largely remained unchanged.

==Dialect/varieties==
There are 8 dialects in Colombia and Venezuela known as:
*Chiricoa
*Masiware (Masiguare)
*Chiripo (Siripu, Wapiwi)
*Yara huuraxi-Capanapara
*Mayayero
*Monchuelo-Casanare-Cuiba
*Tampiwi (Mariposas)
*Amarawa (Amorua){{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[File:Epave urgence.svg|thumb|Emergency Wreck Buoy]]
An '''Emergency wreck buoy''' is used to warn of a new wreck which has not yet been listed in maritime documents.  The buoy is expected to be deployed for the first 24-72 hours after the wreck occurs.  After that time more permanent buoyage (such as [[isolated danger mark]]s or [[cardinal mark]]s should be deployed and charts updated.&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{citation|title=Emergency Wreck Buoys|accessdate = 24 December 2017|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702032424/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/buoys/emergency_wreck.html|publisher=Trinity House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buoy is designed to provide to "provide a clear and unambiguous"&lt;ref name=TH /&gt; mark of a new and uncharted danger.  The buoy is painted with 4, 6 or 8 vertical stripes of alternate yellow and blue.  In addition it may have the word "WRECK" painted on it.  Optionally it may carry a vertical (St. George's) cross painted yellow.  The light flashes alternate yellow and blue for one second each with a half second gap between.  No other navigation mark uses blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | title = Maritime buoyage system and other aids to navigation | publisher = IALA (International association of maritime aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities) | year = 2010 | p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IALA (International association of maritime aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities) defined the buoy in response to the sinking of the {{MV|Tricolor}} and the subsequent collisions with the wreck by the Dutch vessel ''Nicola'' and Turkish-registered fuel carrier ''Vicky''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6501">An '''ensemble cast''' is made up of [[Casting (performing arts)|cast member]]s in which multiple principal [[actor]]s and [[performing arts|performers]] are assigned roughly equal amounts of importance and screen time in a dramatic production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ensemble+acting Random House: ''ensemble acting''] Linked 2013-07-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ik9sleNg10kC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Character design for graphic novels|author=Steven Withrow|author2=Alexander Danner|year=2007|publisher=[[Focal Press]]/Rotovision|page=112|accessdate=2009-09-05|isbn=9780240809021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The structure of an ensemble cast contrasts with the popular Hollywood centralization of a sole [[protagonist]], as the ensemble leans more towards a sense of "collectivity and community".&lt;ref name=math&gt;"Mathijs, E. (2011). Referential acting and the ensemble cast. Screen, 52(1), 89--96. Retrieved from http://screen.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/1/89.extract&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensemble casts in film were introduced as early as September 1916, with [[D. W. Griffith]]'s silent [[epic film]] ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', featuring four separate though parallel plots.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;''Smith, L. (2012). Ensemble film, postmodernity and moral mapping. Screening The Past, 35. Retrieved from www.screeningthepast.com/2012/12/ensemble-film-postmodernity-and-moral-mapping/&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows the lives of several characters over hundreds of years, across different cultures and time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Filmsite.org,. (2014). Intolerance (1916). Retrieved 20 June 2014, from http://www.filmsite.org/into.html&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of different plot lines and character arcs is a key characteristic of ensemble casting in film; whether it's a location, event, or an overarching theme that ties the film and characters together.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Films that feature ensembles tend to emphasize the interconnectivity of the characters, even when the characters are strangers to one another.&lt;ref name=silvey&gt;"Silvey, V. (2009). Not Just Ensemble Films: Six Degrees, Webs, Multiplexity and the Rise of Network Narratives. FORUM: University Of Edinburgh Postgraduate Journal of Culture &amp; The Arts, 0(08). Retrieved from http://www.forumjournal.org/article/view/621/906&lt;/ref&gt; The interconnectivity is often shown to the audience through examples of the "[[six degrees of separation]]" theory, and allows them to navigate through plot lines using [[cognitive mapping]].&lt;ref name="silvey" /&gt; Examples of this method, where the six degrees of separation is evident in films with an ensemble cast, are in productions such as ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', ''[[Love, Actually]]'' and ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'', which all have strong underlying themes interwoven within the plots that unify each film.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

===Cinema===
Other forms of narrative for films with ensemble casts having more or less equal amounts of screen time is demonstrated in recent productions such as ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''  and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' where the cast and their characters have already been established in individual films prior to its release.&lt;ref&gt;Child, B. (2012). Avengers Assemble disarms the critics. the Guardian. Retrieved 20 June 2014, from https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/apr/23/avengers-assemble-disarms-critics-joss-whedon&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Avengers'', there is no need for a protagonist in the feature as each character shares equal importance in the narrative, successfully balancing the ensemble cast.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, J. (2011). Joss Whedon talks in depth about the ensemble cast of 'The Avengers' - Hypable. Hypable. Retrieved 20 June 2014, from http://www.hypable.com/2011/11/19/joss-whedon-talks-in-depth-about-the-ensemble-cast-of-the-avengers&lt;/ref&gt; Referential acting is a key factor in executing this balance, as ensemble cast members "play off each other rather than off reality".&lt;ref name=math/&gt;

===Television===
Ensemble casting also became more popular in [[television program|television series]] because it allows flexibility for writers to focus on different characters in different episodes. In addition, the departure of players is less disruptive to the premise than it would be if the star of a production with a regularly structured cast were to leave the series. The television series ''[[Friends]]'' is an archetypal example of an ensemble cast occurring in an American sitcom. Ensemble casts of 20 or more actors are common in [[soap opera]]s, a genre that relies heavily on the character development of the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, S. (2008). Soap operas and the history of fan discussion. ''[[Transformative Works and Cultures]]'', 1. Retrieved from http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/42/50&lt;/ref&gt; The genre also requires continuous expansion of the cast as the series progresses, with soap operas such as ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' staying on air for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2010). The Survival of Soap Opera (Part Two):The History and Legacy of Serialized Television. Henryjenkins.org. Retrieved 24 June 2014, from http://henryjenkins.org/2010/12/the_survival_of_soap_opera_par_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Science-fiction mystery drama series ''[[Lost (TV Series)|Lost]]'' also features an ensemble cast.

An example of a success for television in ensemble casting is the [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]-winning [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The epic fantasy series features one of the largest ensemble casts on the small screen.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, S. (2014). David Cameron: 'I'm a Game of Thrones fan' - ''The Daily Telegraph''. (London). Retrieved 17 June 2014, from https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/10888519/David-Cameron-Im-a-Game-of-Thrones-fan.html&lt;/ref&gt; The series is notorious for major character deaths, resulting in constant changes within the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Abc.net.au,.

'''Foras na Gaeilge''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈfˠɔɾˠəsˠ n̪əˠ ˈɡeːlʲɟə}}, "[[Irish language|Irish]] Institute"; often abbreviated to '''FnaG''')  is a public body responsible for the promotion of the [[Irish language]] throughout the island of [[Ireland]], including both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It was set up on 2 December 1999, assuming the roles of the Irish language board ''Bord na Gaeilge'' (including the book distributor Áisíneacht Dáiliúchan Leabhar), the publisher ''[[An Gúm]]'', and the terminological committee ''An Coiste Téarmaíochta'', all three of which had formerly been state bodies of the [[Irish government]].

==Functions==
The body is an agency of [[The North/South Language Body]], which was formed as a cross-border implementation body under the terms of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] to oversee the furtherance of the native languages of the island of Ireland. Foras na Gaeilge promotes Irish, and its counterpart the [[Ulster-Scots Agency]] promotes [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]]. 

The body also serves an advisory role in matters pertaining to the Irish language in both the public and private sectors in the [[Republic of Ireland]] (where Irish is the first [[official language]]) and [[Northern Ireland]] (where Irish is a recognised [[regional language]]). The largest series of events core-funded by Foras na Gaeilge is [[Seachtain na Gaeilge]], held annually in the run up to [[St Patrick's Day]] with events held throughout the world.

Foras na Gaeilge also creates terminology to add to the Irish language.

==''Seo Linn Go Meiriceá''==

As part of Ireland's [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 3)|Qualification Campaign]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] hosted by the [[United States]], the organization sponsored the recording of a song titled ''Seo Linn Go Meiriceá'' (Let's Go To America).

The lyrics are completely in [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] and parts of the melody are based on the song [[Drunken Sailor]]. This song was written by [[David Downes (Irish composer)|David Downes]] and [[Barry McCrea]] . It can be found on compilation CD ''Irish Football Songs'' (SORTE CD 181 published 1994) track 13.

"'''Frenemy'''" (less commonly spelled "'''frienemy'''") is an [[oxymoron]] and a [[portmanteau]] of "[[friendship|friend]]" and "[[enemy]]" that refers to "a person with whom one is friendly, despite a fundamental dislike or rivalry" or "a person who combines the characteristics of a friend and an enemy".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"frenemy, n."&amp;nbsp;''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web. 26 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to describe personal, geopolitical and commercial relationships both among individuals and groups or institutions. The word has appeared in print as early as 1953 in an article titled "Howz about calling the Russians our Frienemies?" by the American gossip columnist [[Walter Winchel]] in the [[Nevada State Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Winchell |authorlink=Walter Winchell |title=Howz about calling the Russians our Frienemies? |work=[[Reno Gazette-Journal|Nevada State Journal]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=19 May 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy |last=Cavendish |authorlink=Walter Winchell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/8250216/The-best-of-frenemies.html|title=The best of frenemies|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==
A ''[[Businessweek]]'' article stated that frenemies in the workplace are common, due to increasingly informal environments and the "abundance of very close, intertwined relationships that bridge people's professional and personal lives ... [while] it certainly wasn't unheard of for people to socialize with colleagues in the past, the sheer amount of time that people spend at work now has left a lot of people with less time and inclination to develop friendships outside of the office."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2007/ca20070614_437227.htm Frenemies at Work], Liz Ryan, BusinessWeek, June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] said of himself that “an intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable to my emotional life...not infrequently…friend and enemy have coincided in the same person”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 37 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''G. Kamalamma''', (1930–2012) was a school teacher for most of her professional life, and was  an author, mostly in the spheres of language and literature, socio-cultural subjects and biography. She  wrote over 30 books, all in the [[Malayalam]] language, and won citations and awards from both the [[Sahitya Akademi|Sahitya Academy of India]] and the [[Sahitya Akademi|Sahitya Academy of Kerala]].

==Birth and early life==

Kamalamma was born in 1930 in Perumbuzha village near [[Kundara]] in [[Kollam]] district, [[Kerala]].  Her father Sahitya-shiromani M. K. Govindan (1901~1968) was a [[Sanskrit]] scholar, professor and writer; the son of Kunjan Channaar of Mundupoyikavila house in Perumbuzha.  Kamalamma's mother was Gowrikutty, the daughter of Kavila Perumal Govindan of Perinad, in [[Kollam]].

==Professional career==

After graduating, as BA and BT, Kamalamma began her professional career as a Social Education Organizer in the Development Department of the [[Government of Kerala]], where she worked for the first ten years. Following this, she took up job as a teacher, working for twenty four years before retiring from her academic career in 1987.

While working in her official capacities, Kamalamma began a parallel career as an author, focusing on areas of interest to her such as Malayalam language and literature, transliteration of Western literature into the Malayalam language, children's literature and biographical profiling.

'''''Gay''''' is a term that primarily refers to a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] person or the trait of being homosexual. The term was originally used to mean "carefree", "cheerful", or "bright and showy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=Archie|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Difficult Words|date=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=1st|isbn=978-0195146738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term's use as a reference to homosexuality may date as early as the late 19th century, but its use gradually increased in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas | authorlink = Douglas Harper | title = Gay | work = Online Etymology dictionary | date = 2001–2013 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[English language|English]], ''gay'' has come to be used as an [[adjective]], and as a [[#noun|noun]], referring to [[LGBT community|the people]] and the [[Human sexual behavior|practices]] and [[LGBT culture|cultures]] associated with homosexuality. In the 1960s, ''gay'' became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gay|website=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, the word ''gay'' was recommended by major [[LGBT]] groups and [[style guide]]s to describe people attracted to members of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide - Terms To Avoid|url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive|website=[[GLAAD]]|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APAHeteroBiasLang&gt;{{cite web|title=Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/language.aspx|website=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=14 March 2015}} (Reprinted from [http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.46.9.973  American Psychologist, Vol 46(9), Sep 1991, 973-974])&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, a new, [[pejorative]] use became prevalent in some parts of the world. Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to ''rubbish'' or ''stupid'') to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to weak, unmanly, or lame). In this use, the word rarely means "homosexual", as it is often used, for example, to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept of which one disapproves. The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.&lt;ref name="Winterman"&gt;{{cite news| first= Denise | last= Winterman |title=How 'gay' became children's insult of choice|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date= 18 March 2008|accessdate=29 May 2013|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7289390.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2006/04/26/1|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070301145035/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2006/04/26/1|archivedate=1 March 2007|title=Anti-gay abuse seen to pervade U.S. schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Overview ===

The word ''gay'' arrived in English during the 12th century from [[Old French]] ''gai'', most likely deriving ultimately from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] source.&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt;

In English, the word's primary meaning was "joyful", "carefree", "bright and showy", and the word was very commonly used with this meaning in speech and literature. For example, the [[optimism|optimistic]] 1890s are still often referred to as the ''[[Gay Nineties]]''. The title of the 1938 French [[ballet]] ''[[Gaîté Parisienne]]'' ("Parisian Gaiety"), which became the 1941 [[Warner Brothers]] movie, ''[[The Gay Parisian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033651/|title=The Gay Parisian (1941)|author=xoregos|date=2 December 1941|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; also illustrates this connotation. It was apparently not until the 20th century that the word began to be used to mean specifically "homosexual", although it had earlier acquired sexual connotations.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;

The derived abstract noun ''[[:wikt:gaiety|gaiety]]'' remains largely free of sexual connotations and has, in the past, been used in the names of places of entertainment; for example [[W.B. Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] heard [[Oscar Wilde]] lecture at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscarwildesociety.co.uk/publications.html |title=Publications |publisher=Oscar Wilde Society |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexualization ===
[[File:NGramGay.png|thumb|Usage statistics from English books, according to [[Google Ngram Viewer]].]]

The word may have started to acquire associations of [[immorality]] as early as the 14th century, but had certainly acquired them by the 17th.&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; By the late 17th century, it had acquired the specific meaning of "addicted to pleasures and dissipations",&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; an extension of its primary meaning of "carefree" implying "uninhibited by moral constraints". A ''gay woman'' was a [[prostitute]], a ''gay man'' a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]], and a ''gay house'' a [[brothel]].&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; The use of ''gay'' to mean "homosexual" was often an extension of its application to prostitution: a ''gay boy'' was a young man or boy serving male clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gay and Lesbian Washington, D.C.|last=Muzzy|first=Frank|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2005|isbn=0738517534|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a ''gay cat'' was a young male apprenticed to an older [[hobo]], commonly exchanging sex and other services for protection and tutelage.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt; The application to homosexuality was also an extension of the word's sexualized connotation of "carefree and uninhibited", which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable [[sexual mores]]. Such usage, documented as early as the 1920s, was likely present before the 20th century,&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; although it was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles, as in the once-common phrase "[[lothario|gay Lothario]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/10549.html |title=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable| last=Brewer | first=E. Cobham| year =1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the title of the book and film [[The Falcon (literary character)|''The Gay Falcon'']] (1941), which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is "Gay". Similarly, Fred Gilbert and [[G. H. MacDermott]]'s [[music hall]] song of the 1880s, "Charlie Dilke Upset the Milk" – "Master Dilke upset the milk, when taking it home to Chelsea; the papers say that Charlie's gay, rather a wilful wag!" – referred to Sir [[Charles Dilke]]'s alleged heterosexual impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;John Major (2012) ''My Old Man'', page 87 and note&lt;/ref&gt; Giving testimony in court in 1889, the prostitute [[John Saul (prostitute)|John Saul]] stated: "I occasionally do odd-jobs for different gay people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_lesbian_and_gay_studies/v005/5.3kaplan.html|title = Who's Afraid Of John Saul? Urban Culture and the Politics of Desire in Late Victorian London|last = Kaplan|first = Morris|date = 1999|journal = GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 5.3, 267-314|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well into the mid 20th century a middle-aged bachelor could be described as "gay", indicating that he was unattached and therefore free, without any implication of homosexuality. This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]'', first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of ''Jane Gay''. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on [[Lady Jane Grey]]).

A passage from [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''Miss Furr &amp; Miss Skeene'' (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (''Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family'', 1995) the portrait "featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history," and [[Edmund Wilson]] (1951, quoted by James Mellow in ''Charmed Circle'', 1974) agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Martha E. Stone, Sept–Oct 2002. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Who+were+Miss+Furr+and+Miss+Skeene%3F+(Essay).-a090892988 "Who were Miss Furr and Miss Skeene?"], ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

{{quote|They were&amp;nbsp;... gay, they learned little things that are things in being gay,&amp;nbsp;... they were quite regularly gay.|Gertrude Stein|1922}}

The word continued to be used with the dominant meaning of "carefree", as evidenced by the title of ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), a musical film about a heterosexual couple.

''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) was the first film to use the word ''gay'' in apparent reference to homosexuality. In a scene in which [[Cary Grant]]'s character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman's feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, "Because I just went ''gay'' all of a sudden!" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to [[cross-dressing]] (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, "I just decided to do something frivolous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|title=Bringing Up Baby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A. Gross, executive secretary for the George W. Henry Foundation, who said in the June 1950 issue of SIR magazine: "I have yet to meet a happy homosexual. They have a way of describing themselves as gay but the term is a misnomer. Those who are habitues of the bars frequented by others of the kind, are about the saddest people I’ve ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;"The Truth About Homosexuals," Sir, June 1950, Sara H. Carleton, New York, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shift to specifically ''homosexual'' ===
By the mid-20th century, ''gay'' was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/77207?|title=gay, adj., adv., and n.

This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning, which was at first confined to subcultures. ''Gay'' was the preferred term since other terms, such as ''[[queer]]'', were felt to be derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A queer use of an inoffensive little word |author=Howard, Philip |date=7 June 1976 |page=12 |newspaper=The Times] |url= http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/keywordsearch.arc?queryKeywords=A+queer+use+of+an+inoffensive+little+word |location= London |ref=CS202211015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homosexual]]'' is perceived as excessively clinical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive |title=Media Reference Guide - Offensive Terms To Avoid |publisher=GLAAD |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thenewgay.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thenewgay.net/2008/09/gay-adjectives-vs-lesbian-nouns.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024134919/http://www.thenewgay.net/2008/09/gay-adjectives-vs-lesbian-nouns.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 October 2008 |title=Gay Adjectives vs. Lesbian Nouns |publisher=The New Gay |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americamagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Martin |date=4 November 2000 |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=2297 |title=The Church and the Homosexual Priest |publisher=America The National Catholic Weekly Magazine |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as "homosexuality" was at that time a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] [[diagnosis]] in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM).

In mid-20th century Britain, where male homosexuality was illegal until the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activity. Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of [[euphemism]]s were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include "sporty" girls and "artistic" boys,&lt;ref&gt;Cocks, H. A. "'Sporty' Girls and 'Artistic' Boys: Friendship, Illicit Sex, and the British 'Companionship' Advertisement, 1913–1928", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' – Volume 11, Number 3, July 2002, pp. 457–482.&lt;/ref&gt; all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective.

The 1960s marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of "carefree" to the current "homosexual". In the British comedy-drama film ''[[Light Up the Sky! (film)|Light Up the Sky!]]'' (1960), directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]], about the antics of a British Army searchlight squad during World War II, there is a scene in the mess hut where the character played by [[Benny Hill]] proposes an after-dinner toast. He begins, "I'd like to propose..." at which point a fellow diner, played by [[Sidney Tafler]], interjects "Who to?", suggesting a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, "Not to you for start, you ain't my type". He then adds in mock doubt, "Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet."

By 1963, a new sense of the word ''gay'' was known well enough to be used by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his book ''The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting''. Similarly, [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]] in his 1964 novel ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'', could write that a character "took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those (especially women) who weren't gay...."&lt;ref&gt;Selby, Jr., Hubert "Last Exit To Brooklyn" NY: Grove Press, 1988 p. 23 copyright 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 1960–1966 animated TV series ''[[The Flintstones]]'', whereby viewers are assured that they will "have a gay old time." Similarly, the 1966 [[Herman's Hermits]] song "[[No Milk Today]]", which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a [[Top 40]] hit in the U.S., included the lyric "No milk today, it was not always so; ''The company was gay'', we'd turn night into day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/paul/lyrics/hermanshermits/nomilk~1.html|title=The Lyrics Library – Herman's Hermits – No Milk Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1967, the headline of the review of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album in the British daily newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' stated, "The Beatles revive hopes of progress in pop music with their gay new LP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1873296.ece |title=The Beatles revive hopes of progress in pop music with their gay new LP | location=London |work=The Times |date=2 June 2007 | accessdate=3 May 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in the same year, [[The Kinks]] recorded "[[David Watts (song)|David Watts]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php |title=Kinks Song List |publisher=Kindakinks.net |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly about schoolboy envy, the song also operated as an in-joke, as related in [[Jon Savage]]'s "The Kinks: The Official Biography", because the song took its name from a homosexual promoter they had encountered who had romantic desires for songwriter [[Ray Davies]]' teenage brother; and the lines "he is so gay and fancy free" attest to the ambiguity of the word's meaning at that time, with the second meaning evident only for those in the know.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Jon "The Kinks: The Official Biography" London: Faber and Faber, 1984 pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1970, the first episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' has the demonstrably straight [[Mary Richards]]' downstairs neighbor, Phyllis, breezily declaiming that Mary is, at age 30, still "young and gay."

There is little doubt that the homosexual sense is a development of the word's traditional meaning, as described above. It has nevertheless been claimed that ''gay'' stands for "Good As You", but there is no evidence for this: it is a [[backronym]] created as [[False etymology|popular etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Gay_-_Etymology/id/1419120 |title=Global Oneness Encyclopedia: Gay |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023132924/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Gay_-_Etymology/id/1419120 |archivedate=23 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }} {{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual orientation, identity, behavior ===
{{Main|Sexual orientation|Sexual identity|Human sexual behavior}}
{{See also|Situational sexual behavior}}
The [[American Psychological Association]] defines ''[[sexual orientation]]'' as "an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes," ranging "along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex."&lt;ref name=APABrochure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/orientation.aspx |title=What causes a person to have a particular sexual orientation? |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation can also be "discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex), and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women)."&lt;ref name=APABrochure/&gt;

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other [[minority group]]s (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality."&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmc = 3215279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[gay rights]] activist [[Peter Tatchell]] has argued that the term ''gay'' is merely a cultural expression which reflects the current status of homosexuality within a given society, and claiming that "Queer, gay, homosexual&amp;nbsp;... in the long view, they are all just temporary identities. One day, we will not need them at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/nov/27/isgayjustaphase |title=Just a phase |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Peter |last=Tatchell |date=27 November 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person engages in sexual activity with a partner of the same sex but does not self-identify as gay, terms such as '[[the closet|closeted']], 'discreet', or '[[bi-curious]]' may apply. Conversely, a person may identify as gay without having had sex with a same-sex partner. Possible choices include identifying as gay socially, while choosing to be [[celibate]], or while anticipating a first homosexual experience. Further, a bisexual person might also identify as "gay" but others may consider ''gay'' and ''bisexual'' to be [[Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]]. There are some who are drawn to the same sex but neither engage in sexual activity nor identify as gay; these could have the term ''[[asexuality|asexual]]'' applied, even though ''asexual'' generally can mean no attraction, or involve heterosexual attraction but no sexual activity.

==== Terminology ====
{{Main|Terminology of homosexuality}}

Some reject the term ''homosexual'' as an identity-label because they find it too clinical-sounding;&lt;ref name=thenewgay.net/&gt;&lt;ref name=americamagazine.org/&gt;&lt;ref name="usc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/soin/enhancingCurricula/J468%20STDT-%20KC%20STAR.pdf |title=AIDS and Gay Catholic Priests: Implications of the Kansas City Star Report |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528031311/http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/soin/enhancingCurricula/J468%20STDT-%20KC%20STAR.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; they believe it is too focused on physical acts rather than romance or attraction, or too reminiscent of the era when homosexuality was considered a mental illness. Conversely, some reject the term ''gay'' as an identity-label because they perceive the cultural connotations to be undesirable or because of the negative connotations of the slang usage of the word.

Style guides, like the following from the [[Associated Press]], call for ''gay'' over ''homosexual'':

{{quote|''Gay'': Used to describe men and women attracted to the same sex, though ''lesbian'' is the more common term for women. Preferred over ''homosexual'' except in clinical contexts or references to sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/files/MediaReferenceGuide2010.pdf|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are those who reject the gay label for reasons other than shame or negative connotations. Writer [[Alan Bennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27291458|title=Alan Bennett rejected 'gay label'|date=6 May 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fashion icon [[André Leon Talley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/12/andre-leon-talley-gay_n_3743253.html|title=Vogue's André Leon Talley Rejects 'Gay' Label, Admits To 'Very Gay Experiences'|first=Cavan|last=Sieczkowski|date=12 August 2013|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; are like others in the fashion and the arts, out and open gay men who reject being labeled gay, finding it too limiting and slotting them into label boxes.

===Gay community vs. LGBT community===
{{Main|LGBT community}}

Starting in the mid-1980s in the United States, a conscious effort was under way, within what was then only called the gay community, to add the term ''lesbian'' to the name of all gay organizations that catered to both male and female homosexuals, and to use the terminology of gay and lesbian, or lesbian/gay when referring to that community. So, organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]]. For many ardent feminist lesbians, it was also important that the ''L'' come first, lest an ''L'' following a ''G'' become another symbol of male dominance over women,&lt;ref&gt;''Lesbian Ethics'', pp. 13–21.&lt;/ref&gt; although other women prefer the usage ''gay woman''. In the 1990s, this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual, [[transgender]], [[intersex]], and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movement. Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use, following the example and preference of the organizations, as reflected in their press releases and public communications.

=== Descriptor ===

The term ''gay'' can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|the said culture]]. For example, the term "gay bar" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele, or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.

Using it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality, but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.

{{anchor|noun|Noun}}

=== Use as a noun ===
The label ''gay'' was originally used purely as an [[adjective]] ("he is a gay man" or "he is gay"). The term has also been in use as a [[noun]] with the meaning "homosexual man" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in "gays are opposed to that policy." This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG) and [[Children of lesbians and gays everywhere|Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere]] (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in "he is a gay" or "two gays were there too," although this may be perceived as derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries|title=The American Heritage Book of English Usage|date=1996|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=New York|isbn=0547563213|page=197|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used for comedic effect by the ''[[Little Britain]]'' character Dafydd Thomas.

==Generalized pejorative use==
When used with a derisive attitude (e.g., "that was so gay"), the word ''gay'' is [[pejorative]]. While retaining its other meanings, its use among young people as a general term of [[disparagement]] is common.&lt;ref name="Winterman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; This pejorative usage has its origins in the late 1970s, with the word gaining a pejorative sense by association with the previous meaning: homosexuality was seen as inferior or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/21139-many-heterosexual-college-males-say-that-s-so-gay-but-why|title=Many heterosexual college males say 'That's so gay,' but why? {{!}} University of Michigan News|website=ns.umich.edu|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1980s, and especially in the late 1990s, the usage as a generic insult became common among young people.&lt;ref name="Winterman"/&gt;

This usage of the word has been criticized as [[homophobia|homophobic]]. A 2006 [[BBC]] ruling by the [[Board of Governors]] over the use of the word in this context by [[Chris Moyles]] on his [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show, ''"I do not want that one, it's gay,"'' advises "caution on its use" for this reason:

{{quote|"The word 'gay', in addition to being used to mean 'homosexual' or 'carefree', was often now used to mean 'lame' or 'rubbish'. This is a widespread current usage of the word amongst young people&amp;nbsp;... The word 'gay'&amp;nbsp;... need not be offensive&amp;nbsp;... or homophobic&amp;nbsp;... The governors said, however, that Moyles was simply keeping up with developments in English usage.&amp;nbsp;... The committee&amp;nbsp;... was "familiar with hearing this word in this context." The governors believed that in describing a ring tone as 'gay', the [[DJ]] was conveying that he thought it was 'rubbish', rather than 'homosexual'.&amp;nbsp;... The panel acknowledged however that this use&amp;nbsp;... in a derogatory sense&amp;nbsp;... could cause offence in some listeners, and counselled caution on its use.|BBC Board of Governors&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article671972.ece |title=Gay means rubbish, says BBC |work=The Times |location=London |date=6 June 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |first=Adam |last=Sherwin}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The BBC's ruling was heavily criticised by the Minister for Children, [[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]], who stated in response that "the casual use of homophobic language by mainstream radio DJs" is:

{{quote|"too often seen as harmless banter instead of the offensive insult that it really represents.&amp;nbsp;... To ignore this problem is to collude in it. The blind eye to casual name-calling, looking the other way because it is the easy option, is simply intolerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Grew |url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4862.html |title=BBC's attitude to homophobic language 'damages children' |work=Pink News |location= London |accessdate=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shortly after the Moyles incident, a campaign against homophobia was launched in Britain under the slogan "homophobia is gay", playing on the double meaning of the word "gay" in youth culture, as well as the popular perception that vocal homophobia is common among closeted homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-2607.html |title=Young Liberal Democrats launch 'homophobia is gay' campaign |work=Pink News |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 article published in the ''[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]'', [[University of Michigan]] researchers Michael Woodford, Alex Kulick and Perry Silverschanz, alongside [[Appalachian State University]] professor Michael L. Howell, argued that the pejorative use of the word "gay" was a [[Microaggression theory|microaggression]].&lt;ref name="thatsogayjournalofinter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=Michael L.|last2=Kulick|first2=Alex|last3=Silverschanz|first3=Perry|last4=Woodford|first4=Michael R.|title="That’s so Gay" Heterosexual Male Undergraduates and the Perpetuation of Sexual Orientation Microagressions on Campus|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=January 2013|volume=28|issue=2|pages=416–435|doi=10.1177/0886260512454719|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/28/2/416.abstract|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research found that college-age men were more likely to repeat the word pejoratively if their friends said it, while they were less likely to say it if they had lesbian, gay or bisexual peers.&lt;ref name="thatsogayjournalofinter"/&gt;

==Parallels in other languages==
* The concept of a "gay identity" and the use of the term ''gay'' may not be used or understood the same way in non-Westernised cultures, since modes of sexuality may differ from those prevalent in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Masculinity for boys: A guide for peer educators; Published by UNESCO, New Delhi, Page: 102, Page: 62&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the term "[[two spirit]]" is not interchangeable with "LGBT Native American" or "gay Indian".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} This term differs from most western, mainstream definitions of [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] in that it is not so much about whom one is sexually interested in, or how one personally identifies; rather, it is a sacred, spiritual and ceremonial role that is recognized and confirmed by the Elders of the Two Spirit's ceremonial community.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
* The [[German language|German]] equivalent for ''gay'', ''[[:de:schwul|schwul]]'', which is [[Etymology|etymologically]] derived from ''schwül'' (hot, humid), also acquired the pejorative meaning within youth culture.&lt;ref name=sedlaczek&gt;Robert Sedlaczek, Roberta Baron: ''leet &amp; leiwand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24405">'''Orders to Sentry''' is the official title of a set of rules governing sentry (guard or watch) duty in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. While any guard posting has rules that may go without saying ("Stay awake," for instance), these orders are carefully detailed and particularly stressed in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]. Also known as the '''11 General Orders''', the list is meant to cover any possible scenario a sentry might encounter on duty.

All recruits learn these orders verbatim while at [[recruit training]] and are expected to retain the knowledge to use for the remainder of their military careers. It is very common for a [[drill instructor]] or (after boot camp) an inspecting [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] to ask a question such as, "What is your sixth general order?" and expect an immediate (and correct) reply.

==U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard==
The '''General Orders for Sentries''' are quite similar between the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the main differences being the titles of positions referenced in the orders. The [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Navy Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (NJROTC), [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (NROTC) also use the following General Orders to the Sentry.

The U.S. Department of the Navy gives the General Orders for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps&lt;ref&gt;Marine Corps Order 5530.15: U.S. Marine Corps Interior Guard Manual, Chapter 3: Orders and Countersigns, 2. General Orders and Regulations http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/MCO%205530.15.pdf. Retrieved 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

1. '''To take charge of this [[military base|post]] and all government property in view'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you are a sentry, you are "in charge."  This means that no one—no matter what their [[Military rank|rank]] or position—may overrule your authority in carrying out your orders. The only way that you may be exempted from carrying out your orders is if your orders are changed by your superior. For example, if your orders are to allow no one to enter a fenced-in compound, you must prevent everyone from entering, even if an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] tells you it is all right for him or her to enter. The [[petty officer]] of the watch (or whoever is your immediate superior) may modify your orders to allow the admiral to enter, but without that authorization you must keep the admiral out.  Situations such as this will not often, if ever, occur, but it is important that you understand the principles involved. It is also your responsibility to know the limits of your post. This information will be conveyed to you among your special orders. You must also treat all government property that you can see as though it were your own, even if it is not technically part of your assigned post.&lt;ref name=bluejacket&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas J. Cutler|title=The Bluejacket's Manual|date=1902–2002|publisher=US Naval Institute Press|isbn=1-55750-208-0|page=153}}, [[The Bluejacket's Manual]], ''[[Thomas J. Cutler]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2. '''To walk my post in a military manner, keeping always on the alert and observing everything that takes place within sight or hearing'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Keep your eyes peeled", as the expression goes. Be vigilant by looking around at all times. Do not be tempted to hide from the rain or cold in poor weather. If you see or hear anything unusual, investigate it.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

3. '''To report all violations of orders I am instructed to enforce'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, for example, someone is climbing a fence near your post, you must report it, even if the offender stops climbing and runs away after your challenge. In this case, even though it appears that the threat to security is over, there is no way for you to know whether this violator is the only one involved. And even though the climber may have just been seeking a shortcut back to her or his ship, you cannot be certain that there is not something more sinister involved.  Let your superiors make the judgment calls; your job is to report what happens on or near your post.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

4. '''To repeat all calls from any post more distant from the [[quarterdeck]] than my own'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In these days of modern communications, sentries will probably have telephones or radios at their disposal with which to make their reports. But if they do not, or if there is a power failure or some other reason that the modern equipment fails, the age-old practice of relaying the word is very important. The term "guardhouse" in this general order refers to the command post or point of control for the watches. It might be the [[quarterdeck]] on board ship or a tent in the field.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

5. '''To quit my post only when properly relieved'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It should be fairly obvious that you should not leave your post until someone has come to take your place or until the petty officer of the guard has told you that the watch is no longer necessary. If the person relieving you is late, report it to the petty officer of the watch but do ''not'' quit your post. If you become ill and can no longer stand your watch, notify the petty officer of the watch and he or she will provide you a proper relief.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

6. '''To receive, obey, and pass on to the sentry who relieves me, all orders from the [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], [[Officer of the Day|Command Duty Officer]], [[Officer of the Deck]], and Officers and Petty  Officers of the watch only.'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is essential that you receive and obey all of the special orders that apply to your watch. It is also essential that you pass these orders on to your relief.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(For the Marine Corps it reads: 'commanding officer, officer of the day, and officers, and noncommissioned (petty) officers of the guard only.'&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. f. Number 6; idem, Marine Corps Order 5530.15: U.S. Marine Corps Interior Guard Manual. http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/MCO%205530.15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

7. '''To talk to no one except in the line of duty'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having conversations about matters not pertaining to your duty is distracting and must be avoided.  If someone tries to engage you in casual conversation while you are standing your watch, it is your responsibility to inform them courteously that you are on duty and cannot talk with them.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

8. '''To give the alarm in case of [[Conflagration|fire]] or disorder'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;While this is rather straightforward and obvious, keep in mind that a fire or disorder of some kind might be a deliberate distraction to keep you from observing some other disorderly or subversive activity. If you are certain that a fire is not meant to be a distraction, you should [[Firefighting|fight the fire]] if you have the means to do so. Remember, however, that your first responsibility is to ''report'' whatever is amiss.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

9. '''To call the Officer of the Deck in any case not covered by instructions'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rule here is "When in doubt, ask." If you are not sure what you are supposed to do in a particular situation, it is better to ask for clarification than to make an assumption or to guess.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(For the Marine Corps it reads: 'To call the corporal of the guard in any case not covered by instructions.'&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. i. Number 9. http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/MCO%205530.15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

10. '''To salute all officers and all [[Flag of the United States|colors]] and [[Ensign|standards]] not cased'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even though you are in charge of your post and everyone, including officers, must obey your instructions insofar as they pertain to your duties, you must still extend the appropriate [[Military courtesy|military courtesies]]. Both terms, "colors" and "standards", refer to the national ensign. The national ensign may be referred to as "the colors" when it is fixed to a staff, mast, or pike (e.g., when flown from a flagstaff or carried in a parade).  When it is fixed to a vehicle it is often called "the national standard."  A flag is considered "cased" when it is furled and placed in a protective covering. If your duties allow, you should take part in morning or evening colors ceremonies, but do not sacrifice your vigilance by doing so. For example, if your assignment requires that you watch a certain area and the national ensign is being hoisted in a different direction, you should stand at attention and salute but do not face the colors; keep looking in the direction you are supposed to be watching.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

11. '''To be especially watchful at night and during the time for challenging, to challenge all persons on or near my post, and allow no one to pass without proper authority'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Challenging persons while you are on sentry duty is accomplished by a mix of custom and common sense.  When a person or party approaches your post, you should challenge them at a distance that is sufficient for you to react if they turn out to have hostile intentions. You should say in a firm voice, loud enough to be easily heard, "Halt!  Who goes there?" (or "Who is there?"). Once the person answers, you should then say "Advance to be recognized." If you are challenging a group of people, you should say, "Advance ''one'' to be recognized." If you have identified the person or persons approaching, permit them to pass. If you are not satisfied with that person's identification, you must detain the person and call the petty officer of the watch. When two or more individuals approach from different directions at the same time, challenge each in turn and require each to halt until told to proceed.&lt;ref name=bluejacket/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

General Orders for the Navy and Coast Guard are essentially the same, except for the wording of two orders: {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

* 6. To receive, obey and pass on to the sentry who relieves me, all orders from the Commanding Officer, Command Duty Officer, [[Officer of the Deck]], and Officers and Petty Officers of the Watch only.
* 9. To call the Officer of the Deck in any case not covered by instructions.

General Orders of the Coast Guard:
*6 is similar, however there is a difference in the officers.: ''To receive, obey and pass on the sentry who relieves me, all orders from the Commanding Officer, Field Officer of the day, Officer of the day, and Officers and Petty Officers of the Watch.''
*9. To call the Petty Officer of the watch in any case not covered by instructions.

==U.S. Army==
The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] now uses a condensed form of orders, with three basic instructions. Previously it used the same eleven general orders as the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=US Combat Engineer 1941-45 |last=Rottman|first=Gordon |page=23|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2010|chapter=Daily Life|isbn= 978-1-84603-579-1 |quote=All soldiers were required to memorize and be able to accurately repeat the 11 General Orders for sentries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#I will guard everything within the limits of my post and quit my post only when properly relieved.
#I will obey my special orders and perform all my duties in a military manner.
#I will report violations of my special orders, emergencies, and anything not covered in my instructions to the commander of the relief.

===Meaning of the General Orders===
*'''Number 1. I will guard everything within the limits of my post and quit my post only when properly relieved'''.&lt;ref name="FF 22-6"&gt;FM 22-6, Guard Duty&lt;/ref&gt;

:(1) The guard is responsible for everything that occurs within the limits of his post while he is on duty. He is also responsible for all equipment and property located within the limits of his post. The exact limits of his post are defined by special orders. The special orders should also include every place a guard must go to perform his duties.

:(2) A guard investigates immediately every unusual or suspicious occurrence on or near his post provided he does not have to leave his post to do so. If necessary, the guard will contact the commander of the relief for instructions.

:(3) A guard apprehends all suspicious persons and all persons involved in a disorder occurring on or near his post provided he does not have to leave his post to do so. In apprehending persons, the guard will use only necessary force to overcome any resistance. Apprehension of persons should be included in special orders or guard instructions. All persons apprehended are turned over to the commander of the relief.

:(4) All persons, regardless of rank, are required to respect members of the guard in the performance of their duties.

:(5) A guard will remain on post and continue to perform all duties required on that post until he is relieved by proper authority.

:(6) If a guard requires relief because of sickness or for any other reason, he will notify the commander of the relief and wait until he is replaced by another guard or has permission from the proper authorities to leave his post.

:(7) If a guard is not relieved at the expiration of his tour of duty, he does not abandon his post. He will contact the commander of the relief for instructions.

:(8) Guards leave their posts for meals as specifically directed by the commanding officer. Normally, this is accomplished by arranging for early and late meals for guards going on and coming off post.

:(9) When ordered by proper authority, or prescribed in the special orders, a guard on the last relief of a post may be directed to leave the post at the proper time and return to the guardhouse where he reports to the commander of the relief on duty.

*'''Number 2. I will obey my special orders and perform all my duties in a military manner'''.

:(1) A guard will familiarize himself with the special orders for his post prior to being posted. The guard will obey, execute, and enforce all special orders pertaining to his post.

::Note. The commander of the guard is responsible for insuring that all guards understand their special instructions prior to being posted.

:(2) In addition to his special orders, a guard is responsible to obey and carry out any orders or instructions from the commanding officer, field officer of the day, and officers and noncommissioned officers of the guard. No other persons are authorized to give a guard orders or instructions. Any special instructions for a guard should be issued through the guard's chain of command.

:(3) Guards on post will pass instructions to their relief when appropriate. The information is also given to the commander of the relief. Example: A guard on duty at an ammunition dump discovers a hole in the fence during his tour of duty. Upon finding the hole, the commander of the relief is notified. The guard will pass this information to his relief so that special attention can be paid to that portion of the fence until the hole is repaired.

:(4) The guard will perform his duties in a military manner and serve as an example to others.

:(5) The guard is courteous to all persons. He will talk to no one except in the line of duty. When persons make proper inquiries of a guard, he answers them in a courteous manner.

:(6) A guard on an interior guard post maintains an erect and soldierly bearing. The weapon is carried in a manner prescribed by the commanding officer or commander of the guard. (A guard armed with a rifle, carbine, or shotgun may be allowed to shift his weapon to left shoulder arms to reduce fatigue.)

:(7) Guards on post salute individuals as prescribed in AR 600-25.

::(a) A sentry, on a post which does not require challenging, carrying a weapon at sling arms, will render the hand salute upon recognition of an officer.

::(b) A sentry, on a post which does not require challenging, carrying a weapon at right (left) shoulder arms, will, upon recognition of an officer, halt and present arms as prescribed in the manual of arms FM 22-5. When the officer returns the salute the guard will return to right (left) shoulder arms and resume his duties.

::(c) A sentry armed with a pistol, on a post which does not require challenging, will, upon recognition of an officer, render the hand salute.

::(d) No salute is given by a guard who is engaged in a specific duty, the performance of which prevents saluting.

:(8) A guard talking with an officer does not interrupt the conversation to salute another officer; however, if the officer salutes a senior, the guard also salutes.

:(9) The special orders will specify the time for challenging.

::(a) When challenging, a guard, armed with a rifle, carbine, or shotgun will challenge from the position of port arms as described in the manual of arms in FM 22-5. If armed with a pistol the guard will challenge from the position of raise pistol.

::(b) After challenging, a guard will remain in the challenge position until the individual challenged is allowed to pass, depart, or is turned over the commander of the relief.

::(c) Sentinels on posts requiring challenging will not render salutes.

:::Note. The sentinel's primary mission is to guard his post. Requiring salutes places the individual in a vulnerable position. The sentinel will, however, display all other military courtesy and respect while in conversation with an officer.

::(d) Challenging one person or a group:

:::1. If a guard sees any person on or near his post during the time for challenging, he positions himself so that he can control the situation. If possible, he should be out of sight when challenging. When the person is approximately 30 steps, or at sufficient distance to allow the guard time to react, the guard will assume the correct challenge position and command "HALT!" When the person has halted, the guard asks, "WHO IS THERE?" The guard may advance toward the person while challenging to put himself in a better position. When the guard is in the best position to pass or apprehend the person, he requires the person to advance towards him, remain in position, or advance to a particular place, face toward the light, or to take any position necessary to determine whether the person should be passed, denied, or turned over to the commander of the relief.

:::2. The guard permits only one member of a group to approach him for identification.

:::3. If persons are in a vehicle, the guard proceeds as if they were on foot. If necessary to carry out his duties, he may have one or all of the passengers dismount.

:::4. After halting a group and receiving an answer indicating that it is authorized to pass, the guard says, "Advance one to be recognized." After he has recognized the one advanced, the guard says, "Advance, Sergeant Smith," naming the person (or group) allowed to advance. If the answer is "Friends," the guard says, "Advance one to be recognized." After recognition he says, "Advance, friends."

:::5. The guard satisfies himself beyond a reasonable doubt that those challenged are what they represent themselves to be and that they have a right to pass. If he is not satisfied, he detains the person and calls the commander of the relief. Normally, the guard will accept a reasonable answer for identification if the post is not a vital area and the persons are not suspicious looking.

::::Note. A visual check of an individual's ID card is considered the best means of identification when doubt exists.

::(e) Challenging two or more persons or groups

:::1. If two or more persons or groups approach the guard's post from different directions at the same time, they are halted in turn and remain halted until advanced by the guard.

:::2. When two or more groups are halted at the same time, the senior is advanced first.

:::3. A guard advances different persons or groups with the following priority: commanding officer, field officer of the day, officer of the day, officers of the guard, officers, patrols, reliefs, noncommissioned officers of the guard in order of rank, and friends.

:::4. If a person or group has been advanced and is talking with the guard, the guard halts any other person or group that may approach, but advances no one until the person or group with whom he is talking leaves. He then advances the senior of the remaining group.

:::5. A guard must always be alert and never be surprised. He never permits two persons or groups to advance to his post at the same time.

:::6. Confusing or misleading answers to a guard's challenge are not acceptable. However, the answer "Friend" is not considered misleading and is the usual answer of an inspecting officer or patrol when they do not wish to reveal their official capacity.

:(10) During his tour of duty a guard is required to execute orders of no one but the commanding officer, field officer of the day, officer of the day, and officers of the guard; however, any officer may investigate apparent violations of regulations by members of the guard. In the event of an inspecting officer, or any other person in the military service, finding an irresponsible guard on post (Art. 113, Uniform Code of Military Justice), it is his duty to notify the commander of the guard or a noncommissioned officer of the guard and stay on the post until a qualified guard is posted.

:(11) A guard surrenders his weapon to, and only on order of, a person from whom he lawfully receives orders while on post. These persons should not order a guard to surrender his weapon for inspection or any other purpose unless an emergency exists.

*'''Number 3. I will report violations of my special orders, emergencies, and anything not covered in my instructions, to the commander of the relief.'''

:(1) A guard reports all violations of his special orders to the commander of the relief. He apprehends the offender, if necessary.

:(2) A guard reports all emergencies that occur on or near his post. The guard will take whatever action is prescribed by his special orders or guard instructions. Anytime the guard is in doubt as to what action to take, or it is not covered in his special orders, he will call the commander of the relief for instructions or assistance.

:(3) In case of fire, occurring on or near his post, the guard calls, "Fire, Post Number (Two)." He alerts the occupants, if it is an occupied building. He gives the alarm or ensures one has been given. If possible, he extinguishes the fire. He helps direct the fire fighting apparatus to the fire. He notifies the guardhouse of his actions as soon as possible.

:(4) A guard reports any disorder occurring on or near his post. He takes police action as prescribed in his special orders or guard instructions. If assistance is required, he calls, "The Guard, Post Number (Four)."

:(5) If the danger is great, he fires his weapon into the air three times in rapid succession before calling. When instructed to do so, guards give warnings of air, CBR, and other attacks. Guards should receive special training if they are to act as chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) sentinels while on post.

==U.S. Air Force Security Forces==
The [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[United States Air Force Security Forces|Security Forces]] also uses a condensed form, with three basics

#  I will take charge of my post and protect personnel and property for which I am responsible, until properly relieved.
#  I will report all violations of orders that I am entrusted to enforce and contact my superior in any case not covered by my instructions.
#  I will sound the alarm in any case of disorder or emergency.

{{One source|date=December 2013}}
A '''hardware reset''' or '''hard reset''' of a [[computer system]] is a hardware operation that re-initializes the core hardware components of the system, thus ending all current software operations in the system. This is typically, but not always, followed by [[booting]] of the system into [[firmware]] that re-initializes the rest of the system, and restarts the [[operating system]].

Hardware resets are an essential part of the [[power-on process]], but may also be triggered without [[power cycling]] the system by direct user intervention via a physical [[reset button]], [[watchdog timer]]s, or by software intervention that, as its last action, activates the hardware reset line.

Holding down the power button is a common way to force shutdown a computer.  On Macs, pressing Control-Command-Power quits [[macOS]] and restarts the computer.

==Hardware reset in 80x86 IBM PC==
The [[8086]] microprocessors provide RESET pin that is used to do the hardware reset. When a HIGH is applied to the pin, the CPU immediately stops, and sets the major [[Processor registers|registers]] to these values:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Register !! Value
|-
| CS ([[Code segment|Code Segment]]) || 0xFFFF
|-
| DS ([[Data segment|Data Segment]]) || 0x0000
|-
| ES (Extra [[Data segment|Data Segment]]) || 0x0000
|-
| SS ([[Stack (abstract data type)|Stack]] Segment) || 0x0000
|-
| IP ([[Instruction pointer|Instruction Pointer]]) || 0x0000
|}

The CPU uses the values of CS and IP registers to find the location of the next instruction to execute. Location of next instruction is calculated using this simple equation:

&lt;code&gt;Location of next instruction = (CS&lt;&lt;4) + (IP)&lt;/code&gt;

This implies that after the hardware reset, the CPU will start execution at the physical address 0xFFFF0. In [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC compatible computers]], This address maps to [[BIOS]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. The memory word at 0xFFFF0 usually contains a [[JMP (x86 instruction)|JMP]] instruction that redirects the CPU to execute the initialization code of BIOS. This JMP instruction is absolutely the first instruction executed after the reset.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/80X86-IBM-Compatible-Computers-Interfacing/dp/013061775X/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1 The 80x86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers (Volumes I &amp; II (4th Edition))], By Mohamed Ali Mazidi and Janice Gillispie Mazidi, Section 9.1, Page 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware reset in later x86 CPUs ===
Later x86 processors reset the CS and IP registers similarly, refer to [[Reset vector]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7566">'''Individual ministerial responsibility''' is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in governments using the [[Westminster System]] that a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[minister (government)|minister]] bears the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their [[ministry (government department)|ministry]] or department. Individual ministerial responsibility is not the same as [[cabinet collective responsibility]], which states members of the cabinet must approve publicly of its collective decisions or resign. This means that a motion for a vote of "no confidence" is not in order should the actions of an organ of government fail in the proper discharge of their responsibilities. Where there is ministerial responsibility, the accountable minister is expected to take the blame and ultimately resign, but the majority or coalition within parliament of which the minister is part, is not held to be answerable for that minister's failure.

This means that if waste, corruption, or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is responsible even if the minister had no knowledge of the actions. A minister is ultimately responsible for all actions by a ministry because, even without knowledge of an infraction by subordinates, the minister approved the hiring and continued employment of those [[Civil service|civil servant]]s. If misdeeds are found to have occurred in a ministry, the minister is expected to resign. It is also possible for a minister to face criminal charges for [[malfeasance]] under their watch.

The principle is considered essential, as it is seen to guarantee that an elected official is answerable for every single government decision. It is also important to motivate ministers to closely scrutinize the activities within their departments. One rule coming from this principle is that each cabinet member answers for their own ministry in parliament's [[question time]]. The reverse of ministerial responsibility is that civil servants are not supposed to take credit for the successes of their department, allowing the government to claim them.

In recent years some commentators have argued the notion of ministerial responsibility has been eroded in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. As the doctrine is a constitutional convention, there is no formal mechanism for enforcing the rule. Today ministers frequently use ignorance of misbehaviour as an argument for lack of culpability. While opposition parties rarely accept this argument, the electorate is often more accepting. In most other Commonwealth countries such cases are today hardly ever brought to trial.

==United Kingdom==
It is currently unclear what individual action a minister ought to take when a civil servant within his department is guilty of maladministration. The formulation of some guidelines took place during the [[Crichel Down Affair]] in 1954 in which the Minister of Agriculture, [[Thomas Dugdale]], resigned, despite an inquiry suggesting that all mistakes were made within his department without his knowledge and in some cases due to deliberate deceit by civil servants.  Later details suggested that he resigned because he supported the civil servants' actions and because he disagreed with the government accepting the inquiry's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholson |first=I. |title=The Mystery of Crichel Down |year=1986 |edition=1st |publisher=Oxford University Press | place=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The government announced that ministers must defend civil servants who act properly and in accordance with policies set out by the minister. Furthermore, it was stated that "where an official makes a mistake or causes some delay, but not on an important issue of policy and not where a claim to individual rights is seriously involved, the Minister acknowledges the mistake and he accepts the responsibility although he is not personally involved."  

In 1982, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] (then Foreign Secretary) and two other Foreign Office ministers resigned shortly after the invasion of the Falkland Islands. Later official reviews stated that, although there had been misjudgments within the Foreign Office, no responsibility attached to any individual within the government. However, in 1983, when 38 IRA prisoners broke out of the [[HMP Maze|Maze]] prison, the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[James Prior]], did not resign, explaining that the break-out was not caused by any policy initiative originating from him. This latter position has become the norm in British politics. An exception might be [[Estelle Morris]], who resigned as [[Secretary of State for Education]] in 2002, saying she had not done well enough after a scandal over A-level marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2359695.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; Education secretary resigns |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-10-25 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent resignations due to personal errors of judgment or impropriety include the resignation of [[Ron Davies (British politician)|Ron Davies]], the Secretary of State for Wales, for sexual misconduct in 1998, and the resignation of [[Peter Mandelson]], Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, for failing to disclose a substantial loan by a Cabinet colleague in 1999.

An argument put forward during the [[Scott Inquiry]] into the [[Arms-to-Iraq]] affair in the 1980s was a distinction between political responsibility and political accountability. 

==Canada==
For organizational purposes there are Cabinet Ministers who are responsible for all activity within their department. In Canada ministerial responsibility has been reduced as it has become increasingly common for top level civil servants to be called before [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]], bypassing the minister.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} 

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, ministerial responsibility has tended to follow British practice.  Ministers have resigned in cases of personal misconduct, but more rarely in cases of maladministration.  Ministers have refused to resign in some cases where they have been asked to account for departmental errors.  The most famous case was [[Bob Semple]], who refused to resign in 1943 over engineering failures in the construction of a railway tunnel.  He was quoted as saying "I am responsible, but not to blame."  Subsequent notable incidents have included the refusal of a minister's resignation in the 1980s over compromised security of Budget documents, a minister resigning his portfolio (but not leaving Cabinet) over the 1995 [[Cave Creek disaster|Cave Creek]] disaster, and the resignation of a minister in 2011 for appearing to interfere in the administration of an [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] case.

[[File:Joseph Perl.jpg|250px|thumb|235px|Joseph Perl, with medals awarded for his work in education]]
'''Joseph Perl''' (also ''Josef Perl''; November 10, 1773, [[Ternopil]] – October 1, 1839, Ternopil), was an [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish educator and writer, a scion of the [[Haskalah]] or Jewish Enlightenment. He wrote in [[Hebrew]], [[Yiddish]], and [[German language|German]]; in 1819, he published the first Hebrew novel.&lt;ref name = "Mosaic Mag"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Halkin | first = Hillel | date = 11 May 2015 | title = Sex, Magic, Bigotry, Corruption—and the First Hebrew Novel | url = http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2015/05/sex-magic-bigotry-corruption-and-the-first-hebrew-novel/ | website = mosaicmagazine.com | accessdate = 17 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Born and raised in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] shortly after its annexation in the [[partitions of Poland|first partition of Poland]], he was a follower of [[Hasidism]] in his youth. Later, he turned against Hasidism and became a proponent of [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Haskalah]], although he remained an observant Jew. He is best known for his many writings on Hasidism, ranging from critical treatises to [[parody]].

==Youthful publisher==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2017}}
In 1786, only 13 years old, he wrote a book in German, ''Ueber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim aus ihren eigenen Schriften gezogen'' (''On the Nature of the Sect of the Hasidim, Drawn from Their Own Writings''), in which he attempted to demonstrate the absurdity of the beliefs and practices of Hasidic [[rabbi]]s, including [[Rabbi Nachman]] of [[Bratslav]] and [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi|Rabbi Shneur Zalman]], founder of what became the [[Lubavitcher]] movement. His work was rejected by the imperial [[Censorship|censor]]s, who apparently feared that it would create disharmony among [[Austria]]'s Jewish subjects. It was published in 1816. At the age of 14 he was engaged by his parents, but he continued living in his father's home.

He studied [[Kabbalah|Kabala]] and [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidut]], but his father, who was opposed to these studies, made him a merchant. This deeply affected his opinions regarding various subjects. Perl's satire of the Hasidic movement, ''[[Revealer of Secrets]]'' (''Megalleh Temirim''), is said to be the first modern novel in [[Hebrew]]. It was published in [[Vienna]] in 1819 under the [[pseudonym]] "Obadiah ben Pethahiah". Structured as an [[epistolary novel]], it is currently in print only in an [[English language|English]] [[translation]], by [[Dov Taylor]], published by [[Westview Press]]. It is an unusual book in that it satirizes the language and style of early Hasidic rabbis writing in Hebrew, which was not the vernacular of the Jews of its time. To make his work available and accessible to his contemporaries, Perl translated his own work into [[Yiddish]]. A subsequent parody of Hasidic writings, ''Words of the Righteous'', written with [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn]] and published in 1830, is available in Hebrew.

==Educator==
According to Dov Taylor, in his introduction to his English translation of ''Revealer of Secrets'', Perl denounced Hasidism not only in his writing but in memoranda to representatives of the Austrian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dov (1997). "Introduction." In: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fG8OAAAAYAAJ Joseph Perl's Revealer of Secrets: The first Hebrew novel]''. Translated by Taylor. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, 1838, Perl wrote a letter suggesting that the government censor Jewish libraries, prohibit meetings in Jewish ritual baths and close traditional Jewish schools, which he called "a place of refuge for vagabonds, thieves&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. a nest of demoralization and of&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. nefarious, scandalous deeds."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Taylor (1997), p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain memoranda written in later years Perl went so far as to attack particular Hasidic rebbes by name.&lt;ref&gt;Dauber, Jeremy (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kVWo4xuiaLwC&amp;pg=PA213 Antonio's Devils: Writers of the Jewish Enlightenment and the Birth of Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Literature]''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. p. 213-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an educator, he was a founder of the [[Deutsch-Israelitische Hauptschule]], a school for Jewish children which taught secular subjects such as [[history]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[natural science]] in German, in addition to the [[Jewish Bible|Bible]] and [[Talmud]].

==Death==
Joseph Perl, who ridiculed the ecstatic dancing and singing of the Hasidim, died on [[Simchat Torah]] (a holiday known in English as "rejoicing in the Torah"), a holy day traditionally — and currently — celebrated by song, dance and a processional through the streets carrying [[Torah]] scrolls, so the Galician Hasidim did not miss the opportunity to dance on Perl's fresh grave immediately after his burial.&lt;ref&gt;Dauber (2004), p. 214. Dauber draws a connection between the reported response of Hasidim to Perl's death and the fact that they likely were aware of his memoranda to the government: "Many of these memoranda were intended to be secret, for obvious reasons, but Perl's authorship became generally known, and it is said that Hasidim danced on Perl's fresh grave immediately after his burial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Rafael. ''Hasidism and the Jewish Enlightenment''.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ligbi''' (or Ligby) tribe speaks the [[Mande languages|Mande language]] spoken in [[Ghana]] in the north-west corner of the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]]. Ligbi is spoken by approximately 10,000 speakers (1988 GILLBT/[[SIL International|SIL]]). It is fairly closely related to [[Dioula language|Jula]], [[Vai language|Vai]] and [[Kono language|Kono]]. A small population of Ligbi speakers (around 4,000) is reported to live in Ivory Coast (Vanderaa 1991). Ligbi is also known as Wela (Hwela) or Numu. The latter of these refers to a subsection of the Ligbi people; Numu is Dyula for 'blacksmith'. (See [[blacksmiths of western Africa]].)

The Ligbi area in Ghana is bordered to the west by [[Nafaanra language|Nafaanra]], the [[Senufo languages|Senufo]] language of the [[Nafana (people)|Nafana]] people. The Ligbi people have come to the area of [[Begho]] (Bighu), an ancient trading town on the Tain river in Ghana, in the early 17th century before the Nafana.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Goody, "The Mande and the Akan Hinterland", in: The Historian in Tropical Africa, J.Vansina, R.Mauny and L.V.Thomas eds., 1964, London, Oxford University, 192-218&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ligbi has seven oral and seven nasal vowels. It is a tonal language with two level tones, High and Low. Syllables are of the form (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)V(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or N (a [[syllabic nasal]]), where CV is the most common syllable type.  C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be any of the consonants, whereas the optional C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; slot can have only nasals [[homorganic]] with the following consonants, e.g., ''gbá&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt; mádáánè'' "nine houses," ''gbá&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt; táà'' "ten houses." V (a vowel) alone occurs word-initial only in personal pronouns, some loan words, and names, e.g., ''á jádɛ̀'' "we have come."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23896">{{Distinguish|List of loanwords in Malayalam}}

The '''[[Malay language]] has many [[loanword]]s''' from [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], certain [[Chinese dialects]] and more recently, [[Arabic]] (in particular many religious terms) and [[English language|English]] (in particular many scientific and technological terms). Modern Malay loanwords are now primarily from [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] — English being the language of trade and technology while Arabic is the [[liturgical language|language of religion]] (Islam in the case of this language's concentrated regions), although key words such as ''surga/ syurga'' (heaven) and the word "religion" itself (''agama'') reflect their Sanskrit-Hindu origins. Javanese elements on the other hand are incorporated from the [[Indonesian language|variant of Malay used in Indonesia]] through the consumption of media from said country.

While based on Malay itself, Indonesian is traditionally more influenced by Javanese and Sundanese, as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia, with Javanese having the largest number of native speakers. Dutch influence over Indonesian vocabulary also is significant, as the Malay language itself was favored and adopted due to its trading benefit during VOC era over the archipelago, leading to mass loanword and influence over the modern Indonesian language. It is known that at least one third of the Indonesian vocabulary grew under Dutch influence.

There are some words in Malay which are spelled exactly the same as in its other language counterparts, e.g. in English – museum (Indonesian), hospital (Malaysian), format, lesbian, transit etc. In contrast, some Malay words have been loaned into other languages, [[List of English words of Malay origin|e.g. in English]] – rice [[Paddy field|paddy ("Padi")]], [[orangutan]], [[rattan]], [[babirusa]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D1MjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=babirusa&amp;dq=babirusa&amp;hl=en The Royal Natural History: Mammals, Richard Lydekker, F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4783">A '''liver shot''' or '''liver punch''' is a [[punch (strike)|punch]], [[kick]], or [[knee (strike)|knee strike]] to the right side of the [[rib]]cage that damages the [[liver]]. Blunt force to the liver can be excruciatingly painful, and an especially effective shot will incapacitate a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|8A7b9gBUYJU|A fight doctor explains the effectiveness of liver shots, plus some techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in [[combat sports]], liver shots often result in [[knockout|technical knockout]]s (TKOs).

A liver punch is usually made with the left hand, or the left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]] in [[infighting (martial arts)|infighting]], or the regular short body hook, in a short and quick manner. The drive is usually made under and to the front of the [[Human rib cage|ninth and tenth ribs]] upward to the base of the [[Scapula|shoulder blade]] toward the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. The punch shocks the liver, the largest [[gland]] [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], and a center of blood circulation, and causes the victim to lose focus and drive, and can cause a breathless feeling in the victim. It is usually delivered when [[feint]]ing an opponent to lead with his right, which leaves the body exposed; the attacker then steps in and delivers a short, stiff [[uppercut]], over the liver, which will likely leave the average man incapacitated. Most of the time, however, a liver punch is unintentional. It begins as a left hook to the body, but as the defending boxer puts his elbow down and begins to roll with the punch, the back is exposed. Thus, the attacking boxer is frequently offered either the arm or the back of the ribs, the latter of which he will usually take instead of the arm.

== Examples ==

'''Living Master''' is a term which distinguishes a living spiritual teacher from one who has already left his physical form (i.e., died.) Certain esoteric spiritual movements, notably [[Sant Mat]] and [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], consider a living spiritual adept to be essential, and critique the world religions as mere shells where a living master (who founded the religious movement) has been replaced with a scripture, statue, effigy, or other symbol. Just as an example of the current usage, [[Sant Baljit Singh]] is described by his disciples as a Living Master, while [[Jesus Christ]] or the [[Lord Buddha]] are examples of past Masters or Masters out of date as per Sant Mat.{{ref|link1}}

:TODAY a person who is ill cannot have the benefit of medical advice from Dhanwantri (the progenitor of medical science), nor can a litigant ask Solomon to decide his case, nor can a lady marry Adonis and bring forth children. Similarly, Saints who appeared in the past from time to time and conferred spiritual benefit on those who came into contact with them, cannot do anything for the present generation. Each had his commission, and on completing it, entrusted the work of regeneration to his successor. Man can learn only from man, and God works His ways through living Saints. (Kirpal Singh) {{ref|link2}}

* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} are [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], {{IPA|/p͡f/}} is bilabial-labiodental, whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} are [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=67}}
** {{IPA|/p͡f/}} occurs only in loanwords from Standard German.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}} Just as among many native German-speakers, it tends to be simplified to {{IPA|[f]}} word-initially. For example, ''Pflicht'' ('obligation') is pronounced {{IPA|[fliɕt]}}, or in careful speech {{IPA|[p͡fliɕt]}}.
** {{IPA|/v/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|w}} when it occurs after {{IPA|/k, t͡s, ʃ/}}, e.g. ''zwee'' {{IPA|[t͡sweː]}} ('two').{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=69}}
* {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are voiceless fortis {{IPA|[{{IPA link|p}}, {{IPA link|t}}, {{IPA link|k}}]}}. They are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}} in most positions,{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=68}} but not when {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/ʃ/}} precedes in the same syllable, or when another plosive or affricate follows.
** If followed by a vowel, the fortis stops are [[syllabification|moved to the onset of the following syllable]] and voiced to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}]}}; see [[#Word-final obstruents|below]].{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}}
* {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} are unaspirated lenis, more often voiceless {{IPA|[{{IPA link|p|b̥}}, {{IPA link|t|d̥}}, {{IPA link|k|ɡ̊}}]}} than voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=68}}{{fix|text=are the lenis affricates {{IPA|/d͡z, d͡ʒ/}} also voiceless?|date=June 2015}}
* {{IPA|/d͡z/}} as a phoneme appears only in a few words, such as ''spadséieren'' {{IPA|/ʃpɑˈd͡zɜɪ̯eʀen/}} ('to go for a walk'). {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} as a phoneme occurs only in loanwords from English.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}}
** Note that phonetic {{IPA|[d͡z]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} occur due to voicing of word-final {{IPA|/t͡s/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}; see [[#Word-final obstruents|below]].
* {{IPA|/s/}} does not occur word-initially except in French and English loanwords. (In the oldest loans from French it is often replaced with {{IPA|/t͡s/}}.) {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} only contrast between vowels.
* {{IPA|/ŋ, k, ɡ/}} are [[Velar consonant|velar]], {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is [[Uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas {{IPA|/j/}} is [[Palatal consonant|palatal]].{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=67}}
** The normal realization of {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is more often a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPAblink|ʀ}} than a fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}}. The fricative variant is used after short vowels before consonants. If the consonant is voiceless, the fricative is also voiceless, i.e. {{IPAblink|χ}}. Older speakers use the consonantal variant {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʀ}} ~ {{IPA link|ʁ}}]}} also in the word-final position, where younger speakers tend to vocalize the {{IPA|/ʀ/}} to a central vowel {{IPAblink|ə}} or {{IPAblink|ɐ}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=68}}
** {{IPA|/j/}} is frequently realized as {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, e.g. ''Juni'' {{IPA|[ˈjuːniː]}} or {{IPA|[ˈʒuːniː]}} ('June').{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=69}}
* {{IPA|/χ, ʁ/}} have two types of allophones: [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɕ}}, {{IPA link|ʑ}}]}} and uvular {{IPA|[χ, ʁ]}}. The latter occur after back vowels, whereas the former occur in all other positions.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=68}}
** The {{IPAblink|ʑ}} allophone appears only in a few words intervocalically, e.g. ''Spigel'' {{IPA|[ˈʃpiʑəl]}} ('mirror'), ''héijen'' {{IPA|[ˈhɜɪ̯ʑən]}} (inflected form of ''héich'' 'high'). Note that an increasing number of speakers do not distinguish between the alveolo-palatal allophones {{IPA|[ɕ, ʑ]}} and the postalveolar phonemes {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|pp=68–69}}
* {{IPA|/l/}} is always "clear" {{IPAblink|l}}, never "dark" ([[velarized]]) *{{IPAblink|ɫ}}.

In external [[sandhi]], syllable-final {{IPA|/n/}} is deleted unless followed by {{IPA|[n t d t͡s h]}}, with few exceptions. Furthermore, some unusual consonant clusters may arise post-lexically after [[clitic]]isation of the [[definite article]] ''d''' (for feminine, neuter and plural forms), e.g. ''d'Land'' {{IPA|[dlɑnt]}} ('the country') or ''d'Kräiz'' {{IPA|[tkʀæːɪ̯t͡s]}} ('the cross').{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}} Due to cluster simplification this article often disappears entirely between consonants.

===Word-final obstruents===
Phonetically, word-final {{IPA|/b, d, d͡ʒ, ɡ, v, z, ʒ, ʁ/}} are realized exactly the same as {{IPA|/p, t, t͡ʃ, k, f, s, ʃ, χ/}}. In most cases, they are realized the same as the main allophones of {{IPA|/p, t, t͡ʃ, k, f, s, ʃ, χ/}} (i.e. voiceless), but when the next word begins with a vowel and is pronounced without a pause, they are realized the same as the main allophones of {{IPA|/b, d, d͡ʒ, ɡ, v, z, ʒ, ʁ/}}, i.e. voiced and are [[Syllabification|resyllabified]], that is, moved to the onset of the first syllable of the next word (the same happens with {{IPA|/ts/}}, which becomes {{IPA|[d͡z]}}, and the non-native affricate {{IPA|/p͡f/}}, which is also voiced to {{IPAblink|bv|b͡v}}). For instance, ''se'''ch''' eens'' (phonemically {{IPA|/zeχ ˈeːns/}}) is pronounced {{IPA|[zəˈʑeːns]}},{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|pp=68, 72}} although this article transcribes it {{IPA|[zəʑ‿ˈeːns]}} so that it corresponds more closely to the spelling. Similarly, ''eng interessant Iddi'' {{IPA|[eŋ intʀæˈsɑnd‿ˈidi]}} ('an interesting idea').

===Pronunciation of the letter ''g''===

In Luxembourgish, the letter ''g'' has no fewer than nine possible pronunciations, depending both on the origin of a word and the phonetic environment. Natively, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ɡ]}} initially and {{IPA|[ʁ ~ ʑ]}} elsewhere, the latter being devoiced to {{IPA|[χ ~ ɕ]}} at the end of a morpheme. Words from French, English and (in a few cases) German have introduced {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (devoiced {{IPA|[k]}}) in other environments, and [[French orthography]]'s [[Hard and soft G|"soft ''g''"]] indicates {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (devoiced {{IPA|[ʃ]}}).

By the now very common mergers of {{IPA|[ʒ]}} and {{IPA|[ʑ]}}, as well as {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ɕ]}}, this number may be reduced to seven, however. The pronunciation {{IPA|[j]}} is also (generally) not obligatory but a common alternative to {{IPA|[ʑ]}} in the environment indicated below.

* The nasal vowels appear only in loanwords from French, whereas the oral front rounded vowels appear in loans from both French and German.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}}
* {{IPA|/i, iː, u, uː, o/}} are close to the corresponding cardinal vowels {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|o}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
** Some speakers may realize {{IPA|/o/}} as open-mid {{IPAblink|ɔ}}, especially before {{IPA|/ʀ/}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
* {{IPA|/e/}} has two allophones:
** Before velars: close-mid {{IPAblink|e}}, which for some speakers may be open-mid {{IPAblink|ɛ}} – this is especially frequent before {{IPA|/ʀ/}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
** All other positions: mid central vowel with variable rounding, but more often slightly rounded {{IPAblink|ə̹}} than unrounded {{IPAblink|ə̜}}. Contrary to Standard German, the sequence of {{IPA|[ə]}} and a sonorant never results in a syllabic sonorant; however, Standard German spoken in Luxembourg often also lacks syllabic sonorants, so that e.g. ''tragen'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈtʀaːɡən]}}, rather than {{IPA|[ˈtʀaːɡn̩]}} or {{IPA|[ˈtʀaːɡŋ̍]}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|pp=70–71}}{{sfnp|Dudenredaktion|Kleiner|Knöbl|2015|p=39}}
* {{IPA|/eː, oː/}} are higher than close-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e̝ː}}, {{IPA link|o̝ː}}]}} and may be even as high as {{IPA|/i, u/}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
** Before {{IPA|/ʀ/}}, {{IPA|/eː/}} is realized as open-mid {{IPAblink|ɛː}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
* The quality of {{IPA|/æ/}} matches the prototypical IPA value of the {{angle bracket|{{IPA|æ}}}} symbol ({{IPAblink|æ}}).{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
* {{IPA|/ɐ/}} appears only in unstressed syllables. Phonetically it is a near-open near-back unrounded vowel {{IPAblink|ɐ|ɐ̠}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}} It is similar to {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, though it is shorter and somewhat more central. Phonemically, it can be analyzed either as a marginal phoneme or a non-prevocalic sequence of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ʀ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is near-open {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̝}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=70}}
* {{IPA|/aː/}}, a phonological back vowel (the long counterpart of {{IPA|/ɑ/}}), is phonetically near-front {{IPAblink|a|a̠ː}}. Sometimes, it may be as front and as high as {{IPA|/æ/}} ({{IPAblink|æː}}), though without losing its length.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|pp=68, 70–71}}

* The ending points of the closing diphthongs tend to be fairly close, more like {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}]}} than {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=71}}
* The starting points of {{IPA|/ɜɪ̯, əʊ̯/}} are typically schwa-like {{IPAblink|ə}}, but the first element of {{IPA|/ɜɪ̯/}} may be more of a centralized front vowel {{IPAblink|e̞|ë̞}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=71}}
* The starting points of {{IPA|/æːɪ̯, æːʊ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɑɪ̯, ɑʊ̯/}} as well as {{IPA|/iə̯/}} and {{IPA|/uə̯/}} are similar to the corresponding short monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPA link|æ}}, {{IPA link|ɑ}}, {{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=71}}
** The first elements of {{IPA|/æːɪ̯, æːʊ̯/}} may be phonetically short {{IPA|[æ]}} in fast speech or in unstressed syllables.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=71}}
* The centering diphthongs end in the mid central unrounded area {{IPAblink|ə}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=71}}
* {{IPA|/oɪ̯/}} appears only in loanwords from Standard German.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}}

The {{IPA|/æːɪ̯ – ɑɪ̯/}} and {{IPA|/æːʊ̯ – ɑʊ̯/}} contrasts arose from a former lexical tone contrast: the shorter {{IPA|/ɑɪ̯, ɑʊ̯/}} were used in words with Accent 1, whereas the lengthened {{IPA|/æːɪ̯, æːʊ̯/}} were used in words with Accent 2 (see [[Pitch-accent language#Franconian dialects]].){{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72}}

Additional phonetic diphthongs arise after vocalisation of {{IPA|/ʀ/}}.{{sfnp|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=71}} These are {{IPA|[iːə̯, uːə̯, oːə̯, ɛːə̯]}}, with {{IPA|[iːɐ̯, uːɐ̯, oːɐ̯, ɛːɐ̯]}} as possible alternatives. However, the sequence {{IPA|/aːʀ/}} is realized the same as long {{IPA|/aː/}}, unless a vowel follows within the same word.

In loanwords from Standard German (such as ''[[Bad Dürkheim|Bad D'''ür'''kheim]]'' and ''[[Föhr|F'''öhr''']]'') {{IPA|[yːə̯]}} and {{IPA|[øːə̯]}} also occur, again with {{IPA|[yːɐ̯]}} and {{IPA|[øːɐ̯]}} as possible alternatives.

| é{{efn|Note that the letter {{angbr|é}} today represents the same sound as {{angbr|ë}} before {{angbr|ch}}. The ostensibly inconsistent spelling {{angbr|é}} is based on the traditional, now widely obsolete pronunciation of the sound represented by {{angbr|ch}} as a palatal {{IPA|[ç]}}. As this consonant is pronounced further back in the mouth, it triggered the use of the front allophone of {{IPA|/e/}} (that is {{IPA|[e]}}) as is the case before the velars ({{IPA|/k, ŋ/}}). Since the more forward alveolo-palatal {{IPA|[ɕ]}} has replaced the palatal {{IPA|[ç]}} for almost all speakers, the allophone {{IPA|[ə]}} is used as before any non-velar consonant. So the word ''mécht'' ('[he] makes'), which is now pronounced {{IPA|[məɕt]}}, used to be pronounced {{IPA|[meçt]}}; this is the reason for the spelling. The spelling {{angbr|mëcht}}, which reflects the contemporary pronunciation, is not standard.}}

'''Maite Dono''' (born 17 February 1969) is a Spanish singer-songwriter, poet, and actress.&lt;ref name=AELG&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aelg.org/Centrodoc/GetAuthorById.do?id=autor130 |title=María Teresa Dono Duro |publisher=[[Galician Writers Association]] |language=Galician |date=March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070425/http://www.aelg.org/Centrodoc/GetAuthorById.do?id=autor130 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maite Dono studied Philology at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] and graduated in Acting at the {{ill|Royal Superior School of Dramatic Art|es|Real Escuela Superior de Arte Dramático}} (RESAD) in Madrid.&lt;ref name=AELG/&gt;

In 1993 she began her theatrical activity as an actress. In 1998 she began her musical career with her first solo album: ''Corazón de Brief'', in homage to the folk singer-songwriter {{ill|Emilio Cao|es}}, in which she sang his works accompanied only by the piano of Manuel Gutiérrez.&lt;ref name=AELG/&gt; Dono's second album, titled ''O mar vertical'' (2001), was more personal and included her own songs. The work was accompanied by a book of poems of the same name. She also participated in the ''Cantigas de Nadal'' compilation CD. She has collaborated on projects with different artists from the Galician scene: jazz, accompanying Baldo Martínez and pianist [[Alberto Conde]], performing medieval [[cantiga]]s with Carlos Beceiro, and works with Roberto Somoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/coruna/2007/10/04/jazz-zarzuela-danza-flamenca-pulso-pua/0003_6199097.htm |title=Jazz, zarzuela, danza flamenca y pulso y púa |work=[[La Voz de Galicia]] |location=A Coruña |language=Spanish |date=5 October 2007 |access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also participated in musical works by Na Lúa and La Musgaña.

Since 2006 Dono has experimented poetically and musically with Intruso.&lt;ref name=AELG/&gt; Her latest contributions to music were in the Miño Project, from bassist Baldo Martínez,&lt;ref name=AELG/&gt; and a duet with Martínez on ''Sons Nús''.&lt;ref name=Sons&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.xunta.gal/hemeroteca/-/nova/004517/maite-dono-baldo-martinez-presentaron-nun-concerto-casa-galicia-sons-nus-primeiro |title=Maite Dono e Baldo Martínez presentaron nun concerto na Casa de Galicia 'Sons-Nús' primeiro disco do dúo |trans-title=Maite Dono and Baldo Martínez Present 'Sons-Nús' at the Casa de Galicia, the Duo's First Album |publisher=[[Xunta de Galicia]] |location=Madrid |language=Galician |date=7 June 2010 |access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she participated as an actress in the play ''Hamlet post scriptum'', directed by Roberto García de Mesa. She has written stories and theatrical works. She has several unpublished books, among which ''Poemas da Mamachán ou de cómo podrecen os fardos'' (in Galician) stands out. Her poems have been part of various anthologies and collective books. She has published in magazines such as ''Salamandria'', ''El Planeta'', ''Madrygal'', and ''Mester de Vandalía''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.fronterad.com/?q=nube-habitada-maite-dono |title=La Nube Habitada |trans-title=The Inhabited Cloud |work=Frontera D |language=Spanish |access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She resides in [[Santiago de Compostela]].

'''Mofu-Gudur''', or '''South Mofu''', is a [[Chadic language]] spoken in northern [[Cameroon]].  Dialects are Dimeo, Gudur, Massagal, Mokong, Njeleng, and Zidim.

Speakers use an estimated 1,500 conventionalized gestures.  These are used in story-telling and reciting history, but also in situations not conducive to speech; when children are born deaf, or people go deaf later in life, the members have a system of communication available that will allow them to communicate with the entire community.

'''Momel''' ('''''Mo'''''delling '''''mel'''''ody) is an algorithm developed by Daniel Hirst and Robert Espesser at the [[CNRS]] [[Laboratoire Parole et Langage]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.lpl.univ-aix.fr Lpl : Laboratoire Parole Et Langage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130107130900/http://www.lpl.univ-aix.fr/ |date=2013-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aix-en-Provence]]:
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; for the analysis and synthesis of intonation patterns.

==Purpose==
The analysis of raw [[fundamental frequency]] curves for the study of intonation needs to take into account the fact that speakers are simultaneously producing an intonation pattern and a sequence of syllables made up of segmental phones. The actual raw fundamental frequency curves which can be analysed acoustically are the result of an interaction between these two components and this makes it difficult to compare intonation patterns when they are produced with different segmental material. Compare for example the intonation patterns on the utterances ''It's for papa'' and ''It's for mama''.

==Algorithm==
The Momel algorithm attempts to solve this problem by factoring the raw curves into two components:

* a ''macromelodic component'' - modelled as a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[Spline (mathematics)|spline function]] . This is assumed to correspond to the global [[pitch contour]] of the utterance, and which is independent of the nature of the constituent phonemes. The underlying hypothesis is that this macromelodic component is, unlike raw fundamental frequency curves, both [[wiktionary:continuous|continuous]] and [[wikt:smooth|smooth]]. It corresponds approximately to what we produce if we hum an utterance instead of speaking it.
* a ''micromelodic component'' consisting of deviations from the macromelodic curve - called a ''micromelodic profile''. This residual curve is assumed to be determined entirely by the segmental constituents of the utterance and to be independent of the macromelodic component.

The quadratic spline function used to model the macromelodic component is defined by a sequence of target points, (couples &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;s, Hz&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; each pair of which is linked by two monotonic [[Parabola|parabolic]] curves with the [[spline knot]] occurring (by default) at the midway point between the two targets. The [[first derivative]] of the curve thus defined is zero at each target point and the two parabolas have the same value and same derivative at the spline knot. This in fact defines the most simple mathematical function for which the curves are both continuous and smooth.

==Implications==
On the one hand, two utterances "For Mama!" and "For Papa!" could thus be modelled with the same target points (hence the same macromelodic component) while "For Mama?" and "For Papa?" would also have the same target points but which would probably be different from those of the first pair.

On the other hand, the utterances "For Mama!" and "For Mama?" could be modelled with the same micromelodic profile but with different target point, while "For Papa!" and "For Papa?" would also have the same micromelodic profile but which would be different from those of the first pair.

The Momel algorithm derives what its authors refer to as a ''phonetic representation'' of an intonation pattern which is neutral with respect to speech production and speech perception since while not explicitly derived from a model of either production or perception it contains sufficient information to allow it to be used as input to models of either process. The relatively theory-neutral nature of the algorithm has allowed it to be used as a first step in deriving representations such as those of the [[Fujisaki model]] (Mixdorff 1999), [[ToBI]] (Maghbouleh 1999, Wightman &amp; al. 2000) or [[INTSINT]] (Hirst &amp; Espesser 1993, Hirst et al. 2000).

'''Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi''' ({{lang-gu|નાનાલાલ દલપતરામ કવિ}}) was a noted author and poet &lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography'', by Siba Pada Sen. Published by Institute of Historical Studies, 1972.''Page 217''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Nanalal+Dalpatram+Kavi#PPA129,M1 Gujarati Poetry] ''Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: An Anthology'', by K. M. George, [[Sahitya Akademi]], Published by Sahitya Akademi, 1992. {{ISBN|81-7201-324-8}}.''Page 129''.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gujarati literature]]. His name is sometimes spelt Nhanalal.

== Biography ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dalpatram-stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative stamp released by Indian post]] --&gt;
Nanalal was born on March 16, 1877 as the fourth son of [[Dalpatram]], the illustrious and popular poet of the second half of the last century, who was a pioneer of modern Gujarati Poetry. After passing his M.A., Nanalal served as a Headmaster of the Princes’ School at Sadra and later joined the [[Rajkumar College, Rajkot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sureshbjani.wordpress.com/2007/05/28/nhanalal/|title=ન્હાનાલાલ કવિ, Nhanalal Kavi|date=28 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became the Chief Justice of the Native State of Rajkot before becoming Education Officer for the whole of Kathiawad under the British Political Agency in 1918. He hailed [[Mahatma Gandhi]] on his 50th birthday as the Hermit of Gujarat in a memorable poem which he composed in 1919. When Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, Nanala Kavi responded to it by resigning his Government post in 1921, whereafter he lived in Ahmedabad, wholly devoted to writing. He breathed his last on January 9, 1946 in adverse pecuniary as a gifted poet of our time.

A romantic idealist in the tradition of the English romantic poets of the 19th century, Nanalal was a lyrical poet par excellence. He also wrote a good number of plays and attempted narrative poetry on epic scale, besides other literary forms like novel, short story, biography, essay and criticism. His books number more than eighty. Though he thoroughly imbibed tradition, he was a bold experimenter, true to his romantic spirit.

The rhythmic prose that he employed in his lyrical plays as well as in reflective and narrative poetry was an innovation of his in the direction of vers libre.

All his writing is characterized by a distinctive diction of his own. Unsurpassed in sweetness and charm, and by a consistent strain of high moral purpose coming from his poetic creed, seeing the poet as a prophet. Quite a good many lyrics of Nanalal are gems of Gujarati poetry which have enriched Gujarati literature for all time. His one of the Greatest prayers * ''Asatyo Mahethi'' is still being sung in the Schools of Gujarat. Indian Post and Telegraphs Department feels privileged to bring out a commemorative postage stamp in honour of this great son of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Alpha/N/NANALAL%20DALPATRAM%20KAVI Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi - Postage stamp - 1978] ''[[India Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay''', alternatively spelt as '''Sarat Chandra Chatterjee''' (15 September 1876 – 16 January 1938), was a prominent [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[novelist]] and short story [[writer]] from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Most of his works deal with the lifestyle, tragedy and struggle of the village people and the contemporary social practices that prevailed in Bengal. He remains the most popular, translated, adapted, and plagiarized Indian author of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A History of Indian Literature 1911-1956: Struggle for Freedom: Triumph and Tragedy{{!}}South Asia Books (1 September 1995)|url = https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=8172017987|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay was born on 15 September 1876,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=translation by Amitava|title=Selected novels of Sarat Chandra Chatterjee|date=2006|publisher=Xlibris|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1425721893|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPYBARXxxRsC|accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} in [[Debanandapur]], a small village two miles northwest of [[Bandel]] in [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]], [[West Bengal]].
[[File:Birth place of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of Sharat Chandra, Debanandapur, Hooghly]]

His father Motilal Chattopadhyay was an idler and dreamer who held irregular jobs. He could not finish novels and stories that he had started writing, but passed on his imagination and love of literature to Sarat Chandra. He, wife Bhuvanmohini, and their five children lived for many years in his father-in-law Kedarnath Gangopadhyay's house in [[Bhagalpur]], [[Bihar]].

Sarat Chandra was a daring, adventure-loving boy. Most of his schooling was in informal village schools called pathshalas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suresh|first1=edited by Sushama|title=Who's who on Indian stamps|date=1999|publisher=Mohan B.

(First Arts) examination or attend college due to lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The mortals of Devdas|url = http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/the-mortals-of-devdas/article6719027.ece|accessdate = 2015-08-10|first = BY J. N.|last = Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarat Chandra started writing in his early teens. After finishing his formal studies, he spent much of his time interacting with friends, acting in plays, and in playing sports and games. Several of his famous novels and stories were written during this period.&lt;ref name="sarat-rachanabali.nltr.org"/&gt;

In 1893, Sarat Chandra moved to [[Myanmar|Burma]]. Part of his novel, Srikanto, is based on his experiences in Burma. He got a temporary job in Burma Railway's audit office and later worked for many years in Burma's public works accounts office. While living in [[Rangoon, Myanmar|Rangoon]], he married his first wife Shanti. He was deeply hurt when his wife and one-year-old son died from plague. He married his second wife Mokshada (later renamed Hironmoyee) also in Rangoon and taught her to read and write. She outlived him by  23 years.

In 1916, Sarat Chandra moved backed to India and settled in [[Howrah]], near Kolkata. It is during this time that he improved his Sanskrit skills from "Kabyasri" Kishorimohan Mukherjee. He devoted himself to writing and established himself as one of India's major novelists and story writers. He was involved in India's freedom struggle and served as the president of Howrah district branch of Indian National Congress (1921-1936). [[University of Calcutta]] awarded him the prestigious Jagattarini medal. [[University of Dacca]] awarded him an honorary doctorate ([[D.Litt]].). On 2 Magh 1344 or 16 January 1938 he died, from cancer of the liver.

==House of Chattopadhyay==
{{Main|Sarat Chandra Kuthi}}After returning from Burma, Chattopadhyay stayed for 11 years in Baje Shibpur, Howrah. Then he made a house in the village of Samtabere. He spent the later years of his life as a novelist in Samtabere and in another house in Kolkata. His house in Samtabere is often called as ''Sarat Chandra Kuthi'' in the map of Samtabere or [[Samta (India)|Samta]], in the [[Howrah district]] of [[West Bengal]].

The two storied Burmese style house was also home to Sarat Chandra's brother, Swami Vedananda, who was a disciple of [[Belur Math]]. His and his brother's ''samadhi'' can still be seen there. The trees like bamboo, ''galoncho'' and the guava trees planted by the renowned author are still tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howrah.gov.in/Templates/tourist.html  House of Sarat Chandra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823221452/http://www.howrah.gov.in/Templates/tourist.html |date=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appreciation==
The phenomenal popularity of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay has been attested by some of the most prominent writers as well as literary critics across India in their writings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A History of Indian Literature 1911-1956: Struggle for Freedom: Triumph and Tragedy{{!}}South Asia Books (1 September 1995)|url = https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=8172017987|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the authors in [[Assam]] and [[Odisha]], at least before the Independence, read him admiringly in original Bengali; rest of India read him in translations in varying quality. Publishers were never tired of reprinting his works; he remains the most translated, the most adapted and the most plagiarized author.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His novels also reached a number of people through the medium of film and he is still an important force in Indian cinema. [[O. N. V. Kurup]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; writes "...Sarat Chandra's name is cherished as dearly as the names of eminent [[Malayalam]] novelists. His name has been a household word". Dr Mirajkar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A History of Indian Literature 1911-1956: Struggle for Freedom: Triumph and Tragedy{{!}}South Asia Books (1 September 1995)|url = https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=8172017987|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; informs "the translations of Sarat Chandra created a stir amongst the readers and writers all over [[Maharashtra]]. He has become a known literary personality in [[Maharashtra]] in the rank of any popular [[Marathi language|Marathi]] writers including H. N. Apte, V. S. Khandekar, N. S. Phadke and G. T. Madkholkar". Jainendra Kumar,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who considers that his contribution towards the creation and preservation of cultural India is second, perhaps, only to that of [[Gandhi]], asks a rhetorical question summing up Sarat Chandra's position and presumably the role of translation and inter-literary relationship: "Sarat Chandra was a writer in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]; but where is that [[Languages of India|Indian]] language in which he did not become the most popular when he reached it?"

==Films==
His works have been made into around fifty films in many Indian languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Particularly, his novel ''[[Devdas]]'' has been made into [[Devdas (disambiguation)|sixteen versions]], from Bengali, Hindi to Telugu. ''[[Parineeta (novel)|Parineeta]]'' has also been made twice. In 1957 ''[[Bardidi]]'' was made by director [[Ajoy Kar]]. ''[[Majhli Didi]]'' (1967) by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and ''[[Swami (1977 film)|Swami]]'' (1977), for which he was awarded the [[Filmfare Award for Best Story]], are other adaptations. Another famous film ''[[Chhoti Bahu]]'' (1971) is based on his novel ''Bindur Chhele''. His Novel 'Datta' was adapted into a Bengali film as [[Datta (film)]] in 1976 starring [[Suchitra Sen]] and [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] in the lead roles. The film [[Sabyasachi (film)|''Sabyasachi'' (film)]] was released in 1977 based on his work ''Pather Dabi''.
The other movies based on his novel were ''Nishkriti'', and ''[[Apne Paraye]]'' (1980) by [[Basu Chatterjee]], starring Amol Palekar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|author=Gulzar |authorlink=Gulzar |author2=Govind Nihalani, Saibal Chatterjee|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2003|isbn=81-7991-066-0 |page=337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telugu film ''[[Thodi Kodallu]]'' (1957) is also based on this novel. [[Gulzar]]'s 1975 film, ''[[Khushboo (1975 film)|Khushboo]]'' is majorly inspired by his work ''Pandit Mashay''. The 1961 Telugu film ''[[Vagdanam]]'' by [[Acharya Atreya]] is loosely based on his novel ''Datta''. Also the 2011 film ''Aalo Chhaya'' is based on his short story, ''Aalo O Chhaya''.

== Works ==
Sarat Chandra wrote novels, novellas, and stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Remembering Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, the ‘Awara Masiha’|url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/remembering-sarat-chandra-chattopadhyay-the-awara-masiha-on-his-139th-birth-anniversary/|website = The Indian Express|date = 2015-09-15|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to maturity at a time when the national movement was gaining momentum together with an awakening of social consciousness. His novel 'Pather Dabi' played an important role in the National Movement. Much of his writing bears the mark of the resultant turbulence of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saratchandra Chattopadhyay {{!}} Penguin Books India|url = http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/en/content/saratchandra-chattopadhyay|website = www.penguinbooksindia.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensitive and daring, his novels captivated the hearts and minds of innumerable readers both in Bengal and in the rest of India. His best known novels include ''Palli Samaj'' (1916), ''Charitrahin'' (1917), ''Devdas'' (1917), ''Nishkriti'' (1917), ''Datta'' (1918), ''Srikanta, Griha Daha'' (1920), ''Sesh Prashna'' (1929) and ''Sesher Parichay'' published posthumously (1939).

He wrote some essays including ''Narir Itihas'' (The History of Women) and ''Narir Mulya'' (The Value of Women). ''Narir Itihas'', which was lost in a house fire, contained a history of women on the lines of Spencer's Descriptive Sociology. While the second, ''Narir Mulya'' gives a theory of women's rights in the context of [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s arguments.&lt;ref name="Shandilya2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shandilya|first=Krupa|title=Intimate Relations: Social Reform and the Late Nineteenth-Century South Asian Novel|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/49217|year=2017|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-3424-9|page=46|via=[[Project MUSE]]}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental applications==
The speech shadowing technique is used in [[dichotic listening tests]]. The first one to apply this technique was E. Colin Cherry in 1953.{{sfn|Cherry|1953|p=976}} During dichotic listening tests, subjects are presented with two different messages, one in their right ear and one in their left. The participants are often asked to focus on only one of the different messages and this is where the speech shadowing technique is used. Participants are instructed to shadow the attended message by repeating it out loud with a delay of a few seconds between hearing a word and repeating the word. The speech shadowing technique is significant for these experiments because it ensures that the subjects are attending to the desired message.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B. (2011). ''Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.).'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Various other stimuli are then presented to the other ear, and subjects are afterwards queried on what they can recall from the other message.{{sfn|Cherry|1953|p=977-979}}

{{Quote|Few media persons have experienced the romance of journalism in as great a measure as T. J. S. George has. His journey from the newsroom of S.

While heading a Bihar daily, he earned the displeasure of the chief minister and became the first editor to be charged with sedition in free India. During a stint abroad, the highlight of which was the founding of [[Asiaweek]] in Hong Kong with himself as its Editor, he incurred the wrath of some of Southeast Asia's rulers.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. P.

'''Vitus Bering''' (6 October 1617 – 20 May 1675) was a Danish poet, historian, and Supreme Court justice. He was the great uncle of [[Vitus Bering]]. He served as [[Historiographer Royal (Denmark)|Historiographer Royal]] from 1649.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], Bering was the son of the city's mayor Peder Pedersen Bering and Maren Vitusdatter Brun. He graduated from [[Ciborg Cathedral School]] in 1635. He attracted attention for his poems in latin and went abroad on a royal scholarship, visiting the Netherlands and France.

==Career==
Bering was called home in 1751 to serve as steward for the scanian magnate Tage Thott's son Ove Thott. On this capacity, he went on a seven year journey to the Netherlands (Leiden 1639), France (Orléans 1640), Italy (Siena 1642, Rome and Padua 1647) and Germany (Strassburg and Basel 1648). He had become still more famous for. After their return to Denmark, he took a [[Master's degree]] at [[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen University]] in 1649 he immediately assumed a position as ''professor poeseos'' which had apparently been created specially for him. Later that same year he was appointed to professor in history at [[Sorø Academy]] and [[Historiographer Royal (Denmark)|Historiographer Royal]]. Im late 1651, he was granted permission to resign as professor.

is patron, Tahe Thott, made arrangements for a residence at [[Skabersjö Castle]] in Scania. In 1665, the king granted him the former archbishop's house Lundegård at [[Lund]]. The loss of Scania as a result of the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658 made Bering a Swedish subject. With support from [[Corfitz Ulfeldt]], he negotiated with Karl Gustaf for a position as Swedish Historiographer. He offered to describe Sweden's earliest history and declared his willingness to praise the Swedish king's victories in Poland in return for a canonicate in Lund but refused to describe the Swedish victories over Denmark. The Swedish king accepted his proposal in 1759 but Bering managed to sell his estate to bishop Vinstrup in Lund in 1660 and chose instead to leave Scania. He was well reseived in Denmark and became a member of skatkammerkollegiet on 11 November 1660. In 1669, or possibly earlier, he was also appointed to Supreme Court justice. He also kept the position as Historiographer and was also a popular writer of [[Occasional song|Occasional poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Litteratur/Digter/Vitus_Bering|title=Vitus Bering|language=Danish|publisher=[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Bering was tasked with writing a general history of Denmark, a work on reignof Christian IV and a work on resent events such as the [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|Assault on Copenhagen]] in 1659 and the institution of Absolutism in 1660. Neither of these were published proor to his death. His only publication was a critical work on England, ''Orosij Annilonis dissertalio de bello Dano-Anglico'' (1667), a defense of the Danish king's policy.

His work on the Assault on Copenhagen, ''Obsidio Hafniensis'', was published posthumously in 1676. His largest work, ''Floms Danicus'', an account of Danish history in latin reaching back to 1448, was not published until 1698. Its style is inspired by  that of [[Publius Annius Florus]]. Historically, it is of little interest, being a merely stylistical treatment of older sources. It was, however, praised in its own time.

Few of Bering's poems have survived. They represent the transition from Bording to [[Thomas Kingo]], who both were among his personal friends, in Danish Baroque poetry.

==Personal life==
[[File:Vitus Bering-2.jpg|thumb|Vitus Pederssen Bering's portrait, long mistakenly believed to belong to [[Vitus Bering|his nephew]]]]
Bering married Anne Nielsdatter, daughter of professor [[Niels Pedersen Aurilesius]], in [[Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen on 13 June 1652. She died in 157. On 15 September 1663, he then married  Gertrud Jørgensdatter, daughter of ''renteskriver'' Jørgen Hansen (1613–73) and Kirstine Knudsdatter (død 1702).

In 1666, Christian V granted him the [[Klampenborg]] area north of Copenhagen for life. Bering constructed a small country house on the land and named it [[Christiansholm, Gentofte Municipality|Christiansholm]] after the king. The king also granted him another country estate, probably [[Farumgård]] shortly prior to his death in 1675.

His nephew [[Vitus Bering|Vitus Ionassen Bering]], a sailor, entered Russian service, and, after an unremarkable military career, made himself a name as an explorer, commanding the [[First Kamchatka Expedition]] and [[Great Northern Expedition]], where he perished at 60 years of age. Their similar names and the lack of the latter man's reliable portraits has led to the lot of confusion, and, until the explorer's remains were rediscovered in 1991, the portrait of his uncle was believed to belong to him.

==History==

Use of the phrase "working hypothesis" goes back at least two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;1805, for example. See  [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;q=%22working%20hypothesis%22 p. 118] in ''The Monthly Review; or Literary Journal'' vol. XLVII, May–August 1805, London: Printed by Straban and Preston (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPkAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover its title page] for year printed as "M,DCCC,V").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] came to hold that an explanatory hypothesis is not only justifiable as a [[Abductive reasoning|tentative conclusion]] by its plausibility (by which he meant its naturalness and economy of explanation),&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, pp. 90–112. See both part III and part IV. Reprinted, including originally unpublished portion, in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 6, paragraphs 452–85, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 434–50, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; but also justifiable as a starting point by the broader promise that the hypothesis holds for research. This idea of justifying a hypothesis as potentially fruitful (at the level of research method), not merely as plausible (at the level of logical conclusions), is essential for the idea of a working hypothesis, as later elaborated by Peirce's fellow [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Dewey]].

Peirce held that, as a matter of research method, an explanatory hypothesis is judged and selected&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., Carnegie Application (L75, 1902, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, pp. 37–38. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'': {{quote|Methodeutic has a special interest in Abduction, or the inference which starts a scientific hypothesis. For it is not sufficient that a hypothesis should be a justifiable one. Any hypothesis which explains the facts is justified critically. But among justifiable hypotheses we have to select that one which is suitable for being tested , experiment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for research because it offers to economize and expedite the process of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), application to the Carnegie Institution, see MS L75.329-330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by being testable and by further factors in the economy of hypotheses: low cost, intrinsic value (instinctive naturalness and reasoned likelihood), and relations (caution, breadth, and incomplexity) among hypotheses, inquiries, etc. (as in the game of [[Twenty Questions]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1901 MS), "On The Logic of Drawing History from Ancient Documents, Especially from Testimonies", manuscript corresponding to an abstract delivered at the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] meeting of November 1901. Published in 1958 in ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 162–231; see 220. Reprinted (first half) in 1998 in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 75–114; see 107–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Century Dictionary Supplement'' definition of "working hypothesis"&lt;ref name=Century/&gt; reflects that perspective; Peirce may or may not have written it.&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep Peirce Edition Project (UQÀM) - in short]" from the Peirce Edition Project's branch at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM), which is working on ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings]]'' v. 7: Peirce's work on the ''Century Dictionary''. Peirce worked on the ''Century'' during the years between 1883 and 1909. Find "hypothesis" in PEP-UQÀM's list of words in Peirce's charge [http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=H under "H"]. "Pragmatism" was also in Peirce's charge (see [http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P under "P"], but [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] reported that PEP-UQÀM's director François Latraverse informed him that [[John Dewey]] actually wrote it (see [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/6 Ransdell's 2006 January 13 post] to peirce-l).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce seldom used the phrase "working hypothesis," but he once commented about a related kind of a hypothesis that it was "a hypothesis, which like the working hypothesis of a scientific inquiry, we may not believe to be altogether true, but which is useful in enabling us to conceive of what takes place."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 7, paragraph 534, from an undated manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; For Peirce the pragmatist, conceiving pragmatically of something meant conceiving of its effects in their conceivable implications as to informed practice in general including research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1878), "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA286pp. 286]–302. Reprinted widely, including ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' v. 1, pp. 109–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dewey]] used the concept of the working hypothesis as a pivotal feature in his theory of [[inquiry]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; working hypotheses were conceived by Dewey as neither true nor false but "provisional, working means of advancing investigation," which lead to the discovery of other unforeseen but "relevant" facts.&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt; Dewey's development of the concept of the working hypothesis emerged from his [[contextualism|contextualist]] [[epistemology]] in which absolute truth is unobtainable and replaced by "warranted assertability".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of science also shows that when hypotheses have been taken to be finally ''true'' and hence unquestionable, they have obstructed inquiry and kept science committed to doctrines that later turned out to be invalid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Dewey's view, the working hypothesis is generated, not directly as a testable statement of, but instead in order to "direct inquiry into channels in which new material, factual and conceptual, is disclosed, material which is more relevant, more weighted and confirmed, more fruitful, than were the initial facts and conceptions which served as the point of departure".&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt;

[[Abraham Kaplan]] later described the working hypothesis as "provisional or loosely formatted" theory or [[construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]].&lt;ref&gt;

Working hypotheses are constructed to facilitate inquiry; however, formal hypotheses can often be constructed based on the results of the inquiry, which in turn allows for the design of specific experiments whose data will either support or fail to support the formal hypotheses. In ''Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis'' Oppenheim and Putnam argued that unitary science, in which laws from one branch could be equally useful by others, could only be accepted tentatively without further empirical testing. Thus they argued:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We therefore think the assumption that unitary science can be attained through cumulative micro-reduction recommends itself as a working hypothesis. That is, we believe that it is in accord with the standards of reasonable scientific judgment to tentatively accept this hypothesis and to work on the assumption that further progress can be made in this direction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Putnam, the working hypothesis, therefore, represents a practical starting point in the design of an empirical research exploration.  A contrasting example of this conception of the working hypothesis is illustrated by the [[brain in a vat|brain-in-a-vat]] thought experiment. This experiment involves confronting the global skeptic position that we, in fact, are all just brains in vats being stimulated by a mad scientist to believe that our reality is real. Putnam argued that this proposition, however, rests on a "magical theory of reference" in which the existential evidence necessary to validate it is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the brain-in-a-vat proposition does not make for much of a hypothesis at all since there is no means to verify its truth. It does, however, provide a contrast for what a good working hypothesis would look like: one suited to culling potential existential evidence of the subject at hand.

A more concrete example would be that of [[conjecture]]s in [[mathematics]] – propositions which appear to be true but which are formally unproven. Very often, conjectures will be provisionally accepted as working hypotheses in order to [[Conjecture#Use of conjectures in conditional proofs|investigate its consequences]] and formulate [[conditional proof]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Application==
In the field of [[public administration]] working hypotheses are used as a [[conceptual framework]] for exploratory, applied, empirical research &lt;ref&gt;Baum, Kevin,2003. “Understanding the Line – Staff Relationship in Fire Service.” in ''Handbook of Conflict Management.’’ Edited by William Pammer and Jerri Killian. New York: Marcel Dekker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M., 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/3954/fulltext.pdf?sequence=1 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration]", ''Research in Public Administration’’.  Vol. 4:195-225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M. 2003. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3994 “A Pragmatic Teaching Philosophy]” ''Journal of Public Affairs Education’’.  Vol. 9, No. 1: 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Research projects that use working hypotheses use a [[deductive reasoning]] or logic of [[inquiry]]. In other words, the problem and preliminary theory are developed ahead of time and tested using evidence.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Working hypotheses (statements of expectation) are flexible and incorporate relational or non-relational statements. They are often used as ways to investigate a problem in a particular city or public agency.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, James T. 2010.

''Applied Research Projects’’, Texas State University.&lt;/ref&gt; 
These projects are a type of case study and use multiple methods of evidence collection.&lt;ref&gt;Yin, Robert. 2007. ''Case Study Research: Design and Methods’’. 4th edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; The working hypotheses are used as a device to direct evidence collection. As a result, working hypotheses are generally organized using sub-hypotheses, which specify in more detail the kinds of data or evidence needed to support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;
