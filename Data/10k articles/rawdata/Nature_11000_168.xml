'''{{mp|(163899) 2003 SD|220}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] and tumbling [[List of slow rotators (minor planets)|slow rotator]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]], which orbit the Sun between [[Venus]] and [[Earth]]. Its orbital period of 0.75 years means it revolves about 4 times for every 3 of the Earth. It was discovered on 29 September 2003, by astronomers of the [[Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] at [[Anderson Mesa Station]] near Flagstaff, Arizona.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9383">'''Agroecological restoration''' is the practice of re-integrating natural systems into agriculture in order to maximize [[sustainability]], [[ecosystem services]], and [[biodiversity]]. This is one example of a way to apply the principles of [[agroecology]] to an agricultural system.

== Overview ==
Farms cannot be restored to a purely natural state because of the negative economic impact on farmers, but returning processes, such as [[pest control]] to nature with the method of [[intercropping]], allows a farm to be more ecologically sustainable and, at the same time, economically viable. Agroecological restoration works toward this balance of sustainability and economic viability because conventional farming is not sustainable over the long run without the integration of natural systems and because the use of land for agriculture has been a driving force in creating the present world biodiversity crisis. Its efforts are complementary to, rather than a substitute for, [[biological conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;1.^ Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...biodiversity is just as important on farms and in fields as it is in deep river valleys or mountain cloud forests."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;[http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/51102/index.html  FAO, 15 October 2004]

Agriculture creates a conflict over the [[land use|use of land]] between wildlife and humans. Though the [[domestication]] of [[crop plants]] occurred 10,000 years ago, a 500% increase in the amount of pasture and crop land over the last three hundred years has led to the rapid loss of natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;^ Macdonald, Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the world community acknowledged the value of biodiversity in treaties, such as the 1992 landmark Convention on Biological Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;3.^ {{cite web | title=The future of agriculture depends on biodiversity | website=fao.org | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/51102/index.html | access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reintegration ==
The reintegration of agricultural systems into more natural systems will result in decreased yield and produce a more complex system, but there will be considerable gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services.

===Biodiversity===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] estimates that more than 40% of earth’s land surface is currently used for agriculture. And because so much land has been converted to agriculture, habitat loss is recognized as the driving force in [[biodiversity loss]] (FAO). This biodiversity loss often occurred in two steps, as in the [[American Midwest]], with the introduction of [[mixed farming]] carried out on small farms and then with the widespread use of [[mechanized farming]] and [[monoculture]] beginning after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;4. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The decline in farmland biodiversity can now be traced to changes in farming practices and increased agricultural intensity.&lt;ref&gt;5.^ Benton et al., 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing heterogeneity===
[[Heterogeneity]] (here, the diversity or complexity of the landscape) has been shown to be associated with species diversity. For example, the abundance of butterflies has been found to increase with heterogeneity.  One important part of maintaining heterogeneity in the spaces between different fields is made up of habitat that is not cropped, such as grass margins and strips, scrub along field boundaries, woodland, ponds, and fallow land. These seemingly unimportant pieces of land are crucial for the biodiversity of a farm. The presence of field margins benefits many different taxa: the plants attract herbivorous insects, will which attract certain species of birds and those birds will attract their natural predators. Also, the cover provided by the no cropped habitat allows the species that need a large range to move across the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;6.^ Benton et al., 183&amp;ndash;184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monoculture===
In the absence of cover, species face a landscape in which their [[habitat fragmentation|habitat is greatly fragmented]]. The isolation of a species to a small habitat that it can’t safely wander from can create a [[genetic bottleneck]], decreasing the resilience of the particular population, and be another factor leading to the decline of the total population of the species.&lt;ref&gt;7.^ Macdonald et al., Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt; Monoculture, the practice of producing a single crop over a wide area, causes fragmentation. In conventional farming, monoculture, such as with rotations of corn and soybean crops planted in alternating growing seasons, is used so that very high yields can be produced. After the mechanization of farming, monoculture became a standard practice in corn-beans rotation, and had broad implications for the long-term sustainability and biodiversity of farms. Whereas organic fertilizers, had kept the soil’s nutrients fixed to the ecosystem, the introduction of monoculture removed the nutrients and farmers compensated for that loss by using inorganic fertilizers. It is estimated that humans have doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the nitrogen cycle, mostly since 1975. As a result, the biological processes that controlled the way crops used the nutrients changed and the leached nitrogen from farmland soils has become a source of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;8. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic farming===
[[Organic farming]] is defined in different legal terms by different nations, but its main distinction from conventional farming is that it prohibits the use of synthetic chemicals in crop and livestock production. Often, it also includes diverse [[crop rotation]]s and provides non-cropped habitat for insects that provide ecosystem services, such as pest control and [[pollination]].&lt;ref&gt;9.^ Zhang et al., 255&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is merely encouraged that organic farmers follow those kinds of wildlife friendly practices, and as a result there is a great difference between the ecosystem services that similarly sized but distinctly managed organic farms provide.&lt;ref&gt;10.^ Hole D.G. et al., 114&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the 76 studies concerning the relationship between biodiversity and organic farming listed three practices associated with organic farming that accounted for the higher biodiversity counts found in organic farms as compared to conventional farms. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"1. ''Prohibition/reduced use of [[chemical pesticides]] and inorganic fertilizers'' is likely to have a positive impact through the removal of both direct and indirect negative effects on arable plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.&lt;br /&gt;
2. ''Sympathetic management of non-crop habitats and [[field margin]]s'' can enhance diversity and abundance of arable plants, invertebrates, birds and mammals.&lt;br /&gt;
3. ''Preservation of mixed farming'' is likely to positively impact farmland biodiversity through the provision of greater habitat heterogeneity at a variety of temporal and spatial scales within the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;11.^ Hole D.G. et al., 120&lt;/ref&gt;"

[[File:AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Air pollution from a [[Coke (fuel)|coking oven]].]]

'''Air pollution''' occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substances including gases, [[particulates]], and [[biomolecule|biological molecules]] are introduced into [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the [[natural environment|natural]] or [[built environment]]. Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.

Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst [[toxic]] pollution problems in the 2008 [[Blacksmith Institute]] World's Worst Polluted Places report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpolluted.org/ |title=Reports |publisher=WorstPolluted.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811155338/http://www.worstpolluted.org/| archivedate= 11 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2014 [[WHO|World Health Organization]] report, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide,&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/| title =7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution |publisher =[[WHO]]|date=25 March 2014| accessdate =25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an estimate roughly echoed by one from the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WorldEnergyOutlookSpecialReport2016EnergyandAirPollution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Study Links 6.5 Million Deaths Each Year to Air Pollution |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/27/business/energy-environment/study-links-6-5-million-deaths-each-year-to-air-pollution.html |date=26 June 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollutants==
{{main|Pollutant|Greenhouse gas}}

An air pollutant is a material in the air that can have adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem. The substance can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made.
Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are usually produced by processes such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other examples include [[carbon monoxide]] gas from motor vehicle exhausts or [[sulphur dioxide]] released from the factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. [[Ground level ozone]] is a prominent example of secondary pollutants. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before [[flue-gas desulphurization]] was installed, the emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulphur dioxide]].]]

[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&amp;Effects.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Schematic drawing, causes and effects of air pollution: (1) greenhouse effect, (2) [[Particulate pollution|particulate contamination]], (3) increased UV radiation, (4) acid rain, (5) increased ground-level ozone concentration, (6) increased levels of nitrogen oxides.]]
[[File:Thermal-oxidizer-rto.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal oxidiser]]s are air pollution abatement options for [[hazardous air pollutant]]s (HAPs), [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), and odorous emissions.]]
Substances emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include:
* [[Carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) – Because of its role as a [[greenhouse gas]] it has been described as "the leading pollutant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Pollution Causes, Effects, and Solutions|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/pollution/|publisher=National Geographic|date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the worst climate pollution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaidyanathan, ClimateWire|first1=Gayathri|title=The Worst Climate Pollution Is Carbon Dioxide|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-worst-climate-pollution-is-carbon-dioxide/|publisher=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the  atmosphere, essential for plant life and given off by the human [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Keith|title=How Carbon Dioxide Became a 'Pollutant'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124001537515830975|website=Wall Street Journal|date=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question of terminology has practical effects, for example as determining whether the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] is deemed to regulate {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barbalace|first1=Roberta C.|title=CO2 Pollution and Global Warming: When does carbon dioxide become a pollutant?|url=https://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/200611CO2globalwarming.html|date=November 7, 2006|website=environmentalchemistry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{CO2}} currently forms about 410 parts per million (ppm) of earth's atmosphere, compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/|website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and billions of metric tons of {{CO2}} are emitted annually by burning of [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are associated with electricity generation?|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=77&amp;t=11|accessdate = 2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{CO2}} increase in earth's atmosphere has been accelerating.&lt;ref name="MaunaMonthly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Mauna Loa CO2 record|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/full.html|website=Earth System Research Laboratory|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sulfur oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) – particularly sulphur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. SO2 is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulphur compounds, and their combustion generates sulphur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forms H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus [[acid rain]].[2] This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.
* [[Nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) – Nitrogen oxides, particularly [[nitrogen dioxide]], are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also produced during [[thunderstorms]] by [[electric discharge]]. They can be seen as a brown [[haze]] dome above or a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.
* [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO) – CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic yet non-irritating gas. It is a product of [[combustion]] of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of carbon monoxide let into our atmosphere. It creates a smog type formation in the air that has been linked to many lung diseases and disruptions to the natural environment and animals. In 2013, more than half of the carbon monoxide emitted into our atmosphere was from vehicle traffic and burning one gallon of gas will often emit over 20 pounds of carbon monoxide into the air.&lt;ref&gt;“Vehicles, Air Pollution, and Human Health.” Union of Concerned Scientists, www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/vehicles-air-pollution-and-human-health&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Volatile organic compounds]] (VOC) – VOCs are a well-known outdoor air pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced [[global warming]]. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]]. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.
* [[Particulates]], alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsroom.heart.org/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1029 |title=Evidence growing of air pollution's link to heart disease, death |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603014952/http://www.newsroom.heart.org/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1029 |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }} // American Heart Association. May 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; altered lung function and lung cancer. Particulates are related to respiratory infections and can be particularly harmful to those already suffering from conditions like [[asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Balmes, J.M. Fine, D. Sheppard Symptomatic bronchoconstriction after short-term inhalation of sulphur dioxide Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 136 (1987), p. 1117&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Radical (chemistry)#Persistent radicals|Persistent free radicals]] connected to airborne fine particles are linked to cardiopulmonary disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/pdf138201201.pdf |title=Newly detected air pollutant mimics damaging effects of cigarette smoke |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090722123751.htm |title=Infant Inhalation Of Ultra-fine Air Pollution Linked To Adult Lung Disease |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Toxic [[metal]]s, such as [[lead]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], especially their compounds.
* [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs) – harmful to the [[ozone layer]]; emitted from products are currently banned from use. These are gases which are released from air conditioners, refrigerators, aerosol sprays, etc. On release into the air, CFCs rise to the [[stratosphere]]. Here they come in contact with other gases and damage the [[ozone layer]]. This allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's surface. This can lead to skin cancer, eye disease and can even cause damage to plants.
* [[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) – emitted from agricultural processes. Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous. In the atmosphere, ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulphur to form secondary particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effect of Changing Background Emissions on External Cost Estimates for Secondary Particulates|publisher= Open environmental sciences|year=2008|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luc_Int_Panis/publication/250144316_The_Effect_of_Changing_Background_Emissions_on_External_Cost_Estimates_for_Secondary_Particulates/file/3deec51efe5018cd80.pdf?origin=publication_detail}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Odor]]s&amp;nbsp;— such as from garbage, sewage, and industrial processes
* [[Radioactive pollutants]] – produced by [[nuclear explosions]], nuclear events, war [[explosives]], and natural processes such as the [[radioactive decay]] of [[radon]].
Secondary pollutants include:
* Particulates created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in photochemical smog. [[Smog]] is a kind of air pollution. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulphur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by [[ultraviolet]] light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.
* [[Ground level ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) formed from NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and VOCs. Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a key constituent of the troposphere. It is also an important constituent of certain regions of the stratosphere commonly known as the Ozone layer. Photochemical and chemical reactions involving it drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere by day and by night. At abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities (largely the combustion of fossil fuel), it is a pollutant and a constituent of smog.
* [[Peroxyacetyl nitrate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) – similarly formed from NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and VOCs.
Minor air pollutants include:
* A large number of minor [[:Category:Hazardous air pollutants|hazardous air pollutants]]. Some of these are regulated in USA under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and in Europe under the Air Framework Directive
* A variety of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, which can attach to particulates

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the environment, to be capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potentially significant impacts on human health and the environment.

===Sources===
[[File:Human Fingerprint on Global Air Quality.webm|thumb|This video provides an overview of a NASA study on the human fingerprint on global air quality.]]
There are various locations, activities or factors which are
responsible for releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. These sources can be classified into two major categories.

====Anthropogenic (man-made) sources====
[[File:BurningOffFieldsInTheEveningInSouthGeorgia.jpg|thumb|[[Controlled burning]] of a field outside of [[Statesboro, Georgia|Statesboro]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in preparation for spring planting.]]
These are mostly related to the burning of multiple types of fuel.
* Stationary sources include smoke stacks of [[fossil fuel power station]]s (see for example [[environmental impact of the coal industry]]), manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass Pollution Basics|author1=David Pennise |author2=Kirk Smith |publisher=WHO|url=http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indoor air pollution and household energy|publisher=WHO and UNEP|year=2011|url=http://www.who.int/heli/risks/indoorair/indoorair/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mobile sources include [[Roadway air dispersion modeling|motor vehicles]], marine vessels, and aircraft.
* [[Controlled burn]] practices in agriculture and forest management. Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest.
* Fumes from [[paint]], [[hair spray]], [[varnish]], [[aerosol spray]]s and other solvents.  These can be substantial; emissions from these sources was estimated to account for almost half of pollution from [[volatile organic compounds]] in the Los Angeles basin in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/15/585886321/your-wall-paint-perfumes-and-cleaning-agents-are-polluting-our-air Wall Paint, Perfumes and Cleaning Agents Are Polluting Our Air]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Waste deposition in [[landfill]]s, which generate [[methane]]. Methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is also an [[asphyxiant]] and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement.

===Emission factors===
{{main|AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors}}
[[File:Beijing smog comparison August 2005.png|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Beijing]] air on a 2005-day after [[rain]] (left) and a smoggy day (right)]]
Air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that attempt to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per [[tonne]] of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.

There are 12 compounds in the list of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. Dioxins and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics, like open burning of plastics. These compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a wide range of industrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html |title=AP 42, Volume I |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100924132127/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html| archivedate= 24 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and many other countries have published similar compilations, as well as the [[European Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naei.org.uk/emissions/index.php |title=United Kingdom's emission factor database |publisher=Naei.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707144526/http://www.naei.org.uk/emissions/index.php |archivedate=2010-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-emission-inventory-guidebook-2009 |title=EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook — 2009 |publisher=Eea.europa.eu |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/environmental-pollution/ |title=Environmental Pollution |publisher=Theenvironmentalblog.org |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs6.htm |title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (reference manual) |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure==

Air pollution risk is a function of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated&lt;ref name="Daniel A. Vallero"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Air Pollution|author=Daniel A. Vallero|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|url=http://store.elsevier.com/Fundamentals-of-Air-Pollution/Daniel-Vallero/isbn-9780123736154/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, spending time in traffic, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.&lt;ref name="Daniel A. Vallero"/&gt; For some pollutants such as [[black carbon]], traffic related exposures may dominate total exposure despite short exposure times since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.&lt;ref name="Dons et al."&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dons| first = E|title = Impact of time-activity patterns on personal exposure to black carbon| journal = Atmospheric Environment| volume = 45  | issue = 21  | pages = 3594–3602  | year = 2011  | doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.03.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indoor air quality (IAQ)==
{{main|Indoor air quality}}

[[File:New Delhi Met Office, India 02.jpg|thumb|Air quality monitoring, [[New Delhi, India]].]]

A lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time. [[Radon]] (Rn) gas, a [[carcinogen]], is exuded from the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. Building materials including [[carpet]]ing and [[plywood]] emit [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) gas. Paint and solvents give off [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) as they dry. [[Lead]] paint can degenerate into [[dust]] and be inhaled. Intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of [[air freshener]]s, [[incense]], and other scented items. Controlled wood fires in stoves and [[fireplace]]s can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air, inside and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index130.html |title=Duflo, E., Greenstone, M., and Hanna, R. (2008) "Indoor air pollution, health and economic well-being". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using [[pesticide]]s and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation.

Carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of [[charcoal]] indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bucknell tent death: Hannah Thomas-Jones died from carbon monoxide poisoning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21059594|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] can result even from poorly-adjusted [[pilot light]]s. Traps are built into all domestic [[plumbing]] to keep sewer gas and [[hydrogen sulfide]], out of interiors. Clothing emits [[tetrachloroethylene]], or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after [[dry cleaning]].

Though its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of [[asbestos]] in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. [[Asbestosis]] is a chronic [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] medical condition affecting the tissue of the [[lung]]s. It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of [[lung cancer]]. As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524203454/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123072/AQG2ndEd_6_2_asbestos.PDF World Health Organization (WHO)], these may defined as; [[asbestosis]], ''lung cancer'', and ''[[Peritoneal Mesothelioma]]'' (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos).

Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. [[Pet]]s produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, [[House dust mite|dust mites]] in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, [[mold]] forms on walls and generates [[mycotoxins]] and spores, [[air conditioning]] systems can incubate [[Legionellosis|Legionnaires' disease]] and mold, and [[houseplant]]s, soil and surrounding [[gardens]] can produce [[pollen]], dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature.

==Health effects==
{{see also|Neuroplastic effects of pollution}}
In 2012, air pollution caused premature deaths on average of 1 year in Europe, and was a significant [[risk factor]] for a number of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]], including [[respiratory infection]]s, [[heart disease]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[stroke]] and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, [[asthma]] and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or [[emergency department]] visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.&lt;ref name="Daniel A. Vallero"/&gt;
The most common sources of air pollution include particulates, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. Children aged less than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;

===Mortality===
The [[World Health Organization]] estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; India has the highest death rate due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times International Weekly 2nd February 2014 'Beijing's Air Would Be Called Good In Delhi' by Gardiner Harris.&lt;/ref&gt; India also has more deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the World Health Organization. In December 2013 air pollution was estimated to kill 500,000 people in China each year.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Chen's claim was made in [[The Lancet]] (December 2013 issue) and reported in The Daily Telegraph 8th January 2014 p. 15 'Air pollution killing up to 500,000 Chinese each year, admits former health minister.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a positive correlation between [[pneumonia]]-related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] estimated in 2004 that a proposed set of changes in [[diesel engine]] technology (''Tier 2'') could result in 12,000 fewer ''premature mortalities'', 15,000 fewer [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], 6,000 fewer [[emergency department]] visits by children with asthma, and 8,900 fewer respiratory-related hospital admissions each year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/documents/nonroad-diesel/420f04032.pdf | title=Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule | work=EPA | date=May 2004 | accessdate=28 April 2015 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US EPA has estimated that limiting ground-level ozone concentration to 65 parts per billion, would avert 1,700 to 5,100 premature deaths nationwide in 2020 compared with the 75-ppb standard.

A new economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air pollution in the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and [[San Joaquin Valley]] of Southern California shows that more than 3,800 people die prematurely (approximately 14 years earlier than normal) each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards.

A study conducted in 1960–1961 in the wake of the [[Great Smog]] of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function ([[FEV1|FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences.&lt;ref&gt;Holland WW, Reid DD.

A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from [[lung cancer]] (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes&amp;nbsp;– increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the United States, despite the passage of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] in 1970, in 2002 at least 146 million Americans were living in [[Non-Attainment Area|non-attainment areas]]—regions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Committee on Environmental Health | title = Ambient Air Pollution: Health Hazards to Children | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | year = 2004 | pages = 1699–707 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-2166 | pmid = 15574638}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dangerous pollutants are known as the [[criteria pollutant]]s, and include ozone, [[particulate matter]], sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead.

According to a WHO report-2018,  polluted air  is a main cause poisoning millions of children under the age of 15 years and ruining their lives which resulting to death of some six hundred thousand children annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/387232-air-pollution-kills-600-000-children-who |title= Air pollution kills 600,000 children: WHO |publisher=The News International|date= 30 October 2018 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infants====

Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight. A 2014 WHO worldwide survey on maternal and perinatal health  found a statistically significant association between low birth weights (LBW) and increased levels of exposure to PM2.5. Women in regions with greater than average PM2.5 levels had statistically significant higher odds of pregnancy resulting in a low-birth weight infant even when adjusted for country-related variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischer|first=Nancy L.|last2=Merialdi|first2=Mario|last3=van Donkelaar|first3=Aaron|last4=Vadillo-Ortega|first4=Felipe|last5=Martin|first5=Randall V.|last6=Betran|first6=Ana Pilar|last7=Souza|first7=João Paulo|date=2014-04-01|title=Outdoor air pollution, preterm birth, and low birth weight: analysis of the world health organization global survey on maternal and perinatal health|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=122|issue=4|pages=425–30|doi=10.1289/ehp.1306837|issn=1552-9924|pmc=3984219|pmid=24508912}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is thought to be from stimulating inflammation and increasing oxidative stress.

A study by the University of York found that in 2010 exposure to PM2.5 was strongly associated with 18% of preterm births globally, which was approximately 2.7 million premature births. The countries with the highest air pollution associated preterm births were in South and East Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and West sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malley|first=Christopher S.|last2=Kuylenstierna|first2=Johan C.

The source of PM 2.5 differs greatly by region. In South and East Asia, pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of the wood and other biomass fuels used for cooking which are responsible for more than 80% of regional pollution. In the Middle East, North Africa and West sub-Saharan Africa, fine PM comes from natural sources, such as dust storms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The United States had  an estimated 50,000 preterm births associated with exposure to PM2.5 in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study performed by Wang, et al.  between the years of 1988 and 1991 has found a correlation between sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and total suspended particulates (TSP) and preterm births and low birth weights in Beijing. A group of 74,671 pregnant women, in four separate regions of Beijing, were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of sulphur Dioxide and TSP (along with other particulates).  The estimated reduction in birth weight was 7.3 g for every 100&amp;nbsp;µg/m3 increase in SO2 and 6.9g for each 100&amp;nbsp;µg/m3 increase in TSP. These associations were statistically significant in both summer and winter, although, summer was greater. The proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution, was 13%. This is the largest attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=X.|last2=Ding|first2=H.|last3=Ryan|first3=L.|last4=Xu|first4=X.|date=1997-05-01|title=Association between air pollution and low birth weight: a community-based study|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=105|issue=5|pages=514–20|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1469882|pmid=9222137|doi=10.1289/ehp.97105514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal stoves, which are in 97% of homes, are a major source of air pollution in this area.

Brauer et al. studied the relationship between air pollution and proximity to a highway with pregnancy outcomes in a Vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy. Exposure to NO, NO2, CO PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with infants born small for gestational age (SGA). Women living &lt;50meters away from an expressway or highway were 26% more likely to give birth to a SGA infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brauer|first=Michael|last2=Lencar|first2=Cornel|last3=Tamburic|first3=Lillian|last4=Koehoorn|first4=Mieke|last5=Demers|first5=Paul|last6=Karr|first6=Catherine|date=2008-05-01|title=A Cohort Study of Traffic-Related Air Pollution Impacts on Birth Outcomes|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=116|issue=5|page=680|doi=10.1289/ehp.10952|pmc=2367679|pmid=18470315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution, public health effects can be significant and costly, since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants. A study published in 2017 found that even in areas of the U.S. where ozone and PM2.5 meet federal standards, Medicare recipients who are exposed to more air pollution have higher mortality rates.&lt;ref name=NEJM0617&gt;{{cite journal |last=Qian |first=Di  |date=June 29, 2017 |title=Air Pollution and Mortality in the Medicare Population |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=376 |issue=26 |pages=2513–2522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 scientific study for the British Columbia Lung Association showed that a small improvement in air quality (1% reduction of ambient PM2.5 and ozone concentrations) would produce $29 million in annual savings in the [[Metro Vancouver]] region in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.lung.ca/pdf/health_and_air_quality_2005.pdf |title=2005 BC Lung Association report on the valuation of health impacts from air quality in the Lower Fraser Valley airshed |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515185052/http://www.bc.lung.ca/pdf/health_and_air_quality_2005.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is based on health valuation of lethal (death) and sub-lethal (illness) affects.

In a June 2014 study conducted by researchers at the [[University of Rochester]] Medical Center, published in the journal ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]'', it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]]. The study also shows that air pollution also affected [[short-term memory]], learning ability, and [[impulsivity]]. Lead researcher Professor Deborah Cory-Slechta said that "When we looked closely at the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]], we could see that the [[white matter]] that normally surrounds them hadn't fully developed. It appears that [[inflammation]] had damaged those [[brain cells]] and prevented that region of the brain from developing, and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in [[autism]], as well as in other [[neurodevelopmental disorders]]." Air pollution has a more significant negative effect on males than on females.&lt;ref name="Allen Liu Pelkowski Palmer p.

In 2015, experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic (situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. Researchers at the [[Harvard University]] and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in "conventional" and "green" buildings, as well as [[green buildings]] with enhanced ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) or [[carbon dioxide]], while keeping other factors constant. The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=New Study Demonstrates Indoor Building Environment Has Significant, Positive Impact on Cognitive Function |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=26 October 2015 | url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201510261604PR_NEWS_USPRX____NE38233&amp;feedID=600&amp;press_symbol=278490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHP&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Allen | first1=Joseph G. | last2=MacNaughton | first2=Piers | last3=Satish | first3=Usha | last4=Santanam | first4=Suresh | last5=Vallarino | first5=Jose | last6=Spengler | first6=John D. | title=Associations of Cognitive Function Scores with Carbon Dioxide, Ventilation, and Volatile Organic Compound Exposures in Office Workers: A Controlled Exposure Study of Green and Conventional Office Environments | journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | year=2015 | volume=124 | issue= 6| doi=10.1289/ehp.1510037 | pmid=26502459 | pmc=4892924 | pages=805–12 | url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/15-10037/ | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123194551/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/15-10037/ | archivedate=2016-01-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Air pollution increases the risk of dementia in people over 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/air-pollution-causes-jump-in-dementia-risk-study-suggests Air pollution linked to much greater risk of dementia] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural effects==
In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution by [[black carbon]] and ground level ozone had reduced crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2011 when compared to 1980 levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/03/india-air-pollution-cutting-crop-yields-by-almost-half India air pollution 'cutting crop yields by almost half'] The Guardian, 3 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic effects==
Air pollution costs the world economy $5 trillion per year as a result of productivity losses and degraded quality of life, according to a joint study by the [[World Bank]] and the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="documents.worldbank.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/781521473177013155/pdf/108141-REVISED-Cost-of-PollutionWebCORRECTEDfile.pdf|title=The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the Economic Case for Action|last=World Bank|first=|last2=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at University of Washington – Seattle|publisher=The World Bank|year=2016|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|page= xii|nopp=y|format=PDF}}&lt;!-- License: Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 3.0 IGO --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commondreams.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/08/making-case-clean-air-world-bank-says-pollution-cost-global-economy-5-trillion|title=Making Case for Clean Air, World Bank Says Pollution Cost Global Economy $5 Trillion|last=McCauley|first=Lauren|date=8 September 2016|work=|access-date=3 February 2018|publisher=[[Common Dreams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|first=|date=1 February 2018|title=The Rising Cost of Smog|url=&lt;!--paper copy, url not determined--&gt;|journal=Fortune|volume=|page=15|issn=0015-8259|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. One out of ten deaths in 2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse. The problem is even more acute in the [[developing world]]. "Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries."&lt;ref name="documents.worldbank.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="commondreams.org"/&gt; The report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution, including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report, and thus the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than $5 trillion.

==Historical disasters==
The world's worst short-term civilian pollution crisis was the 1984 [[Bhopal Disaster]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | author = Simi Chakrabarti | url =http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2004/s1257352.htm | title = 20th anniversary of world's worst industrial disaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked industrial vapours from the Union Carbide factory, belonging to Union Carbide, Inc., U.S.A. (later bought by [[Dow Chemical Company]]), killed at least 3787 people and injured from 150,000 to 600,000. The United Kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the December 4 [[Great Smog]] of 1952 formed over [[London]]. In six days more than 4,000 died and more recent estimates put the figure at nearer 12,000.&lt;ref name="EHP_112_1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = Michelle L. |author2=Michelle L.

==Alternatives to pollution==
There are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution:
* Areas downwind (over 20 miles) of major airports more than double ''total particulate emissions in air'', even when factoring in areas with frequent ship calls, and heavy freeway and city traffic like Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/05/29/.../air-pollution-from-lax-jets-worse-than-previously/{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aviation biofuel]] mixed in with jetfuel at a 50/50 ratio can reduce jet derived cruise altitude particulate emissions by 50-70%, according to a NASA led 2017 study (however, this should imply ground level benefits to urban air pollution as well).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/nasa-confirms-biofuels-reduce-jet-emissions|title=NASA Confirms Biofuels Reduce Jet Emissions|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ship propulsion and idling can be switched to much cleaner fuels like natural gas.  (Ideally a [[renewable natural gas|renewable source]] but not practical yet)
* Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using [[ground source heat pumps]] and [[seasonal thermal energy storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/interseasonal_heat_transfer.html|title=Interseasonal Heat Transfer™ – Seasonal Heat Storage – GSHC – Renewable Heat &amp; Renewable Cooling from ThermalBanks – Efficient Renewable Energy – Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems|website=www.icax.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electric power generation from burning fossil fuels can be replaced by power generation from nuclear and renewables.  For poor nations, heating and home stoves that contribute much to regional air pollution can be replaced by a much cleaner fossil fuel like natural gas, or ideally, renewables.
* Motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels, a key factor in urban air pollution, can be replaced by electric vehicles.  Though lithium supply and cost is a limitation, there are alternatives.  Herding more people into clean public transit such as electric trains can also help. Nevertheless, even in emission-free electric vehicles, rubber tires produce significant amounts of air pollution themselves, ranking as 13th worst pollutant in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenetlinks.com/science-news/science-updates/road-rubber/|title=Road Rubber |website=sciencenetlinks.com Science Updates – Science NetLinks|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reducing travel in vehicles can curb pollution. After Stockholm reduced vehicle traffic in the central city with a congestion tax, nitrogen dioxide and PM10 pollution declined, as did acute pediatric asthma attacks.&lt;ref name=NBERMar2018&gt;{{cite web |last=Simeonova |first=Emilia  |date=March 2018 |title=Congestion Pricing, Air Pollution and Children's Health |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24410 |website=National Bureau of Environmental Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anaerobic digestion|Biodigesters]] can be utilized in poor nations where [[slash and burn]] is prevalent, turning a useless commodity into a source of income.  The plants can be gathered and sold to a central authority that will break it down in a large modern biodigester, producing much needed energy to use.
* Induced humidity and ventilation both can greatly dampen air pollution in enclosed spaces, which was found to be relatively high inside subway lines due to braking and friction and relatively less ironically inside transit buses than lower sitting passenger automobiles or subways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/subway-air-pollution-damages-passenger-health/3007012.article|title=Subway air pollution damages passenger health|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reduction efforts==
Various air pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Fensterstock, J. A. Kurtzweg &amp; G. Ozolins (1971): "Reduction of Air Pollution Potential through Environmental Planning", ''Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association'', 21:7, 395–399&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fensterstock, Ketcham and Walsh, The Relationship of Land Use and Transportation Planning to Air Quality Management, Ed. George Hagevik, May 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; At its most basic level, [[land-use planning]] is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. In most developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population, as well as to protect the environment.

Because a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of [[fossil fuels]] such as [[coal]] and [[oil]], the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as [[wind power]], [[solar power]], [[hydro power]] which don't cause air pollution.&lt;ref name="Jacobson" /&gt; Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations),{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as [[string trimmer]]s, [[chainsaw]]s, and [[snowmobiles]]), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of [[hybrid vehicle]]s), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to [[electric vehicle]]s.

[[Titanium dioxide]] has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution. [[Ultraviolet]] light will release free electrons from material, thereby creating free radicals, which break up VOCs and NOx gases. One form is [[Superhydrophilicity|superhydrophilic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15694973|author=Jason Palmer|title='Smog-eating' material breaking into the big time|date= 12 November 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Tony Ryan (scientist)|Prof. Tony Ryan]] and [[Simon Armitage|Prof. Simon Armitage]] of [[University of Sheffield]] prepared a 10 meter by 20 meter-sized poster coated with microscopic, pollution-eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. Placed on a building, this giant poster can absorb the toxic emission from around 20 cars each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27425217|title=Nanotechnology to gobble up pollution|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very effective means to reduce air pollution is the [[Energy transition|transition]] to [[renewable energy]]. According to a study published in [[Energy and Environmental Science]] in 2015 the switch to [[100% renewable energy]] in the United States would eliminate about 62,000 premature mortalities per year and about 42,000 in 2050, if no biomass were used. This would save about $600 billion in [[health costs]] a year due to reduced air pollution in 2050, or about 3.6% of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;[[Mark Z. Jacobson]] et al.: ''100% clean and renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy road maps for the 50 United States''. In: ''[[Energy and Environmental Science]]'' (2015), {{DOI|10.1039/C5EE01283J}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control devices===

The following items are commonly used as pollution control devices in industry and transportation. They can either destroy [[contaminant]]s or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere.
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* '''Particulate control'''
** Mechanical collectors ([[Cyclonic separation|dust cyclones]], multicyclones)
** [[Electrostatic precipitator]]s An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air), using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream.
** [[Dust collector#Types of baghouses|Baghouses]] Designed to handle heavy dust loads, a dust collector consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust).
** [[Wet scrubber|Particulate scrubbers]] Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.

==Regulations==

[[File:Cairo in smog.jpg|thumb|Smog in [[Cairo]]]]
{{main|Air quality law}}
In general, there are two types of air quality standards. The first class of standards (such as the U.S. [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] and E.U. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090225/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/directive.htm Air Quality Directive]) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American [[Air Quality Index]]) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.

===Canada===
In Canada, air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the [[Air Quality Health Index (Canada)|Air Quality Health Index]] or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution.

The Air Quality Health Index or "AQHI" is a federal program jointly coordinated by [[Health Canada]] and [[Environment Canada]]. However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.

|}

As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as 'low', 'moderate', 'high' or 'very high', and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cas-aqhi/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=065BE995-1 |title=Environment Canada – Air Quality |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2007-09-10 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurement is based on the observed relationship of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ground-level Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and particulates (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) with mortality, from an analysis of several Canadian cities. Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems.

When developing the AQHI, Health Canada's original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: particulates, [[ozone]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO2), as well as [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation.

The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, [[pollen]], dust, heat or humidity.

===Germany===

[[TA Luft]] is the German air quality regulation.

==Hotspots==
{{Main|Toxic Hotspots}}

Air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air pollution hot spot|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/air-pollution-hot-spot.htm|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may be a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=David|title=Global Toll of Air Pollution: Over 3 Million Deaths Each Year|publisher=Switchboard NRDC|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|date=14 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061609/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dpettit/global_toll_of_air_pollution_o.html|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of [[social vulnerability]], including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.&lt;ref name="Drury"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drury|first=Richard|last2=Belliveau|first2=Michael|last3=Kuhn|first3=J Scott|last4=Shipra|first4=Bansal|title=Pollution Trading and Environmental Justice: Los Angeles' Failed Experiment in Air Pollution Policy|journal=Duke Environmental Law &amp; Policy Forum|date=Spring 1999|volume=9|issue=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Morello-Frosch 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morello-Frosch|first=Rachel|last2=Zuk|first2=Miriam|last3=Jerrett|first3=Michael|last4=Shamasunder|first4=Bhavna|last5=Kyle|first5=Amy D.|title=Understanding the Cumulative Impacts of Inequalities in Environmental Health: Implications for Policy|journal=Health Affairs|year=2011|volume=30|issue=5| doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153|pages=879–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities.&lt;ref name="Morello-Frosch 2011"/&gt; Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than whites and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones.&lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt; Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the US South and metropolitan areas of the US West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Mohai et al.|title=Racial and Socioeocnomic Disparities in Residential Proximity|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2009|volume=99|issue=3|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.131383|pages=S649–56|pmid=19890171|pmc=2774179 | last1 = Mohai | first1 = P | last2 = Lantz | first2 = PM | last3 = Morenoff | first3 = J | last4 = House | first4 = JS | last5 = Mero | first5 = RP}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2014}} Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=Steve|journal=Port Arthur, Texas: Public Housing Residents Breathe Contaminated Air from Nearby Refineries and Chemical Plants|title=Sacrifice Zones: The Front Lines of Toxic Chemical Exposure in the United States|publisher=MIT Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing urban air pollution==
In [[Europe]], Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which [[member states]] can "set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment . . . and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory".&lt;ref name=Europa1996&gt;{{cite web|last=Europa (1996)|title=Summaries of EU legislation – Management and quality of ambient air|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l28031a_en.htm|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2008 in the case Dieter Janecek v Freistaat Bayern CURIA, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that under this directive&lt;ref name=Europa1996/&gt; citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values.&lt;ref name="CURIA 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=European Court of Justice|first=CURIA (2008)|title=PRESS RELEASE No 58/08 Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-237/07|url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080058en.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This important [[case law]] appears to confirm the role of the EC as centralised regulator to European nation-states as regards air pollution control. It places a [[supranational]] legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution, furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen.

In 2010, the [[European Commission]] (EC) threatened the UK with legal action against the successive breaching of [[PM10]] limit values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Air quality: Commission sends final warning to UK over levels of fine particle pollution|url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/press_releases/2010/pr1055_en.htm|accessdate=7 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090215/http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/press_releases/2010/pr1055_en.htm|archivedate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government has identified that if fines are imposed, they could cost the nation upwards of £300 million per year.&lt;ref name="HoC Air Quality Report 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (2010)|title=Environmental Audit Committee – Fifth Report Air Quality|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmenvaud/229/22902.htm|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the [[Greater London Built-up Area]] remains the only UK region in breach of the EC's limit values, and has been given 3 months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the EU Air Quality Directive.&lt;ref name="Guardian2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Guardian|title=Britain fends off threat of £300m fine over London air pollution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/britain-300m-fine-london-air-pollution|accessdate=24 January 2015|newspaper=Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of London has dangerous levels of PM10 concentrations, estimated to cause 3000 deaths per year within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=London Assembly Environment Committee (2009) |title=Every Breath You Take |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/FINAL%20AIR%20QUALITY%20REPORT.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222163223/https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/FINAL%20AIR%20QUALITY%20REPORT.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the threat of EU fines, in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western [[congestion charge]] zone, which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC (2010)|title=Threat to sue over London congestion charge scrapping|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11928005|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these charges, [[Boris Johnson]], [[Mayor of London]], has criticised the current need for European cities to communicate with Europe through their nation state's [[central government]], arguing that in future "A great city like London" should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the European Commission regarding its air quality action plan.&lt;ref name="Guardian2011"/&gt;

This can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks, for example through transnational relations. Transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations,&lt;ref name="Kappen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Risse-Kappen|first=T|title=Bringing transnational relations back in: non-state actors, domestic structures, and international institutions|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=3–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing sub-national actors including cities and [[regions]] to partake in air pollution control as independent actors.

Particularly promising at present are global city partnerships.&lt;ref name="pattberg"/&gt; These can be built into networks, for example the [[C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group]], of which London is a member. The C40 is a public 'non-state' network of the world's leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions.&lt;ref name="pattberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pattberg|first=P|author2=Stripple, J.|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C40 has been identified as 'governance from the middle' and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roman|first=M|title=Governing from the middle: the C40 Cities Leadership Group|journal=Corporate Governance|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities "exchange information, learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions".&lt;ref name="pattberg"/&gt; A criticism of the C40 network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.

The '''''Bern Physiologus''''' (Bern, [[Burgerbibliothek of Berne|Burgerbibliothek]], ''Codex Bongarsianus'' 318) is a 9th-century [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] copy of the [[Latin language|Latin]] translation of the ''[[Physiologus]]''. It was probably produced at [[Reims]] about 825-850. It is believed to be a copy of a 5th-century manuscript.  Many of its miniatures are set, unframed, into the text block, which was a characteristic of late-antique manuscripts. It is one of the oldest extant illustrated copies of the ''Physiologus''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36660">[[File:Bird toy showing center of gravity.jpg|thumb|right|This toy uses the principles of center of mass to keep balance on a finger]]
In [[physics]], the '''center of mass''' of a distribution of [[mass]] in space is the unique point where the [[weight function|weighted]] relative [[position (vector)|position]] of the distributed mass sums to zero, or the point where if a force is applied it moves in the direction of the force without rotating. The distribution of mass is balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed mass defines its coordinates.  Calculations in [[mechanics]] are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass.
It is a hypothetical point where entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion.
In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newton's laws of motion.

In the case of a single [[rigid body]], the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the [[centroid]].  The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for [[wikt:hollow|hollow]] or open-shaped objects, such as a [[horseshoe]].  In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the [[planets]] of the [[Solar System]], the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system.

The center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in [[mechanics]] that involve masses distributed in space, such as the [[momentum|linear]] and [[angular momentum]] of planetary bodies and [[rigid body dynamics]]. In [[orbital mechanics]], the equations of motion of planets are formulated as [[point mass]]es located at the centers of mass.  The [[center of mass frame]] is an [[inertial frame]] in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.

==History==
The concept of "center of mass" in the form of the '''center of gravity''' was first introduced by the  great ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the [[torque]] exerted on a [[lever]] by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point—their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.{{sfn|Shore|2008|pp=9–11}}

Later mathematicians who developed the theory of the center of mass include [[Pappus of Alexandria]], [[Guido Ubaldi]], [[Francesco Maurolico]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=91–94}} [[Federico Commandino]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=94–96}} [[Simon Stevin]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=96–101}} [[Luca Valerio]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=101–106}} [[Jean-Charles de la Faille]], [[Paul Guldin]],{{sfn|Mancosu|1999|pp=56–61}} [[John Wallis]], [[Louis Carré (mathematician)|Louis Carré]], [[Pierre Varignon]], and [[Alexis Clairaut]].{{sfn|Walton|1855|p=2}}

[[Newton's second law]] is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in [[Euler's laws#Euler's first law|Euler's first law]].{{sfn|Beatty|2006|p=29}}

==Center of gravity==
The term "center of mass" is often used interchangeably with the term '''center of gravity''' because any uniform [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Gravitational field|gravitational field]] '''g''' acts on a system as if the mass ''M'' of the system were concentrated at the center of mass '''R'''. The center of gravity is defined as the average position of weight distribution, and mass and weight are technically different properties. However, because weight and mass are proportional, the center of gravity and center of mass refer to the same point of an object for almost all objects on and near Earth's surface. Generally, physicists prefer to use the term ''center of mass'', as an object has a center of mass whether or not it is under the influence of gravity. In addition, the term "center of gravity" refers to the single point associated with an object where the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]] can be considered to act,

Specifically, the [[gravitational potential energy]] is equal to the potential energy of a point mass ''M'' at '''R''',{{sfn|Goldstein|Poole|Safko|2001|p=185}} and the gravitational [[torque]] is equal to the torque of a force ''M'''''g''' acting at '''R'''.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}} In a uniform gravitational field, the center of mass is a center of gravity, and in common usage, the two phrases are used as synonyms.

In a non-uniform field, gravitational effects such as [[potential energy]], [[force]], and [[torque]] can no longer be calculated using the center of mass alone. In particular, a non-uniform gravitational field can produce a torque on an object, causing it to rotate. The center of gravity, an application point of the [[resultant force|resultant]] gravitational force, may not exist or not be unique; see [[centers of gravity in non-uniform fields]].

=={{anchor|Definition of center of mass}}Definition==
The center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the mean location of a distribution of mass in space.

===A system of particles===
In the case of a system of particles {{math|1=''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''i'' = 1, …, ''n'' }}, each with mass {{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} that are located in space with coordinates {{math|1='''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, …, ''n'' }}, the coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass satisfy the condition
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n m_i(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation for '''R''' yields the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \frac 1M \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \mathbf{r}_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|M}} is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.

===A continuous volume===
If the mass distribution is continuous with the density ρ('''r''') within a solid ''Q'', then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass '''R''' over the volume '''V''' is zero, that is
:&lt;math&gt;\iiint\limits_{Q} \rho(\mathbf{r})(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})dV = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Solve this equation for the coordinates '''R''' to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf R = \frac 1M \iiint\limits_{Q}\rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{r} dV,&lt;/math&gt;
where M is the total mass in the volume.

If a continuous mass distribution has uniform [[density]], which means ρ is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the [[centroid]] of the volume.{{sfn|Levi|2009|p=85}}

===Barycentric coordinates===
{{further|Barycentric coordinate system}}
The coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass of a two-particle system, ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', with masses ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R} = \frac{1}{m_1+m_2}(m_1 \mathbf{r}_1 + m_2\mathbf{r}_2).&lt;/math&gt;
Let the percentage of the total mass divided between these two particles vary from 100% ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and 0% ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' through 50% ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and 50% ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to 0% ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and 100% ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the center of mass '''R''' moves along the line from ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The percentages of mass at each point can be viewed as projective coordinates of the point '''R''' on this line, and are termed barycentric coordinates. Another way of interpreting the process here is the mechanical balancing of moments about an arbitrary point. The numerator gives the total moment that is then balanced by an equivalent total force at the center of mass. This can be generalized to three points and four points to define projective coordinates in the plane, and in space, respectively.

==={{anchor|Cluster straddling}}Systems with periodic boundary conditions===
For particles in a system with [[periodic boundary conditions]] two particles can be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs often in [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, ''x'' and ''y'' and/or ''z'', as if it were on a circle instead of a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The calculation takes every particle's ''x'' coordinate and maps it to an angle,
 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_i = \frac{x_i}{x_{max}} 2 \pi &lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the system size in the ''x'' direction and &lt;math&gt;x_i\in[0,x_{max})&lt;/math&gt;. From this angle, two new points &lt;math&gt;(\xi_i,\zeta_i)&lt;/math&gt; can be generated, which can be weighted by the mass of the particle &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; for the center of mass or given a value of 1 for the geometric center:
 
:&lt;math&gt; \xi_i = \cos(\theta_i)  &lt;/math&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta_i = \sin(\theta_i) &lt;/math&gt;
 
In the &lt;math&gt;(\xi,\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; plane, these coordinates lie on a circle of radius 1. From the collection of &lt;math&gt;\xi_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\zeta_i&lt;/math&gt; values from all the particles, the averages &lt;math&gt;\overline{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt; are calculated.

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\xi} = \frac 1M \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \xi_i,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\zeta} = \frac 1M \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \zeta_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|M}} is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.

These values are mapped back into a new angle, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, from which the ''x'' coordinate of the center of mass can be obtained:
 
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{\theta} = \mathrm{atan2}(-\overline{\zeta},-\overline{\xi}) + \pi &lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt; x_{com} = x_{max} \frac{ \overline{\theta}}{2 \pi} &lt;/math&gt;
 
The process can be repeated for all dimensions of the system to determine the complete center of mass. The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the mathematics to determine where the "best" center of mass is, instead of guessing or using [[cluster analysis]] to "unfold" a cluster straddling the periodic boundaries. If both average values are zero, &lt;math&gt;(\overline{\xi},\overline{\zeta}) = (0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\overline{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their ''x'' coordinates are mathematically identical in a [[periodic boundary conditions#Practical implementation: continuity and the minimum image convention|periodic system]].

==Center of gravity==
{{main|Centers of gravity in non-uniform fields}}

A body's center of gravity is the point around which the [[resultant force|resultant torque]] due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same.  However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical.  In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center.  Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque.

It is useful to note that the mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may, in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field.  In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed.

In the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration.  Referring to the mass-center as the center-of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably.

In physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass distribution can be seen by considering the [[resultant force|resultant]] of the gravity forces on a continuous body.  Consider a body Q of volume V with density ρ('''r''') at each point  '''r''' in the volume.  In a parallel gravity field the force '''f''' at each point '''r''' is given by,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) =  -dm\, g\vec{k}= -\rho(\mathbf{r})dV\,g\vec{k},&lt;/math&gt;
where dm is the mass at the point '''r''', g is the acceleration of gravity, and ''k'' is a unit vector defining the vertical direction.
Choose a reference point '''R''' in the volume and compute the [[resultant force]] and torque at this point,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \iiint\limits_{Q} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) =  \iiint\limits_{Q}\rho(\mathbf{r})dV( -g\vec{k}) = -Mg\vec{k},&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} =  \iiint\limits_{Q} (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})\times \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = \iiint\limits_{Q} (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})\times   (-g\rho(\mathbf{r})dV\vec{k} )= \left(\iiint\limits_{Q} \rho(\mathbf{r}) (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})dV \right)\times   (-g\vec{k}) .&lt;/math&gt;
If the reference point '''R''' is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then
:&lt;math&gt; \iiint\limits_{Q} \rho(\mathbf{r}) (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})dV =0, &lt;/math&gt;
which means the resultant torque '''T'''=0.  Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass.

By selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass.

==Linear and angular momentum==
The linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center of mass.  Let the system of particles ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''i''=1,...,''n'' of masses ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' be located at the coordinates '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with velocities '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Select a reference point '''R''' and compute the relative position and velocity vectors,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}_i = (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}) + \mathbf{R}, \quad \mathbf{v}_i = \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}) + \mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
The total linear and angular momentum vectors relative to the reference point '''R''' are
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R})\right) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\right) \mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})\times \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})\right)\times\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

If '''R''' is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v},\quad \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})\times \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the total mass of all the particles, '''p''' is the linear momentum, and '''L''' is the angular momentum

The [[Conservation of momentum|Law of Conservation of Momentum]] predicts that for any system not subjected to external forces the momentum of the system will remain constant, which means the center of mass will move with constant velocity.  This applies for all systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric fields, chemical reactions, and so on.  More formally, this is true for any internal forces that cancel in accordance with [[Newton's Third Law]].{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=117}}
&lt;!-- this section is redundant and may have some errors----
The total momentum for any system of particles is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{cm},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' indicates the total mass, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity of the center of mass.{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=116}} This velocity can be computed by taking the time derivative of the position of the center of mass. An analogue to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{cm},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' indicates the sum of all external forces on the system, and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the acceleration of the center of mass. It is this principle that gives precise expression to the intuitive notion that the system as a whole behaves like a mass of ''m'' placed at '''R'''.{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=117}}

The [[angular momentum]] vector for a system is equal to the angular momentum of all the particles around the center of mass, plus the angular momentum of the center of mass, as if it were a single particle of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=262}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_\mathrm{sys} = \mathbf{L}_\mathrm{cm} + \mathbf{L}_\mathrm{around\,cm}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a corollary of the [[parallel axis theorem]].{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=252}}
--&gt;

==Locating the center of mass==
{{Main|Locating the center of mass}}
[[File:Center gravity 2.svg|thumb|Plumb line method]]
The experimental determination of the center of mass of a body uses gravity forces on the body and relies on the fact that in the parallel gravity field near the surface of the earth the center of mass is the same as the center of gravity.

The center of mass of a body with an axis of symmetry and constant density must lie on this axis.  Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder.  In the same way, the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at the center of the sphere.  In general, for any symmetry of a body, its center of mass will be a fixed point of that symmetry.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}}

===In two dimensions===
An experimental method for locating the center of mass is to suspend the object from two locations and to drop [[plumb line]]s from the suspension points. The intersection of the two lines is the center of mass.{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|pp=119–120}}

The shape of an object might already be mathematically determined, but it may be too complex to use a known formula. In this case, one can subdivide the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|pp=19.1–19.2}} This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses.{{sfn|Hamill|2009|pp=20–21}}

A direct development of the [[planimeter]] known as an integraph, or integerometer, can be used to establish the position of the [[centroid]] or center of mass of an irregular two-dimensional shape. This method can be applied to a shape with an irregular, smooth or complex boundary where other methods are too difficult. It was regularly used by ship builders to compare with the required [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] and [[center of buoyancy]]  &lt;!---[[center of buoyancy]]---&gt;of a ship, and ensure it would not capsize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The theory and design of British shipbuilding. |page=3 of 14|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/amos-lowrey-ayre/the-theory-and-design-of-british-shipbuilding-hci/page-3-the-theory-and-design-of-british-shipbuilding-hci.shtml|work=Amos Lowrey Ayre|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sangwin|2006|p=7}}

===In three dimensions===
An experimental method to locate the three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass begins by supporting the object at three points and measuring the forces, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that resist the weight of the object, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W} = -W\mathbf{\hat{k}}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the vertical direction).  Let '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be the position coordinates of the support points, then the coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass satisfy the condition that the resultant torque is zero,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}= (\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{R})\times\mathbf{F}_1+(\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{R})\times\mathbf{F}_2+(\mathbf{r}_3-\mathbf{R})\times\mathbf{F}_3=0,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\times(-W\mathbf{\hat{k}})= \mathbf{r}_1\times\mathbf{F}_1+\mathbf{r}_2\times\mathbf{F}_2+\mathbf{r}_3\times\mathbf{F}_3. &lt;/math&gt;
This equation yields the coordinates of the center of mass '''R'''* in the horizontal plane as,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^* =-\frac{1}{W} \mathbf{\hat{k}}\times(\mathbf{r}_1\times\mathbf{F}_1+\mathbf{r}_2\times\mathbf{F}_2+\mathbf{r}_3\times\mathbf{F}_3).&lt;/math&gt;
The center of mass lies on the vertical line L, given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L}(t) = \mathbf{R}^* + t\mathbf{\hat{k}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass are determined by performing this experiment twice with the object positioned so that these forces are measured for two different horizontal planes through the object.  The center of mass will be the intersection of the two lines L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; obtained from the two experiments.

== Applications ==

=== Engineering designs ===

==== Automotive applications ====
Engineers try to design a [[sports car]] so that its center of mass is lowered to make the car [[car handling|handle]] better, that is maintaining traction while executing relatively sharp turns. 

The characteristic low profile of the U. S. military [[Humvee]] was designed in part to allow it tilt farther than taller vehicles, without a [[rollover]], because its low center of mass would stay over the space bounded the four wheels even at angles far from the horizontal.

==== Aeronautics ====
{{main|Center of gravity of an aircraft}}

The center of mass is an important point on an [[aircraft]], which significantly affects the stability of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the center of mass must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass is ahead of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly to the point of being unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing.{{sfn|Federal Aviation Administration|2007|p=1.4}} If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly so unstable that it is impossible to fly. The moment arm of the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] will also be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a [[stall (flight)|stalled]] condition.{{sfn|Federal Aviation Administration|2007|p=1.3}}

For [[helicopter]]s in [[hover (helicopter)|hover]], the center of mass is always directly below the [[rotorhead]]. In forward flight, the center of mass will move forward to balance the negative pitch torque produced by applying [[Helicopter flight controls#Cyclic|cyclic]] control to propel the helicopter forward; consequently a cruising helicopter flies "nose-down" in level flight.&lt;ref name="Helicopter Centre Of Mass"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ultraligero.net/Cursos/helicoptero/Introduccion_a_la_aerodinamica_del%20_helicoptero.pdf | title=Helicopter Aerodynamics | accessdate=23 November 2013 | pages=82 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324063720/http://www.ultraligero.net/Cursos/helicoptero/Introduccion_a_la_aerodinamica_del%20_helicoptero.pdf | archivedate=24 March 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Barycenter}}
[[File:orbit3.gif|thumb|180px|Two bodies orbiting their [[barycenter]] (red cross)]]

The center of mass plays an important role in astronomy and astrophysics, where it is commonly referred to as the ''barycenter''. The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies [[orbit]] each other. When a [[natural satellite|moon]] orbits a [[planet]], or a planet orbits a [[star]], both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body.{{sfn|Murray|Dermott|1999|pp=45–47}} For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the [[Earth]], but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710&amp;nbsp;km (1,062&amp;nbsp;miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the [[Sun]]. If the masses are more similar, e.g., [[Pluto#Charon|Pluto and Charon]], the barycenter will fall outside both bodies.

=== Body motion ===
[[File:Fosbury Flop English.gif|thumb|right|Estimated center of mass/gravity of a high jumper doing a Fosbury Flop. Note that it is below the bar in this position.]]

When [[high jump]]ers perform a "[[Fosbury Flop]]", they bend their respective bodies in such a way that they clear the bar while their respective centers of mass do not necessarily do so.{{sfn|Van Pelt|2005|p=185}} Because it is the height of the center of gravity (rather than of the highest part of the body) that constrains the minimum energy investment for "clearing" the bar, "snaking over" the bar can reduce the energy expended in propelling the body upward.

{{main|Kinesiology}}{{anchor|Kinesiology}}
In kinesiology and biomechanics, the center of mass is an important parameter that assists people in understanding their human locomotion. Typically, a human’s center of mass is detected with one of two methods: The [[reaction board]] method is a static analysis that involves the person lying down on that instrument, and use of their [[static equilibrium]] equation to find their center of mass; the segmentation method relies on a mathematical solution based on the [[physical law|physical principle]] that the [[summation]] of the [[torque]]s of individual body sections, [[relative motion|relative to]] a specified [[Axis of rotation|axis]], must equal the torque of the whole system that constitutes the body, measured [[relative torque|relative]] to the same axis.{{sfn|Vint|2003|pp=1–11}}

The '''Chivay obsidian source''' (15.6423° S, 71.5355° W, 4972 masl) is the geological origin of a chemical group of obsidian that is found throughout the south-central Andean highlands including southern [[Peru]] and western [[Bolivia]]. Chemical characterization studies using [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF) and [[Neutron Activation Analysis]] (NAA) have shown that the Chivay obsidian source, also known as the Cotallalli type or the Titicaca Basin type, makes up over 90% of the obsidian artifacts analyzed from the [[Lake Titicaca]] Basin.

[[Obsidian]] from the Chivay source is found in large and homogeneous nodules in a high altitude volcanic depression approximately ten km to the east of the town of [[Chivay]] in the [[Colca Canyon|Colca Valley]] (Caylloma, Arequipa, Peru).&lt;ref&gt;http://mapaspects.org/tripcevich-papers-presentations/tripcevich-phd-dissertation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumption sites ==

Obsidian from the Chivay source has been chemically identified among artifacts from over fifty sites in the south-central Andes.  Chivay obsidian was the predominant type found at the Archaic and Formative site of [[Jiskairumoko]] on the western side of Lake Titicaca in the Ilave Valley of [[Puno, Peru]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}

'''Compost''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|p|ɒ|s|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|p|oʊ|s|t}}) is [[organic matter]] that has been [[Biodegradation|decomposed]] in a process called composting. This process [[Recycling|recycles]] various organic materials otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a [[soil conditioner]] (the ''compost'').

Compost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).

At the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting also can take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or "windrows" are used. [[Earthworm]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].

==Fundamentals==
[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]
[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]
[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]

Composting is an aerobic method (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&amp;dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0hs-ly-HUAhXhllQKHQJdDfw4ChDoAQgjMAA|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a [[humus]]-like material, known as compost, which is a good [[fertilizer]] for plants. Composting requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, development of internal biological heat.

Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:
*Carbon — for energy; the microbial [[oxidation]] of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/science.html |title=Composting for the Homeowner - University of Illinois Extension |publisher=Web.extension.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.
* Nitrogen — to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon. High nitrogen materials tend to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.
* Oxygen — for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.
* Water — in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name="uiuc-mat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.uiuc.edu/homecompost/materials.html|title=Composting for the Homeowner -Materials for Composting|work=uiuc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures (135°-160° Fahrenheit / 50° - 70° Celsius) until the materials are broken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=Rattan|date=2003-11-30|title=Composting|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX3408100055/GVRL?u=txshracd2597&amp;sid=GVRL&amp;xid=54515a57|journal=Pollution A to Z|language=English|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.&lt;ref name="tilley2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|year=|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|pages=|chapter=Septic tanks|chapter-url=http://ecompendium.sswm.info/sanitation-technologies/septic-tank?group_code=s}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot container composting]] focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a C/N ratio of ~30 or less. Above 30 the substrate is nitrogen starved, below 15 it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haug|first1=Roger|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MX_jbemODmAC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=ammonium+phosphate+compost&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wd_Hoja9j7&amp;sig=eQyp3hBsnuomYm-TDd0mZp9eD5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwB2oVChMI2eWJ-P7eyAIVwsImCh3xvAfz#v=onepage&amp;q=ammonium%20phosphate%20compost&amp;f=false|publisher=CRC Press,|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klickitatcounty.org/SolidWaste/fileshtml/organics/compostCalc.htm Klickitat County WA, USA Compost Mix Calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117112037/http://www.klickitatcounty.org/solidwaste/fileshtml/organics/compostCalc.htm |date=17 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1 and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts, and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation.

===Microorganisms===
With the proper mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, micro-organisms are able to break down organic matter to produce compost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/dont-bag-it/chapter-1-the-decomposition-process/|title=Chapter 1, The Decomposition Process|publisher=aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asthegardenturns.com/composting/how-to-make-compost-at-home/|title=How to Make Compost at Home|publisher=asthegardenturns.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composting process is dependent on micro-organisms to break down organic matter into compost. There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/microorg.html|title=Composting - Compost Microorganisms|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bacteria]]- The most numerous of all the [[microorganism]]s found in compost.  Depending on the phase of composting, [[mesophile|mesophilic]] or [[thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria may predominate.
* [[Actinobacteria]]- Necessary for breaking down paper products such as newspaper, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], etc.
* [[Fungi]]- [[molds]] and [[yeast]] help break down materials that bacteria cannot, especially [[lignin]] in woody material.
* [[Protozoa]]- Help consume bacteria, fungi and micro organic particulates.
* [[Rotifers]]- Rotifers help control populations of bacteria and small protozoans.

In addition, [[earthworm]]s not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.

===Phases of composting===
Under ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt;

*An initial, mesophilic phase, in which the decomposition is carried out under moderate temperatures by mesophilic microorganisms.
*As the temperature rises, a second, thermophilic phase starts, in which the decomposition is carried out by various thermophilic bacteria under high temperatures.
*As the supply of high-energy compounds dwindles, the temperature starts to decrease, and the mesophiles once again predominate in the maturation phase.

===Slow and rapid composting===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
There are many proponents of rapid composting that attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional, slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf|title=The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that in fact modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are sceptical that there is a "super-charged" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}

Both sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Pathogen removal===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
Composting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]]. The "[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]" in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s.

Thermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]].

== Materials that can be composted ==

Composting is a process used for [[resource recovery]]. It can [[recycle]] an unwanted by-product from another process (a [[waste]]) into a useful new product.

=== Organic solid waste (green waste) ===
[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by [[thermophile|thermophilic]] microorganisms.]]

Composting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable [[landfill]] space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].

Co-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].&lt;ref name="tilley2" /&gt;

Industrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].

===Animal manure and bedding===
On many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human excreta and sewage sludge ===
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
[[Human excreta]] can also be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, like in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].

[[Urine]] can be put on compost piles or directly used as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/iys/docs/san_lib_docs/ESR2web%5B1%5D.pdf Stockholm Environment Institute - EcoSanRes - Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Feces in Crop Production]&lt;/ref&gt; Adding urine to compost can increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs. Urine usually does not smell for long, particularly when it is fresh, diluted, or put on [[sorbent]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Uses==
{{Main|Uses of compost}}
Compost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'', or a porous, absorbent material that holds moisture and soluble minerals, providing the support and [[nutrient]]s in which plants can flourish, although it is rarely used alone, being primarily mixed with [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulture | volume = 644 | issue = | pages = 417–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Itävaara et al.

==Composting technologies==

Various approaches have been developed to handle different ingredients, locations, throughput and applications for the composted product.

=== Industrial-scale  ===
Industrial-scale composting can be carried out in the form of [[in-vessel composting]], [[aerated static pile composting]], [[vermicomposting]], or [[windrow composting]], and takes place in most Western countries now.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== {{anchor|Vermicompost}}Vermicomposting ===
[[File:Worm.bin.jpg|right|thumb|Worms in a bin being harvested]]
{{Main|Vermicompost}}
[[Vermicompost]] is the product or process of organic material degradation using various species of worms, usually [[Eisenia fetida|red wigglers]], [[Enchytraeus buchholzi|white worms]], and earthworms, to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste (excluding meat, dairy, fats, or oils), bedding materials, and vermicast. Vermicast, also known as [[worm castings]], worm humus or worm manure, is the end-product of the breakdown of organic matter by [[species]] of earthworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwoodsforestgardens.blogspot.com/2009/01/paper-on-invasive-european-worms.html |title=Paper on Invasive European Worms |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composting toilets{{anchor|Humanure}} ===
{{Main|Composting toilet}}
[[File:TerraNova Sitzdichtung (6211343544).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Composting toilet]] with a seal in the lid in Germany]]

A [[composting toilet]] collects human excreta. These are added to a compost heap that can be located in a chamber below the toilet seat. [[Sawdust]] and straw or other carbon rich materials are usually added as well. Some [[compost toilet|composting toilet]]s do not require water or electricity; others may. If they do not use water for flushing they fall into the category of [[dry toilets]]. Some composting toilet designs use [[urine diversion]], others do not. When properly managed, they do not smell. The composting process in these toilets destroys pathogens to some extent. The amount of pathogen destruction depends on the temperature (mesophilic or thermophilic conditions) and composting time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Stenström, T.A., Seidu, R., Ekane, N., Zurbrügg, C. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1236 Microbial exposure and health assessments in sanitation technologies and systems] - EcoSanRes Series, 2011-1. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Stockholm, Sweden, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Composting toilets with a large composting container (of the type [[Clivus Multrum]] and derivations of it) are popular in United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. They are available as commercial products, as designs for self builders or as "design derivatives" which are marketed under various names.

==== {{anchor|Bokashi}}Bokashi ====
[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. The aerated base is just visible through the food scraps and bokashi bran.]]
Bokashi is a method that uses a mix of microorganisms to cover food scraps or wilted plants to decrease smell, reduce the risk of attracting pests and increase the speed of decomposition. Bokashi (ぼかし) is Japanese for "shading off" or "gradation." It derives from the practice of [[Japan]]ese farmers centuries ago of covering food scraps with rich, local soil that contained the microorganisms that would ferment the material.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The technique relies on [[effective microorganism]]s. These essential microbes are typically added to the food scraps using an inoculated bokashi bran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bokashiliving.com/how-to-bokashi-compost/ "How to bokashi compost"], Retrieved 5 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper fermented in a lactobacillus culture can be substituted for bokashi bran for a successful bokashi bucket.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The first stage of bokashi preserves the ingredients in a [[lactic acid]] [[fermentation]]. The acid is a natural disinfectant, used as such in household cleaning products, so that what enters the second (digestion) stage is essentially free of microbial pathogens.

==History==
[[File:Compost Basket.jpg|thumb|upright|Compost Basket]]
Composting as a recognized practice dates to at least the early Roman Empire, and was mentioned as early as [[Cato the Elder]]'s 160 BCE piece ''[[De Agri Cultura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/A*.html|title=De Agri Cultura|last=Cato|first=Marcus|publisher=|year=160 BCE|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=37.2; 39.1|chapter-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, composting involved piling organic materials until the next planting season, at which time the materials would have decayed enough to be ready for use in the soil. The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.

Composting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting|publisher=illinois.edu|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in [[Wels]], Austria in the year 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Welser Anzeiger vom 05. Januar 1921, 67. Jahrgang, Nr. 2, S. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Early frequent citations for propounding composting within farming are for the German-speaking world [[Rudolf Steiner]], founder of a farming method called [[biodynamics]], and [[Annie Francé-Harrar]], who was appointed on behalf of the government in [[Mexico]] and supported the country 1950–1958 to set up a large humus organization in the fight against erosion and [[soil degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gETbAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=Annie+Franc%C3%A9-Harrar+compost&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KGGp_ou_Lz&amp;sig=Y2rPv3kDWVelR4Qm4Q1gqJDjoxQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipkqW92ofZAhVk6IMKHaRyAB8Q6AEIRTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Annie%20Franc%C3%A9-Harrar%20compost&amp;f=false|title=A History of the Garden in Fifty Tools|last=Laws|first=Bill|date=2014-06-19|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226139937|location=|pages=86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English-speaking world it was [[Sir Albert Howard]] who worked extensively in [[India]] on sustainable practices and [[Lady Eve Balfour]] who was a huge proponent of composting. Composting was imported to America by various followers of these early European movements by the likes of [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] (founder of Rodale Organic Gardening), E.E. Pfeiffer (who developed scientific practices in biodynamic farming), [[Paul Keene]] (founder of Walnut Acres in Pennsylvania), and [[Scott Nearing|Scott]] and [[Helen Nearing]] (who inspired the [[back-to-the-land movement]] of the 1960s). Coincidentally, some of the above met briefly in India - all were quite influential in the U.S. from the 1960s into the 1980s.

=== Terminology ===
The term "composting" is used worldwide with differing meanings.

"Humanure" is a [[portmanteau]] of ''human'' and ''manure'', designating human excrement ([[feces]] and [[urine]]) that is recycled via composting for agricultural purposes. The term was first used in 1994 in a book by Joseph Jenkins that advocates the use of this [[organic material|organic]] soil amendment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com|title=The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last=Jenkins|first=J.C.|publisher=Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9644258-3-5|location=Grove City, PA|page=255|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term humanure is used by compost enthusiasts in the United States but not widely used elsewhere.&lt;ref name="tilley2" /&gt; Because the term "humanure" has no authoritative definition it is subject to various uses. News reporters may use the term also for [[sewage sludge]] or [[biosolids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourottawaregion.com/feature/article/1224782--humanure-dumping-sickens-homeowner|title='Humanure' dumping sickens homeowner|author=Courtney Symons|date=13 October 2011|work=YourOttawaRegion|publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd.|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contact guidance''' refers to a phenomenon for which the orientation of cells and [[stress fiber]]s is influenced by geometrical patterns such as nano/microgrooves on substrates, or collagen fibers in gels and soft tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=J.

Nevertheless, the biological processes underlying contact guidance are still unclear.

==Contact guidance on two-dimensional substrates==
When cells are seeded onto flat substrates, they generally exhibit a random orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LOESBERG|first1=W|last2=TERIET|first2=J|last3=VANDELFT|first3=F|last4=SCHON|first4=P|last5=FIGDOR|first5=C|last6=SPELLER|first6=S|last7=VANLOON|first7=J|last8=WALBOOMERS|first8=X|last9=JANSEN|first9=J|title=The threshold at which substrate nanogroove dimensions may influence fibroblast alignment and adhesion|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2007|volume=28|issue=27|pages=3944–3951|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.030|pmid=17576010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamers|first1=Edwin|last2=Frank Walboomers|first2=X.|last3=Domanski|first3=Maciej|last4=te Riet|first4=Joost|last5=van Delft|first5=Falco C.M.J.M.|last6=Luttge|first6=Regina|last7=Winnubst|first7=Louis A.J.A.|last8=Gardeniers|first8=Han J.G.E.|last9=Jansen|first9=John A.|title=The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition|journal=Biomaterials|date=April 2010|volume=31|issue=12|pages=3307–3316|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.034|pmid=20122723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when substrates have topographical patterns, the orientation of cells cultured on these surfaces is influenced by these geometrical cues. For example, if a substrate has nano/microgrooves running parallel to each other, cells orient along the direction of these topographical patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamers|first1=Edwin|last2=Frank Walboomers|first2=X.|last3=Domanski|first3=Maciej|last4=te Riet|first4=Joost|last5=van Delft|first5=Falco C.M.J.M.|last6=Luttge|first6=Regina|last7=Winnubst|first7=Louis A.J.A.|last8=Gardeniers|first8=Han J.G.E.|last9=Jansen|first9=John A.|title=The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition|journal=Biomaterials|date=April 2010|volume=31|issue=12|pages=3307–3316|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.034|pmid=20122723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=den Braber|first1=E.T.|last2=de Ruijter|first2=J.E.|last3=Smits|first3=H.T.J.|last4=Ginsel|first4=L.A.|last5=von Recum|first5=A.F.|last6=Jansen|first6=J.A.|title=Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation and orientation on substrata with uniform parallel surface micro-grooves|journal=Biomaterials|date=June 1996|volume=17|issue=11|pages=1093–1099|doi=10.1016/0142-9612(96)85910-2|pmid=8718969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walboomers|first1=X.

A similar effect can be obtained when cells are cultured on flat surfaces with lines of proteins printed on top (to which cells can adhere), interspersed by repellent lines; also in that case, cells align along the patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimerman|first1=B.|last2=Arnold|first2=M.|last3=Ulmer|first3=J.|last4=Blümmel|first4=J.|last5=Besser|first5=A.|last6=Spatz|first6=J.P.|last7=Geiger|first7=B.|title=Formation of focal adhesion-stress fibre complexes coordinated by adhesive and non-adhesive surface domains|journal=IEE Proceedings - Nanobiotechnology|date=2004|volume=151|issue=2|pages=62|doi=10.1049/ip-nbt:20040474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alford|first1=Patrick W.|last2=Nesmith|first2=Alexander P.|last3=Seywerd|first3=Johannes N.|last4=Grosberg|first4=Anna|last5=Parker|first5=Kevin Kit|title=Vascular smooth muscle contractility depends on cell shape|journal=Integrative Biology|date=2011|volume=3|issue=11|pages=1063|doi=10.1039/c1ib00061f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been observed that the phenomenon of contact guidance on microgrooved surfaces is influenced by the groove width. For instance, osteoblast-like cells align along the nanogrooves only for grooves wider than 75&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamers|first1=Edwin|last2=Frank Walboomers|first2=X.|last3=Domanski|first3=Maciej|last4=te Riet|first4=Joost|last5=van Delft|first5=Falco C.M.J.M.|last6=Luttge|first6=Regina|last7=Winnubst|first7=Louis A.J.A.|last8=Gardeniers|first8=Han J.G.E.|last9=Jansen|first9=John A.|title=The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition|journal=Biomaterials|date=April 2010|volume=31|issue=12|pages=3307–3316|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.034|pmid=20122723}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar behavior has been observed with other cell types, such as fibroblasts, which align along these topographical patterns when the grooves are wider than 150&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LOESBERG|first1=W|last2=TERIET|first2=J|last3=VANDELFT|first3=F|last4=SCHON|first4=P|last5=FIGDOR|first5=C|last6=SPELLER|first6=S|last7=VANLOON|first7=J|last8=WALBOOMERS|first8=X|last9=JANSEN|first9=J|title=The threshold at which substrate nanogroove dimensions may influence fibroblast alignment and adhesion|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2007|volume=28|issue=27|pages=3944–3951|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.030|pmid=17576010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, too large values of groove widths can also decrease the effects of contact guidance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charest|first1=Joseph L.|last2=García|first2=Andrés J.|last3=King|first3=William P.|title=Myoblast alignment and differentiation on cell culture substrates with microscale topography and model chemistries|journal=Biomaterials|volume=28|issue=13|pages=2202–2210|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.020|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.020|pmid=17267031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact guidance in three-dimensional structures==
Cells can orient in response to contact guidance also when located inside three-dimensional structures, such as collagen gels, scaffolds, and soft tissues. For those conditions, it has been demonstrated that the geometrical cues provided by collagen or scaffold fibers are able to influence the orientation of cells. For example, it has been observed that endothelial colony forming cells align along the direction of the fibers present in electrospun scaffolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fioretta|first1=Emanuela S.|last2=Simonet|first2=Marc|last3=Smits|first3=Anthal I. P. M.|last4=Baaijens|first4=Frank P. T.|last5=Bouten|first5=Carlijn V. C.|title=Differential Response of Endothelial and Endothelial Colony Forming Cells on Electrospun Scaffolds with Distinct Microfiber Diameters|journal=Biomacromolecules|date=10 March 2014|volume=15|issue=3|pages=821–829|doi=10.1021/bm4016418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the collagen fibers present in collagen gels and soft tissues can influence cell alignment, providing the most important stimulus in terms of cell orientation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foolen|first1=Jasper|last2=Deshpande|first2=Vikram S.|last3=Kanters|first3=Frans M.

==Potential of contact guidance for tissue engineering==
Recent research has highlighted the importance of cellular alignment for the mechanical properties and functionality of the prostheses developed using the principles of tissue engineering. Currently, scientists are investigating the mechanisms and potential of contact guidance to control cellular alignment, which would ultimately lead to the control of their cellular forces and certain aspects of collagen remodeling.

==Biological mechanisms determining contact guidance==
Many researchers have formulated hypotheses on the biological mechanisms determining contact guidance. In general, cellular contraction, stress fibers and focal adhesions seem to play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barocas|first1=V. H.|last2=Tranquillo|first2=R. T.|title=An Anisotropic Biphasic Theory of Tissue-Equivalent Mechanics: The Interplay Among Cell Traction, Fibrillar Network Deformation, Fibril Alignment, and Cell Contact Guidance|journal=Journal of Biomechanical Engineering|date=1997|volume=119|issue=2|pages=137|doi=10.1115/1.2796072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vigliotti|first1=A.|last2=McMeeking|first2=R. M.|last3=Deshpande|first3=V. S.|title=Simulation of the cytoskeletal response of cells on grooved or patterned substrates|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=11 March 2015|volume=12|issue=105|pages=20141320–20141320|doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.1320|pmc=4387521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Feng|last2=Yuan|first2=Lin|last3=Huang|first3=He|last4=Chen|first4=Hong|title=Phenomenon of "contact guidance" on the surface with nano-micro-groove-like pattern and cell physiological effects|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|date=13 September 2009|volume=54|issue=18|pages=3200–3205|doi=10.1007/s11434-009-0366-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a computational model has been developed that is able to simulate the re-alignment of cells and stress fibers on top of grooved surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vigliotti|first1=A.|last2=McMeeking|first2=R. M.|last3=Deshpande|first3=V. S.|title=Simulation of the cytoskeletal response of cells on grooved or patterned substrates|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=11 March 2015|volume=12|issue=105|pages=20141320–20141320|doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.1320|pmc=4387521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, it has been supposed that cells, once seeded, form focal adhesions on top of the ridges and not above the grooves. Once formed, the focal adhesions produce a signal that starts to diffuse into the cell inducing stress fiber assembly. At this point, there are two different possibilities, depending on the groove size. On the one hand, when the groove size is small, the intracellular signal produced by focal adhesions on the ridges can homogenously reach all locations in the cell. In that case, the stress fiber assembly is isotropic, and these fibers can pull on their surroundings in an isotropic fashion, and consequently the resulting cell shape is isotropic (without a preferred alignment). On the other hand, when the groove size is relatively large, the intracellular signal cannot reach the locations of the cell situated on top of the grooves, as diffusion is limited. As a result, stress fibers form only close to the ridges, and these acto-myosin bundles pull on their surroundings anisotropically. Due to the anisotropic cellular contraction, stress fibers and cells align along the direction of the microgrooves. Further experiments are necessary to validate this theory.

The '''Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests''' is a [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] found in the middle elevations of the eastern [[Himalayas]], including parts of [[Nepal]], [[India]], and [[Bhutan]]. These forests have an outstanding richness of wildlife.

==Setting==
This ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|83100|sqkm|mi2|abbr=on}} and constitutes a band of temperate broadleaf forests lying on steep mountain slopes of the Himalayas between approximately {{convert|2000|and|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It extends from the [[Kali Gandaki River]] in [[Nepal]] across [[Sikkim]] and [[West Bengal]] in India, [[Bhutan]], and the Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The temperate broadleaf forests transition into the [[Himalayan subtropical pine forests]] and the [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]] at lower elevations, and into the [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] at higher elevations. This area receives over 2000 mm of rainfall per year, mostly falling from May to September during the [[monsoon]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Flora==
The Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests are diverse and species-rich, with a great diversity (of [[oak]]s and [[rhododendron]]s in particular) and many endemic species including plants of [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalayan]], [[Indochina|Indochinese]], Himalayan, [[Eastern Asiatic Region|Eastern Asiatic]] and even [[Gondwana]]n origin. 

The ecoregion has two broad forest types: evergreen and deciduous. Evergreen forests are characterized by oaks ''(Quercus'' spp.), chiefly ''[[Quercus lamellosa]],'' together with ''[[Lithocarpus pachyphylla]], [[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Rhododendron falconeri]], [[Rhododendron thomsonii]], [[Michelia excelsa]], [[Michelia cathcartii]], [[Bucklandia populnea]], [[Symplocos cochinchinensis]], [[Magnolia]]'' spp., ''[[Cinnamomum]]'' spp., and ''[[Machilus]]'' spp. The many rhododendron species include more than fifty in Sikkim and another sixty in Bhutan. 

In the deciduous forests meanwhile the predominant tree species are Himalayan maple (''[[Acer campbellii]]''), ''[[Juglans regia]]'', ''[[Alnus nepalensis]]'', ''[[Betula alnoides]]'', ''[[Betula utilis]]'', and ''[[Echinocarpus dasycarpus]]''.

Finally in Eastern Nepal there are wetter areas dominated by a mixture of ''[[Magnolia campbellii]]'', ''Acer campbellii'' and ''[[Osmanthus suavis]]'' along with Himalayan hazel (''[[Corylus ferox]]'').

==Fauna==
The forests are home to over 500 species of bird some of which migrate to the higher Himalayas in the hot summer. There are twelve near-endemic bird species as well as the strictly endemic [[rufous-throated wren-babbler]]. A number of bird species especially [[pheasant]], [[tragopan]] and [[hornbill]] are easily threatened by changes to their habitat and those found here include the globally threatened [[rufous-necked hornbill]] (''Aceros nipalensis''), [[Sclater's monal]] (''Lophophorus sclateri''), [[white-bellied heron]] (''Ardea insignis''), [[Blyth's tragopan]] (''Tragopan blythii'') and [[Ward's trogon]] (''Harpactes wardi'').

There are four endemic or near-endemic mammals including Gee's golden langur (''[[Trachypithecus geei]]'') which is found north of the [[Brahmaputra River]] between the [[Sankosh River|Sankosh]] and [[Manas River]]s. Other endemic mammals are Hodgson's giant flying squirrel (''[[Petaurista magnificus]]''), Namdapha flying squirrel (''[[Biswamoyopterus biswasi]]'') and Brahma white-bellied rat (''[[Niviventer brahma]]''), while [[endangered species]] found here include a population of [[Bengal tiger]]s adapted to higher mountain slopes and having a high conservation priority. Other endangered species include [[takin]] (''Budorcas taxicolor'') and [[Himalayan serow]] (a subspecies of ''Capricornis sumatraensis'') as well as the [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] Mandelli's mouse-eared bat (''[[Myotis sicarius]]''), [[Assam macaque]] (''Macaca assamensis''), [[stump-tailed macaque]] (''Macaca arctoides''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), [[back-striped weasel]] (''Mustela strigidorsa''), [[clouded leopard]] (''Neofelis nebulosa''), and [[Irrawaddy squirrel]] (''Callosciurus pygerythrus''). The area also includes patches of [[fir]] forest with a bamboo undergrowth that are home to the endangered [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens'').

==Conservation==
Most of the forest is intact as these are steep inaccessible slopes, although the ''[[Quercus lanata]]'' forests of the lower elevations are vulnerable to clearance, while the upper slopes are liable to be used for livestock grazing, especially in more densely populated Nepal. Protected areas include [[Namdapha National Park]] and Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh, [[Makalu Barun National Park]] in Nepal, and parts of [[Thrumshingla National Park|Thrumshingla]], [[Jigme Dorji National Park|Jigme Dorji]], and [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park]]s and [[Kulong Chu Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Bhutan. There are plans to create corridors of protection linking some of these areas in Bhutan and in India. The area around Namdapha National Park has been increasingly settled by [[Chakma people|Chakma]] refugees from Bangladesh. Another threat is the plan to build a dam on the [[Dihing River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests|id=im0401}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area of importance that is currently unprotected is [[Mount Phulchowki]] in the [[Kathmandu valley]].

===Protected areas===
In 1997, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] identified 15 protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately {{convert|5800|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} that includes 7% of the ecoregion's area.&lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, E.; Dinerstein, E.; Loucks, C.

==History==
[[File:GeologicalSurveyIndia1870.jpg|thumb|left|Earliest members of the [[Geological Survey of India|GSI]] and [[British Geological Survey|BGS]] in 1851.]]

As early as 1836–51, the [[British monarchy|British crown]] [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] decided to set up the geological survey to explore the [[British Indian Empire]] under the British geologist [[David Hiram Williams|David Williams]] who later founded the [[Geological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0007/bsb00079409/images/ copy in Bavarian State Library (also Horizontal and Vertical Sections)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of Pakistan from the [[British Indian Empire]], the [[Geological Survey of India]]'s north-west branch, staff and assets were evolved into creating to Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP).&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Richard J. Ward|title=The challenge of development : theory and practice in human resource management|year=2008|publisher=AldineTransaction|location=Piscataway, N.J.|isbn=978-0202362267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQypxEfL8XEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=geological+survey+of+pakistan+1947#v=onepage&amp;q=geological%20survey%20of%20pakistan%201947&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the GSP had consisted of only six geologist and two [[chemist]]s under British scientist H.L. Crookshank, who was at that time was the most senior scientist working.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; Immediately, H.L. Crookshank was appointed first director general of GSP which he remained until 1955. Under Crookshank, the technical staff was increased to 30 geoscientists in 1948.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In its formative years, the GSP did the pioneering work in hydrogeology and [[Engineering geology|engineering]] but the efforts were transfer to engineering units of the [[Pakistan Military|military]].&lt;ref name="archives of the GSP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff editor |title=Historical perspective |url=http://gsp.gov.pk/about/historical_prespective.html |work=Govt.

Due to these activities, it increased the operational, scientific capabilities, and expansion of facilities of the GSP by 1956; it became one of the pioneering scientific institution of the government.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In 1955, English geologist, E.R. Gee, took over the GSP who initiated a massive expansion programme for GSP, including engineering, photogeology sections, as well as systematic publications journals were established. In 1959, the construction of new headquarters in [[Quetta]] was completed with Dr. N.M. Khan becoming first native GSP's director.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

[[File:Paktopo de.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Topographic map]] of Pakistan.]]

By 1956, the GSP worked extremely close with the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS); the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] established multimillion-dollar work laboratories and facilities in all over the country and cooperation continued until 1970.&lt;ref name="Department of Interior, Department of State and Geological Survey of Pakistan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calkins|first=James A.|author2=S.

H. Nayyar|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the GSP helped established country's [[Universities in Pakistan|universities]] to teach geoscience and engineering as part of their university programmes.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

In the 1970s, due to its expansion and scientific capabilities, the GSP was instrumental in carrying out work on nuclear geography, when its scientists frequently visited in various [[Mountain ranges of Pakistan|mountain ranges]] of the country.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; The GSP notably carried out an ingenious work on nuclear geology and geography as part of the clandestine [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic bomb project]], and played an integral role in the selection of the test sites.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saleh|first=R.

In 1992, The GSP announced the discovery of the [[Thar coalfield|huge deposits]] of [[coal]] at [[Thar Desert]] in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="Embassy of Pakistan, Washington D.C."&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=editor and writers|title=Thar Coal Power Generation|url=http://www.embassyofpakistanusa.org/forms/Thar%20Coal%20Power%20Generation.pdf|work=Govt of Pakistan|publisher=Embassy of Pakistan, Washington D.C.|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GSP sponsored and published various studies on the geology of Thar Desert.&lt;ref name="GSP, Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Discovery Of Ignite Coal In Thar Desert|url=http://www.gsp.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30:thar-coal&amp;catid=1:data|work=Govt.

In the 2000s, the GSP gained international and public prominence when its scientists discovered and unearthed the first ever dinosaur fossils in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The remains were thought to be around  ~70 million years old and were found by geologists mapping the Barkhan district of the country's arid Balochistan province.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The specimens include legs and vertebrae.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=First dinosaur find in Pakistan|newspaper=BBC Pakistan|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GSP publications===

The GSP researchers, engineers, technicians, and scientists publish the results of their science in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name="Geological Survey, Research"/&gt; Many researchers publish their science in peer-reviewed scientific journals as well as in one of a variety of series that includes series for preliminary results, maps data, and final results. All publications are published by the GSP and are available as public domains.&lt;ref name="Geological Survey, Research"&gt;{{cite web|first=Staff|title=Latest Research Publications|url=http://www.gsp.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:latest-research-publications&amp;catid=2:publicationnews|work=Govt Pakistan|publisher=Geological Survey, Research|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Geological Survey's two scientists published an assessed report, predicting the [[2010 Pakistan floods|hydrological threat]] posed to the country.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=David|title=Flash flood threat to Pakistan quake survivors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/feb/11/pakistan.naturaldisasters|accessdate=18 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey was conducted immediately after the [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|devastated earthquake]] in 2005, and the GSP's scientists began to study the hazards in the region, which were still geologically unstable.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

In 2009, the GSP submitted another report that recommended the potentially hazardous areas of [[Northern Pakistan]] where the earthquake and seismic activities were suspected. The survey also found out that the earthquake cracks were found in all over the [[Atta Abad lake]] region. The GSP declared the eastern part of the [[Atta Abad lake|Atta Abad]] as "High Hazard" area, and recommendations were submitted to evacuate the area.&lt;ref name="GSP Pakistan, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Causative Mechanisms of Hunza Valley|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/Documents/Hunza_Landslide_Report/Report%20of%20Geological%20Survey%20of%20Pakistan%20in%20Pre%20disaster%20period%20of%20Hunza%20Attabad%20Landslide.pdf|publisher=GSP Pakistan, 2009|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male godparent is a '''godfather''', and a female godparent is a '''godmother'''. The child is a '''godchild''' (i.e. '''godson''' for boys and '''goddaughter''' for girls).

===Origins and history===
[[File:Baptismal Font Magdeburg.jpg|thumb|right|The [[baptismal font]] at the [[Cathedral of Magdeburg]]]]
As early as the 2nd century AD, [[infant baptism]] had begun to gain acceptance among Christians for the spiritual purification and social initiation of infants,&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Lynch, ''google Godparents and Kinship in Early Medieval Europe'' (Princeton, NJ, 1980), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; the requirement for some confession of faith necessitated the use of adults who acted as sponsors for the child. They vocalized the confession of faith and acted as guarantors of the child’s spiritual beliefs. 

Normally, these sponsors were the natural parents of a child, as emphasized in 408 by [[St. Augustine]] who suggested that they could, it seems exceptionally, be other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;W. Parsons, ed., ''Saint Augustine, Letters of the San Francisco and San San and San the state have a great game and on Sunday he has been a little Yuit for the San and San bay bay on the San San games of San bay and the is back in the San San games of new China and the San bay games are a rlittle and of us aand San San games of a little '', The Fathers of the Church, 18 (New York, 1953hjnjn and the Chicago bears are a bit more than they have in the past few years and has been the most beautiful man ever in and the most of last one season year with a series man of with the a new man of a lifetime season with a man who will have the most beautiful face in a while in a world of drama he is not in love and he came the best and best friends and in a good way mood by ), pp. 134-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a century, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' indicates that parents had been replaced in this role almost completely.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kruger, ed., ''Corpus Iuris Civis'', vol. 3, Codex Iustinianus (Took nd Zurich, 1970), v, 4, 26, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; This'll  was clarified in 813 when the [[Council of Munich]] prohibited natural parents from acting as godparents to their own children.&lt;ref name="J. Goody, 1983 p. 199"&gt;J. Goody, ''The Development of Family and Marriage in Europe'' (Cambridge, 1983), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 5th century, male sponsors were referred to as "spiritual fathers", and by the end of the 6th century, they were being noted to as "compaters" and "commaters", suggesting that these were being seen as spiritual co-parents.&lt;ref&gt;S. W. Mintz and E. R. Wolf, 'An analysis of ritual co-parenthood', ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'', 6 (1950), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern was marked by the creation of legal barriers to marriage that paralleled those for other forms of kin. A decree of Justinian, dated to 530, outlawed marriage between a godfather and his goddaughter, and these barriers continued to multiply until the 11th century, forbidding marriage between natural and spiritual parents, or those directly related to them.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Smith, ''Papal Enforcement of Some Medieval Marriage Laws'' (Port Washington, WI, and London, 1940), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[confirmation]] emerged as a separate rite from baptism from the 8th century, a second set of sponsors, with similar prohibitions, also emerged.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cramer, ''Baptism and Change in the Early Middle Ages c. 200&amp;nbsp;– c. 1150'', Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, 4th series, 20 (Cambridge, 1993), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact extent of these spiritual relationships as a bar to marriage in Catholicism was unclear until the [[Council of Trent]], which limited it to relationships between the godparents, the child, and the parents.&lt;ref&gt;N. P. Tanner, ed., ''Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils'', 1, (London and Georgetown Washington DC, 1990), p. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

====During the Reformation====
[[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] preserved infant baptism against the attacks of more radical reformers including [[Anabaptists]], and with it, sponsors at baptism.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. C. Fisher, ed., ''Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period'', Alcuin Collections, 51 (London, 1970), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Luther strongly objected to the marriage barriers it created, Zwingli stressed the role of parents and [[pastors]], rather than the "witnesses", in religious instruction, and Calvin and his followers tended to prefer the sponsors to be the natural parents.&lt;ref&gt;H. T. Lehmann and J. Pelikan, eds, ''Luther Works'', 45 St Louis MO and Philadelphia, PA (1958-67), p. 24; W. P. Stephens, ''The Theology of Huldrych Zwingli'' (Oxford, 1986), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; A single godparent was retained in baptism at Geneva and among French [[Calvinists]], but some followers of Calvin, most notably in Scotland and eventually the English colonies in America, rejected them altogether.&lt;ref&gt;W. Coster, ''Baptism and Spiritual Kinship in Early Modern England'' (Ashgate, 2002), pp. 84-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Numbers of sponsors====
In the early church, one sponsor seems to have been the norm, but in the early Middle Ages, there seems to have been two, one of each sex, and this practice has been largely maintained in [[Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Gudeman, 'The compadrazgo as a reflection of the natural and spiritual person', ''Proceedings of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' (1971), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In 888, the Catholic Council of Metz attempted to limit the number to one, but proliferation seems to have continued.&lt;ref name="J. Goody, 1983 p. 199"/&gt; In early 14th-century Spain, as many as 20 godparents were being chosen.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Foster, 'Confradia and compadrazgo in Spain and Spanish America', ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'', 9 (1953), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the [[Synod of Worcester]] (1240) stipulated three sponsors (two of the same sex and one of the opposite), and this has remained the norm in the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. C. Fisher, ed., ''Christian Initiation: Baptism in the Medieval West. A Study in the Disintegration of the Primitive Rite of Initiation'', Alcuin Collections, 47 (London, 1965), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Council of Trent]] attempted to limit the numbers of godparents to one or two, but practice has differed across the Catholic world.&lt;ref&gt;N. P. Tanner, ed., ''Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils'', 1, (London and Georgetown Washington DC, 1990), p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern practices===

====Anglican Communion====
The [[Church of England]], the [[mother Church]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], retained godparents in baptism, formally removing the marriage barriers in 1540, but the issue of the role and status of godparents continued to be debated in the English Church.&lt;ref&gt;W. Coster, ''Baptism and Spiritual Kinship in Early Modern England'' (Ashgate, 2002), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They were abolished in 1644 by the [[Directory of Public Worship]] promulgated by the [[English Civil War]] Parliamentary regime, but continued to be used in some parishes in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;C. Durston, 'Puritan rule and the failure of cultural revolution', in C. Durston and J. Eales, eds, ''The Culture of English Puritanism'' (London, 1986), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Restoration in 1660, they were reintroduced to Anglicanism, with occasional objections, but dropped by almost every dissenting church.&lt;ref&gt;H. Davis, ''Worship and Theology in England, from Andrews to Baxter and Fox 1603-1690'' (Princeton, NJ, 1975) p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that the restored institution had lost some of its social importance as well as its universality.&lt;ref&gt;W. Coster, ''Baptism and Spiritual Kinship in Early Modern England'' (Ashgate, 2002), pp. 269-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, in the Church of England, relatives can stand as godparents, and although it is not clear that parents can be godparents, they sometimes are. Godparents should be both baptized and confirmed (although it is not clear in which Church), but the requirement for confirmation can be waived. There is no requirement for clergy to baptize those from outside their parishes, and baptism can be reasonably delayed so that the conditions, including suitable godparents, can be met. As a result, individual clergy have considerable discretion over the qualifications of godparents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canons of the Church of England'', 6th edn (London, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Many "contemporary Anglican rites likewise require parents and godparents to respond on behalf of infant [baptismal] candidates."&lt;ref name="HeflingShattuck2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hefling|first1=Charles|last2=Shattuck|first2=Cynthia|title=The Oxford Guide to The Book of Common Prayer: A Worldwide Survey|date=1 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780199723898|pages=487–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lutheran churches====
[[Lutheran]]s follow a similar theology of godparents as Roman Catholics. They believe that godparents "help [children] with their Christian upbringing, especially if they should lose their parents".&lt;ref name=luther&gt;''[[Luther's Small Catechism]] with Explanation'' ([[Concordia Publishing House]], 1991 edition). Retrieved 2010-16-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans, like Roman Catholics, believe that a godparent must be both a baptized and confirmed Christian.&lt;ref name=luther /&gt; Some Lutherans also follow the Roman Catholic tradition that a Christian who is not affiliated with the Lutheran denomination may serve as a witness rather than a godparent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040702013518/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3900 Godparents at LCMS.org]. Retrieved 2010-16-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methodist Church====
The [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]] stipulates that it is the duty of a godparent, also known as a sponsor, "to provide training for the children of the Church throughout their childhood that will lead to a [[Born again|personal commitment to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior]], to an understanding of the Christian faith, and to an appreciation of the privileges and obligations of baptism and membership (¶ 225.4)." [[John Wesley]], the founder of the [[Methodist Church]], wrote a homily titled "Serious Thoughts Concerning Godfathers and Godmothers" in which he stated that godparents are "spiritual parents to the baptized, whether they were infants or [adults]; and were expected to supply whatever spiritual helps were wanting either through the death or neglect of the natural parents."&lt;ref name="Wesley1831"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesley|first=John|title=The Works of the Reverend John Wesley, A. M.|accessdate=1 May 2016|year=1831|publisher=J. Emory and B. Waugh|language=English|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the role of godparents, instructing that they should call upon their godchild "to hear sermons, and shall provide that he(/she) may learn the [[Nicene Creed|Creed]], the [[Lord's Prayer]], and the [[Ten Commandments]], and all other things which a Christian ought to know and believe to his soul's health; and that this child be virtuosly brought up, to lead a godly and a Christian life."&lt;ref name="Wesley1831"/&gt; As such, the [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|Book of Worship]] states that godparents/sponsors should be "selected carefully" and "should be members of Christ's holy Church; and it is the duty of pastors to instruct them concerning the significance of Holy Baptism, their responsibilities for the Christian training of the baptized child, and how these obligations may be fulfilled."&lt;ref name="PublicationVarious2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The United Methodist Book of Worship|date=5 April 2016|publisher=United Methodist Publishing House|language=English|isbn=9781426735004|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Church====
The Orthodox institution of godparenthood has been the least affected of the major traditions by change. In some Orthodox churches ([[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]], [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]]) usually the best man (kum, кум, koumbaros) or bridesmaid (kuma, кума, koumbara) at a couple's wedding act as a godparent to the first or all children of the marriage. In some instances, the godfather is responsible for naming the child. A godparent to a child will then act as a sponsor at the child's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Campbell, ''Honour, family and Patronage, a Study of the Institutions and Moral Values in a Greek Mountain Community'' (Oxford, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Godparents are expected to be in good standing in the Orthodox church, including its rulings on divorce, and aware of the meaning and responsibilities of their role.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions for Weddings, Divorces, Baptisms, Funerals, and Memorials {{cite web |url=http://www.goarch.org/archdiocese/departments/outreach/resources/pastoralresources/pastoral |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117012706/http://www.goarch.org/archdiocese/departments/outreach/resources/pastoralresources/pastoral |archivedate=2009-01-17 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot be a minor or a parent of the child, and at least one sponsor must be Orthodox.

====Reformed Churches====
In the [[Reformed]] tradition that includes the [[Continental Reformed]], [[Congregationalist]] and [[Presbyterian]] Churches, the godparents are more often referred to as ''sponsors'', who have the role of standing with the child during [[infant baptism]] and pledging to instruct the child in the faith.&lt;ref name="McKim2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms, Second Edition: Revised and Expanded|date=21 April 2014|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|language=English|isbn=9781611643862|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the bapismal liturgy of Reformed [[Geneva]], "the traditional presence of godparents was retained".&lt;ref name="Manetsch2013"/&gt; [[John Calvin]], the progenitor of the Reformed tradition, himself served as a godparent during forty-seven baptisms.&lt;ref name="Manetsch2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Manetsch|first=Scott M.|title=Calvin's Company of Pastors: Pastoral Care and the Emerging Reformed Church, 1536-1609|year=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780199938575|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geneva#Protestant_Rome|Reformed Church in Geneva]], in order to ensure confessional orthodoxy, "expected parents to select Reformed godparents."&lt;ref name="Maag2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maag|first=Karin|title=Lifting Hearts to the Lord: Worship with John Calvin in Sixteenth-Century Geneva|date=13 January 2016|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|language=English|isbn=9781467444002|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many Reformed churches invite parents to select godparents for their prospective neophyte, while other parishes entrust this responsibility to the whole [[Local church|congregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fccucc.org/worship/baptism-communion/|title=Baptism &amp; Communion|last=Maddox|first=Cindy|publisher=First Congregational Church - United Church of Christ|language=English|accessdate=12 August 2017|quote=You’re welcome to invite one or two Godparents to take part in the baptism service, though this is optional and matter of personal choice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wehrheim2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehrheim|first=Carol A.|title=The Baptism of Your Child: A Book for Presbyterian Families|year=2006|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|language=English|isbn=9780664502850|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholic Church====
[[File:Baptism at St. Mary's Church in Dedham, Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|A child being baptized with her parents and godparents.]]
The Catholic institution of godparenthood survived the Reformation largely unchanged. A godparent must normally be an appropriate person, at least sixteen years of age, a confirmed Catholic who has received the [[Eucharist]], not under any canonical penalty, and may not be the parent of the child. Someone who belongs to another Christian church cannot become a godparent but can be a 'witness' in conjunction with a Catholic sponsor. A witness does not have any religious role recognized by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Canon Law'' Can. 872-4 [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2Y.HTM].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Vatican declared that transgender Catholics cannot become godparents, stating in response to a transgender man's query that transgender status "reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality" and that, "[t]herefore it is evident that this person does not possess the requirement of leading a life according to the faith and in the position of godfather and is therefore unable to be admitted to the position of godfather or godmother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wofford |first=Taylor |title=Transgender Catholics Can't Be Godparents, Vatican Says|url=http://www.newsweek.com/vatican-transgender-godparents-368142|publisher=Newsweek.com|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual kinship===
{{See also|Compadre}}
In some Catholic and Orthodox countries, particularly in southern Europe, Latin America, and the Philippines, the relationship between parents and godparents or co-godparents has been seen as particularly important and distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Foster, 'Confradia and compradrazgo in Spain and Spanish America', ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'', 9 (1953), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships create mutual obligations and responsibilities that may be socially useful for participants. The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[compadre]]'' (literally, "co-father") and ''comadre'' ("co-mother"), the [[French language|French]] ''marraine'' and ''parrain'', and the archaic meaning of the English word ''[[gossip]]'' (from ''godsib,'' "godsibling"), describe these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;W. Coster, ''Baptism and Spiritual Kinship in Early Modern England'' (Ashgate, 2002), pp. 91–7.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, they can also be used to describe a friendship.

The Spanish and Portuguese words for the godparent roles are used for members of the [[wedding party]]—''padrino/padrinho'' meaning "godfather" or "[[best man]]" and ''madrina/madrinha'' meaning "godmother" or "[[matron of honor]]", reflecting the custom of baptismal sponsors acting in this role in a couple's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Nutini, and E. Bell, ''Ritual Kinship: The Structure and Historical Development of the Compadrazgo System in Rural Tlaxcala'' 1 (Princeton, 1980), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish custom was also adopted in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country in [[Southeast Asia]] that was a former part of the Spanish Empire. The Filipino terms ''ninong'' for godfather and ''ninang'' for godmother, were also borrowed from Hispanic custom, and apply to godparents in both a child's Baptism and the child's later Confirmation. In the context of a wedding, the terms instead refer to the principal sponsors of the couple.

===Literature and folklore===
{{See also|Fairy godmother}}
Godparents are noted features of fairy tales and folklore written from the 17th century onwards, and by extension, have found their way into many modern works of fiction. In ''[[Godfather Death]]'', presented by the [[Brothers Grimm]], the archetype is, unusually, a supernatural godfather. However, most are a [[fairy godmother]] as in versions of ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[The Blue Bird (fairy tale)|The Blue Bird]]''. This feature may simply reflect the Catholic milieu in which most fairy tales were created, or at least recorded, and the accepted role of godparents as helpers from outside the family, but [[feminist]] [[Marina Warner]] suggests that they may be a form of wish fulfilment by female narrators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Warner, ''From the Beast to the Blonde, on Fairy Tales and Their Tellers'' (London, 1995), pp. 215-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Christian traditions==

===Santeria===
In the [[Yoruba religion]] [[Santería]], godparents must have completed their santo or their [[Ifá]]. A person gets his Madrina and Yubona (co-godmother) or his Padrino and Yubon (co-godfather). A santero, aside from his co-godparents, may have an oluo (babalawo, initiate of ifa) who consults him with an ekuele (divinating chain).

===Judaism===
[[Image:Nimrod ST 07.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Brit milah]]''—the ''[[sandek]]'' holds the baby boy]]
There are two roles in the [[Jewish circumcision]] ceremony that are sometimes translated as ''godparent''. The [[sandek]] holds the baby boy while he is circumcised. Among Orthodox Ashkenazi, the [[Jewish circumcision#Kvatter|kvater]] (or kvaterin if female) is the person who takes the child from his mother and carries him into the room in which the circumcision is performed. Kvater is etymologically derived from the archaic German ''Gevatter'' ("godfather").

===Chinese traditions===
Some Chinese communities practise the custom of matching a child with a relative or family friend who becomes the godmother (乾媽) or godfather (乾爹). This practice is largely non-religious in nature, but commonly done to strengthen ties or to fulfill the wish of a childless adult to have a "son/daughter". In most circumstances, an auspicious day is selected during which a ceremony takes place, involving the godchild paying his/her respects to his new godfather/godmother in the presence of relatives or friends.&lt;ref&gt;D. Waters, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120405095449/http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/44/4402012.pdf "Taking a Godson" ], ''Journals of The Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch'', Vol. 33, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, as it is already common in Chinese kinship to use kinship terms among people that are not related (e.g. addressing a respected coworker as "brother" or one's father's friend may be referred to as "uncle"), an older friend or family friend with a deep friendship and a sufficient age gap will also informally address the other as his godparent or godchild, a gesture often initiated by the older person.

A '''green wedding''' or an '''eco-friendly wedding''' is any [[wedding]] where the couple tries to decrease the impact of their event on the planet. Couples plan their weddings by integrating [[eco-friendly]] alternatives, such as eco-friendly [[Wedding invitation|invitation]]s, [[flower]]s, [[Wedding dress|dress]], [[photography]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Jessica|title=What is a green wedding|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/detail?sid=73ecbace-09c7-4033-a7f1-b42e92f3f33c%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=f5h&amp;AN=42749367|accessdate=March 21, 2012|newspaper=Summer Wedding, Cincinnati|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kasteel van Rhoon Tuin.JPG|thumb|A green wedding reception]]

==Definition==
A green wedding is one that is eco-friendly and conscious of the consumption of resources that would otherwise be used in the wedding. 
This can include [[recycling]] waste, choosing a [[sustainable]] venue and even neglecting to participate in traditional practices that could be considered unsustainable such as buying diamond rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tasker|first=Angela|title=Green Weddings Uniting the Elegant and Unique|year=2009|publisher=Alt health watch|pages=65–70|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c1a04d5a-20d6-4782-849c-6574eac60753%40sessionmgr15&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many people who live green lifestyles believe it is necessary to continue with making sure their weddings are green as well. Others choose green weddings to raise awareness to others of how [[sustainability]] is important in daily activities and celebrations. The largest factor that contributes to the growing number of green weddings is the impact wedding celebrations can have on the environment. Many argue that without being conscious of practices and items used, the average wedding can generate a large amount of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmunds|first=Valerie|title=The Green Wedding Guide|year=2008|publisher=Penn Publishing Ltd.|location=Little Rock, Arkansas|pages=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtmrLBTNUPAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=green+weddings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SOVoT73KD-SUiQL1s6jjBg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20weddings&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
One key concept for keeping a wedding [[eco-friendly]] is to ensure that the items being used will not quickly become waste, mainly one-time disposable items such as hosiery, plates, cups, ornaments or wedding favors. Many green weddings have instead opted for borrowed or recycled items. Another option chosen is to rent items needed for the wedding instead of buying all new equipment/decorations instead to control the amount of waste that could be created. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Napolitano|first=Wenona|title=The Everything Green Wedding Book|year=2009|publisher=Adams Media|location=Avon, MA|isbn=978--1-59869-811-4|pages=x, 93–95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IVMhC9jGIIC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=basic+principles+green+wedding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IuNoT5_FJeqRiQL-r7ydBw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=basic%20principles%20green%20wedding&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other matters that consist of planning a wedding, the main basis is to prevent or reduce all harmful impacts that could be placed on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] either directly or indirectly by resources used for the wedding. The average wedding produces 400 lbs of garbage and 63 tons of CO2. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Kate|title=The Green Bride Guide|year=2008|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, IL|isbn=978--1-4022-1345-8|url=https://www.amazon.com/Green-Bride-Guide-Earth-Friendly-Wedding/dp/140221345X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, American weddings are equivalent to 8.3 million cars driving on the road for a year. This can include flowers, paper (invitations), textiles (dress, suits), gas emissions (transportation), and everything else that can occur from the wedding. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Emily Elizabeth|title=Eco-Chic Weddings|year=2007|publisher=Hatherleigh Press|isbn=9781578262403|pages=3–23|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/eco-chic-weddings-emily-elizabeth-anderson/1007992811?ean=9781578262403&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=eco%2bchic%2bweddings#CustomerReviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flowers==
Another important factor that is considered important is picking of the flowers. Flowers can add a huge impact on the environment due to [[fertilizers]] used and gas emissions that are released to transport the flowers. Many green wedding planners opt to have their flowers supplied by [[Organic farming|organic]] florist or even to grow their own. 
Another common practice is to consider what to do with the flowers after the wedding. Some weddings have had flowers that are replanted after the big day to minimize waste and allow the flowers to continue to grow afterwards. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varner|first=Richard|title=Why are Green Weddings becoming so Popular?|url=http://www.istaygreen.net/?p=228|work=I Stay Green|publisher=Living the Green Life|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some people decorate wedding halls with potted plants without picking flowers. If they give the plant to the guests as a gift, they can grow flowers while thinking about the bride and groom.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SBS|title=1,000 flowers to be thrown away ... Now the wedding is ' green '.|date=March 16, 2018|url=https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1004668344&amp;plink=ORI&amp;cooper=NAVER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invitations==
There is a large amount of paper used in weddings throughout the entire process. One large reason paper is used so largely is because of invitations. Green wedding planners are careful when selecting how to invite others due to the impact this can have. 
Some options that are more sustainable are 
*Using recycled paper
*Purchasing do-it-yourself kits to create your own invitations
*Using the internet to send out electronic invitations instead
*Using tree-free milled paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmunds|first=Valerie|title=The Green Wedding Guide|year=2008|publisher=Penn Publishing Ltd.|location=Little Rock, Arkansas|pages=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtmrLBTNUPAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=green+weddings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SOVoT73KD-SUiQL1s6jjBg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20weddings&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
Food is one important factor that affects how sustainable a wedding is. Some planners choose to get all their food supplied by local/organic growers to help eliminate the amount of chemicals that would have used in the growing of the food or the transportation of it. Wedding cakes are generally made out of all organic ingredients as well to reduce the chemicals used in the production of the ingredients. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Emily Elizabeth|title=Eco-Chic Weddings|year=2007|publisher=Hatherleigh Press|isbn=9781578262403|pages=3–23|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/eco-chic-weddings-emily-elizabeth-anderson/1007992811?ean=9781578262403&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=eco%2bchic%2bweddings#CustomerReviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many sustainable practices that are done in green weddings are to have the leftovers composted after or to have untouched meals donated to local charities.

==Attire==
One of the biggest contributors to waste that can be generated is the wedding dress. Many argue that one of the ways to continue with a sustainable wedding to use a dress that can be re-worn or borrowed from another. This eliminates the one-time use principle violation. Also choosing a wedding dress that is made out of organic fibre ensures that the garment had minimal impact on the environment during its production. 
Many green brides opt to purchase a vintage/second hand dress and have it altered instead of buying a new dress instead. Other brides choose to sell or donate their dress after the wedding or have it recycled to create a new garment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3078">'''Sundaland heath forest''', also known as '''''Kerangas'' [[forest]]''', is a type of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]] found on the island of [[Borneo]], which is divided between [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]], as well as on the Indonesian islands of [[Belitung]] and [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], which lie to the west of Borneo.

==Setting==
The word ''Kerangas'', which means "land which cannot grow rice", came from the [[Iban language]]. [[Heath forest]]s occur on acidic sandy soils that are the result of the area's siliceous parent rocks. Permanently waterlogged heath forests are known as ''kerapah'' forests. The sandy soil of the heath forest are often lacking in nutrients; it is generally considered that [[nitrogen]] is the nutrient which is most lacking for plant growth in these forests. This is in contrast to many other lowland rain forests where [[phosphorus]] is considered to be lacking.

A more recent hypothesis, proposed by Proctor (1999), is that these forests are growing on soils which are highly acidic, such that hydrogen ion toxicity prevents the growth of non-adapted species.

==Flora==
The Sundaland heath forests are distinct from the surrounding [[Borneo lowland rain forest]]s in species composition, structure, texture, and color. The heath forests have a low, uniform canopy, with thick underbrush and rich growth of moss and [[epiphyte]]s.

Many tree and plant species in the nutrient-deprived heath forests have developed unconventional ways to get their nutrients. Some tree species  (''[[Gymnostoma]] nobile'', for example) utilise [[rhizobia]] ([[nitrogen fixing]] [[bacteria]]) in their root nodules. [[Myrmecophyte]]s, including ''[[Myrmecodia]]'' spp. and ''[[Hydnophytum]]'' spp., are tree species that develop symbiotic associations with ants to get their nutrients. Other plants, including [[pitcher plant]]s ''([[Nepenthes]]'' spp.), [[sundew]]s ''([[Drosera]]'' ssp.), and [[bladderwort]] ''(Utricularia'' ssp.), are carnivorous, trapping and digesting insects.

The heath forests are characterized by many plants of [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]] origin, including trees of families [[Myrtaceae]] and [[Casuarinaceae]] and the southern hemisphere [[conifer]]s ''[[Agathis]]'', ''[[Podocarpus]]'', and ''[[Dacrydium]]''.

'''Laurel forest''', also called '''laurisilva''' or '''laurissilva''', is a type of [[Subtropics|subtropical]] forest found in areas with high [[humidity]] and relatively stable, mild temperatures. The forest is characterized by [[broadleaf]] tree [[species]] with [[evergreen]], glossy and [[wikt:elongated|elongated]] leaves, known as "laurophyll" or "lauroid". Plants from the laurel family ([[Lauraceae]]) may or may not be present, depending on the location.

== Setting ==
[[File:Laurazeen wood madeira hg.jpg|thumb|Laurel forest in [[Madeira]]]]
Laurel forests are specific to wet forests from sea level to the highest mountains, but are poorly represented in areas with a pronounced [[dry season]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
They need an [[ecosystem]] of high humidity, such as [[cloud forest]]s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} with abundant rainfall throughout the year. Laurel forests typically occur on the slopes of tropical or subtropical [[mountain]]s, where the [[moisture]] from the ocean condenses so that it falls as rain or fog and soils have high moisture levels.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;[http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci_team/pubs/abstract.php?id=04300 Abstract] at NASA – MODIS: Izquierdo, T; de las Heras, P; Marquez, A (2011).

''Hydrological Processes'', 25(10), 1531–41: "[R]esults prove the absence of summer drought stress in the laurel forest implying that the fog drip income is high enough to maintain enough soil moisture".&lt;/ref&gt; Some evergreen tree species will survive short [[frost]]s, but most species will not survive hard freezes and prolonged cool weather. They need a mild climate with annual temperature oscillation moderated by the proximity of the ocean. These conditions of temperature and moisture occur in four different [[Geography|geographical]] regions:

* Along the eastern margin of [[continent]]s at [[latitude]]s of 25° to 35°.
* Along the western [[Continental climate|continental]] coasts between 35° and 50° latitude.
* On islands between 25° and 35° or 40° latitude.
* In humid [[montane]] regions of the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2352394 Resumen], Aschan, G., María Soledad Jiménez Parrondo, Domingo Morales Méndez, Reiner Lösch (1994), "Aspectos microclimaticos de un bosque de laurisilva en Tenerife / Microclimatic aspects of a Laurel Forest in Tenerife".

Some laurel forests are a type of [[cloud forest]]. Cloud forests are found on mountain slopes where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean is precipitated as warm moist air masses blowing off the ocean are forced upwards by the terrain, which cools the air mass to the [[dew point]]. The moisture in the air condenses as rain or fog, creating a habitat characterized by cool, moist conditions in the air and soil. The resulting climate is wet and mild, with the annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean.

== Characteristics ==
Laurel forests are characterized by evergreen and hardwood trees, reaching up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} in height. Laurel forest, laurisilva, and laurissilva all refer to plant communities that resemble the laurel bay.

Some species belong to the true laurel family or [[Lauraceae]], but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to [[convergent evolution]]. As in any other rainforest, plants of the laurel forests must adapt to high rainfall and humidity. The trees adapted in response to these ecological drivers by developing [[analogous structures]], leaves that repel water. '''Laurophyll''' or [[lauroid]] leaves are characterized by a generous layer of [[wax]], making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an ''apical mucro'' or "[[drip tip]]", which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration. The scientific names ''laurina'', ''laurifolia'', ''laurophylla'', ''lauriformis'', and ''lauroides'' are often used to name species of other plant families that resemble the Lauraceae.&lt;ref name="ebooksread.com"&gt;Otto E. (Otto Emery) Jennings. "Fossil plants from the beds of volcanic ash near Missoula, western Montana" ''Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum'', 8(2), [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/otto-e-otto-emery-jennings/fossil-plants-from-the-beds-of-volcanic-ash-near-missoula-western-montana-volu-nne/1-fossil-plants-from-the-beds-of-volcanic-ash-near-missoula-western-montana-volu-nne.shtml p. 417].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Lucidophyll'', referring to the shiny surface of the leaves, was proposed in 1969 by Tatuo Kira.&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998" /&gt; The scientific names ''[[Daphnidium]]'', ''[[Daphniphyllum]]'', ''[[Daphnopsis hellerana|Daphnopsis]]'', ''[[Daphnandra]]'', ''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; from Greek: Δάφνη, meaning "laurel", ''[[Bay Laurel|laural]]'', ''[[Laureliopsis philippiana|Laureliopsis]]'', ''[[Skimmia laureola|laureola]]'', ''[[laurelin]]'', ''[[Laurelindorinan]]'', ''[[Malosma|laurifolia]]'', ''[[Cistus laurifolius]]'' (Laurel Rockrose), ''[[Cistus laurifolius|laurifolius]]'', ''[[Viburnum tinus|lauriformis]]'', ''[[Hakea laurina|laurina]]'', ''[[Banyan|laurophylla]]'', ''[[Prunus laurocerasus|laurocerasus]]'', ''[[laurus]]'', ''[[Prunus laurocerasus]]'' (English laurel), ''[[Prunus lusitanica]]'' (Portugal laurel), ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' (New Zealand Laurel), and ''[[Corynocarpus rupestris]]'' designate species of other plant families that resemble Lauraceae.&lt;ref name="ebooksread.com" /&gt; The term "lauroid" is also applied to climbing plants such as [[ivy|ivies]] whose leaves resemble those of the Lauraceae.

Mature laurel forests typically have a dense [[canopy (biology)|tree canopy]] and low light levels at the forest floor.&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Box, Elgene O.|author2=Chang-Hung Chou|author3=Kazue Fujiwara|year=1998|title=Richness, Climactic Position, and Biogeographic Potential of East Asian Laurophyll Forests, with Particular Reference to Examples from Taiwan|url=http://kamome.lib.ynu.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10131/7114/1/biest241061.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Environmental Science, Yokohama National University|volume=24|pages=61–95|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226034538/http://kamome.lib.ynu.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10131/7114/1/biest241061.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forests are characterized by an overstory of [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] trees.

Laurel forests are typically multi-species, and diverse in both the number of species and the genera and families represented.&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998" /&gt; In the absence of strong environmental selective pressure, the number of species sharing the arboreal stratum is high, although not reaching the value of tropical forests; nearly 100 tree species have been described in the laurisilva rainforest of [[Misiones]] ([[Argentina]]), about 20 in the Canary Islands. This species diversity contrasts with other temperate forest types, which typically have a canopy dominated by one or a few species. Species diversity generally increases towards the tropics.&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tagawa | first1 = Hideo | year = 1995 | title = Distribution of lucidophyll Oak – Laurel forest formation in Asia and other areas | url = | journal = Tropics | volume = 5 | issue = 1/2| pages = 1–40 | doi=10.3759/tropics.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional type between temperate forests and tropical rainforests.

== Origin ==
Laurel forests are composed of [[vascular plant]]s that evolved millions of years ago. Lauroid floras have included forests of [[Podocarpaceae]] and [[southern beech]].

This type of vegetation characterized parts of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] and once covered much of the [[tropics]]. Some lauroid species that are found outside laurel forests are [[relict]]s of vegetation that covered much of the mainland of [[Australia]], Europe, South America, Antarctica, Africa, and North America when their climate was warmer and more humid. Cloud forests are believed to have retreated and advanced during successive geological eras, and their species adapted to warm and wet conditions were replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] plant communities. Many of the late Cretaceous – early Tertiary Gondwanan species of flora became extinct, but some survived as relict species in the milder, moister climate of coastal areas and on islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/newcaledonia/|title=MBG: DIVERSITY, ENDEMISM, AND EXTINCTION IN THE FLORA AND VEGETATION OF NEW CALEDONIA|work=mobot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Tasmania and New Caledonia share related species extinct on the Australian mainland, and the same case occurs on the [[Macaronesia]] islands of the Atlantic and on the [[Taiwan]], [[Hainan]], [[Jeju-do|Jeju]], [[Shikoku]], [[Kyūshū]], and [[Ryūkyū Islands]] of the Pacific.

Although some remnants of archaic flora, including species and genera extinct in the rest of the world, have persisted as endemic in such coastal mountain and shelter sites, their biodiversity was reduced. Isolation in these fragmented habitats, particularly on islands, has led to the development of [[vicariant]] species and genera. Thus, fossils dating from before the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]]s show that species of ''[[Laurus]]'' were formerly distributed more widely around the Mediterranean and [[North Africa]]. Isolation gave rise to ''[[Laurus azorica]]'' in the Azores Islands, ''[[Laurus nobilis]]'' on the mainland, and ''[[Laurus novocanariensis]]'' in the Canary Islands.

== Laurel forest ecoregions ==
Laurel forests occur in small areas where their particular climatic requirements prevail, in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Inner laurel forest ecoregions, a related and distinct community of [[vascular plant]]s, evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and species of this community are now found in several separate areas of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], including southern [[South America]], southernmost [[Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Biodiversity of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]. Most Laurel forest species are evergreen, and occur in tropical, subtropical, and mild temperate regions and [[cloud forest]]s of the northern and southern hemispheres, in particular the [[Macaronesia]]n islands, southern [[Japan]], [[Madagascar]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Tasmania]], and central [[Chile]], but they are pantropical, and for example in Africa they are endemic in [[Congo (area)|the Congo region]], [[Cameroon]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]], in lowland forest and [[Afromontane]] areas.
Since laurel forests are archaic populations that diversified as a result of isolation on islands and tropical mountains, their presence is a key to dating climatic history.

=== East Asia ===
Laurel forests are common in subtropical eastern Asia, and form the climax vegetation in far southern Japan, [[Taiwan]], southern China, the mountains of [[Indochina]], and the eastern [[Himalayas]]. In southern China, laurel forest once extended throughout the Yangtze Valley and Sichuan Basin from the [[East China Sea]] to the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. The northernmost laurel forests in East Asia occur at 39°&amp;nbsp;N. on the Pacific coast of Japan. Altitudinally, the forests range from sea-level up to 1000 metres in warm-temperate Japan, and up to 3000 metres elevation in the subtropical mountains of Asia.&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995" /&gt; Some forests are dominated by Lauraceae, while in others evergreen laurophyll trees of the beech family ([[Fagaceae]]) are predominant, including ring-cupped oaks (''[[Quercus]]'' subgenus ''Cyclobalanopsis''), chinquapin (''[[Castanopsis]]'') and tanoak (''[[Lithocarpus]]'').&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998" /&gt; Other characteristic plants include ''[[Schima]]'' and ''[[Camellia]]'', which are members of the tea family ([[Theaceae]]), as well as [[magnolia]]s, [[bamboo]], and [[rhododendron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0118|name=Jian Nan subtropical evergreen forests|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subtropical forests lie between the temperate deciduous and conifer forests to the north and the subtropical/tropical monsoon forests of Indochina and India to the south.

Associations of Lauraceous species are common in broadleaved forests; for example, ''[[Litsea]]'' spp., ''[[Litsea cupola]], [[Persea odoratissima]], [[Persea duthiei]],'' etc., along with such others as ''[[Engelhardtia spicata]], [[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Lyonia ovalifolia]], [[Pyrus pashia]], [[Rhus]]'' spp., ''[[Acer oblongum]], [[Myrica esculenta]], [[Michelia kisopa]]'', and ''[[Betula alnoides]]''. Some other common trees and large shrub species of subtropical forests are ''[[Semecarpus anacardium]], [[Cretaeava unilocularis]], [[Trewia nudiflora]], [[Premna interrupta]], [[Ulmus lancifolia]], [[Ulmus chumlia]], [[Glochidium velutinum]], [[Callicarpa arborea]], [[Toona ciliata]], [[Ficus]]'' spp., ''[[Mahosama similicifolia]], [[Trevesia palmate]], [[Xylosma longifolium]], [[Boehmeria rugulosa]], [[Scheffera venulosa]], [[Michelia]]'' spp., ''[[Casearia graveilens]], [[Rhus wallichii]], [[Actinodaphne reticulata]], [[Sapimum insegne]], [[Alnus nepalensis]], [[Ardisia thyrsiflora]], [[Ilex]]'' spp, ''[[Macaranga pustulata]], [[Trichilia cannoroides]], [[Celtis tetranda]], [[Wenlendia puberula]], [[Saurauia nepalensis]], [[Ligustrum confusum]], [[Quercus glauca]], [[Zizyphus incurva]], [[Camellia kissi]], [[Hymenodictyon flaccidum]], [[Maytenus thomsonii]], [[Zanthoxylum armatum]], [[Rhus succednea]], [[Eurya acuminata]], [[Myrsine semiserrata]], [[Slonea tomentosa]], [[Hydrangea asper]], [[Symplocus]]'' spp., ''[[Cleyrea]]'' spp. and ''[[Quercus lamellose]]''.

In the temperate zone, the cloud forest between 2,000 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;m altitude supports broadleaved evergreen forest dominated by plants such as ''[[Quercus lamillosa]]'' and ''[[Quercus semicarpifolia|Q. semicarpifolia]]'' in pure or mixed stands. ''[[Lindera]]'' and ''[[Litsea]]'' species, ''[[Tsuga dumosa]]'', and ''[[Rhododendron]]'' spp. are also present in the upper levels of this zone. Other important species are ''[[Magnolia campbellii]], [[Michelia doltsopa]], [[Pieris ovalifolia]], [[Daphnephyllum himalayanse]], [[Acer campbellii]], [[Acer pectinatum]]'', and ''[[Sorbus cuspidata]]'', but these species do not extend toward the west beyond central Nepal. ''[[Alnus nepalensis]]'', a pioneer tree species, grows gregariously and forms pure patches of forests on newly exposed slopes, in gullies, beside rivers, and in other moist places.

The common forest types of this zone include ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Rhododendron barbatum]], [[Lyonia (plant)|Lyonia]]'' spp., ''[[Pieris formosa]]; [[Tsuga dumosa]]'' forest with such deciduous taxa as ''[[Acer (plant)|Acer]]'' and ''[[Magnolia]]''; deciduous mixed broadleaved forest of ''[[Acer campbellii]], [[Acer pectinatum]], [[Sorbus cuspidata]]'', and ''[[Magnolia campbellii]]''; mixed broadleaved forest of ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Acer campbellii]], [[Symplocos ramosissima]]'' and Lauraceae.

This zone is habitat for many other important tree and large shrub species such as ''[[Abies pindrow]], [[Betula utilis]], [[Buxus rugulosa]], [[Benthamidia capitata]], [[Corylus ferox]], [[Deutzia staminea]], [[Euonymus tingens]], [[Abies spectalbilis]], [[Acanthopanax cissifolius]], [[Acer campbellii]], [[Acer pectinatum]], [[Betula alnoides]], [[Coriaria terminalis]], [[Fraxinus macrantha]], [[Dodecadenia grandiflora]], [[Eurya cerasifolia]], [[Hydrangea heteromala]], [[Ilex dipyrena]], [[Ligustrum]]'' spp., ''[[Litsea elongata]], [[Juglans regia]], [[Lichelia doltsopa]], [[Myrsine capitallata]], [[Neolitsea umbrosa]], [[Philadelphus tomentosus]], [[Osmanthus fragrans]], [[Prunus cornuta]], [[Rhododendron companulatum]], [[Sorbus cuspidate]]'', and ''[[Viburnum continifolium]]''.

In ancient times, laurel forests (''shoyojurin'') were the predominant vegetation type in the [[Taiheiyo evergreen forests]] ecoregion of Japan, which encompasses the mild temperate climate region of southeastern Japan's Pacific coast. There were three main types of evergreen broadleaf forests, in which ''[[Castanopsis]]'', ''[[Machilus]]'', or ''[[Quercus]]'' predominated. Most of these forests were logged or cleared for cultivation and replanted with faster-growing [[conifer]]s, like [[pine]] or [[hinoki]], and only a few pockets remain.&lt;ref&gt;Karan, Pradyumna Prasad (2005).

[[Epiphyte]]s, including orchids, ferns, moss, lichen, and liverworts, are more abundant than in either temperate laurel forests or the adjacent lowland tropical rain forests. [[Myrtaceae]] are common at lower elevations, and conifers and rhododendrons at higher elevations. These forests are distinct in species composition from the lowland tropical forests, which are dominated by [[Dipterocarp]]s and other tropical species.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0103|name=Borneo montane rain forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurel forests are found in the islands of [[Macaronesia]] in the eastern Atlantic, in particular the [[Azores]], [[Madeira Islands]], and [[Canary Islands]] from 400 to 1200&amp;nbsp;metres elevation. Trees of the genera ''[[Apollonias]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Ocotea]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Persea]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Clethra]]'' ([[Clethra]]ceae), ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' ([[Ruscaceae]]), and ''[[Picconia]]'' ([[Oleaceae]]) are characteristic.&lt;ref name="Madeira Laurel Forest"&gt;[http://www.madeirabirds.com/madeira_laurel_forest Madeira Laurel Forest], Madeira Wind Birds 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Madeira Islands laurel forest was designated a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1999. The paleobotanical record of Madeira reveals that laurissilva forests has existed in this island for at least 1.8 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Góis-Marques|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Madeira|first2=José|last3=Menezes de Sequeira|first3=Miguel|title=Inventory and review of the Mio–Pleistocene São Jorge flora (Madeira Island, Portugal): palaeoecological and biogeographical implications|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|date=7 February 2017|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/14772019.2017.1282991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of years ago, laurel forests were widespread around the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The drying of the region since the [[Pliocene]] and cooling during the [[Ice Ages]] caused these rainforests to retreat. Some relict Mediterranean laurel forest species, such as sweet bay ''([[Laurus nobilis]])'' and European holly ''([[Ilex aquifolium]])'', are fairly widespread around the Mediterranean basin.

In the Mediterranean there are other areas with species adapted to the same habitat, but which do not form a laurel forest. The most important is the [[Hedera|ivy]], a climber or vine that is well represented in most of Europe, where it spread again after the glaciations. The "loro" (''[[Prunus lusitanica]]'') is the only tree that survives as a relict in some [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] riversides, especially in the western part of the peninsula, particularly the [[Extremadura]], and to a small extent in the Northeast. In other cases, the presence of Mediterranean laurel  (''[[Laurus nobilis]]'') provides an indication of the previous existence of laurel forest. This species survives natively in [[Morocco]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Greece]], the Mediterranean islands, and some areas of [[Spain]], including the [[Parque Natural Los Alcornocales]] in the province of [[Cádiz]] and in coastal mountains, especially in the [[Province of Girona|Girona Province]] of [[Catalonia]], which keeps the best "lauredales", and isolated in the [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] area. [[Cortegada Island]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] is famous for its vast forest of laurels, but this forest is not indigenous to the island, but originated in plantings after the native vegetation had been destroyed. The [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] spread through North Africa. [[Tree Heath]] ''(Erica arborea)'' grows in southern Iberia, but without reaching the dimensions observed in the temperate evergreen forest or North Africa. The subspecies ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]] baeticum'' and/or ''[[Rhamnus frangula]] baetica'' still persist in humid microclimates, such as stream valleys, in Spain's [[Baetic Cordillera]], in the Portuguese mountains of [[Monchique]], and the [[Rif Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpretation Manual of European Union Habitats|year=2007|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/docs/2007_07_im.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2013}}

Although the Atlantic laurisilva is more abundant in the Macaronesian archipelagos, where the weather has fluctuated little since the [[Tertiary]], there are small representations and some species contribution to the oceanic and Mediterranean ecoregions of Europe, [[Asia minor]] and west and north of Africa, where microclimates in the coastal mountain ranges form inland "islands" favorable to the persistence of laurel forests. In some cases these were genuine islands in the Tertiary, and in some cases simply areas that remained ice-free. When the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] reclosed, the species repopulated toward the Iberian Peninsula to the north and were distributed along with other African species, but the seasonally drier and colder climate, prevented them reaching their previous extent. In Atlantic Europe, subtropical vegetation is interspersed with taxa from Europe and North African in bioclimatic enclaves such as [[Monchique Islet|Monchique]],  [[Sintra]], and the coastal mountains from [[Cadiz]] to [[Algeciras]]. In the Mediterranean region, remnant laurel forest is present in some islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], on the [[Black Sea]] coast of Iran and Turkey, including the laurifolia castanopsis and true laurus forests, associated with ''[[Prunus laurocerasus]]'', and conifers such as ''[[Taxus baccata]]'', ''[[Cedrus atlantica]]'', and ''[[Abies pinsapo]]''.

In Europe the laurel forest has been badly damaged by timber harvesting, by fire (both accidental and deliberate to open fields for crops), by the introduction of exotic animal and plant species that have displaced the original cover, and by replacement with arable fields, exotic timber plantations, cattle pastures, and [[golf]] courses and tourist facilities. Most of the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is in serious danger of extinction. The laurel forest flora are usually strong and vigorous, so the forest regenerates easily; its decline is due to external forces.

=== Nepal ===
In the Himalayas, in Nepal, subtropical forest consists of species such as ''[[Schima wallichii]]'', ''[[Castanopsis indica]]'', and ''[[Castanopsis tribuloides]]'' in relatively humid areas. Some common forest types in this region include ''Castanopsis tribuloides'' mixed with ''[[Schima wallichi]], Rhododendron'' spp., ''[[Lyonia ovalifolia]], [[Eurya acuminata]]'', and ''[[Quercus glauca]]''; ''Castanopsis''-Laurales forest with ''Symplocas'' spp.; ''[[Alnus nepalensis]]'' forests; ''Schima wallichii-Castanopsis indica'' hygrophile forest; ''Schima-Pinus'' forest; ''[[Pinus roxburghii]]'' forests with ''[[Phyllanthus emblica]]. [[Semicarpus anacardium]]'', ''Rhododendron arboreum'' and ''[[Lyoma ovalifolia]]; Schima-Lagestromea parviflora'' forest, ''[[Quercus lamellosa]]'' forest with ''[[Quercus lenata]]'' and 'Quercus glauca; ''Castanopsis'' forests with ''[[Castanopsis hystrix]]'' and Lauraceae.

=== Africa ===
{{Main|Afromontane}}
The [[Afromontane]] laurel forests describe the plant and animal species common to the mountains of [[Africa]] and the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The afromontane regions of Africa are discontinuous, separated from each other by lowlands, resembling a series of islands in distribution. Patches of forest with Afromontane floristic affinities occur all along the mountain chains. Afromontane communities occur above {{convert|1500–2000|m}} elevation near the equator, and as low as {{convert|300|m}} elevation in the [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests]] of [[South Africa]]. Afromontane forests are cool and humid. Rainfall is generally greater than {{convert|700|mm/year|in/year}}, and can exceed {{convert|2000|mm}} in some regions, occurring throughout the year or during winter or summer, depending on the region. Temperatures can be extreme at some of the higher altitudes, where snowfalls may occasionally occur.

In [[Subsaharan Africa]], laurel forests are found in the [[Cameroon Highlands forests]] along the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], along the East African Highlands, a long chain of mountains extending from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] around the [[African Great Lakes]] to [[South Africa]], in the Highlands of [[Madagascar]], and in the montane zone of the [[São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón moist lowland forests]]. These scattered highland laurophyll forests of Africa are similar to one another in species composition (known as the [[Afromontane]] flora), and distinct from the flora of the surrounding lowlands.

The main species of the Afromontane forests include the broadleaf canopy trees of genus ''[[Beilschmiedia]]'', with ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'', ''[[Ilex mitis]]'', ''[[Nuxia congesta]]'', ''[[Nuxia floribunda|N. floribunda]]'', ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', ''[[Prunus africana]]'', ''[[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', ''[[Halleria lucida]]'', ''[[Ocotea bullata]]'', and ''[[Xymalos monospora]]'', along with the emergent conifers ''[[Podocarpus latifolius]]'' and ''[[Afrocarpus falcatus]]''. Species composition of the Subsaharan laurel forests differs from that of Eurasia. Trees of the [[lauraceae|Laurel family]] are less prominent, limited to ''[[Ocotea]]'' or ''[[Beilschmiedia]]'' due to exceptional [[Biology|biological]] and [[Paleoecology|paleoecological]] interest and the enormous [[biodiversity]] mostly but with many endemic species, and the members of the beech family (Fagaceae) are absent.&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995" /&gt; &lt;!-- This last sentence is unclear. --&gt;

Trees can be up to {{convert|30|or|40|m|ft}} tall and distinct strata of emergent trees, canopy trees, and shrub and herb layers are present. Tree species include: Real Yellowwood (''[[Podocarpus latifolius]]''), Outeniqua Yellowwood (''[[Podocarpus falcatus]]''), White Witchhazel (''[[Trichocladus ellipticus]]''), ''[[Rhus chirendensis]]'', ''[[Curtisia dentata]]'', ''[[Calodendrum capense]]'', ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'', ''[[Halleria lucida]]'', ''[[llex mitis]]'', ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', ''[[Nuxia floribunda]]'', ''[[Xymalos monospora]]'', and ''[[Ocotea bullata]]''. Shrubs and climbers are common and include: Common Spikethorn (''[[Maytenus heterophylla]]''), Cat-thorn (''[[Scutia myrtina]]''), Numnum (''[[Carissa bispinosa]]''), ''[[Secamone alpinii]]'', ''[[Canthium ciliatum]]'', ''[[Rhoicissus tridentata]]'', ''[[Zanthoxylum capense]]'', and ''[[Burchellia bubalina]]''. In the undergrowth grasses, herbs and ferns may be locally common: Basketgrass (''[[Oplismenus hirtellus]]''), Bushman Grass (''[[Stipa dregeana]]'' var. ''elongata''), Pigs-ears (''[[Centella asiatica]]''), ''[[Cyperus albostriatus]]'', ''[[Polypodium polypodioides]]'', ''[[Polystichum tuctuosum]]'', ''[[Streptocarpus rexii]]'', and ''[[Plectranthus]]'' spp. Ferns, shrubs and small trees such as [[Cape Beech]] (''[[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'') are often abundant along the forest edges.

=== USA Southeast States ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
According to the recent study by Box and Fujiwara (Evergreen Broadleaved Forests of the Southeastern United States: Preliminary Description), laurel forests occur in patches in the southeastern United States from southeast [[North Carolina]] southward to [[Florida]], and west to [[Texas]], mostly along the coast and coastal plain of the Gulf and south Atlantic coast. In the southeastern United States, evergreen [[Hammock (ecology)]] (i.e. topographically induced forest islands) contain many laurel forests. These laurel forests occur mostly in moist depression and floodplains. In many portions of the coastal plain, a low-lying mosaic topography of white sand, silt, and [[limestone]] (mostly in [[Florida]]), separate these laurel forests. Frequent fire is also thought to be responsible for the disjointed geography of laurel forests across the coastal plain of the southeastern United States.

Despite being located in a humid climate zone, much of the broadleaf Laurel forests in the Southeast USA are semi-[[sclerophyll]] in character. The semi-sclerophyll character is due (in part) to the sandy soils and often periodic semi-arid nature of the climate. As one moves south into central Florida, the sclerophyll character slowly declines and more tree species from the tropics ([[Caribbean]]) increase as the temperate species decline. As such, the southeastern laurel forests gives way to [[tropical savanna]].

There are several different broadleaved evergreen canopy trees in the laurel forests of the southeastern United States. In some areas, the evergreen forests are dominated by species of Live Oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), Laurel Oak (''[[Quercus hemisphaerica]]''), Southern Magnolia (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]''), Red Bay (''[[Persea borbonia]]''), Cabbage Palm (''[[Sabal palmetto]]''), and Sweetbay Magnolia (''[[Magnolia virginiana]]''). In several areas on the barrier islands, a stunted ''[[Quercus geminata]]'' or mixed ''Quercus geminata'' and ''Quercus virginiana'' forest dominates, with a dense evergreen understory of scrub palm ''[[Serenoa repens]]'' and a variety of vines, including ''[[Bignonia capreolata]]'', as well as ''[[Smilax]]'' and ''[[Vitis species]]'''. ''[[Gordonia lasianthus]]'', ''[[Ilex opaca]]'' and ''[[Osmanthus americanus]]'' also may occur as canopy co-dominant in coastal dune forests, with ''[[Cliftonia monophylla]]'' and ''[[Vaccinium arboreum]]'' as a dense evergreen understory (Box and Fujiwara 1988).

The lower [[shrub layer]] of the evergreen forests is often mixed with other evergreen species from the palm family (''[[Rhapidophyllum hystrix]]''), Bush palmetto(''[[Sabal minor]]''), and Saw Palmetto (''[[Serenoa repens]]''), and several species in the Ilex family, including ''[[Ilex glabra]]'', [[Dahoon Holly]], and [[Yaupon Holly]]. In many areas, ''[[Cyrilla racemiflora]]'', ''[[Lyonia fruticosa]]'',  Wax Myrtle ''[[Myrica]]'' is present as an evergreen understory. Several species of ''[[Yucca]]'' and ''[[Opuntia]]'' are native as well to the drier sandy coastal scrub environment of the region, including ''[[Yucca aloifolia]]'', ''[[Yucca filamentosa]]'', ''[[Yucca gloriosa]]'', and ''[[opuntia stricta]]''.

=== USA ancient California ===
During the [[Miocene]], oak-laurel forests were found in Central and Southern [[California]]. Typical tree species included oaks ancestral to present-day California oaks, as well as an assemblage of trees from the Laurel family, including ''[[Nectandra]]'', ''[[Ocotea]]'', ''[[Persea]]'', and ''[[Umbellularia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Daniel I. (2000) ''A Miocene (10-12 Ma) Evergreen Laurel-Oak Forest from Carmel Valley, California.'' University of California Publications in Geological Sciences 145; April 2000. 3rd ed.

''Terrestrial vegetation of California''. Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-1-282-35915-4}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Only one native species from the Laurel family (Lauraceae), ''[[Umbellularia californica]],'' remains in California today.

There are however, several areas in Mediterranean California, as well as isolated areas of southern Oregon that have evergreen forests. Several species of evergreen ''[[Quercus]]'' forests occur, as well as a mix of evergreen scrub typical of [[Mediterranean climate]]s. Species of ''[[Notholithocarpus]]'', ''[[Arbutus menziesii]]'', and ''[[Umbellularia californica]]'' can be canopy species in several areas.

=== Central America ===
The laurel forest is the most common [[Central America]]n temperate evergreen cloud forest type. They are found in mountainous areas of southern [[Mexico]] and almost all Central American countries, normally more than {{convert|1000|m}} above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the Laurel family, and species of ''[[Weinmannia]]'', ''[[Drimys]]'', and ''[[Magnolia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0167|name=Talamancan montane forests|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloud forest of [[Sierra de las Minas]], [[Guatemala]], is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern [[Honduras]] there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with [[Nicaragua]]. In [[Nicaragua]] the [[cloud forest]]s are found in the border zone with Honduras, and most were cleared to grow [[coffee]]. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the [[Mombacho]] volcano in Nicaragua. In [[Costa Rica]] there are laurisilvas in the "Cordillera de [[Tilarán]]" and [[Volcán Arenal]], called [[Monteverde]], also in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]].

=== Tropical Andes ===
The [[Yungas]] are typically evergreen forests or jungles, and multi-species, which often contain many species of the laurel forest. They occur discontinuously from [[Venezuela]] to northwestern [[Argentina]] including in [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], usually in the Sub-Andean Sierras. The forest relief is varied and in places where the Andes meet the Amazon, it includes steeply sloped areas. Characteristic of this region are deep ravines formed by the rivers, such as that of the [[Tarma River]] descending to the San Ramon Valley, or the [[Urubamba River]] as it passes through [[Machu Picchu]]. Many of the Yungas are degraded or are forests in recovery that have not yet reached their [[climax vegetation]].

=== Southeastern South America ===

The laurel forests of the region are known as the ''Laurisilva Misionera'', after Argentina's [[Misiones Province]]. The [[Araucaria moist forests]] occupy a portion of the highlands of southern Brazil, extending into northeastern Argentina. The forest canopy includes species of Lauraceae (''[[Ocotea pretiosa]]'' and ''[[Ocotea catharinense|O. catharinense]]''), Myrtaceae (''[[Campomanesia xanthocarpa]]''), and Leguminosae (''[[Parapiptadenia rigida]]''), with an emergent layer of the conifer Brazilian Araucaria (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'') reaching up to {{convert|45|m|ft}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0101|name=Araucaria moist forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtropical [[Serra do Mar coastal forests]] along the southern coast of Brazil have a tree canopy of Lauraceae and Myrtaceae, with emergent trees of Leguminaceae, and a rich diversity of [[bromeliad]]s and trees and shrubs of family [[Melastomaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0160|name=Serra do Mar coastal forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inland [[Alto Paraná Atlantic forests]], which occupy portions of the Brazilian Highlands in southern Brazil and adjacent parts of Argentina and Paraguay, are semi-deciduous.

=== Central Chile ===
{{Main|Valdivian temperate rain forests}}

The Valdivian temperate rain forests, or ''Laurisilva Valdiviana'', occupy southern [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] from the Pacific Ocean to the [[Andes]]  between 38° and 45° latitude. Rainfall is abundant, from {{convert|1500|to(-)|5000|mm}} according to locality, distributed throughout the year, but with some subhumid Mediterranean climate influence for 3–4 months in summer. The temperatures are sufficiently invariant and mild, with no month falling below {{convert|5|C}}, and the warmest month below {{convert|22|C}}.

[[File:Nothofagus demis.JPG|thumb|Distribution of ''[[Nothofagus]]'', a plant genus that typifies Gondwanan distribution, having descended from the supercontinent and persisting in Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Chile; fossils have also been found in Antarctica]]
Laurel forest appears on mountains of the coastal strip of New South Wales in [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Tasmania]], and [[New Zealand]]. The laurel forests of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand are home to species related to those in the Valdivian laurel forests, including Southern Beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'', fossils of which have recently been found in Antarctica&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = H.M. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z.K. | year = 2007 | title = Fossil nothofagaceous leaves from the Eocene of western Antarctica and their bearing on the origin, dispersal and systematics of Nothofagus | url = | journal = Science in China | volume = 50 | issue = 10| pages = 1525–1535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]]. Other typical flora include [[Winteraceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], Southern Sassafras ([[Atherospermataceae]]), conifers of [[Araucariaceae]], [[Podocarpaceae]], and [[Cupressaceae]], and [[tree fern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, Kazue and Elgene O.

New Caledonia was an ancient fragment of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Unlike many of the Pacific Islands, which are of relatively recent volcanic origin, New Caledonia is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a fragment of the ancient Gondwana that separated from Australia 60–85&amp;nbsp;million years ago,&lt;ref name="Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web |author=Keith Lewis |author2=Scott D. Nodder |author3=Lionel Carter |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/OceanStudyAndConservation/SeaFloorGeology/1/en | title=Zealandia: the New Zealand continent |work=Te Ara&amp;nbsp;— the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=11 January 2007 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ridge linking New Caledonia to [[New Zealand]] has been deeply submerged for millions of years. This isolated New Caledonia from the rest of the world's landmasses, preserving a snapshot of Gondwanan forests. New Caledonia and New Zealand are separated by [[continental drift]] of Australia 85 million years ago. The islands still shelter an extraordinary diversity of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants and animals of Gondwanan origin that have later spread to the southern continents.

The laurel forest of Australia, [[New Caledonia]] (''[[Adenodaphne]]''), and New Zealand have a number of species related to those of the Valdivian laurel forest, through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]] of [[gymnosperms]] like the [[podocarpus]] and deciduous Nothofagus. ''[[Beilschmiedia tawa]]'' is often the dominant canopy species of genus ''[[Beilschmiedia]]'' in lowland laurel forests in the [[North Island]] and the northeast of the [[South Island]], but will also often form the subcanopy in primary forests throughout the country in these areas, with [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] such as [[Kahikatea]], [[Prumnopitys taxifolia|Matai]], [[Miro (tree)|Miro]] and [[Rimu]]. Genus ''Beilschmiedia'' are trees and [[shrub]]s widespread in tropical [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[South America]] as far south as [[Chile]]. In the [[Corynocarpus]] family, ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' is called laurel of New Zealand, while ''[[Laurelia novae-zelandiae]]'' belongs to the same genus as ''[[Laurelia sempervirens]]''. The tree [[niaouli]] grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and Papua.

New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the Antarctic flora, including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], fossilized logs can be seen of trees closely related to modern [[Kauri]] and [[Norfolk Pine]] that grew on Zealandia about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |date=2008-10-17 }} Retrieved on 2007-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

During glacial periods more of Zealandia became a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]]s, but a recent discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw from the [[Miocene]] in the [[Otago]] region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand|last=Campbell|first=Hamish|authorlink=|author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=North Shore, New Zealand|isbn=978-0-14-302088-2|pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Guinea]] and Northern Australian ecoregions are closely related. Over time Australia drifted north and became drier; the humid Antarctic flora from Gondwana retreated to the east coast and [[Tasmania]], while the rest of Australia became dominated by sclerophyll forest and [[xeric]] shrubs and grasses. Humans arrived in Australia 50–60,000 years ago, and used fire to reshape the vegetation of the continent; as a result,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} the Antarctic flora, also known as the ''Rainforest flora'' in Australia, retreated to a few isolated areas composing less than 2% of Australia's land area.

==== New Guinea ====
The eastern end of [[Malesia]], including [[New Guinea]] and the [[Aru Islands]] of eastern Indonesia, is linked to Australia by a shallow continental shelf, and shares many [[marsupial]] mammal and bird [[taxon|taxa]] with Australia. New Guinea also has many additional elements of the Antarctic flora, including southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'') and [[Eucalypt]]s. New Guinea has the highest mountains in [[Malesia]], and vegetation ranges from tropical lowland forest to [[tundra]].

The highlands of New Guinea and [[New Britain]] are home to montane laurel forests, from about {{convert|1000|to(-)|2500|m}} elevation. These forests include species typical of both Northern Hemisphere laurel forests, including ''[[Lithocarpus]], [[Ilex]],'' and Lauraceae, and Southern Hemisphere laurel forests, including Southern Beech ''[[Nothofagus]]'', ''[[Araucaria]]'', [[Podocarp]]s, and trees of the Myrtle family ([[Myrtaceae]]).&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0105|name=Central Range montane rain forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Guinea and Northern Australia are closely related. Around 40 million years ago, the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian tectonic plate]] began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it collided with the [[Pacific Plate]] on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central [[New Guinea]] emerged around 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=Frith&gt;Frith, D.W., Frith, C.B. (1995). Cape York Peninsula: A Natural History. Chatswood: Reed Books Australia. Reprinted with amendments in 2006. {{ISBN|0-7301-0469-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lee of this collision zone, the ancient rock formations of what is now [[Cape York Peninsula]] remained largely undisturbed.

As to statistical hurricane research between 1883 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5&amp;nbsp;percent of all [[North Atlantic tropical cyclones]] have affected the state.&lt;ref name="ncclimate"/&gt; Additionally, the remnants of a few [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific]] tropical cyclones struck the state.{{Tropical Cyclone Rainfall in the Southeastern United States}} [[Cape Hatteras]] is most affected by storms within the state, though [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|Cape Lookout]] and [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] are also regularly affected; the increased activity in three areas is because it protrudes from elsewhere along the Atlantic coastline.&lt;ref name="ncclimate"&gt;{{cite web|author=State Climate Office of North Carolina|year=2006|title=Hurricanes in North Carolina|accessdate=2008-04-03|url=http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/print/8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330154058/http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/print/8|archivedate=2010-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Southern Florida, Cape Hatteras has the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86&amp;nbsp;[[statute mile|mi]] (139&amp;nbsp;km) of a given location, in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=2007-10-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Outer Banks]] are a narrow strip of low-lying land, hurricanes occasionally leave portions of the land partially or fully submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sprol.com |date=2005-09-15 |title=When will a Category Five Hurricane strike the Outer Banks? |accessdate=2008-03-04 |url=http://www.sprol.com/?p=259 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014084155/http://www.sprol.com/?p=259 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the remnants of inland tropical cyclones have produced flooding and landslides in the state's western region.&lt;ref name="0069rain"&gt;{{cite web|author1=William Haggard|author2=Thaddeus Bilton|author3=Harold Crutcher|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Journal of Applied Meteorology|year=1973|title=Maximum Rainfall from Tropical Cyclone Stems which Cross the Appalachians|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-23|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0450/12/1/pdf/i1520-0450-12-1-50.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20080325002042/http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0450/12/1/pdf/i1520-0450-12-1-50.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-25|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical cyclones have affected North Carolina in every month between May and December; about 35&amp;nbsp;percent of the storms struck the state in September, and 80&amp;nbsp;percent affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. The earliest storm to affect the state was [[Subtropical Storm Andrea (2007)|Subtropical Storm Andrea]] on May 7, 2007, and the latest was a tropical storm that moved across the Outer Banks on December 2, 1925. The strongest storm to strike the state was [[Hurricane Hazel]] on October 15, 1954, which made landfall as a [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 4]] hurricane on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

==Pre-1900==
[[Image:North carolina topographic.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Topographic map of [[North Carolina]]]]
{{Main|List of North Carolina hurricanes (pre-1900)}}
The list of North Carolina hurricanes before 1900 encompasses 139&amp;nbsp;[[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in over 775&amp;nbsp;direct fatalities during the period. Seven cyclones affected the state in the [[1893 Atlantic hurricane season|1893 season]], which was the year with the most tropical cyclones devastating the state during the time period. From the beginning of the official Atlantic hurricane record in 1851 to 1899, there were 12&amp;nbsp;years without a known tropical cyclone affecting the state.

Historical data prior to 1700 is sparse due to lack of significant European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from [[Roanoke Colony]] and later the [[Province of Carolina]]. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{cite web|author=James E.

==Deadly storms==
The table lists hurricanes by death tolls of over 20&amp;nbsp;fatalities. Direct deaths are those that are directly caused by the storm passage, such as drownings or deaths from being struck by windblown objects. Indirect deaths, which are not included in the toll of Hurricane Floyd, are those that are related to the storm, but not directly from its storm effects. Due to lack of data, many early hurricanes have overall death tolls that do not specify indirect or direct.

This is a '''list of Superfund sites in New Mexico''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law. The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). 

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 16, 2017, there were sixteen Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="NPLF-NM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/national-priorities-list-npl-sites-state#NM|title=National Priorities List (NPL( Sites - by State|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2017|website=|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, four other sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPLD-NM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/deleted-national-priorities-list-npl-sites-state#NM|title=Deleted National Priorities List (NPL) Sites - by State|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2017|website=|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national parks of France is a system of ten [[national park]]s throughout metropolitan [[France]] and its [[overseas department]]s, coordinated by the government agency Parcs Nationaux de France.

The first national park was established in 1963 and the most recent park was created in 2012. The French national parks protect a total area of {{convert|3,710|km2|mi2}} in core area and {{convert|9,162|km2|mi2}} in buffer zones in metropolitan France.

This puts over 2% of the total area of metropolitan France under some level of protection. French national parks draw over seven million visitors every year.

The following is a '''list of pipeline accidents in the United States in 2014'''. It is one of several [[list of pipeline accidents in the United States|lists of U.S. pipeline accidents]]. See also [[list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States]].
{{expand list|date=April 2013}}

&lt;!--end compact toc--&gt;

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6681">The '''rivers and water bodies of Montreal''' are few and mostly artificial. Hydrography of the [[island of Montreal]] remained intact until approximately XIXth where [[Montreal]] will undergo major urban works including the construction of [[Lachine Canal]] and the creation of the first [[list of parks in Montreal|major parks of Montreal]].

==History==

===Last Ice Age===

After the [[Ice Age]], around -13 000 years, Montreal and the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]] are flooded by the [[Champlain sea]]. Within a few centuries, as and when these waters recede, the [[Mount Royal]] and its three summits are emerged into islands. With the complete withdrawal of the sea, water is retained in some [[Depression (geology)|depression]] of the island. This is the case among other [[Beaver Lake (Montreal)|Beaver Lake]], located in the palm of [[Mount Royal]]. This will dry gradually to become a [[fen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/science-et-technologie/408486/le-lac-aux-castors-habite-par-le-rongeur-il-y-a-11-000-ans Article of "journal Le Devoir" - Beaver Lake (Lac aux Castors) on Mount Royal]&lt;/ref&gt; He was regrooved artificially in 1938.

===Before XIXth===

There used to be a complex hydrographic, now destroyed or channeled&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivieresperdues.radio-canada.ca/fr/villes/montreal#river4 Radio-Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/home/mapping-ecological-indigenous-heritage sites.google.com Carte des sites de l'héritage autochtone]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Lake Otter (Montreal)|Lake Otter]]''' (or '''small lake St. Peter'''): long by about 4 kilometers and one kilometer wide, marshy lake that was halfway between the [[Old Montreal]] and [[Lachine, Quebec|Lachine]], south of Quartier Latin, the [[Saint-Jacques escarpment]], and west of the [[Turcot Interchange]]. It was backfilled and gradually dried up, particularly with the construction of the [[Lachine Canal]] and with the industrialization of the sector. The [[Quebec autoroute 20|highway 20]] runs through the length and breadth of today in the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivieresperdues.radio-canada.ca/fr/villes/montreal/histoire/13 Radio-Canada, emission "Rivières perdues".]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Saint-Pierre River (Montreal)|Saint-Pierre River]]''': started in [[Côte-des-Neiges]] down to [[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] and widening formed Lake Otter. It then returns to the river and leads to [[St. Lawrence River]] in [[Nuns' Island]].
* '''Little St. Pierre River''': created artificially in 1697 under the name of "St. Gabriel canal". This channel connects the [[Saint-Pierre River (Montreal)|Saint-Pierre River]] (in the east part of [[Lake Otter (Montreal)|Lake Otter]]) up the [[Pointe-à-Callière Museum]]. One part was channeled as qu'égout (William collector) in 1832. The [[Pointe-à-Callière Museum]] would make the public place around 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacmusee.qc.ca/fr/ a-propos de Pointe-à-Callière museum/museum/future-expansion-museum-projects Article "À propos du musée de Pointe-à-Callière"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Saint Martin River''' or '''Little River''': It begins at [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] through [[Outremont, Quebec]] and the [[Mile End, Montreal|Mile End]] and [[Plateau Mont-Royal]] until [[La Fontaine Park]] (including the pond is a remnant). Then it branched off westward through the [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Quartier Latin]] and ran along the [[Montreal fortifications]] to the river. There are still some traces of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaiapresse.ca/nouvelles/des-rivieres-perdues-un-ruisseau-meconnu-36348.html Article "Des rivières perdues - un ruisseau méconnu"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today ===

Today there are only a handful of streams and lakes in nature. However, many parks have ponds or artificial lakes of large size.

== List of water bodies==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15945">This is a list of [[river]]s, which are at least partially located in [[Germany]]. Rivers that flow into the sea are sorted geographically, along the coast. Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea (the lower in the list, the more upstream). Some rivers (e.g. Meuse) do not flow through Germany themselves, but they are mentioned for having German tributaries. They are given in ''italics''. For clarity, only rivers that are longer than {{convert|50|km|mi}} (or have longer tributaries) are shown. An alphabetical list of all German rivers that have an article in Wikipedia is given at the end.

The rivers of Germany flow into the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[Black Sea]] and the [[North Sea]]. The most important rivers of Germany are:
*flowing into the Baltic Sea: [[Oder]]
*flowing into the Black Sea: [[Danube]] (and its main tributaries [[Inn (river)|Inn]], [[Isar]], and [[Lech (river)|Lech]])
*flowing inside the North Sea: [[Rhine]] (and its main tributaries [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Neckar]]), [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] (and its main tributaries [[Havel]] and [[Saale]])

==Draining into the [[Baltic Sea]]==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10513">In [[theoretical physics]], a '''mass generation''' mechanism is a theory that describes the origin of [[mass]] from the most fundamental laws of [[physics]]. Physicists have proposed a number of models that advocate different views of the origin of mass.  The problem is complicated because the primary role of [[mass]] is to mediate [[gravitational interaction]] between bodies, and no theory of gravitational interaction reconciles with the currently popular [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]].

There are two types of mass generation models: gravity-free models and models that involve gravity.

==Background==

===Electroweak theory and the Standard Model===

The [[Higgs mechanism]] is based on a [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] [[scalar field]] potential, such as the [[Quartic interaction|quartic]]. The Standard Model uses this mechanism as part of the [[Electroweak interaction|Glashow–Weinberg–Salam model]] to unify [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions. This model was one of several that predicted the existence of the scalar [[Higgs boson]].

==Gravity-free models==
In these theories, as in the [[Standard Model]] itself, the [[gravitational interaction]] either is not involved or does not play a crucial role.

===Technicolor===

[[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor]] models break electroweak symmetry through gauge interactions, which were originally modeled on [[quantum chromodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Steven Weinberg | title=Implications of dynamical symmetry breaking | journal=Physical Review D | volume=13 | date=1976 | pages=974–996 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.13.974 | postscript=.|bibcode = 1976PhRvD..13..974W | issue=4 }}&lt;br&gt;{{Citation | author=S.

In [[aquatic mammal]]s, '''maternal transfer''' is the movement of contaminants from mother to offspring, typically of lipophilic contaminants while in utero or through the mother’s milk. This has become important with the increase in usage of persistent organic pollutants ([[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]]). POPs [[Biomagnification|biomagnify]] due to their lipophilic nature and become accumulated in the lipid tissues of aquatic mammals. These lipids are used as energy for the mother during the development of offspring, which releases the [[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]] into the circulatory fluid. This leads to a transfer of the [[toxicant]]s into the developing embryos during gestation as well as into milk that an aquatic mammal produces during lactation.

== History and background ==
Marine mammals are exposed to a variety of chemicals throughout their life, mostly through their diet. Once the chemicals are accumulated in the body tissues of the mammals, a portion of these chemicals in the female mammals are transferred to their offspring during gestation and lactation.

The degree of maternal-fetal transfer of chemical pollutants is affected by chemical and physical properties of those compounds. [[Lipophilicity]], protein binding, and active transport mechanisms all influence  the absorption and distribution of such chemicals in maternal tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aylward|first=L.

The placenta provides a barrier to some contaminants, but is partially permeable to others, including many organics and certain heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[cadmium]], particularly when combined with organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiDfCQAAQBAJ|title=Ecotoxicology Essentials: Environmental Contaminants and Their Biological Effects on Animals and Plants|last=Sparling|first=Donald W.|date=2016-04-18|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128019610|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of Maternal Transfer ==

=== Lactation ===
The transfer of contaminants from mother to pup through [[lactation]] is most likely the largest mass transfer of contaminants, greater than that of in-utero transfers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=R. F.|last2=Brodie|first2=P. F.|date=1977-07-01|title=Organochlorine Residues in Maternal Blubber, Milk, and Pup Blubber from Grey Seals (Halichoerus grypus) from Sable Island, Nova Scotia|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f77-146|journal=Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|volume=34|issue=7|pages=937–941|doi=10.1139/f77-146|issn=0015-296X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the mother begins lactation, blubber lipids are converted into milk lipids to feed her offspring. During this process, toxicants that were stored in [[blubber]] lipids are moved into the milk and subsequently are transferred to the nursing pup.

The transfer of toxicants through lactation is driven by the log Kow of the toxicants. Chemical compounds with a high affinity for lipids (a higher log Kow) will more readily be transferred through lactation due to the high lipid content of milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frouin|first=Héloïse|last2=Lebeuf|first2=Michel|last3=Hammill|first3=Mike|last4=Fournier|first4=Michel|date=2012-02-15|title=Transfer of PBDEs and chlorinated POPs from mother to pup during lactation in harp seals Phoca groenlandica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711014021|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=417–418|pages=98–107|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.11.084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of toxicants from blubber to milk is not fully understood, and selective transfer of contaminants has been observed.

Mass balance of toxicants is difficult during lactation due to milk lipids originating from blubber lipids as well as being synthesized locally in mammary tissue. The change in toxicant [[solubility]] between blubber and circulatory fluid as well as the breakdown and resynthesis of blubber lipids and circulatory lipids also contributes to the difficulties of mass balance of toxicants between blubber, circulatory, and milk lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=R. F.|last2=Brodie|first2=P. F.|date=1987-04-01|title=Transfer of Organochlorine Residues from Blubber through the Circulatory System to Milk in the Lactating Grey Seal Halichoerus grypus|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f87-095|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=44|issue=4|pages=782–786|doi=10.1139/f87-095|issn=0706-652X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even with difficulties of mass balancing, it has generally been observed in grey seals and harbor porpoises that residues in pup blubber lipids are generally similar or slightly higher than in maternal milk lipids, and are approximately half of the residues in maternal blubber lipids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heppleston|first=P. B.|date=1973-03-01|title=Organochlorines in British grey seals|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025326X73903056|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=4|issue=3|pages=44–45|doi=10.1016/0025-326X(73)90305-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Placental Transfer ===
The transfer of POPs from mother to fetus via the [[placenta]] is less than that of lactation but can still cause adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ren|first=Aiguo|last2=Qiu|first2=Xinghua|last3=Jin|first3=Lei|last4=Ma|first4=Jin|last5=Li|first5=Zhiwen|last6=Zhang|first6=Le|last7=Zhu|first7=Huiping|last8=Finnell|first8=Richard H.|last9=Zhu|first9=Tong|date=2011-08-02|title=Association of selected persistent organic pollutants in the placenta with the risk of neural tube defects|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/31/12770|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=31|pages=12770–12775|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105209108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3150927|pmid=21768370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatty acids from the mother’s plasma are transported either through diffusion or active transport through the placenta to be used in important processes such as brain development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lager|first=Susanne|last2=Powell|first2=Theresa|date=2012|title=Regulation of Nutrient Transport across the Placenta|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2012/179827/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|doi=10.1155/2012/179827|pmid=|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of fatty acids are mainly derived from blubber in seals, porpoises, and whales.

Lipophilic chemicals such as PCBs previously stored within the mother’s fatty tissue can be transferred to the fetus via the circulatory fluid. Some lipophilic chemicals can be metabolized by the fetus using mostly [[Cytochrome P450|CYP enzymes]], but others are quickly incorporated into developing fetal adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prouillac|first=Caroline|last2=Lecoeur|first2=Sylvaine|date=2010-10-01|title=The role of the placenta in fetal exposure to xenobiotics: importance of membrane transporters and human models for transfer studies|journal=Drug Metabolism and Disposition|volume=38|issue=10|pages=1623–1635|doi=10.1124/dmd.110.033571|issn=1521-009X|pmid=20606001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szabo|first=AndrewJ.|last2=Szabo|first2=Olga|date=1974-08-31|title=Originally published as Volume 2, Issue 7879PLACENTAL FREE-FATTY-ACID TRANSFER AND FETAL ADIPOSE-TISSUE DEVELOPMENT: AN EXPLANATION OF FETAL ADIPOSITY IN INFANTS OF DIABETIC MOTHERS|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673674920200|journal=The Lancet|volume=304|issue=7879|pages=498–499|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(74)92020-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storage  and release of these chemicals within the fetus can lead to [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]], [[immunosuppression]], thyroid disruption, and [[neurotoxicity]] in seals and orcas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krahn|first=Margaret M.|last2=Hanson|first2=M.

== Implications ==

=== Offspring Vulnerability ===
In mammals, maternal factors can be transferred via the [[placenta]], in the [[colostrum]], and in normal milk during lactation. Marine mammal offspring are especially vulnerable during the time when their own immune systems have not yet matured. When females provide milk to their young, they can have a dramatic impact on offspring fitness during [[ontogeny]], as well as when the offspring matures into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seaweb.org/resources/briefings/chempol_mammal.php|title=SeaWeb - Ocean Briefing Book|website=www.seaweb.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female marine mammals pass on most of their [[Persistent organic pollutant|POP]] burden to their first-born offspring, while the calf is in utero and afterwards during lactation. The large amount of [[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]] transferred to the offspring as well as the fast rate of transfer, can sometimes prove fatal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.whales.org/issues/marine-chemical-pollution|title=Marine Chemical Pollution|website=WDC, Whale and Dolphin Conservation|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Male vs. Female ===
The POP [[Body burden|burden]] carried by male and female marine mammals tends to increase with time until they reach the age of sexual maturity. After that point, the burden in males continues to grow, as they continue to absorb POPs from their food. However, with female marine mammals, the POP burden carried decreases after birth but can then increase until the next reproductive cycle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[biogeography]], the '''Mediterranean Basin''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|d|ɪ|t|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|n|i|ə|n}} (also known as the '''Mediterranean region''' or sometimes '''Mediterranea''') is the region of lands around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that have a [[Mediterranean climate]], with mild, rainy [[winter]]s and hot, dry [[summer]]s, which supports characteristic [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] vegetation.

The Mediterranean basin covers portions of three continents: [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]

It has a varied and contrasting topography. The Mediterranean Region offers an ever-changing landscape of high mountains, rocky shores, impenetrable scrub, semi-arid steppes, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches and a myriad islands of various shapes and sizes dotted amidst the clear blue sea. Contrary to the classic sandy beach images portrayed in most tourist brochures, the Mediterranean is surprisingly hilly. Mountains can be seen from almost anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/info/pubs/docs/biogeos/Mediterranean.pdf|title = Natura 2000 in the Mediterranean Region|date = |accessdate = August 6, 2015|website = |publisher = European Commission of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean Basin extends into [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]], covering the western and southern portions of the peninsula of [[Turkey]], excluding the temperate-climate mountains of central [[Turkey]]. It includes the Mediterranean climate [[Levant]] at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, bounded on the east and south by the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Negev]] deserts.

The northern portion of the [[Maghreb]] region of northwestern Africa has a Mediterranean climate, separated from the [[Sahara Desert]], which extends across [[North Africa]], by the [[Atlas Mountains]]. In the eastern Mediterranean the Sahara extends to the southern shore of the Mediterranean, with the exception of the northern fringe of the peninsula of [[Cyrenaica]] in [[Libya]], which has a dry Mediterranean climate.

Europe lies to the north, and three large [[Southern Europe]]an peninsulas, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Italian Peninsula]], and the [[Balkan Peninsula]], extend into the Mediterranean-climate zone. A system of folded mountains, including the [[Pyrenees]] dividing [[Spain]] from [[France]], the [[Alps]] dividing [[Italy]] from [[Central Europe]], the [[Dinaric Alps]] along the eastern [[Adriatic]], and the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkan]] and [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains of the Balkan Peninsula divide the Mediterranean from the temperate climate regions of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]].

==Geology and paleoclimatology==
The Mediterranean Basin was shaped by the ancient collision of the northward-moving African-Arabian continent with the stable Eurasian continent. As Africa-Arabia moved north, it closed the former [[Tethys Sea]], which formerly separated Eurasia from the ancient super continent of [[Gondwana]], of which Africa was part. At about the same time, 170 mya in the [[Jurassic]] period, a small Neotethys ocean basin formed shortly before the Tethys Sea was closed at the eastern end. The collision pushed up a vast system of mountains, extending from the [[Pyrenees]] in Spain to the [[Zagros Mountains]] in [[Iran]]. This episode of mountain building, known as the [[Alpine orogeny]], occurred mostly during the [[Oligocene]] (34 to 23 million years ago ([[mya (unit)|mya]])) and [[Miocene]] (23 to 5.3 mya) epochs. The Neotethys became larger during these collisions and associated folding and subduction.

About 6 mya during the late Miocene, the Mediterranean was closed at its western end by drifting Africa, which caused the entire sea to evaporate. There followed several (debated) episodes of sea drawdown and re-flooding known as the [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]],  which ended when the Atlantic last re-flooded the basin at the end of the Miocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The end of the Miocene also marked a change in the Mediterranean Basin's climate. Fossil evidence shows that the Mediterranean Basin had a relatively humid subtropical climate with summer rainfall during the Miocene, which supported [[laurel forest]]s. The shift to a Mediterranean climate occurred within the last 3.2–2.8 million years, during the [[Pliocene]] epoch, as summer rainfall decreased. The subtropical laurel forests retreated, although they persisted on the islands of [[Macaronesia]] off the Atlantic coast of Iberia and North Africa, and the present Mediterranean vegetation evolved, dominated by coniferous trees and [[sclerophyllous]] trees and shrubs, with small, hard, waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers. Much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation. There are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Mediterranean basin together with the nearby Atlantic coast, the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] and [[Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe]] of [[North Africa]], the [[Black Sea]] coast of northeastern [[Anatolia]], the southern coast of [[Crimea]] between [[Sevastopol]] and [[Feodosiya]] and the Black Sea coast between [[Anapa]] and [[Tuapse]] in [[Russia]] forms the ''Mediterranean Floristic Region'', which belongs to the Tethyan Subkingdom of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is enclosed between the [[Circumboreal Region|Circumboreal]], [[Irano-Turanian Region|Irano-Turanian]], [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian]] and [[Macaronesian Region|Macaronesian]] [[phytochorion|floristic regions]].

The Mediterranean Region was first proposed by German botanist [[August Grisebach]] in the late 19th century.

[[Drosophyllaceae]], recently segregated from [[Droseraceae]], is the only plant family [[endemism|endemic]] to the region. Among the endemic plant genera are:{{dubious|date=February 2016&lt;!-- Ceratocapnos claviculata occurs in northern Scotland and parts of Norway --&gt;}}

The genera ''[[Aubrieta]]'', ''[[Sesamoides]]'', ''[[Cynara]]'', ''[[Dracunculus (plant)|Dracunculus]]'', ''[[Arisarum]]'' and ''[[Biarum]]'' are nearly endemic. Among the endemic species prominent in the Mediterranean vegetation are the [[Aleppo pine]], [[stone pine]], [[Mediterranean cypress]], [[bay laurel]], [[Oriental sweetgum]], [[holm oak]], [[kermes oak]], [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]], [[Greek strawberry tree]], [[Pistacia lentiscus|mastic]], [[terebinth]], [[common myrtle]], [[oleander]], ''[[Acanthus mollis]]'' and ''[[Vitex agnus-castus]]''. Moreover, many plant [[taxa]] are shared with one of the four neighboring floristic regions only. According to different versions of [[Armen Takhtajan]]'s delineation, the Mediterranean Region is further subdivided into seven to nine [[floristic province]]s: Southwestern Mediterranean (or Southern Moroccan and Southwestern Mediterranean), Ibero-Balearian (or Iberian and Balearian), Liguro-Tyrrhenian, Adriatic, [[East Mediterranean]], South Mediterranean and Crimeo-Novorossiysk.&lt;ref&gt;Тахтаджян А.

The Mediterranean Basin is the largest of the world's five [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] regions. It is home to a number of plant communities, which vary with rainfall, elevation, latitude, and soils.
*[[Scrubland]]s occur in the driest areas, especially areas near the seacoast where wind and salt spray are frequent. Low, soft-leaved scrublands around the Mediterranean are known as ''garrigar'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''[[garrigue]]'' in [[French language|French]], ''phrygana'' in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''tomillares'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and ''batha'' in [[Hebrew]].
*[[Shrubland]]s are dense thickets of evergreen sclerophyll [[shrubs]] and small trees, and are the most common plant community around the Mediterranean. Mediterranean shrublands are known as ''[[maquis shrubland|màquia]]'' in Catalan, ''[[macchia]]'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''[[maquis shrubland|maquis]]'' in French, and "[[matorral]]" in Spanish. In some places shrublands are the mature vegetation type, and in other places the result of degradation of former forest or woodland by logging or overgrazing, or disturbance by major fires.
*[[Savanna]]s and [[grassland]]s occur around the Mediterranean, usually dominated by annual [[grass]]es.
*[[Woodland]]s are usually dominated by [[oak]] and [[pine]], mixed with other sclerophyll and coniferous trees.
*[[Forest]]s are distinct from woodlands in having a closed canopy, and occur in the areas of highest rainfall and in [[riparian]] zones along rivers and streams where they receive summer water. Mediterranean forests are generally composed of evergreen trees, predominantly oak and pine. At higher elevations Mediterranean forests transition to mixed broadleaf and tall conifer forests similar to temperate zone forests.

The Mediterranean Basin is home to considerable [[biodiversity]], including 22,500 [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[vascular plant]] [[species]]. [[Conservation International]] designates the region as a [[biodiversity hotspot]], because of its rich biodiversity and its threatened status. The Mediterranean Basin has an area of 2,085,292&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which only 98,009&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; remains undisturbed.

Endangered [[mammal]]s of the Mediterranean Basin include the [[Mediterranean monk seal]], the [[Barbary macaque]], and the [[Iberian lynx]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Mediterranean region}}
[[Neanderthal]]s inhabited western Asia and the non-glaciated portions of Europe starting about 230,000 years ago. Modern humans moved into western Asia from Africa less than 100,000 years ago. Modern humans, known as [[Cro-Magnon]]s, moved into Europe approximately 50-40,000 years ago.

The most recent glacial period, the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], reached its [[Last Glacial Maximum|maximum extent]] approximately 21,000 years ago, and ended approximately 12,000 years ago. A warm period, known as the [[Holocene climatic optimum]], followed the ice age.

Food crops, including [[wheat]], [[chickpea]]s, and [[olive]]s, along with [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s, were [[domestication|domesticated]] in the eastern Mediterranean in the [[9th millennium BCE]], which allowed for the establishment of agricultural settlements. Near Eastern crops spread to southeastern Europe in the [[7th millennium BCE]]. [[Poppy (flower)|Poppy]] and [[oat]]s were domesticated in Europe from the 6th to the 3rd millennium BCE. Agricultural settlements spread around the Mediterranean Basin. [[Megalith]]s were constructed in Europe from 4500 – 1500 BCE.

A strengthening of the summer [[monsoon]] 9000–7000 years ago increased rainfall across the [[Sahara]], which became a [[grassland]], with lakes, rivers, and wetlands. After a period of climatic instability, the Sahara settled into a desert state by the [[4th millennium BCE]].

==Agriculture==
[[Wheat]] is the dominant grain grown around the Mediterranean Basin. [[Pulse (legume)|Pulses]] and [[vegetable]]s are also grown. The characteristic tree crop is the [[olive]]. [[Common fig|Figs]] are another important fruit tree, and [[citrus]], especially [[lemon]]s, are grown where irrigation is present. [[Grape]]s are an important [[vine]] crop, grown for fruit and to make [[wine]]. [[Rice]] and summer vegetables are grown in irrigated areas.

'''Mercerisation''' is a [[textile finishing]] treatment for [[cellulose]] [[fabric]] and [[yarn]], mainly [[cotton]] and [[flax]], which improves [[Dyeing|dye uptake]] and [[tear strength]], reduces [[Shrinkage (fabric)|fabric shrinkage]], and imparts a [[silk]]-like luster.

== Development ==
The process was devised about 1844 by [[John Mercer (scientist)|John Mercer]], who treated cotton with solutions of 55–65{{nbsp}}[[Twaddell scale|°Tw]] (20–30%) [[sodium hydroxide]], followed by washing. Mercer observed that the treated fabrics shrank, had increased tensile strength, and an increased affinity for dyes. In the original process of Mercer, no tension was applied. The product was termed ''fulled cotton'', a nod to the process of [[fulling]] in woven wool fabric. Mercer regarded the increased affinity for dyes as the most important technical aspect. Mercer also experimented with [[sulfuric acid]] and [[zinc chloride]] solutions, and discovered the [[Parchmentised cotton|parchmentising]] effect of [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=J. T. Marsh | chapter=Dispersion Processes | title=An Introduction To Textile Finishing | year=1948 | pages=111-133 | url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.6810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The silk-like lustre now commonly associated with mercerising is produced by tension, and was discovered by [[Horace Arthur Lowe|Horace Lowe]] in 1890.

== Process ==
Treatment with sodium hydroxide destroys the spiral form of the cellulose with formation of [[alkali cellulose]], which is changed to [[cellulose hydrate]] on washing out the alkali. Caustic soda concentrations of 20–26 % are used. Effective mercerization requires the use of [[wetting agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution=Textile Auxiliaries | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | year=2007 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a26_227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improved lustre of mercerised cotton is due to the production of nearly circular cotton fibres under tension. Another characteristic feature is the untwisting (deconvolution) of the cotton hair.

In dry mercerization, the process is carried out while drying the fabric on a [[stenter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">The '''Musée de l'Histoire vivante''' (Museum of Living History) is an historical museum located in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil-sous-bois]], adjacent to the eastern part of [[Paris]], France.

Created in 1937 by the Association pour l'Histoire Vivante (Association for Living History) under the impulse of Communist politician [[Jacques Duclos]], it opened its doors on 23 March 1939 for the 150th anniversary of the [[French Revolution]]. {{ill|Jean Bruhat|fr}} was entrusted with the management of the project. He then dealt with the history of social movements, colonization and decolonization, as well as the suburbs and industrial heritage of the city of Montreuil. Since then, its domain has expanded, notably through temporary exhibitions. 

== History of the Museum ==
During the Second World War, the museum's collections were hidden in a farm in [[Seine-et-Marne]]. It officially reopened to the public on 22 June 1946. Later, it presented new rooms devoted to the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation]] and [[Western Front (World War II)#Liberation of France|Libération]]. A room is also dedicated to [[Karl Marx]]. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, a significant drop in attendance led to the museum's semi-closing, not all spaces being opened to the visitors.

After a complete renovation (refurbishment of the rooms, creation of a reserve, computerization of funds, new presentation of the permanent exhibition), the museum reopened its doors in September 1988, with a temporary exhibition devoted to "Jean Jaurès and the French Revolution". It then acquired the status of a museum controlled by the {{ill|Service des Musées de France|fr|3=Service des Musées de France|lt=Direction des musées de France}}.

The museum houses iconographic collections from the Revolution to the 1960s as well as archival collections of several activists and leaders of the [[French Communist Party]] (Jacques Duclos, [[Daniel Renoult]], {{ill|Marcel Dufriche|fr}}, archives of socialist and far-left activists, in particular. 

The museum houses a space dedicated to the memory of [[Hô Chi Minh]], the first President of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], for his fight against colonialism.

The institution publishes or co-produces historical works, exhibition catalogues, postcards and documentary films. It is also a place of archival resources for researchers and historians.

Its pedagogical activity has intensified and it works in partnership with the association "Citoyenneté Jeunesse" to present teachers and their students with various pedagogical workshops. Modules of images introduce the pupils of schools (from primary to secondary school) to different themes: French revolution, colonial imagery, the image and representation of woman/women from the French Revolution to the present day, urban habitat: garden cities and large complexes, discovery and liberation of Nazi camps, image of propaganda...).

The '''Norian''' is a division of the [[Triassic]] [[geological period]]. It has the rank of an [[age (geology)|age]] ([[geochronology]]) or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] ([[chronostratigraphy]]). The Norian lasted from ~227 to {{Period start|Rhaetian}} [[Mya (unit)|million years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004). Brack ''et al.'' (2005) give 226 to 207 million years&lt;/ref&gt; It was preceded by the [[Carnian]] and succeeded by the [[Rhaetian]].&lt;ref&gt;See for a detailed [[geologic timescale]] Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphic definitions==
[[File:Otisk stopy ceskeho dinosaura.jpg|thumb|Cast of a tridactyl footprint of a theropod dinosaur from the Norian of the [[Czech Republic]].]]
The Norian was named after the [[Noric Alps]] in [[Austria]]. The stage was introduced into scientific literature by Austrian geologist [[Johann August Georg Edmund Mojsisovics von Mojsvar|Edmund Mojsisovics von Mojsvar]] in 1869.

The Norian stage begins at the base of the [[ammonite]] [[biozone]]s of ''[[Klamathites|Klamathites macrolobatus]]'' and ''[[Stikinoceras|Stikinoceras kerri]]'', and at the base of the [[conodont]] biozones of ''[[Metapolygnathus|Metapolygnathus communisti]]'' and ''[[Metapolygnathus|Metapolygnathus primitius]]''. A global reference profile for the base (a [[GSSP]]) had in 2009 not yet been appointed.

The top of the Norian (the base of the Rhaetian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species ''[[Cochloceras|Cochloceras amoenum]]''. The base of the Rheatian is also close to the first appearance of conodont species ''[[Misikella|Misikella spp.]]'' and ''[[Epigondolella|Epigondolella mosheri]]'' and the [[radiolaria|radiolarid]] species ''[[Proparvicingula|Proparvicingula moniliformis]]''.

In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Norian stage contains six ammonite biozones:
*zone of ''[[Halorites|Halorites macer]]''
*zone of ''[[Himavatites|Himavatites hogarti]]''
*zone of ''[[Cyrtopleurites|Cyrtopleurites bicrenatus]]''
*zone of ''[[Juvavites|Juvavites magnus]]''
*zone of ''[[Malayites|Malayites paulckei]]''
*zone of ''[[Guembelites|Guembelites jandianus]]''

| [[Avon (county)|Avon]], [[England]]
| A disputed dinosaur known from an ilium, maxilla, astragalus, and humerus (it could be a [[Chimera (paleontology)|chimera]]). ''Agnosphitys'' lies close to the ancestry of dinosaurs, although exactly where is disputed by researchers. Some consider it a [[saurischian]] close to the beginnings of dinosaur evolution, while others consider it a non-dinosaurian dinosauromorph.

The '''North Pacific High''' is a semi-permanent, [[subtropic|subtropical]] [[anticyclone]] located in the northeastern portion of the [[Pacific Ocean]], located northeast of [[Hawaii]] and west of [[California]]. It is strongest during the northern hemisphere summer and shifts towards the equator during the winter, when the [[Aleutian Low]] becomes more active.  It is responsible for California's typically dry [[summer]] and [[autumn|fall]] and typically wet [[winter]] and [[spring (season)|spring]], as well as Hawaii's year-round [[trade winds]].

'''Passive nuclear safety''' is a design approach for safety features, implemented in a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear reactor,]] that does not require any active intervention on the part of the operator or electrical/electronic feedback in order to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown state, in the event of a particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a [[loss-of-coolant accident|loss of coolant]] or loss of coolant flow). Such design features tend to rely more on the engineering of components such that their predicted behaviour would slow down, rather than accelerate, the deterioration of the reactor state; typically take advantages of natural forces or phenomena such as gravity, buoyancy, pressure differences, conduction or natural heat convection to accomplish safety functions without requiring an active power source&lt;ref name="Schulz2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulz|first1=T.L.|year=2006|title=Westinghouse AP1000 advanced passive plant|journal=Nuclear Engineering and Design|volume=236|issue=14-16|pages=1547–1557|doi=10.1016/j.nucengdes.2006.03.049|issn=00295493}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Many older common reactor designs use passive safety systems to a limited extent, rather, relying on [[active safety systems]] such as diesel powered motors. Some newer rector designs feature more passive systems; the motivation being that they are highly reliable and reduce the cost associated with the installation and maintenance of systems that would otherwise require multiple trains of equipment and redundant safety class power supplies in order the achieve the same level of reliability. However, weak driving forces that power many passive safety features can pose significant challenges to effectiveness of a passive system, particularly in the short term following an accident.

==Terminology==
Terming a reactor 'passively safe' is more a description of the strategy used in maintaining a degree of safety, than it is a description of the level of safety. Whether a reactor employing passive safety systems is to be considered safe or dangerous will depend on the criteria used to evaluate the safety level. This said, modern reactor designs have focused on increasing the amount of passive safety, and thus most passively safe designs incorporate both active and passive safety systems, making them substantially safer than older installations. They can be said to be "relatively safe" compared to previous designs.

Reactor vendors like to call their new generation reactors 'passively safe' but this term is sometimes confused with 'inherently safe' in the public perception. It is very important to understand that there are no 'passively safe' reactors or 'passively safe' systems, only 'passively safe' ''components'' of safety systems exist. Safety systems are used to maintain control of the plant if it goes outside normal conditions in case of anticipated operational occurrences or accidents, while the control systems are used to operate the plant under normal conditions. Sometimes a system combines both features.  Passive safety refers to safety system components, whereas [[inherent safety]] refers to control system process regardless of the presence or absence of safety specific subsystems.

As an example of a safety system with 'passively safe' components, let us consider the containment of a nuclear reactor. 'Passively safe' components are the concrete walls and the steel liner, but in order to fulfil its mission active systems have to operate, e.g. valves to ensure the closure of the piping leading outside the containment, feedback of reactor status to external [[instrumentation]] and [[Control engineering|control]] ([[Instrumentation|I&amp;C]]) both of which may require external power to function.

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) classifies the degree of "passive safety" of components from category A to D depending on what the system does not make use of:&lt;ref name="tecdoc626"&gt;{{cite journal|id=IAEA-TECDOC-626|issn=1011-4289|location=Vienna, Austria|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_626_web.pdf|title=Safety related terms for advanced nuclear plants|publisher=[[IAEA|International Atomic Energy Agency]]|date=September 1991|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#no moving working fluid
#no moving mechanical part
#no signal inputs of 'intelligence'
#no external power input or forces

In category A (1+2+3+4) is the fuel cladding, the protective and nonreactive outer layer of the fuel pellet, which uses none of the above features: It is always closed and keeps the fuel and the fission products inside and is not open before arriving at the reprocessing plant.  In category B (2+3+4) is the surge line, which connects the hot leg with the pressurizer and helps to control the pressure in the primary loop of a PWR and uses a moving working fluid when fulfilling its mission.  In category C (3+4) is the accumulator, which does not need signal input of 'intelligence' or external power. Once the pressure in the primary circuit drops below the set point of the spring-loaded accumulator valves, the valves open and water is injected into the primary circuit by compressed nitrogen.  In category D (4 only) is the [[SCRAM]] which utilizes moving working fluids, moving mechanical parts and signal inputs of 'intelligence' but not external power or forces: the control rods drop driven by gravity once they have been released from their magnetic clamp. But nuclear safety engineering is never that simple: Once released the rod may not fulfil its mission: It may get stuck due to earthquake conditions or due to deformed core structures. This shows that though it is a passively safe system and has been properly actuated, it may not fulfil its mission. Nuclear engineers have taken this into consideration: Typically only a part of the rods dropped are necessary to shut down the reactor.  Samples of safety systems with passive safety components can be found in almost all nuclear power stations: the containment, hydro-accumulators in PWRs or pressure suppression systems in BWRs.

In most texts on 'passively safe' components in next generation reactors, the key issue is that no pumps are needed to fulfil the mission of a safety system and that all active components (generally [[Instrumentation|I&amp;C]] and valves) of the systems work with the electric power from batteries.

IAEA explicitly uses the following caveat:&lt;ref name="tecdoc626"/&gt;
{{quote|... passivity is not synonymous with reliability or availability, even less with assured adequacy of the safety feature, though several factors potentially adverse to performance can be more easily counteracted through passive design (public perception). On the other hand active designs employing variable controls permit much more precise accomplishment of safety functions; this may be particularly desirable under accident management conditions.}}

Nuclear reactor response properties such as [[Temperature coefficient#Temperature coefficient of reactivity|Temperature coefficient of reactivity]] and [[Void coefficient of reactivity]] usually refer to the thermodynamic and phase-change response of the neutron moderator heat transfer ''process'' respectively.  Reactors whose heat transfer process has the operational property of a negative void coefficient of reactivity are said to possess an ''inherent safety'' process feature.  An operational failure mode could potentially alter the process to render such a reactor unsafe.

Reactors could be fitted with a hydraulic safety system component that increases the inflow pressure of coolant (esp. water) in response to increased outflow pressure of the moderator and coolant without control system intervention.  Such reactors would be described as fitted with such a ''passive safety'' component that could – if so designed – render in a reactor a negative void coefficient of reactivity, regardless of the operational property of the reactor in which it is fitted.  The feature would only work if it responded faster than an emerging (steam) void and the reactor components could sustain the increased coolant pressure.  A reactor fitted with both safety features – if designed to constructively interact – is an example of a [[interlock|safety interlock]].  Rarer operational failure modes could render both such safety features useless and detract from the overall relative safety of the reactor.

== Examples of passive safety in operation ==
Traditional reactor safety systems are ''active'' in the sense that they involve electrical or mechanical operation on command systems (e.g., high-pressure water pumps). But some engineered reactor systems operate entirely passively, e.g., using pressure relief valves to manage overpressure. Parallel redundant systems are still required. Combined ''inherent'' and ''passive'' safety depends only on physical phenomena such as pressure differentials, convection, gravity or the ''natural'' response of materials to high temperatures to slow or shut down the reaction, not on the functioning of engineered components such as high-pressure water pumps.

Current [[pressurized water reactor]]s and [[boiling water reactor]]s are systems that have been designed with one kind of passive safety feature.  In the event of an excessive-power condition, as the water in the [[nuclear reactor core]] boils, pockets of [[steam]] are formed. These steam voids [[Neutron moderator|moderate]] fewer [[neutrons]], causing the power level inside the reactor to lower.  The [[BORAX experiments]] and the [[SL-1]] meltdown accident proved this principle.

A reactor design whose ''inherently'' safe process directly provides a ''passive'' safety component during a specific failure condition in ''all'' operational modes is typically described as relatively [[fail-safe]] to that failure condition.&lt;ref name="tecdoc626"/&gt;  However most current water-cooled and -moderated reactors, when [[scram]]med, can not remove residual production and decay heat without either process heat transfer or the active cooling system.  In other words, whilst the inherently safe heat transfer process provides a passive safety component preventing excessive heat while the reactor is operating, the same inherently safe heat transfer process ''does not'' provide a passive safety component if the reactor is shut down (SCRAMed).  The [[Three Mile Island accident]] exposed this design deficiency: the reactor and steam generator were shut down but with loss of coolant it still suffered a partial meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Generation III reactor|Third generation]] designs improve on early designs by incorporating passive or inherent safety features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.com.au/nip16.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019060444/http://www.uic.com.au/nip16.htm |archivedate=2007-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which require ''no'' active controls or (human) operational intervention to avoid accidents in the event of malfunction, and may rely on pressure differentials, gravity, natural convection, or the natural response of materials to high temperatures.

In some designs the core of a [[fast breeder reactor]] is immersed into a [[LMFBR|pool of liquid metal]]. If the reactor overheats, thermal expansion of the metallic fuel and cladding causes more neutrons to escape the core, and the nuclear chain reaction can no longer be sustained. The large mass of liquid metal also acts as a heatsink capable of absorbing the decay heat from the core, even if the normal cooling systems would fail.

The [[pebble bed reactor]] is an example of a reactor exhibiting an inherently safe process that is also capable of providing a passive safety component for all operational modes.  As the temperature of the ''fuel'' rises, [[Doppler broadening]] increases the probability that neutrons are captured by [[Uranium-238|U-238]] atoms. This reduces the chance that the neutrons are captured by [[Uranium-235|U-235]] atoms and initiate fission, thus reducing the reactor's power output and placing an inherent upper limit on the temperature of the fuel.  The geometry and design of the fuel pebbles provides an important passive safety component.

Single fluid [[fluoride]] [[molten salt reactor]]s feature [[fissile]], [[fertile material|fertile]] and [[actinide]] radioisotopes in molecular bonds with the [[fluoride]] coolant.  The molecular bonds provide a passive safety feature in that a loss-of-coolant event corresponds with a loss-of-fuel event.  The molten fluoride fuel can not itself reach criticality but only reaches criticality by the addition of a neutron reflector such as [[pyrolytic graphite]].  The higher density of the fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1n1234u72143r26/fulltext.pdf?page=1|title=Density and surface tension of mixtures of molten fluorides of lithium, beryllium, thorium, and uranium|author=Klimenkov, A.

Gravity driven drainage of reactor liquids provides a passive safety component.

Low power [[pool-type reactor]]s such as the [[SLOWPOKE]] and [[TRIGA]] have been licensed for ''unattended'' operation in research environments because as the temperature of the [[Enriched Uranium|low-enriched]] (19.75% U-235) uranium alloy hydride fuel rises, the molecular bound hydrogen in the fuel cause the heat to be transferred to the fission neutrons as they are ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triga.ga.com/45years.html|title=TRIGA – 45 Years of Success|publisher=General Atomics|accessdate=2010-01-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929013136/http://triga.ga.com/45years.html|archivedate=2009-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifting]] or spectrum hardening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcp.ijs.si/ric/safety_parameters-a.html|title=Nuclear Safety Parameters of a TRIGA reactor|location=Brinje 40, [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]]|publisher=Reactor Infrastructure Centre, [[Jožef Stefan Institute]]|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; dissipates heat from the fuel more rapidly throughout the pool the higher the fuel temperature increases ensuring rapid cooling of fuel whilst maintaining a much lower water temperature than the fuel.  Prompt, self-dispersing, high efficiency hydrogen-neutron heat transfer rather than inefficient [[radionuclide]]-water heat transfer ensures the fuel cannot melt through accident alone.  In uranium-zirconium alloy hydride variants, the fuel itself is also chemically corrosion resistant ensuring a sustainable safety performance of the fuel molecules throughout their lifetime.   A large expanse of water and the concrete surround provided by the pool for high energy neutrons to penetrate ensures the process has a high degree of intrinsic safety.  The core is visible through the pool and verification measurements can be made directly on the core fuel elements facilitating total surveillance and providing nuclear non-proliferation safety.  Both the fuel molecules themselves and the open expanse of the pool are passive safety components.  Quality implementations of these designs are arguably the safest nuclear reactors.

==Examples of reactors using passive safety features==

[[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station#Three Mile Island Unit 2|Three Mile Island Unit 2]] was unable to contain about 480 PBq of radioactive noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building.  The [[pilot-operated relief valve]] at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a quench tank.  However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV quench tank to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;  The containment building sump pumps automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building.&lt;ref&gt;Kemeny, p. 96; Rogovin, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Both a working PORV with quench tank and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety.  An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety.  The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based on the status of its solenoid actuator, instead of a separate indicator of the PORV's actual position.&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate. The automatic sump pumps and/or insufficient containment sump capacity negated the containment building designed passive safety.

The notorious [[RBMK]] graphite moderated, water-cooled reactors of [[Chernobyl Power Plant]] [[Chernobyl disaster|disaster]] were designed with a positive void coefficient with boron control rods on electromagnetic grapples for reaction speed control.  To the degree that the control systems were reliable, this ''design'' did have a corresponding degree of ''active'' inherent safety.  The reactor was unsafe at low power levels because erroneous control rod movement would have a counter-intuitively magnified effect.  Chernobyl Reactor 4 was built instead with manual crane driven boron control rods that were tipped with the moderator substance, graphite, a [[neutron reflector]].  It was designed with an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) that depended on either grid power or the backup Diesel generator to be operating.  The ECCS safety component was decidedly not passive.   The design featured a partial containment consisting of a concrete slab above and below the reactor – with pipes and rods penetrating, an inert gas filled metal vessel to keep oxygen away from the water-cooled hot graphite, a fire-proof roof, and the pipes below the vessel sealed in secondary water filled boxes.  The roof, metal vessel, concrete slabs and water boxes are examples of passive safety components.  The roof in the [[Chernobyl Power Plant]] complex was made of bitumen – against design – rendering it ignitable.  Unlike the [[Three Mile Island accident]], neither the concrete slabs nor the metal vessel could contain a [[Gasification|steam, graphite and oxygen driven]] hydrogen explosion.  The water boxes could not sustain high pressure failure of the pipes.  The passive safety components as designed were inadequate to fulfill the safety requirements of the system.

The [[General Electric Company]] [[ESBWR]] (Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor, a [[boiling water reactor|BWR]]) is a design reported to use passive safety components.  In the event of [[loss of coolant|coolant loss]], no operator action is required for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gepower.com/about/press/en/2005_press/092605a.htm|title=GE'S advanced ESBWR nuclear reactor chosen for two proposed projects|publisher=GE Energy|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] [[AP1000]] ("AP" standing for "Advanced Passive") uses passive safety components.  In the event of an accident, no operator action is required for 72 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap1000.westinghousenuclear.com/ap1000_nui_pv.html|title=Westinghouse AP1000|publisher=Westinghouse|accessdate=2010-01-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405092747/http://www.ap1000.westinghousenuclear.com/ap1000_nui_pv.html|archivedate=2010-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent version of the Russian [[VVER]] have added a passive heat removal system to the existing active systems, utilising a cooling system and water tanks built on top of the containment dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2060518 |title=Passive safety in VVERs |author=V.G. Asmolov |work=JSC Rosenergoatom |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[integral fast reactor]] was a [[fast breeder reactor]] run by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. It was a sodium cooled reactor capable of withstanding a loss of (coolant) flow without [[SCRAM]] and loss of heatsink without [[SCRAM]]. This was demonstrated throughout a series of safety tests in which the reactor successfully shut down without operator intervention. The project was canceled due to [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation concerns]] before it could be copied elsewhere.

The [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P.N. Haubenreich  |author2=J.R. Engel |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experience with the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment| journal= Nuclear Applications and Technology| year= 1970| pages=118–136| volume=8 |url=http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/NAT_MSREexperience.pdf| format=PDF, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; (MSRE) was a [[molten salt reactor]] run by the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. It was [[nuclear graphite]] moderated and the coolant salt used was [[FLiBe]], which also carried the [[uranium-233]] [[fluoride]] fuel dissolved in it. The MSRE had a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity: as the FLiBe temperature increased, it expanded, along with the uranium ions it carried; this decreased density resulted in a reduction of fissile material in the core, which decreased the rate of fission. With less heat input, the net result was that the reactor would cool. Extending from the bottom of the reactor core was a pipe that lead to passively cooled drain tanks. The pipe had a "freeze valve" along its length, in which the molten salt was actively cooled to a solid plug by a fan blowing air over the pipe. If the reactor vessel developed excessive heat or lost electric power to the air cooling, the plug would melt; the FLiBe would be pulled out of the reactor core by gravity into dump tanks, and criticality would cease as the salt lost contact with the graphite moderator.

The [[General Atomics]] [[High temperature gas reactor|HTGR]] design features a fully passive and inherently safe decay heat removal system, termed the Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS). In this design, an array of steel ducts line the concrete containment (and hence surround the [[reactor pressure vessel]]) which provide a flow path for air driven natural circulation from chimneys positioned above grade. Derivatives of this RCCS concept (with either air or water as the working fluid) has also been featured in other gas-cooled reactor designs, including the Japanese [[High-temperature engineering test reactor]], the Chinese [[HTR-10]], the South African [[Pebble bed modular reactor|PBMR]], and the Russian [[Gas turbine modular helium reactor|GT-MHR]]. While none of these designs have been commercialized for power generation research in these areas is active, specifically in support of the [[Generation IV]] initiative and [[Next Generation Nuclear Plant|NGNP]] programs, with experimental facilities at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (home to the Natural convection Shutdown heat removal Test Facility, a 1/2 scale air-cooled RCCS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/rsta/nstf/|title=The NSTF at Argonne: Passive Safety and Decay Heat Removal for Advanced Nuclear Reactor Designs|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Wisconsin]] (home to separate 1/4 scale air and water-cooled RCCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/document/116903/neup_project_no_09-781_final_report_pdf|title=NEUP final report 09-781: Experimental Studies of NGNP Reactor Cavity Cooling Systems with Water|website=inlportal.inl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/document/87093/21-3079_michael_corradini_pdf |title=NEUP awarded abstract: Modeling and Test Validation of a Reactor Cavity Cooling System with Air|website=inlportal.inl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the air pollution index used in Singapore|air pollution indices in general|Air quality index}}

The '''Pollutant Standards Index''', or '''PSI''', is a type of [[air quality index]], which is a number used to indicate the level of pollutants in air. 

Initially PSI was based on five air pollutants, but since 1 April 2014 it has also included fine [[particulates|particulate matter]] (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;). 

In addition to the PSI derived by averaging data collected for the past 24 hours, Singapore also publishes a 3h-PSI based on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations for the past 3 hours. 1-hr PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are also published every hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSI Reading|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/psi/|publisher=National Environment Agency of Singapore|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Singapore, some other countries also use air quality indices. However, the calculations used to derive their air quality indices may differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) On Haze|url=http://www.haze.gov.sg/faq/faq.aspx|publisher=National Environment Agency of Singapore|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different countries also use different names for their indices such as Air Quality Health Index, Air Pollution Index and Pollutant Standards Index.

==History==
The PSI is based on a scale devised by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) to provide a way for broadcasts and newspapers to report air quality on a daily basis. The PSI has been used in a number of countries including the United States and Singapore. 

Since 1999, the United States EPA has replaced the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) with the [[Air quality index#United States|Air Quality Index]] (AQI) to incorporate new [[Particulate|PM2.5]] and [[ozone]] standards.

Prior to 1 April 2014, Singapore published the PSI and the 1-hour PM2.5 reading separately. This 3-hour PSI is unique to Singapore and was introduced in 1997 to provide additional air quality information which would better reflect a more current air quality situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624081219/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singaporeans-haze-over-psi-readings|title=Govt says it will move towards publishing 24-hour PSI, PM2.5 data on hourly basis|last=|first=|date=20 June 2013|website=|publisher=TODAY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the 3-hour PSI was phased out on the grounds that the 1-hour PM2.5 reading was a better indicator of the current air quality. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/pollution-control/air-pollution/faqs|title=National Environment Agency - Air Pollution FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of the PSI used in Singapore==
The PSI considers six air pollutants - sulphur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). 

The concentrations of these pollutants in the ambient air are measured via a network of air monitoring stations located around Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Written Reply by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources to Parliamentary Question on Air Quality Reporting|url=https://app.mewr.gov.sg/web/contents/contents.aspx?contid=1718|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=Ministry of the Environment &amp; Water Resources (Singapore)|date=10 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191750/https://app.mewr.gov.sg/web/contents/contents.aspx?contid=1718|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A sub-index value is computed for each pollutant based on the pollutant's ambient air concentration. The highest sub-index value is then taken as the PSI value. In other words, the PSI is determined by the pollutant with the most significant concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computation of the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)|url=http://www.haze.gov.sg/docs/default-source/faq/computation-of-the-pollutant-standards-index-%28psi%29.pdf|publisher=National Environment Agency of Singapore|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During [[Southeast Asian haze|haze]] episodes, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is the most significant pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) On Haze|url=http://www.haze.gov.sg/faq|publisher=National Environment Agency of Singapore|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

The PSI is reported as a number on a scale of 0 to 500. The index figures enable the public to determine whether the air pollution levels in a particular location are good, unhealthy, hazardous or worse. The following PSI table is grouped by index values and descriptors, explaining the effects of the levels, according to Singapore's [[National Environment Agency]] (NEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://app2.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution-control/psi| title = PSI Readings| accessdate = 21 January 2014| publisher = National Environment Agency| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140201145028/http://app2.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution-control/psi| archivedate = 1 February 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Southeast Asian haze}}
Singapore has been regularly hit by [[Southeast Asian haze|smoke haze]] from forest fires in nearby [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], brought over by wind. These forest fires have been attributed to the [[slash-and-burn]] method favoured by several large plantation owners to clear their land, as opposed to a more expensive and inconvenient mechanical approach using excavators and bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore hit by highest haze levels in 16 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22935068|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, severe [[haze]] hit [[Singapore]], pushing the nation's PSI into ''Hazardous'' levels for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haze in Singapore hits new high, PSI at 321 at 10pm|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/the-haze-singapore/story/haze-singapore-hits-new-high-psi-321-10pm-20130619|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the highest 3-hour PSI reading on record in [[Singapore]] is 471 on 20 October 2015 at 11 pm (GMT+8).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/pm25-levels-hit-471-haze-situation-worsens|title=PM2.5 levels hit 471 as haze situation worsens|publisher=Today|date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15269">'''Seasonal adjustment''' is a [[statistical]] method for removing the [[Seasonality|seasonal component]] of a [[time series]] that exhibits a seasonal pattern. It is usually done when wanting to analyse the trend, and cyclical deviations from trend, of a time series independently of the seasonal components. It is normal to report seasonally adjusted data for unemployment rates to reveal the underlying trends and cycles in labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/seasfaq.htm|title=What is seasonal adjustment?|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220031628/http://www.bls.gov/cps/seasfaq.htm|archivedate=2011-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many economic phenomena have seasonal cycles, such as [[Pork cycle|agricultural production]] and consumer consumption, e.g. greater consumption leading up to [[Christmas]]. It is necessary to adjust for this component in order to understand what underlying trends are in the economy and so [[official statistics]] are often adjusted to remove seasonal components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/17/retail-spending-rise-uk-recession |date=17 February 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Retail spending rise boosts hopes UK can avoid double-dip recession |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308150132/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/17/retail-spending-rise-uk-recession |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time series components==
{{Main|Decomposition of time series}}
The investigation of many economic time series becomes problematic due to seasonal fluctuations. Time series are made up of four components:

*&lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;: The seasonal component
*&lt;math&gt;T_t&lt;/math&gt;: The [[Trend estimation|trend]] component
*&lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt;: The [[Periodic sequence|cyclical]] component
*&lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt;: The [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error]], or irregular component.

The difference between seasonal and cyclic patterns:
*Seasonal patterns have a fixed and known length, while cyclic patterns have variable and unknown length.
*Cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period (duration usually of at least 2 years).
*The average length of a cycle is usually longer than that of seasonality.
*The magnitude of cyclic variation is usually more variable than that of seasonal variation.&lt;ref name="otexts.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1|title=2.1 Graphics - OTexts|author=|date=|website=www.otexts.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117032938/https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1|archivedate=2018-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between decomposition of time series components
*Additive decomposition: &lt;math&gt;Y_t = S_t + T_t + C_t + E_t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Y_t&lt;/math&gt; is the data at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  
*Multiplicative decomposition: &lt;math&gt;Y_t = S_t \cdot T_t \cdot C_t \cdot E_t&lt;/math&gt;.  
*Logs turn multiplicative relationship into an additive relationship: &lt;math&gt;Y_t = S_t \cdot T_t \cdot C_t \cdot E_t \Rightarrow \log Y_t = \log S_t + \log T_t + \log C_t + \log E_t&lt;/math&gt;:
*An additive model appropriate if the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations does not vary with level.
*If seasonal fluctuations are proportional to level of series, then a multiplicative model is appropriate. Multiplicative decomposition more prevalent with economic series.

==Seasonal adjustment==
{{cleanup|section|reason=make less terse; what is the number 6 at start of last paragraph?|date=March 2017}}

Unlike the trend and cyclical components, seasonal components, theoretically, happen with similar magnitude during the same time period each year. The seasonal components of a series are sometimes considered to be uninteresting and to hinder the interpretation of a series. Removing the seasonal component directs focus on other components and will allow better analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/const/www/faq2.html|title=MCD - Seasonal Adjustment Frequently Asked Questions|author=|date=|website=www.census.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113192428/http://www.census.gov/const/www/faq2.html|archivedate=2017-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different statistical research groups have developed different methods of seasonal adjustment, for example X-13-ARIMA and  [[X-12-ARIMA]] developed by the [[United States Census Bureau]]; [[TRAMO]]/SEATS developed by the [[Bank of Spain]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2398|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - Seasonal adjustment Definition|first=OECD Statistics|last=Directorate|date=|website=stats.oecd.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234157/https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2398|archivedate=2014-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.bls.gov/osmr/pdf/ec140040.pdf MoveReg] (for weekly data) developed by the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], STAMP developed by a group led by S. J. Koopman;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stamp-software.com/stamp.html|title=STAMP|author=|date=|website=www.stamp-software.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170945/http://www.stamp-software.com/stamp.html|archivedate=2015-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess” (STL) developed by Cleveland et al. (1990).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/5|title=6.5 STL decomposition {{!}} OTexts|website=www.otexts.org|access-date=2016-05-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512020106/https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/5|archivedate=2018-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While X-12/13-ARIMA can only be applied to monthly or quarterly data, STL decomposition can be used on data with any type of seasonality. Furthermore, unlike X-12-ARIMA, STL allows the user to control the degree of smoothness of the trend cycle and how much the seasonal component changes over time. X-12-ARIMA can handle both additive and multiplicative decomposition whereas STL can only be used for additive decomposition. In order to achieve a multiplicative decomposition using STL, the user can take the log of the data before decomposing, and then back-transform after the decomposition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Brief introduction to process of X-12-ARIMA:

For example: description assumes monthly data.
Additive decomposition: &lt;math&gt;Y_t = S_t + T_t + C_t + E_t&lt;/math&gt;:
Multiplicative decomposition: &lt;math&gt;Y_t = S_t \cdot T_t \cdot C_t \cdot E_t&lt;/math&gt;
*1. Using moving-average smoothing method to estimate the trend-cycle for all periods. In the monthly data, use 12-month centered moving average is appropriate to be applied to estimate the trend-cycle component. 
*2. Ratios of data to trend computed(called“centered ratios”)---which means remove the smoothed series from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to leave &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.  
*3. Separate 3 * 3 MA (moving average) applied to each month of centered ratios to form rough estimate of &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;.
*4. Divide centered ratios by estimate of &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; to get estimate of &lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt;.
*5. Reduce extreme value of &lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt;
*6. Multiply by &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; to get modified centered ratios. 
*7. Take another 3 * 3 MA of each month of the year individually applied to modified ratios to get revised &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;.
*8. Original data divided by new estimate of &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; gives the preliminary seasonally adjusted series.
*9. Trend-cycle estimated by applying a weighted Henderson MA to the preliminary seasonally adjusted values.
*10. Repeat Step 2. New ratios are obtained by dividing the original data by the new estimated trend-cycle
*11. Repeat Steps 3–6 using new ratios and applying a 3 * 5 MA instead of a 3 * 3 MA.
*12. Repeat Step 7 but using a 3 * 5 MA instead of a 3 * 3 MA, that is taking  5 * 3 MA of each month of the year individually by using the modified data applied to modified ratios to get revised &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;.
*13. Repeat Step 8 but using the new seasonal component obtained in Step 12 to obtain seasonally adjusted values.
*14. Remainder component obtained by dividing seasonally adjusted data from Step 13 by the trend-cycle obtained in Step 9.
*15. Extreme values of remainder component are reduced as in Step 5. 
*16. A series of modified data is obtained by multiplying the trend-cycle, seasonal component, and adjusted irregular component together.

Repeat whole process two more times with modified data. On final iteration, the 3 * 5 MA of Steps 11 and 12 is replaced by either a 3 * 3, 3 * 5, or 3 * 9 moving average, depending on the variability in the data.

6. Time series
Each group provides software supporting their methods. Some versions are also included as parts of larger products, and some are commercially available. For example, [[SAS programming language|SAS]] includes X-12-ARIMA, while Oxmetrics includes STAMP. A recent move by public organisations to harmonise seasonal adjustment practices has resulted in the development of [[Demetra+]] by [[Eurostat]] and [[National Bank of Belgium]] which currently includes both X-12-ARIMA and TRAMO/SEATS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = OECD | first = Short-Term Economic Statistics Expert Group | title =  Harmonising Seasonal Adjustment Methods in European Union and OECD Countries | date = June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R (programming language)|R]] includes STL decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/4|title=6.4 X-12-ARIMA decomposition {{!}} OTexts|last=Hyndman|first=R.J|date=|website=www.otexts.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117033723/https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/4|archivedate=2018-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The X-12-ARIMA method can be utilized via the R package "X12" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/x12/x12.pdf|title=Xx12|last=Kowarik|first=Alexander|date=February 20, 2015|website=cran.r-project.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206010053/https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/x12/x12.pdf|archivedate=December 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[EViews]] supports X-12, X-13, Tramo/Seats, STL and MoveReg.

==Example==
One well-known example is the rate of [[unemployment]], which is represented by a time series. This rate depends particularly on seasonal influences, which is why it is important to free the unemployment rate of its seasonal component. Such seasonal influences can be due to school graduates or dropouts looking to enter into the workforce and regular fluctuations during holiday periods. Once the seasonal influence is removed from this time series, the unemployment rate data can be meaningfully compared across different months and predictions for the future can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1|title=6.1 Time series components - OTexts|author=|date=|website=www.otexts.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512020106/https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1|archivedate=2018-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal adjustment is used in the official statistics implemented by statistical software like [[Demetra+]].

When seasonal adjustment is not performed with monthly data, year-on-year changes are utilised in an attempt to avoid contamination with seasonality.

==Moves to standardise seasonal adjustment processes==
Due to the various seasonal adjustment practices by different institutions, a group was created by Eurostat and the [[European Central Bank]] to promote standard processes. In 2009 a small group composed of experts from [[European Union]] statistical institutions and central banks produced the [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5910549/KS-RA-09-006-EN.PDF ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment], which is being implemented in all the European Union statistical institutions. It is also being adopted voluntarily by other public statistical institutions outside the European Union.

==Use of seasonally adjusted data in regressions==

By the [[Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem]] it does not matter whether [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]s for all but one of the seasons are introduced into the regression equation, or if the independent variable is first seasonally adjusted (by the same dummy variable method), and the regression then run.

Since seasonal adjustment introduces a "non-revertible" moving average (MA) component into time series data, [[unit root]] tests (such as the [[Phillips–Perron test]]) will be [[Bias (statistics)|biased]] towards non-rejection of the unit root [[Null hypothesis|null]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maddala |first=G. S. |last2=Kim |first2=In-Moo |title=Unit Roots, Cointegration, and Structural Change |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-521-58782-4 |pages=364–365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings of using seasonally adjusted data==

Use of seasonally adjusted time series data can be misleading. This is because the seasonally adjusted series contains both the [[Trend estimation|trend]]-[[Periodic sequence|cycle]] component and the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error]] component. As such, the seasonally adjusted data will not be "smooth" and what appears to be "downturns" or "upturns" may actually be randomness in the data. For this reason, if the purpose is finding turning points in a series, it is better to use the trend-cycle component rather than the seasonally adjusted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyndman|first1=Rob J|last2=Athanasopoulos|first2=George|title=Forecasting: principles and practice|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1|accessdate=20 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512020106/https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1|archivedate=12 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24884">The '''soil biomantle''' can be described and defined in several ways. Most simply, the [[soil]] biomantle is the organic-rich bioturbated upper part of the soil, including the [[topsoil]] where most biota live, reproduce, die, and become assimilated. The biomantle is thus the upper zone of soil that is predominantly a product of organic activity and the area where [[bioturbation]] is a dominant process. Soil bioturbation consists predominantly of three subsets: ''faunalturbation'' (animal burrowings), ''floralturbation'' (root growth, tree-uprootings), and ''fungiturbation'' ([[mycelia]] growth). All three processes promote soil parent material destratification, mixing, and often particle size sorting, leading with other processes to the formation of soil and its horizons. While the general term bioturbation refers mainly to these three mixing processes, unless otherwise specified it is commonly used as a synonym to faunalturbation (animal burrowings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schaetzl, R.J.  |author2=S.

==One- and two-layered biomantles, soil stonelayers (stone lines)==
The biomantle includes the topsoil, or [[A horizon]] of soils, and also, any underlying lighter-colored (E) horizon that may be present. For [[midlatitude]] and [[subtropical]] soils that have typical A-E-B-C horizons and profiles, the biomantle is normally that part above the [[B horizon]].

Since midlatitude type Bt (argillic) horizons are often lacking in [[tropical]] soils owing to an abundance of active and deep bioturbators that move large volumes of soil to the surface ([[ants]], [[termites]], [[worm]]s, etc.), horizon notations are: M-SL-W, where M is the mineral soil (extended topsoil), SL is stonelayer, and W is the underlying weathered or [[saprolite]] zone.&lt;ref name="Johnson, D.L. 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.P. 1961.

Stonelayers occupy the base of biomantles in many, if not most, tropical soils and in many midlatitude soils. Where present they often function as subsurface “[[French drains]]” for soil-water movements and storage.&lt;ref name="Johnson, D.L. 2002"/&gt;

==Biomantles and hydropedology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.5194/hess-14-25-2010|author=Lin H. |year=2010|title=Earth's Critical Zone and hydropedology: concepts, characteristics, and advances|journal= Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.|volume= 14|pages= 25–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; processes==
Because the soil biomantle is the main zone of bioturbation, it is invariably permeable and of low density. It thus plays several essential hydropedological roles in the environment. For example, it promotes the downward percolation of rainwater and snowmelt through often-abundant biochannels and interconnected biopores. The biomantle also promotes downslope soil-water (throughflow, interflow) movements if it is formed above a clay-enriched Bt (argillic) horizon, or above some other dense subsoil horizon (e.g., duripan, fragipan, etc.) or bedrock – all of which generally function as aquitards or aquicludes to vertical soil water flow. In such cases the stonelayer, if present, can actually function as an aquifer for free water flow. Hence it is not uncommon to see soil water seepage above Bt horizons on slopes where soil stonelayers outcrop. Ground water recharge can occur through any of these biomantle-related processes. Recharge, of course, can also occur when the soil dries appreciably and shrinks, as during droughts, which allows vertical leakage to temporarily occur immediately after drought-breaking rainfalls.

==Pedosphere, critical zone, biomantle interrelationships==
The [[pedosphere]], or soil, is the planetary interface where Earth’s five great global ‘spheres’ interact. These are the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and pedosphere. The "[[critical zone]]", a recent conceptual framework, encompasses the Earth’s outer layer in which most surface and near-surface life sustaining processes operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2006AGUFM.H11G..06J |title=The Biomantle-Critical Zone Model |journal=American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2006, abstract #H11G-06 |author1=Johnson, D. L. |author2=Lin, H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice and theory, the critical zone essentially equates to the pedosphere, whereas the ‘biomantle’ deals with the uppermost critical zone, or pedosphere, encompassing its epidermal layer (where most biota live).&lt;ref&gt;NRC (National Research Council). 2001.

==Latitudinal differences in biomantle thickness==
In midlatitude soils where most bioturbation is relatively shallow, seasonal, and without many bioturbators, the biomantle is relatively thin, often less than 1–2 m thick. However, in humid tropical and subtropical erosionally stable regions where both greater volumes of soil are biotransfered and deeper bioturbations occur—and bioturbation is year-round and performed by more invertebrate animals (termites, ants, worms, etc.), the biomantle is often thicker, sometimes 5–6 m or more thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Breeman (van), N. and P. Buurman|year= 2002|title=Soil Formation |edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Kluwer Academic Publishers|place= Dordrecht-Boston-London|isbn=0-7923-5263-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where such soils are formed in conjunction with saprolite production, the biomantle is the bioturbated zone above the structured (unbioturbated) saprolite, with its base commonly defined by a stonelayer. In most subtropical and tropical areas where deep and large volume bioturbators dwell, and in some midlatitudes like South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Fey, M.V. 2009. Soils of South Africa.

Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; such thick, two-layered biomantles (those with stonelayers) above structured saprolite are very common.

==Whole soil biomantles==
In some desert soils, in many mountain soils with moderate to steep slopes, in many recently eroded bedrock soils, and in various other soils, the biomantle constitutes the entire soil. That is, neither soil horizons nor weathering zones underlie the biomantle. Such biomantles are ''whole-soil biomantles''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==The biofabric of biomantles==
As originally defined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00010694-199002000-00004|author=Johnson, D.L.|year= 1990|title= Biomantle evolution and the redistribution of Earth materials and artifacts|journal= Soil Science |volume=149|pages= 84–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; a biomantle must exhibit at least 50% [[biofabric]]. This criterion denotes small, often pelletized microbiofabric and mesobiofabric produced by invertebrates (ants, worms, termites), usually observed under hand lens or higher magnification (soil thin sections). The criterion, however, becomes moot and irrelevant in the case of megabiofabric produced in some biomantles – namely the cloddy and chunky surface-spoil heaps produced by small-to-large burrowing vertebrates  (rodents, badgers, aardvarks, elephants) and by tree uprooting.

==Dynamic denudation, bioturbation and soil biomantle formation==
The biomantle is an organic-rich near-surface layer in which bioturbation is a dominant process, with all other biological and more traditional soil processes normally being subsidiary (e.g., organic matter productions, eluviations-illuviations, weathering-biochemical transformations, wind and water erosions-depositions, freeze-thaw, dilations-contractions, shrink-swell, gravity movements, geochemical-capillary surface-wickings and precipitations, etc.). The expression ''dynamic denudation'' is the sum of all these processes, with bioturbation and organic impacts commonly dominant.&lt;ref name="Johnson, D.L., J.E.J. Domier, and D.N. Johnson"/&gt;

The role of plants in soil formation is undisputedly great, both agronomically and silviculturally, and is well appreciated and reasonably well understood by geomorphologists, pedologists, soil scientists, farmers, gardeners, and others.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/S98005|author=Gould, S.F. |year=1998|title=Proteoid root mats stabilize Hawkesbury Sandstone biomantles following fire|journal= Australian Journal of Soil Research|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1033–1044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/x89-001|author=Schaetzl, R.J., D.L.

Wilkinson and Humphreys offer evidence that “bioturbation appears to be the most active pedogenic process operating in many soils.”&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, M.T. and G.S. Humphreys"/&gt; While probably close to the mark, research over multiple decades strongly indicates that bioturbation is the dominant process in the upper part of most soils, notable exceptions possibly being [[vertisols]] and [[cryosols]], where shrink-swell and freeze-thaw processes, respectively, appear dominant.

==Three notable bioturbation sub-processes and associated particle comminutions==

Soil bioturbations consist of three upper soil disorganizing and organizing sub-processes that can overlap, and that collectively promote particle abrasions and size reductions, termed "[[particle comminution]]". The three bioturbation sub-processes are ''biomixing'', ''biotransfers'', and ''biosorting''.

''Biomixing'' refers to the kind of soil bioturbations typically caused by surface-, shallow-, and intermediate-burrowing vertebrates, such as rodents (pocket gophers, tuco-tucos, mole-rats), insectivores (moles), mustelids (badgers), canids (wolves, coyotes, foxes), marsupials (marsupial moles, wombats), aardvarks, armadillos, pigs, and other similar organisms. Though animal bioturbations are dominant, tree uprooting is still an important process.

''Biotransfers'' refers to transfers of soil by animals, [[vertebrates]] or [[invertebrates]], either to the surface, within the biomantle, or from lower levels. Biotransfers can be effected by any burrowing animal, but the term is most applicable to deep burrowing, so-called conveyor-belt animals, such as ants, termites, and worms. Termites, for example, may burrow downward many meters into weathered and unweathered parent material to collect moist soil for constructing their surface mounds (termitaria). Ants, particularly [[leaf-cutter ants]], can also biotransfer tremendous amounts of soil to the surface in the process of excavating their innumerable multipurpose subterranean chambers. Enormous amounts of soil and sediment are annually biotransferred onto tropical-subtropical landscapes in this process, and even onto some midlatitude landscapes (e.g., Texas, Louisiana), resulting in notably thick biomantles on stable (low slope) surfaces.

''Biosorting'' refers to particle sorting, typically in gravelly (mixed particle) soils, that leads to the formation of a stonelayer (SL) horizon at the base of the biomantle, which results in a two-layered biomantle. The process begins as animals burrow and only soil particles smaller than their burrow diameters are moved; larger particles settle downward as smaller particles are moved upward from below them. The stonelayer (SL) forms at rates roughly proportional to the numbers of bioturbators and the intensity and style of burrowing. Conveyor-belt soil invertebrates (ants, termites, worms, etc.) are the primary biosorters in most tropical, subtropical, and some midlatitude soils, and thus often produce deep, two-layered biomantles if the soils contain gravels, as many do. Small fossorial vertebrates ([[pocket gophers]], [[mole (animal)|moles]], [[tuco tucos]], etc.), on the other hand, tend to be dominant biosorters in many midlatitude soils, especially [[deserts]], [[prairies]], and [[steppes]]. In more humid areas, like northeastern U.S. and W. Europe, conveyor-belt ants and worms are probably dominant or co-dominant.

Humans have often colonized areas in the temperate deciduous forest. They have harvested [[wood]] for [[timber]] and [[charcoal]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, J. D. 1982. Deforestation, erosion, and forest management in ancient Greece and Rome. Journal of Forest History 26: 60–75.&lt;/ref&gt; During the settlement of North America, [[potash]] made from tree ashes was exported back to Europe as fertilizer. This left less than one-quarter of original forests to remain. Many forests are now small fragments dissected by fields and roads; these islands of green often differ substantially from the original forests, particularly along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcove, D. S., C. H. McLellan, and [[A. P. Dobson]]. 1986. Habitat fragmentation in the temperate zone. pp. 237–256. In M. E. Soul´e (ed.) Conservation B; the Science of Scarcity and Diversity. Sunderland: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, L. D. 1984. The Fragmented Forest: Island Biogeography Theory and the Preservation of Biotic Diversity. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of exotic diseases continues to be a threat to forest trees, and hence, the forest;&lt;ref&gt;Little, C. E. 1995. The Dying of the Trees: The Pandemic in America’s Forests. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; examples include the loss of chestnut and elm.  At the same time, species such as deer, which are clearing rather than true forest animals, have expanded their range and proliferated in these altered landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Latham, R. E., J. Beyea, M. Benner, C.A. Dunn, M. A. Fajvan, R.R. Freed, M. Grund, S. B. Horsley, A. F. Rhoads, and B. P. Shissler. 2005. Managing White-tailed Deer in Forest Habitat from an Ecosystem Perspective: Pennsylvania Case Study. Harrisburg: Audubon Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Habitat Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large deer populations have deleterious effects on tree regeneration overall, but particularly for edible species including yew, yellow birch, and hemlock.  Deer grazing also has significant negative effects on the number and kind of herbaceous flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;Latham, R. E., J. Beyea, M. Benner, C.A. Dunn, M. A. Fajvan, R.R. Freed, M. Grund, S. B. Horsley, A. F. Rhoads, and B. P. Shissler. 2005. Managing White-tailed Deer in Forest Habitat from an Ecosystem Perspective: Pennsylvania Case Study. Harrisburg: Audubon Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Habitat Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing pressure to increase deer populations, and the continued killing of top carnivores, suggests that overgrazing by deer will continue to be a significant forest conservation problem. Objective criteria for the restoration of deciduous forest include large trees, coarse woody debris, spring ephemeral, and top predators.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. and C. G.Drummond. 1996. Ecological properties for the evaluation, management, and restoration of temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. Ecological Applications 6: 748–762.&lt;/ref&gt;
