'''Alexandru Nicolau''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Александрович Николау}}; January 1889 – September 27, 1937) was a [[Romania]]n lawyer, [[socialism|socialist]] and later [[communism|communist]] activist. Active in the Romanian and [[France|French]] socialist movements before and during [[World War I]], he left for [[Russia]] during the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolutions]]. There, he became one of the organisers of Romanian [[Military volunteer|volunteer]] detachments in support of the [[Soviet (council)#Russian Revolution of 1917|Soviets]]. Arrested shortly after returning to Romania in 1920, he left for [[Soviet Russia]] after a successful prison escape. During the later part of his life he held teaching positions at several Soviet universities, before falling victim to the [[Great Purge]] in 1937. His name was posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] both in the Soviet Union and in his native Romania.

==Biography==

===Early life and activity===
Nicolau was born in [[Bucharest]] in 1889. As a student at the [[Saint Sava National College|Saint Sava High School]], he befriended [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]] and [[Mihail Cruceanu]], both of whom would later become known as socialist militants.{{sfn|Cruceanu|1973|p=131}} After finishing his secondary education, Nicolau trained as a lawyer, receiving a degree from the local [[University of Bucharest|University]], a [[PhD]] in [[Paris]], before being admitted to the [[Bucharest Bar]]. His first contacts with the Romanian socialist movement, still in disarray during that period, came through his membership in the Bucharest's Study Circle of the Socialist Students between 1908 and 1909. Soon after he began writing for ''[[România Muncitoare]]'', the main socialist press venue. One of his first notable contributions was his correspondence from [[Italy]], criticising the [[Reformism|reformist]] stance of the local socialist party.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|pp=267-268}} In 1911, ''România Muncitoare'' published Nicolau's [[Antimilitarism|anti-militarist]] manifesto ''To the recruits''.{{Sfn|Liveanu|1967|p=895}} Recalling the army's contribution in suppressing the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 Peasants' revolt]], the brochure called on the new [[Army recruit|recruits]] to choose a different path and refuse to support the government crackdown on the demands of the workers and the peasant. As a result, in May 1912 he was put under trial before the Court of the [[Ilfov County]], where he reaffirmed the ideas expressed in the manifesto. Defended by fellow socialists [[Mihail Gh. Bujor]], [[Toma Dragu]] and Titel Petrescu, and by socialist sympathizer [[Constantin Mille]], Nicolau was eventually acquitted by the jury.{{sfn|Calendarul Muncei|1913|p=89}}{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|pp=269-271}}{{sfn|Petrescu|n.d|pp=245-246}} In June 1912, along with [[Constantin Dobrogeanu Gherea]], [[Ecaterina Arbore]] and others, he represented the Bucharest Socialist Club at the Fifth Congress of the [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Social Democratic Party of Romania]] (PSDR),{{sfn|Bacalbaşa|1936|p=95}} being elected a member in the committee of the [[Cercul de Editură Socialistă|party's publishing house]].{{sfn|Calendarul Muncei|1913|p=65}} In order to escape harassment from the authorities, Nicolau chose to leave Romania for Paris, where he continued his law studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and joined the [[French Section of the Workers' International]].{{sfn|Memorial}}{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}}{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=410}}

===World War I and Russian Revolution===
In 1916, Romania joined [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] and imposed an immediate ban on the local socialist movement, which had adopted a militant [[pacifism|pacifist]] stance. Nicolau reacted by publishing in Paris a study highly critical of the Romanian ruling classes, titled ''The Crime of the Romanian Oligarchy''. Returning to Romania later in the war, he was kept under constant surveillance by [[Siguranța]], the secret police.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}} Nicolau was present in Iaşi during the revolutionary agitation which emerged during the 1917 [[May Day]] celebrations and under the impression of the [[February Revolution]]. Along the other social-democrats, he supported the position of the PSD leader [[Christian Rakovsky]], who believed the situation in Romania was not ripe for the overthrow of the monarchy.{{Sfn|Matichescu|1967|p=870}}{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}}

[[File:Romanian Revolutionaries in Odessa, 1918.jpg|thumb|300px|Romania volunteer regiment marching in Odessa in January 1918]]
Joining [[Christian Rakovsky]] and Bujor, Nicolau left in June 1917 for Russia,{{sfn|Petrescu|n.d|pp=292-293}} where he entered the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)]].{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=67}} He settled in [[Odessa]] and, along with Bujor, [[Ion Dic Dicescu]], and [[Alter Zalic]], he was one of the organisers and afterwards leaders of the ''Romanian Committee for Social-Democratic Action'' established in the city.{{Sfn|Unc|1967|p=847}}{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}}{{Sfn|Liveanu|1967|p=895}}{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=67}} Nicolau also became the editor of ''Lupta'' ("The Struggle"), which presented itself as the successor of ''România Muncitoare'' (renamed in 1914 to ''Lupta zilnică'', "The Daily Struggle").{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}}{{Sfn|Liveanu|1967|p=895}} After the [[October Revolution]], the Romanian socialists in Odessa saluted the new developments. Becoming increasingly communist in outlook, they also began agitating for a revolution in their home country.{{Sfn|Unc|1967|p=848}} Such views were publicly expressed by Nicolau during his speech at the 2nd Congress of [[Rumcherod]].{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=410}} In order to help the Soviets secure power in Southern Russia, on December 28, 1917, the Committee established the ''Romanian Revolutionary Military Committee'', which counted Nicolau, Bujor, and Dicescu among its leaders.{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=411}} The Revolutionary Committee worked in close cooperation with the Rumcherod, which provided it with material support.{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=412}} During the following period, two Romanian volunteer battalions were established by recruiting Romanian soldiers in [[Bessarabia]] and the Russian [[Black Sea]] ports, as well as workers who had been evacuated to Southern Russia.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}}{{Sfn|Unc|1967|p=849}}{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|pp=413-414}} Between January and March 1918, the volunteers participated along the local [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] in battles against the troops of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the regular Romanian Army which had occupied Bessarabia, as well as against the [[Central Powers]] armies advancing from the Northwest.{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|pp=414-415}}

The occupation of Odessa by [[Austro-Hungary|Austro]]-[[German Empire|German]] troops in the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] forced the volunteer battalions to retreat to [[Crimea]] and central Russia, with the members of the Action Committee either going underground or leaving for Russian areas still under Soviet control.{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=416}} In August 1918, Nicolau, Dicescu and the other former members of the Action Committee which had reached [[Moscow]] created the ''Romanian Communist Revolutionary Committee''. The new committee, proclaimed the official representative of the PSDR in Russia, established contacts with the socialists in Bucharest and initiated an outreach campaign amongst the Romanian POWs in Russia. In late 1918, the Committee joined another Romanian group, the [[Agrarian socialism|radical agrarian]] ''[[Romanian Revolutionary Peasants' Party]]'', to form an unified ''Romanian Communist group'' of the [[Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks)]]. Nicolau was elected the group's chairman, with another PSDR member, Ion Penţa, being elected secretary and representative to the [[Federation of Foreign Groups]]. Nicolau also began publishing regularly in ''Foaia ţăranului'', the former organ of the Revolutionary Peasants' Party.{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=418}} In 1919 the Publishing House of the Romanian Communist Groups in Soviet Russia published Nicolau's brochure ''The Socialist Revolution in Romania''.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}} The pamphlet acknowledged the Bolshevik support for the Romanian communists, and called on Romanians to follow the revolutionary path taken by the Russian communists under the leadership of [[Lenin]].{{sfn|Manusevich|Birman|Klevanskiy|Khrenov|1967|p=419}} During August 1919, as the Soviets regained Odessa, Nicolau was one of the editors of the short-lived newspaper ''[[Scînteia|Scânteea]]''.

===Later life and death===
Alexandru Nicolau returned to Romania in 1920, however he was soon apprehended by the authorities, and imprisoned in [[Jilava]] along with a larger group of communists, including [[Alecu Constantinescu]]. The group made a successful bid for escape on the night of December 2, 1920, and, following a short stay in [[Bulgaria]], most escapees made their way to [[Moscow]].{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=271}}{{Sfn|Liveanu|1967|p=895}} On March 31, 1931, Nicolau was [[Trial in absentia|sentenced in absentia]] to death by the Romanian authorities.{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=272}} In [[Soviet Russia]], he joined the local group of Romanian communists, and participated as a non-voting delegate in the [[Comintern#Third World Congress|Third World Congress]] of the [[Communist International]], held in Moscow in June 1921.{{Sfn|Stănescu|1971|p=61}} Nicolau also joined the Romanian section of the [[Communist University of the National Minorities of the West]], where he lectured on topics such as history and social sciences, and worked as a teacher for the [[Moscow State Linguistic University|Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages]].{{sfn|Memorial}}{{sfn|Popescu-Puţuri|Georgescu|1971|p=272}}

Nicolau was among the Romanian Communist refugees in Soviet Russia who in 1924 signed a memorandum calling for the creation of a [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] national territory inside the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], near the disputed border with Romania. Along with Dicescu, the main author of the document, Nicolau considered Moldovans to be [[Romanians]], and saw the new polity primarily as a base for propaganda across the [[Dniester]], in Bessarabia and Romania. Such views were however rejected by the Bessarabian Communists who, after gaining the support of the Ukrainian leadership, enforced a cultural policy emphasizing the distinctiveness of Moldovan identity in the newly created [[Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Galuschenko|2009}}

Arrested on August 14, 1937, during the [[Stalinist purges]], Nicolau was sentenced to death on September 27, 1937 by the [[Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR]] on fabricated charges of "espionage and involvement in counter-revolutionary terrorist organisations". He was executed on the same day, and buried in the [[Donskoy Cemetery]] in Moscow.

He was posthumously rehabilitated on September 15, 1956, through a decision of the Soviet Supreme Court during the [[De-Stalinization|De-Stalinisation]] campaign.{{sfn|Memorial}} In a symbolic gesture, his name was also rehabilitated in Romania during the April 1968 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]].

'''Anne Emily Cummins''' (12 October 1869 – 8 February 1936) was an early [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Medical social work|medical social worker]] who was later called the "mother of almoners".

==Life==
Cummins was born in [[Reigate]] in 1869. She was educated at Kensington high school and first went to work as a governess. She briefly worked as a teacher before deciding that social work should be her career. She had a natural ability to understand and assist. She was taken on by the [[Charity Organization Society]] who sent her to train under Edith Mudd who was an early [[almoner]]. She trained and then worked at [[St. Thomas's Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name=ll/&gt; Cummins is creditted with inventing the role of a modern social worker attached to a hospital. Her first priorities were patients who had tuberculosis and those who were expectant mothers.&lt;ref name="Burnham2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Burnham|title=The Social Worker Speaks: A History of Social Workers Through the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOgCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=24 February 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-01546-8|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with the [[Southwark Health Society]] she started regular visits for pregnant women. She would advise on health and cleanliness as well as advising on the care of babies. She encouraged mothers to feed their babies milk having observed three month old babies being given pickles and fried fish.&lt;ref name=ll/&gt; Cummins wanted the families to be self reliant and she set up self help groups. In fact when free meals were offered for Lambeth mothers she opposed this as she felt that the meals might encourage families to rely on charity.&lt;ref name="Burnham2016"/&gt;

After 1909, [[Stafford Northcote (1909?)|Stafford Northcote]] established a trust in the memory of [[Cicely Northcote]].&lt;ref name=ll/&gt; This money meant Cummins could offer a comprehensive service. She has been called the "mother of almoners".&lt;ref name="Burnham2016"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Cummins died in [[Broughton, Hampshire|Broughton]].&lt;ref name=ll&gt;Baraclough, J. (2004-09-23). Cummins, Anne Emily (1869–1936), social worker. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

'''Archibald Trojan Steele''' (25 June 1903 [[Toronto]], Ontario  - 26 February 1992 [[Sedona]], Arizona) was an American foreign or war correspondent for [[United Press]], the [[New York Times]], the [[Chicago Daily News]] and, the [[New York Herald Tribune]].&lt;ref name="LA Times" &gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-13/news/mn-3615_1_inside-china Archibald T. Steele; Journalist Reported From China in the '30s]," [[Los Angeles Times]] (March 13, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; He covered China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa from the early 1930s until his retirement in 1960. He then published several books, and is known for filing reports of the [[Nanjing Massacre]] in 1937 that first informed the world of the activities of the Japanese Army.

In 1950 Steele was co-winner of a [[George Polk award]], given by [[Long Island University]], for reporting on China for ''The New York Herald Tribune''. In 1955 he won a [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes|Maria Moors Cabot medal]], given by Columbia University, for articles in ''The Herald Tribune'' about a journey with his wife from Alaska to Chile. In 1966, he was named by Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] to a panel of nineteen experts to advise on US policy on China &lt;ref name="Rusk"&gt;{{cite| journal = New York Times|title = 19 Experts on Asia Are Named by Rusk as Advisory Panel| date = November 11, 1966| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/11/11/82952102.html?zoom=15.16&amp;pageNumber=19| ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele recalled that "When I returned from the Orient I would usually take refuge in [[Boise, Idaho]], capital of the potato state. Usually the State Department didn't even know that I was in the country. I was never sought out when I returned from China."{{sfnb|MacKinnon|1987 |p = 172-173}} [[Steven W. Mosher]]'s book, ''[[China Misperceived]]''  included Steele in his criticisms of the [[China Hands]], the diplomats and journalists who were held responsible for the [[loss of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Mosher |first =  Steven W. |authorlink = Steven W. Mosher|year = 1990 |title = China Misperceived: American Illusions and Chinese Reality |publisher = Basic Books| location = New York |isbn =| pp = 63, 69 |ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to these and other comments, the journalist [[Harrison Salisbury]] wrote in 1991 that Steele deserved "a special place in the journalist's Hall of Fame." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title = A Chinese Dissident: The Pertinent Views of Fang Lizhi||journal = Chicago Tribune |date  = April 21, 1991|last = Salisbury| first = Harrison | authorlink = Harrison Salisbury|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-04-21/entertainment/9102050470_1_fang-lizhi-great-wall-china | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and education==
Steele was born to James Arthur and Clara (Trojan) Steele in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada on June 25, 1903. He had six brothers and sisters. In 1915 the family moved to [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, then [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], Idaho, before Boise, Idaho, where they stayed. Steele graduated from [[Stanford University]] in 1924, and then became a cub reporter for the Capital News in Boise. He moved to [[Downey, California]], where he wrote for the ''Willows Journal''.&lt;ref name="Biographical Note" &gt;[http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/asu/steele.xml&amp;doc.view=print;chunk.id=0 Biographical Note A. T. Steele Papers 1931-1982, 1995-1999] Arizona State University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]], Steele owned ''The Downey Champion'', a small weekly newspaper in California, when the Japanese invaded Manchuria beginning September 18, 1931. He recalled later that "Up to that moment I had had no interest whatever in China. My sole interest was in the orange crop around Downey, California, where I was working, and in trying to keep my head above water." Rather than remain and go slowly bankrupt, Steele turned the newspaper over to his business manager, gathered a small amount of cash and took a ship named ''Taiyo Maru'' for Shanghai. Steele knew little about China and had no prospects for a job, but arrived just before the Japanese attack on Shanghai in 1931, and soon was hired to cover the war.{{sfnb|MacKinnon|1987| p = 30-31}}

Steele later explained that "one could get a very quick education" in those days because "Shanghai was an international city with its International Settlement and French Concession and a very large and lively Chinese population." He added that "it might not all be accurate, but it would certainly teach you in a very short time to take a strong position on China."  He found himself disagreeing with resident foreigners who asked "What's wrong with China?" When the [[Battle of Shanghai]] began in 1937, he could go back and forth across the battle lines and observe the Japanese in action and then talk to the commander of the Chinese forces, who put up a "brilliant defense at a time when the Chinese were being generally maligned as very poor fighters."{{sfnb|MacKinnon| 1987|p = 30-31}}

==Covering the Nanjing Massacre and the Sino-Japanese War==
In the fall of 1937, Steele was one of five American journalists who remained in Nanjing after it fell to the Japanese. Steele broke the news about the events that became known as the "[[Rape of Nanking]]" (the New York Times correspondent [[F. Tillman Durdin]] is sometimes mistakenly credited as being the first.)  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/14/14.03-23askew.pdf |first=David |last=Askew |title=The International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone: An Introduction| p =5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steele and Durdin left for Shanghai on the ''Oahu'', an American naval vessel, and Steele bribed an American sailor to allow him to radio his dispatches. The [[Chicago Daily News]] ran Steele's article on December 15, 1937, while the New York Times story appeared three days later.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto " &gt;{{cite book |last = Yamamoto |first =  Masahiro|year = 2000 |title = Nanking Anatomy of an Atrocity |publisher = Praeger| location = Westport, CT|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0K1aUH00XoQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=steele&amp;f=false |pp = 81–83|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent historian, Masahiro Yamamoto, wrote that although scholars have come to rely on the reports of these journalists less and less, "judging from the records and documents available from other sources,  one may conclude that despite some erroneous assumptions and sensationalism typical in media war coverage these two American journalists basically told almost every essential detail of the atrocities in Nanking." Steele saw panic and confusion among the Chinese defenders, who had been abandoned by their commanders, and reported that between 5,000 and 20,000 Chinese soldiers had been killed. Neither he nor Durdin mentioned the number of civilian victims, but Steele wrote that "streets throughout the city were littered with bodies of civilians..."  &lt;ref name="Yamamoto " /&gt; (The worst of the civilian casualties happened after Steele and Durdin left on December 15).

When the national government led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the wartime capital, [[Chongqing]], Steele accompanied it. There he came to know [[Zhou Enlai]], who was stationed in the city during the war as representative of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]]. Steele was impressed with Zhou's power to manipulate correspondents' views and opinions. "As a male," he told a conference of journalists and scholars in 1984, "I would find it difficult to say that I was captivated by Chou, although I was certainly captivated by [[Gong Peng|Kung P'eng (Gong Peng)]]. But in discussing Chou I think we haven't really touched on the basic question of the extent to which people like Chou, and particularly Chou, manipulated the views of the correspondents in China and their coverage of Chinese events." {{sfnb|MacKinnon|1987 |p = 82-83}} He explained:
:Remember Chungking in those days and how difficult it was to get the truth about anything, how futile it was to go to the Chinese Ministry of Information to get their superficial communiqués, which could easily be disproved and were usually just nonsense. Then you would go to a little cubbyhole on the side street in Chungking that was occupied by the liaison officer of the Chinese Communists, who were then our allies, and hear from a charming person like Chou En-lai an explanation of, say, the latest conflict between the Kuomintang forces and the People's Liberation Army in some remote area of the interior, giving in great detail the facts, as he reported them, of what was going on out there. It was very tempting indeed to give considerable prominence to the detailed version and very persuasive words that we got from Chou and to more or less ignore—and quite rightly, I think, in most cases—the Nationalists' communiqués.{{sfnb|MacKinnon|1987 |p = 82-83}}

His other travels during the war included a 1938 visit to Yan'an, the Chinese Communist wartime headquarters, and a 1944 trip to Tibet for the ''Chicago Daily News'', where he met the [[Fourteenth Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], who was then a young boy.&lt;ref name="Biographical Note" /&gt; Of all his travels and assignments, he late wrote, the trip to Tibet and meeting the Dalai Lama were the most exciting.{{sfnb|Steele|1993| p = X}}

==Post-war career==
After 1945, Steele was posted to Japan, where he reported on the [[Tokyo War Crimes Trials]]. He traveled widely in East and Southeast Asia, then covered Central and South America from August 1953 to May 1954. and undertook a jeep trip from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego with his wife from August 1954 to August 1955.

He retired in 1960 to [[Sedona, Arizona]]. In 1966, he was named by Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] to a panel of nineteen experts to advise on US policy on China&lt;ref name="Rusk" /&gt; In that year he published ''The American People and China'', a survey of US public opinion, and in 1977  ''Shanghai and Manchuria, 1932: Recollections of a War Correspondent'' (Center for Asian Studies, Arizona State University).

Steele died of cancer at his home on February 26, 1992.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;

At his death Steele was editing the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' articles from his 1944 trip to Tibet.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt; The book was privately published in 1993 as ''In the Kingdom of the Dalai Lama'', with a foreword by the Dalai Lama.

==Family life==
He and Esther Frances Johnson (1910-1980) were married January 16, 1933 in Tokyo, Japan. They had courted when they were in California.&lt;ref name="Biographical Note" /&gt;

'''Aslambek Ilimsultanovich&lt;ref&gt;[https://wn.com/aslambek_vadalov Aslambek Vadalov]&lt;/ref&gt; Vadalov''' ({{lang-ru|Асламбек Илимсултанович Вадалов}}), also known by his [[nom de guerre]] ''Emir Aslambek'', is a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] rebel leader fighting in the [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title="Palace Coup" Reveals Split between Umarov and Rebel Commander Aslanbek Vadalov |journal=[[Eurasia Daily Monitor]] |volume=7 |issue=152 |date=August 6, 2010 |author=Mairbek Vatchagaev |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36725&amp;cHash=8eed570ae3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed the supreme leader of the [[Caucasus Emirate]] on 1 August 2010, though this was later retracted.&lt;ref name="recon"/&gt;

==Early life==
Aslambek Vadalov was born in 1972 and is a native of Ishkoy-Yurt, a village in the eastern portion of Chechnya's [[Gudermessky District|Gudermes]]. Vadalov also seems to have spent much of his youth in the Gudermes region, though some reports have suggested that he studied for a short period of time in Moscow in the late 1980s, perhaps at a technical institute.

==Chechen War and rebel army==
Following the outbreak of the [[First Chechen War]] in 1994, Vadalov joined the separatist fighters from Gudermes; he may have served in the unit of Sheik Fathi, a Chechen who had lived in Jordan and engaged in [[Islamist]] conflicts in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It has been postulated that if Vadalov did indeed serve alongside Fathi, it would indicate a very early exposure to the Islamist interpretation of the war in Chechnya.

Though Vadalov played no role in the 1999 [[Dagestan War|Dagestan incursion]] led by [[Shamil Basayev]] and [[Ibn al-Khattab]], following Russia's re-invasion of Chechnya that autumn he joined Khattab's [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya]]. After engaging in the battles for [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]] and Gudermes, Vadalov's unit withdrew to the mountainous districts of [[Vedeno]] and Nozhay-Yurt in order to launch guerrilla attacks on Russian security forces.

In 2000, Vadalov returned to Ishkoy-Yurt for unknown reasons and joined a small, local guerrilla force; the unit operated both independently and in cooperation with other rebel formations, including taking part in the 17 September 2001 attack on Gudermes. The next few years saw the separatist movement incur significant losses, but Vadalov was able to distinguish himself mainly due to his survival skills. As such, he was named Deputy Commander of the Gudermes Region of the Chechen Armed Forces under [[Emir]] Askhab. Although this unit that he commanded lacked manpower, his team and him were able to launch numerous small but significant attacks against the Russian security forces, especially around Ishkoy-Yurt.

Following Emir Askhab's death{{clarify|date=November 2011}} in early 2005, Vadalov was named Commander of the Gudermes region. However, while a capable small-unit commander, Vadalov struggled when in control of a larger fighting force that required a broader strategic perspective. His unit was eventually driven out of Gudermes proper and forced back into the highlands of Vedeno and Nozhay-Yurt. Despite these setbacks, he still maintained a reputation for "commitment to the cause and hard-fought guerrilla operations."{{by whom|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; He has been fighting with the Caucasus Emirate rebels against Russian forces since 1994 and was apparently one of the first to swear allegiance to Doku Umarov in 2007. Caucasus Emirate was formed 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caucasus Emirate]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was fighting for independent Chechnya until 2007.

His relationship with [[Amir Khattab]] is of significance. Previously he was the commander of the Eastern Front of the Armed Forces of the Caucasus Emirate, although in practice he was commanding a force of perhaps about 30-50 militants on the Ingushetian border.&lt;ref&gt;globaljihad.net/view_news.asp?id=1589&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
[[Akhmed Zakayev]] said Vadalov had been announced as the new Emir of the Caucasus Emirate because of a "loss of confidence among his (Umarov's) subordinates. [The] Methods of Dokku Umarov, including attacks against civilians, were not supported by militants." He also said that Vadalov "is a supporter of other views and is not affected by ideologists of [[Wahhabism]]." The Russian paper ''[[Kommersant]]'' had reported that Zakayev, sentenced to death by the [[Sharia]] Court of the Caucasus Emirate, had plans to establish contacts with Vadalov.&lt;ref name=lentazaka&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ахмед Закаев связал уход Умарова с потерей доверия боевиков | work = [[lenta.ru]] |date = August 3, 2010 | url = http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/03/anew/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointment as "Emir of the Caucasus Emirate" ==
On 1 August 2010 the "state web site" of the Caucasus Emirate, ''[[Kavkaz Center]]'' reported that [[Doku Umarov]] had stepped down from his position as [[Emir]] of the [[Caucasus Emirate]] and appointed Vadalov to become his successor.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chechen rebel leader 'steps down' | work= [[Aljazeera.net]] | date = August 2, 2010 | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/08/201081225749844675.html |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vadalov Youtube"&gt;{{Cite video | title = Aslambek Vadalov - Emir of the Caucasus Emirate  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj59l_a2dbc | date = August 1, 2010 | publisher = [[Kavkaz Center]] | location = [[YouTube]] | accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the video containing the announcement Umarov states that "jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders."&lt;ref name="Vadalov Youtube" /&gt; However, when the Kavkaz Center site was restored on-line after a "service break" on 3 August 2010,&lt;ref name="LWJ"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov retracts resignation | author = Bill Roggio | date = August 4, 2010 | work = [[The Long War Journal]] | url = http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/08/caucasus_emirate_lea.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; the original announcement had been replaced by one which stated, that Umarov only "proposed to appoint" Vadalov his successor. A few days later Umarov said he had no intention of stepping down and called the video announcing his resignation a fabrication.&lt;ref name="LWJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera2"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chechen rebel chief denies quitting | work= [[Aljazeera.net]] | date = August 4, 2010 | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/08/201084123832188820.html |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2010 ''Kavkaz Center'' announced that Aslambek Vadalov had resigned from his post of Deputy Military Emir of the Caucasus Emirate.

=== Rift with Umarov ===
Days after Umarov rescinded his resignation, Vadalov was said to have renounced adherence of an oath given to Umarov; however it was said that while he ceases subordination to Umarov, he would remain loyal to the larger Caucasus Emirate.

In July 2011, a [[sharia]] court ruled in favour of Umarov to close the rift caused by Umarov's reorganisation of the [[Vilayat Nokhchicho|armed forces]] of Chechnya, the disbanding the so-called "eastern and south-western fronts" and dividing Chechnya into "military sectors." The court asked the rebels to re-swear allegiance to Umarov. [[Amir Khamzat]], the commander of the [[Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs]] or the organisation's suicide battalion who has been named the commander of the western sector. [[Hussein Gakayev]], who had been named to lead the eastern sector, Aslambek Vadalov and [[Tarkhan Gaziev]] consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/07/caucasus_emirate_cla_1.php#ixzz1TKEnDQLI|title=Internal divisions resolved, claims Caucasus Emirate| work=The Long War Journal|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later events==
In November 2016, Vadalov was reportedly arrested in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=712933|title=Kadyrov says 3 Chechen militants arrested in Turkey, requests their extradition to Russia|publisher=Interfax|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Paul Mwanzia Nzimbi''' (born Kitui District, 1945) is a Kenyan Anglican Archbishop. He was the Archbishop and Primate of the [[Anglican Church of Kenya]] and Bishop of the Diocese of All Saints Cathedral, from 2002 to 2009. He is married to Alice Kavula and the couple has five children.

He was born in a poor family of eight children and went to attend Ithookwe Primary, Mulutu Intermediary and [[Kitui School]]. He later attended Kenyatta University, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Education, with majors in Religion and Kishwahili. Afterwards he worked as a lecturer at Machakos Teachers Training College, where he was dean of students and head of social studies. He felt his religious call then and was trained and ordained as the college chaplain.

He finally decided to leave teaching to become a full-time priest. He studied for the priesthood at the Trinity and St. Francis College, in [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]] in 1984. Nzimbi was elected afterwards the first bishop of the new Diocese of Machakos, which he was from 1985 to 1995. In 1995 he was elected the first bishop of the newly created Diocese of Kitui. Nzimbi was elected the fourth Archbishop and Primate of Kenya and Bishop of the Diocese of All Saints Cathedral, on 16 August 2002, and served from 2002 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200208170143.html Kenya: Nzimbi is Elected Anglican Archbishop, 17 August 2002, All Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/2008/11/09/a-profile-of-archbishop-benjamin-nzimbi-of-kenya/ A profile of Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi of Kenya, 9 November 2008, Anglican Mainstream]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed the acceptance on non-celibate gay clergy and the blessing of same-sex unions in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] branches of the [[Anglican Communion]], becoming a leading name in the [[Anglican realignment]] as member of the [[Global South (Anglican)|Global South]] and the [[Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans]]. He attended the [[GAFCON]] meeting in [[Jerusalem]], in 2008, and supported the creation of the [[Anglican Church in North America]], in June 2009. He was one of the Anglican Primates that attended the new church inaugural assembly in [[Bedford, Texas]].

[[File:Blu logo.jpg|thumb|Blu's logo]]
'''Blu''' is the pseudonym of an Italian artist who conceals his real identity. He was born in [[Senigallia]]. He lives in [[Bologna]] and has been somewhat active in [[street art]] since 1999.

His early career involved the practice of shared artistic actions. Artists such as Dem, Sweza, Run and, above all, [[Ericailcane]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericailcane.org Ericailcane's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; were his companions during nocturnal raids where an anonymous creative participation overcame the need of signing their pieces. Also, during those years, Blu started experimenting with digital animation, and he created short interactive video clips that were used as a visual contribution to the live musical performances of the collective OK NO.&lt;ref name="YouTube, Ok NO"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr_lcVVoDIY Blu, Oklahoma NO video, 2001, via Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaboration with Ericailcane had its best results from 2003 to 2006. The two personalities complemented each other; while Blu was painting his characteristic human figures Ericailcane made his typical animals. The two artists, friends in real life, continue to work together, although less often.

Begging in 2004, a few art galleries had noticed Blu's immensely artistic value and invited him to take part in both one-man and collective shows. Yet Blu, throughout his entire youthful career, attempted to limit his presence within the official art world, preferring other kinds of territories.

Since his very major pieces outside of his videos have been immovable murals, the survey below of Blu's work is geographical rather than chronological.

== Places ==

===Central and South America===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hombre Banano.jpg|thumb|Blu: Hombre Banano, Avenida Bolovar, Managua, 2005.]] --&gt;
His nomadic spirit reached its peak in 2005. From the end of that year Blu spent most of his time jumping around in self-guided travels, linking his itineraries to the festivals to which he was invited. At that time he collaborated with [[Ericailcane]] and several artists from [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]] in a festival in [[Managua]] called "Murales de Octubre." On that occasion he painted a wall, significant in the history of South American [[mural]]s, on the Avenida Bolivar where, in 1979, [[Victor Canifrù]] celebrated the Sandinista revolution.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The murals of revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992'', University of California Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; With this he achieved one of his most imposing murals which was immediately dubbed Hombre Banano (Banana Man) by the locals, referring to the protest of the workers on banana plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Frundt, ''Fair Bananas, Farmers, Workers, and Consumers Strive to Change an Industry'', University of Arizona Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hombre Banano.jpg|thumb|right|Blu: Hombre Banano, Managua, Nicaragua, 2005.]] --&gt;

The following year, from October 2006 to December 2006, he returned to Central and South America for a long circuit of murals that included [[Mexico City]], [[Guatemala City]], Managua, [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] (Costa Rica), and finally, [[Buenos Aires]] (Argentina). A year later he was again in South America, in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, participating in the festival "A Conquista do Espaço" (Conquering Space). On that occasion he came up with a new interpretation of the "[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ of Corcovado]]" of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In Blu's version [[Christ]] is literally submerged by tons of guns and rifles.
[[File:Corcovado Blu.jpg|thumb|left |Blu: São Paulo, Brasil, 2007.]]

From the Fall of 2007 to the Spring of 2008, he lived in Buenos Aires, devoting all his efforts to the creation of a video called ''Muto''&lt;ref name="YouTube, Muto"&gt;[http://blublu.org/sito/video/muto.htm Blu, Muto, 2008, via Youtube] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326223643/http://blublu.org/sito/video/muto.htm |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Silent). In addition to receiving many international awards, such as the Grand Prix 2009 from the Festival of [[Clermont-Ferrand]],&lt;ref name="Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival"&gt;[http://www.clermont-filmfest.com Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival Website]&lt;/ref&gt; "Muto" has been seen by 10 million-plus viewers on YouTube. It is also available in high definition on Blu's website under the Creative Commons license.&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org Creative Commons’ Website]&lt;/ref&gt; This video is composed of hundreds of paintings on walls, made throughout many streets of Buenos Aires and, frame by frame, created more than seven minutes of an animated mural.

In 2009 Blu started his umpteenth tour around South America visiting [[Bogotá]] for the festival "Memoria Canalla", then to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], back to Buenos Aires and, for the first time, to [[Lima]], [[Peru]], where he painted the entire façade of an historical building in the central Avenida Arenales. In this huge mural Blu seems to reinterpret the history of South America, a continent that has been violated by both ancient and modern [[conquistadores]].

===North America===
In 2008 Blu accepted an invitation from the Deitch Gallery in New York to paint the exterior of their [[Long Island]] location.
After being invited by the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] to paint an exterior wall of the museum for its "Art in the Street" exhibition, its director [[Jeffrey Deitch]] ordered the resulting mural to be whitewashed the day after it was finished, probably due to its political content. The mural represented two rows of coffins each draped with a one dollar bill in place of the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Angeles MOCA Censors Street Artist's Commissioned Mural|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/10/los-angeles-moca-censors-_n_795258.html|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Bank===
In 2007, Santa's Ghetto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santasghetto.com/ Santa's Ghetto's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; a London-based art collective which organizes annual happenings of painting performances and print trade fairs, invited Blu to a festival that took place in the [[West Bank]]. Blu was part of a group of artists, including [[Banksy]], [[Mark Jenkins (artist)|Mark Jenkins]], [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]], [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], and [[Faile (artist collective)|Faile]] who painted on the wall around [[Bethlehem]] that separates the West Bank from [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="The Times, Santa's Ghetto"&gt;Sheera Claire Frenkel, "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article2988367.ece Let us spray: Banksy hits Bethlehem]", ''The Times'', December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On a watchtower border Blu painted a figure of a person trying to tear down the walls with his finger.&lt;ref name="Art Magazine, Santa's Ghetto"&gt;[http://www.art-magazin.de/kunst/3091.html Santa's Ghetto Bethlehem, Art-Das Kunst Magazine, Dec. 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Austria====
[[File:Alberner Hafen Gebäude Wien.JPG|thumb|Vienna, Albern harbour mural, 2010-2013]]

In 2010 Blu was invited to [[Vienna]] to paint a mural at the [[Danube]] River [[Harbours in Vienna#The harbour near Albern (River kilometre 1918.3)|harbour near Albern]] in the city district of [[Simmering (Vienna)|Simmering]]. 
First suggested in 1923 as one possibility for the expansion of Vienna's harbour facilities, Albern was selected for realisation by the German [[Reich Ministry of Transport]] ''(Reichsverkehrsministerium)'' in 1939, a year after the "[[Anschluss]]" of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] to [[Nazi Germany]]. The project was to serve as a logistic node of a future [[Geopolitical|geo]]- and [[biopolitical]] order, designated for the transshipment of grain from the annexed or economically colonized regions of [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] and [[south-eastern Europe]] to the heartlands of the German Reich. For the construction of the harbour basin and its five granaries between 1939 and 1942 the Nazi regime employed [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]]. Realized on one of the granaries, Blu's [[mural]] called upon the overdue historical and social commemoration of the place's charged history and the unknown fates of the forced labourers who built it. The commissioned piece was destroyed in autumn 2013 in the course of renovation works.&lt;ref name="kor"&gt;Roman Tschiedl: ''BLU - Untitled/it is obvious'', in: Maria Taig, Barbara Horvath (Hg.): ''Kör vie 07-10: Public Art in Vienna, 2007-2010'', Verlag für moderne Kunst, Nuremberg 2014, p 206; see also [http://www.koer.or.at/en/projects/untitled-it-is-obvious/ Untitled/it is obvious], koer.or.at, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrauneDonau"&gt;Ortrun Veichtlbauer: ''[https://www.academia.edu/6574582/Braune_Donau Braune Donau. Transportweg nationalsozialistischer Biopolitik]'', in: Christian Reder, Erich Klein (Hg.): ''Graue Donau – Schwarzes Meer'', Springer, Vienna/New York, 2008, p 240 f {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Europe====
[[File:Krakow Jozefinska mural; fot. 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kraków]], Jozefinska mural, 2011.]]
In Eastern Europe Blu has painted in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2009, in [[Wrocław]] and [[Gdańsk]], Poland, in 2008. In Gdańsk, located on the industrial harbor where the destinies of twentieth-century Europe intersected, he used an abandoned hangar as the background for his short movie, "Morphing,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpIvJWKCAV0 Blu, Morphing, 2008, via Youtube.]&lt;/ref&gt; where the symbols of this place, loaded with history, are mixed together. Gdańsk Harbor was indeed invaded first by the [[Nazis]], then by the [[Red Army]] and subsequently saw the birth of the trade union movement, [[Solidarność]] (Solidarity), and finally, the victory of [[capitalism]].
Also, in 2008, Blu was in [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]] for the "Names Festival"&lt;ref&gt;[http://namesfest.net/news.php Names Festival's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; to paint a mural called Gaza Strip, where tanks and bulldozers are seen chasing each other along a [[Möbius strip]].

====England====
In 2007, Blu went to London for the first time where he made many pieces around [[Camden Town]] and Willow Street, and at the former headquarters of art-gallery website Pictures on Walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picturesonwalls.com/ Pictures on Walls’ Website]&lt;/ref&gt; That same summer he took part in a two-man exhibit with [[Ericailcane]] at the Lazarides Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lazinc.com Lazarides Gallery's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[Tate Modern]]&lt;ref name="Tate Gallery, Street Art"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/streetart/artists.shtm Tate Gallery, Street Art Exhibition's Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323005643/http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/streetart/artists.shtm |date=March 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented an exhibition on the phenomenon of street art and invited Blu,&lt;ref name="The Guardian, Tate Gallery, Street Art"&gt;Francesca Gavin, "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/apr/08/streetartattate Street art is now mainstream], ''The Guardian'', April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[JR (artist)|JR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jr-art.net J-R's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faile (artist collective)|Faile]], [[Sixeart]], and [[Os Gêmeos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lost.art.br/osgemeos.htmOs Gemeos’ Website]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; e [[Nunca]], to paint its entire main façade.&lt;ref name="BBC, Street Art at Tate Gallery"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7325950.stm Street art to adorn Tate's walls]", BBC, April 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
[[File:Berlin Blu-120804 01.jpg|thumb|right|Murals in Cuvrystraße, 2007-2014.]]
Blu worked in Germany on many occasions between 2006 and 2009, mostly in Berlin, and always around Cuvrystraße in a multi-ethnic neighborhood called [[Kreuzberg]]. Thanks to his participation in several of the festivals "Backjump"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backjumps.org/ Backjump Festival's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Planetprozess,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbangrassroots.net/ Planetprozess’ Website]&lt;/ref&gt; he had the opportunity to create some of his works, one of which was painted in combination with gigantic photos by the French artist [[JR (artist)|JR]].

In 2006, during one of these trips, Blu made his first digital animation from images painted directly on a wall, a technique that would be a recurrent theme of many of his future videos such as "Muto."

In consultation with Blu the two murals at Cuvrystraße were covered with black paint in 2014 by a group of people as a sign of discontent with the city's urban development policies in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blublu.org/sito/blog/?p=2524 ”When the finger points to the moon… “], Blog, blublu.org, retrieved 6. June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Italy, above any other country, can boast of having the majority of Blu's graffiti, both illegal and legal. Among the public projects worth noting are the façade of [[Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea|PAC]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/pac/ Padiglione dell’Arte Contemporanea di Milano (PAC) Website]&lt;/ref&gt; (the Contemporary Art Pavilion) in [[Milan]], finished in 2008; the murals in that city's Bicocca and Lambrate train stations, done in 2008 and in 2009; three editions of "Spinafestival" in [[Comacchio]] (2005, 2006 and 2007); two editions of "Fame Festival a [[Grottaglie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famefestival.it Fame Festival's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;" (2008 and 2009). In this last one, Blu completed a video-animation with the New York-based artist, [[David Ellis.]] Blu has also taken part in many editions of the festival "Icone&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icone.tv Icone Festival's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;" in [[Modena]] and in [[Ancona]]'s "Festival Pop Up" in 2008 where he painted along with [[Ericailcane]] a gigantic silos next to the harbor waterfront. Other Italian cities where Blu has left his mark are varied, among which are [[Prato]], [[Florence]], [[Grosseto]], [[Turin]], Ancona, [[Rovereto]], [[Verona]] and [[Pesaro]].
In Bologna there were  most of his first works because of his studies in the city's University. In 2016 he deleted all murals painted in Bologna due to the decision taken by the municipality who made an exhibition trying to profit from Blu's graffiti without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wumingfoundation.com/giap/2016/03/street-artist-blu-is-erasing-all-the-murals-he-painted-in-bologna/#more-24357|title=Street Artist #Blu Is Erasing All The Murals He Painted in #Bologna - Giap|date=2016-03-12|work=Giap|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blublu.org/sito/blog/?paged=5|title=BLU blog March 12th, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=blublu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blu has also painted in several "[[Self-managed social centers in Italy|Centri Sociali]]", places that are between squats and self-managed cultural centers. In Bologna his work is visible at XM24, TPO, Livello 57, Crash; in Rome at Forte Prenestino and Collatino; in Milan at Cox 18 and Leoncavallo and in [[Pisa]] at Cantiere San Bernardo.

====Spain====
[[File:Desordes - 2012 - Blu - 5 (8168526679).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ordes]], 2012.]]
Blu has frequently visited Spain. At the festival "Segundo Asalto" in [[Zaragoza]], he, along with the artists San, [[Eltono]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eltono.com El Tono's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Nuria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuriamora.com Nuria's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Nano, painted a mural of a colossal [[minotaur]] picking up an astonished man. Blu's murals can also be found in [[Valencia]], [[Linares, Jaén|Linares]], [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]]. In Barcelona's Barrio Carmelo neighborhood, Blu took part in the 2008 edition of the festival "[[The Influencers]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinfluencers.org The Influencers Festival's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; With the global economic crisis looming, Blu painted a threatening shark whose skin is completely covered in euro bills.

==Techniques, themes and ethic==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:avesella1.jpg|thumb|Blu: Bologna, Italy, 2005.]] --&gt;

The list of the places where Blu has left his trace is as long as his collection of sketchbooks which contain sketches, thoughts or simply visual notes. Often these drawings function as a script for his improvisations on walls.

His graphic mania is directly proportional to the epic scale of his murals. His paintings seem to interpret the architectural language of public spaces and reinvent them into new shapes. Thus, his murals are never detached from the places where they were conceived because Blu is a painter in the landscape, urban or industrial. He always tries to communicate with the society which inhabits those spaces, searching for the uniqueness of each place.
Besides drawing and painting, the technical universe of Blu is completed by a skillful use of the digital medium. Proof of that can be seen in his website where his manual craftsmanship is combined with computer programming language.
The recurring themes of his imagery play on the distortion of the human figure. He speaks a [[Popular culture|pop]] vocabulary which resembles the automatic writing process of the [[surrealist]] tradition with purely [[rhetorical]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''L'Échange symbolique et la mort'', Paris, 1976. {{Dubious|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- How can a 1976 book tell us about somebody who started in 1999? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Blu's artistic practice has contributed to a radical change in the art market. His murals and his videos are given for free to the public space of the cities and on the World Wide Web. His income comes from the sale of multiples, like [[Screen-printing|silkscreen prints]], in those few galleries which represent him, or through the sale of self-made editions.
The works of Blu appear abrupt because they are derived from the free creativity of an artist who has decided to occupy a position outside the sheltered field of art. As magically as they appear they can disappear, sometimes covered by other paintings by Blu himself, sometimes ruined by time and weather, but mostly erased by the authorities in the name of tidiness.

Blu's aesthetic search is motivated by a belief in an open source philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Klein, ''No Logo'', Knopf, 2000. {{Dubious|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- How can a 2000 book tell us about somebody who started in 1999? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; persistent in its anarchical revolt against contemporary art conventions and unique in beauty.

==Censored in US==

In 2015, amid allegations of mismanagement and the squandering of funds, Batmanghelidjh was forced to step down as the charity's chief executive, and Kids Company was closed, by then insolvent, despite receiving millions of pounds in government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kids Company faces investigation over financial collapse|first=Jamie|last=Grierson|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 August 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/21/kids-company-faces-investigation-over-financial-collapse|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour and Conservative ministers ignored repeated warnings over Kids Company|first=Patrick|last=Butler|date=29 October 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/29/kids-company-ministers-warnings-david-cameron-charity|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity work==

===The Place To Be===
In 1991, Batmanghelidjh was involved in the formation of The Place to Be, a [[Family Service Unit]] project working with troubled children in [[primary schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sally|last=Williams |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3357117/Place2Be-its-good-to-talk.html/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107055124/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3357117/Place2Be-its-good-to-talk.html|title= Place2B: It's Goood to Talk|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 September 2007|archivedate=7 January 2013|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Batmanghelidjh resigned from the project in 1995.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.place2be.org.uk/our-story/the-early-years-of-place2be/|title=The early years of Place2Be|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwark's Urban Academy===
The Urban Academy was a post-16 educational and life skills academy in [[Southwark]], [[south London]]. It was founded by Batmanghelidjh and was run by her Kids Company organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icsouthlondon.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0500lewisham/tm_objectid=17724776&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50100&amp;headline=an-honour-to-help-kids-name_page.html|title=An honour to help kids|date=12 September 2006|first=Zara|last=Bishop|work=icSouthlondon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114051039/http://icsouthlondon.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0500lewisham/tm_objectid%3D17724776%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50100%26headline%3Dan-honour-to-help-kids-name_page.html|archivedate=14 January 2007|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gangs/projects/southwark/project-06.jsp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507193642/http://www.london.gov.uk/gangs/projects/southwark/project-06.jsp|work=[[Greater London Authority]]|title=London Against Gun and Knife Crime: Kids Company|year=2006|archivedate=7 May 2009 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanacademy.org.uk/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418021946/http://www.urbanacademy.org.uk/|archivedate=18 April 2011|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|work=Urban Academy|title=What we do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kids Company===
{{Main|Kids Company}}
In 1996, after leaving The Place To Be, Batmanghelidjh founded Kids Company, a charity that provided care to children whose lives had been disrupted by poverty, abuse and trauma. Originally a single drop-in centre in Camberwell, Kids Company claimed that it helped some 36,000 children, young people and families, although this figure is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/08/the-inside-story-of-how-the-spectator-broke-the-kids-company-scandal/?ref=yfp|title=How I blew the whistle on Kids Company - and Camila Batmanghelidjh|first=Miles|last=Goslett|work=[[The Spectator]] |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity operated through a network of street level centres, alternative education centres, therapy houses and with over 40 schools in London and Bristol as well as a performing arts programme in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/22/camila-batmanghelidjh-interview |title=Camila Batmanghelidjh: 'I chose the vocation' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Orr]], in an interview with Batmanghelidgh, reported in 2012 that fifteen independent evaluations of Kids Company had found that 96 per cent of  children assisted return to education and employment and an "impact on crime reduction" of 88 per cent.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

In 2015, it was first reported that Kids Company was in significant financial difficulty. In July 2015 a report by [[Newsnight]] and [[BuzzFeed]] revealed that public funding for Kids Company was to be withheld unless Batmanghelidjh was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33356304|title=Kids Company's Camila Batmanghelidjh (crook) asked to step down by government|first=Chris|last=Cook|date=3 July 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July it was reported that Batmanghelidjh would step down as chief executive in the next few months and continue in a "presidential" role.&lt;ref name="guardian-20150703"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/03/camila-batmanghelidjh-to-leave-kids-company |title=Camila Batmanghelidjh to leave Kids Company, citing political 'ugly games' |first=Patrick|last=Butler |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 July 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph-20150705"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11719428/Kids-Company-under-new-Charity-Commission-scrutiny-amid-fears-for-its-future.html |title=Kids Company under new Charity Commission scrutiny amid fears for its future |first=John|last=Bingham |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=5 July 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2015, Kids Company closed its operations&lt;ref name= BBC6Aug&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33798285 |title=Kids Company: '£3m donation withdrawn amid police probe'|date=6 August 2015 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than a week after receiving a government grant of £3,000,000. The charity was given the money against the advice of officials, who had raised concerns about value for money and how it would be spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33641889 |title=Kids Company charity in closure warning|work=[[BBC News]]|first=Chris|last=Cook|date=5 August 2015 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity had announced that it was closing down because "it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/kids-company-founder-camila-batmanghelidjh-lashes-out-at-illspirited-ministers-as-she-announces-organisation-is-about-to-go-bankrupt-10441606.html|title=Kids Company: Camila Batmanghelidjh lashes out at 'ill-spirited ministers' as she announces the organisation is about to go bankrupt|first=Oliver|last=Wright|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 August 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in August 2015, Batmanghelidjh said she hoped Kids Company could make a comeback after some restructuring and once the media storm had died down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11797646/Kids-Company-could-return-after-a-restructure.html|title=Kids Company could return after a 'restructure’|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 August 2015|accessdate=14 August 2015|first=John|last=Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In mid-August 2015, Batmanghelidjh announced that she would be opening a food bank in [[Lambeth]], south London. She said fifty former staff had volunteered to help run the pop-up ''Kids Dining Room'' in Loughborough Junction to provide food for up to 3,000 children and young people. Approximately 200 people used the service in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/People/article1594232.ece|title=Camila opens food kitchen as taxpayer faces £25m Kids Company bill|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=16 August 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015|first=Nicholas|last=Hellen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television, film, and media==
Batmanghelidjh was the subject of ''Ruby Wax Gets Streetwise'', a documentary film about her charity work with Kids Company, presented by [[Ruby Wax]]. Directed by Michael Waldman, the film was broadcast on 15 March 2000 by [[BBC Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forget Hollywood, Now Ruby Has Got Street Cred|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|date=12 March 2000|first=Anthea|last=Gerrie|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60960211.html|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=15 March 2000|page=38|issue=66775|title=Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, she was interviewed by [[Fergal Keane]] for ''Taking A Stand'', a radio documentary exploring her work as an advocate for "society's most anti-social, violent and disruptive children".

A 2003 [[Channel Four]] series, ''Second Chance'', featured Batmanghelidjh's work at Kids Company with children who had been labelled "unteachable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenagers running out of track|first=Alison|last=Benjamin|date=16 April 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/16/guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=19 April 2003|page=38[S4]|issue=67741|title=Arts and Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batmanghelidjh's work with Kids Company was the subject of ''Tough Kids, Tough Love'', a film by Lynn Alleway, first broadcast on 19 October 2005 by BBC Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reality bites|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=24 October 2005|first=Billen|last=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Love at the end of the road|first=Libby|last=Purves|work=[[The Times]]|date=18 October 2005|page=22|issue=68521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=15 October 2005|page=60|issue=68519|title=Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alleway made a second film, at Batmanghelidjh's invitation, during the summer of 2015, which unwittingly captured the collapse of Kids Company. Sam Wollaston, writing in ''The Guardian'', described it as: "like an invitation, on the evening of 14 April 1912, to the bridge of the ''Titanic''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camila's Kids Company: The Inside Story review – both damning and vindicatory|first=Sam|last=Wollaston|date=4 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/04/camilas-kids-company-the-inside-story-review-both-damning-and-vindicatory|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was broadcast as ''Camila's Kids Company: The Inside Story'' on 3 February 2016 by [[BBC One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camila's Kids Company: The Inside Story, TV review|first=Amy|last=Burns|date=3 February 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/camilas-kids-company-the-inside-story-tv-review-she-cant-run-a-business-but-batmanghelidjh-would-a6852296.html|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video installation artist [[Larisa Blazic]]  created a multi screen video installation ''Angel (of Peckham)'' which was displayed in [[Currys Digital]] shop window in August 2007 and was inspired by her and [[William Blake]]'s vision of angels in [[Peckham Rye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/blogs/angel-of-peckham |title=ANGEL (OF PECKHAM) |website=www.a-n.co.uk |language=en-US |access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
An Army Scholar, Geidt enlisted in the [[Scots Guards]] and attended the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. He was later commissioned in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]].&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/&gt;

In 1987 Geidt joined the staff of the [[Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies]], becoming an Assistant Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071848808445375] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 he worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in diplomatic posts in [[Sarajevo]], [[Geneva]] and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/&gt;

In 1991 Geidt and Anthony de Normann sued the journalist [[John Pilger]] and Central Television over the documentary ''[[Cambodia]]: The Betrayal'' in which they were accused of being members of the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] secretly engaged in the training of the [[Khmer Rouge]]. Geidt and de Normann accepted ‘very substantial’ damages and all costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/the-lie-is-indeed-breathtaking-mr-pilger-but-who-told-it/story-e6frg71f-1111118977347 |title=The Lie is Indeed Breathtaking Mr Pilger, But Who Told It |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related libel action [[Ann Clwyd]] MP, then shadow minister for overseas development, issued a public apology to Geidt and de Normann and agreed to meet all legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by ''[[The Times]]'' on 6 July 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the war in Bosnia (1992–1995), Geidt was deployed to liaise with the Bosnian Serb leadership, including [[Radovan Karadžić]], [[Momčilo Krajišnik]] and General [[Ratko Mladić]], all later indicted for [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoHQEEDzL5AC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=geidt+karadzic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kW2KkYAfxc&amp;sig=Hrd33kULyEN2u99rx9Q0ebBP0bg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=boCBUM-bEIOi0QWJ4ICQBA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=geidt%20karadzic&amp;f=false |title=The Modern Yugoslav Conflict 1991-1995: Perception, Deception and Dishonesty |author=Brendan O'Shea |page=155 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=2005-01-21 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bildt, Peace Journey, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/24 |title=Key Figures of the Cases &amp;#124; International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia |website=Icty.org |date=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assisted the High Representative, [[Carl Bildt]], in negotiating with Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] for the removal of Karadžić from the Presidency of the Bosnian Serb ‘Republic’ in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bildt, Peace Journey, p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

Geidt was recruited to the Royal Household in 2002 as Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen. He was promoted to Deputy Private Secretary in 2005 before serving for a decade as the Queen's Private Secretary (2007–2017).
 
During his appointment as Private Secretary, Geidt was also Keeper of the Queen’s Archives and a Trustee of both the Royal Collection and the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust (later the Queen's Trust). He remains a Trustee of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust and is also Chairman of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/about/trustees |title=Trustees |website=Royalcollection.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507064758/https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/about/trustees |archive-date=2016-05-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121129125546/http://92.52.108.90/qsjt/our-team.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jubileetribute.org/the-trust/ |title=About the trust &amp;#124; The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust |website=Jubileetribute.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.queenscommonwealthtrust.org|title=The Queen's Commonwealth Trust|accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Private Secretary, Geidt had been a member of the so-called 'golden triangle' of senior British officials – the others being the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] and the [[Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister]] – with key responsibilities in the event of a '[[hung parliament]]' in the United Kingdom, as happened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicholas Watt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/14/queen-power-hung-parliament |title=How a hung parliament would put the Queen centre stage &amp;#124; UK news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ten years as Private Secretary, Geidt stepped down in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/queens-private-secretary-sir-christopher-geidt-to-step-down-after-a-decade-a3600681.html|title=Queen's private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt to step down after a decade}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently created '''Baron Geidt''', of Crobeg in the [[County of Ross and Cromarty]], and sits as a [[Crossbencher|Crossbench]] peer in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=peerage&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=62103 |date=8 November 2017 |page=20550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geidt is the Honorary Regimental Colonel of the [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish Regiment]], having succeeded [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen]] in 2016.

==Family==
In 1996 he married Emma Charlotte Angela Neill, youngest daughter of [[Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen]].&lt;ref&gt;"Marriages." ''[[The Times]]'', [London, England], 16 July 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two daughters. Geidt's father was the first cousin of actor [[Jeremy Geidt]].&lt;ref&gt;Entry of Birth (30th August 1961) in the Sub-district of All Souls in the Metropolitan Borough of St. Marylebone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corpus Christi College Oxford Biographical Register 1880-1974, 1988, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Geidt was appointed a Privy Counsellor (PC) in 2007.&lt;ref name="Number 10"&gt;{{cite press release  |title=Announcement of Christopher Geidt being sworn of the Privy Council  |publisher=Number 10  |date=2007-12-19  |url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12593.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070725092936/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12593.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-07-25 |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalem Bekung''', also known as ''Pamayun'', was a king of [[Bali]] who is traditionally dated in the second half of the 16th century. He belonged to a [[dynasty]] of kings who were descended from [[Majapahit]] on [[Java]], and reigned from their [[palace]] ([[puri]]) in [[Gelgel, Indonesia|Gelgel]].

==Intrigues and rebellions==

The main source for his reign is the [[Babad Dalem]], a chronicle from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), ''Babad Dalem. Teks dan Terjemahan''. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of the successful king [[Dalem Baturenggong]], and came to the throne when still a minor. His uncle Dewa Anggungan wished to usurp [[kingship]], and was supported by the [[nobleman]] [[Batan Jeruk]] who took Dalem Bekung and his brother Seganing into custody. He was immediately opposed by the majority of the grandees of the kingdom and the two infant princes were rescued. Batan Jeruk fled and was killed by loyalist soldiers. His kinsmen later founded the [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] kingdom in East Bali. 

Dewa Anggungan was spared but lost his [[caste]] status as [[Ksatria]]. The Batan Jeruk [[rebellion]] is dated in 1556 or 1558 in Balinese texts. When old enough to reign in his own name, Dalem Bekung proved to be an inactive and cowardly ruler, which led to a loss of royal prestige and discipline among the grandees. He left the affairs of state to his chief [[Minister (government)|minister]] Nginte. In this period the famous [[Brahmin]] sage [[Nirartha]], who had entertained a profound impact on the religious elite culture on Bali, died. 

A conflict between the noblemen Kiyayi Pande and Gusti Talabah escalated into a full-scale rebellion where Kiyayi Pande mounted a desperate attack on the troops of the king. In the end he was defeated and killed with utmost effort, an event dated in 1578 by various texts. After this event Dalem Bekung had to leave the Gelgel palace. Late versions of the Babad Dalem assert that his brother [[Dalem Seganing]] took over as king in his stead at this point.&lt;ref&gt;I B. Rai Putra, ''Babad Dalem''. Denpasar: Upada Sastra 1991, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat by the Javanese==

Towards the end of Dalem Bekung's life, a military expedition was organized to support the East [[Java]]nese kingdom of [[Blambangan]] against [[Pasuruan]], a port and kingdom on the north coast of [[Java]]. The expedition, which was led by the nobleman Jelantik, sailed to Panarukan in [[East Java]], and marched into the land of Pasuruan. However, it met with a shattering defeat and Jelantik was killed. Some time after this calamity, Dalem Bekung died. His name is in fact a nickname, meaning 'the childless'. His brother Dalem Seganing either took the throne or continued to reign.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Berg, ''De middeljavaansche historische traditië''. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 144-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first [[Netherlands|Dutch]] expedition, under [[Cornelis de Houtman]], visited Bali in 1597, they met a king who might have been either Dalem Bekung or Dalem Seganing. The king was described as a heavily built, stout man of about 40–50 years. The Dutchmen provided lively accounts of the royal splendours they saw on Bali, which accord rather well with the descriptions in the later Balinese chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;W.A. Hanna, ''Bali Chronicles''. Singapore: Periplus 2004, pp. 32-7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of their visit, a large Balinese expedition was prepared in order to assist the still [[Hindu]] kingdom of Blambangan against the [[Muslim]] Pasuruan. A later Dutch account indicates that the expedition was fruitless, since Blambangan fell to Pasuruan in c. 1597. It has been argued that this must be the Jelantik expedition mentioned in the Babad Dalem. Another hypothesis places Dalem Bekung's reign much later, in the 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Creese, 'Balinese Babad as Historical Sources', ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 147 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dirk Hoogendam''', a.k.a. '''Dieter Hohendamm''', alias ''The Boxer'' (18 May 1922, [[Vlaardingen]] - 8 August 2003 in [[Ringgau]], [[Germany]]), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[war criminal]]. 

Hoogendam was sentenced to death after [[World War II]] because of his service in a foreign army (the German [[SS]]) and severe mistreatment of prisoners in [[Drenthe]] during the war. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. In 1946 however, Hoogendam escaped and fled to Germany, and only a few years before his death, the Dutch paper ''De Telegraaf'' discovered that he was living in Ringgau under the name of Hohendamm. 

Just before his death, the Netherlands asked the German government to prosecute him, together with five other in Germany living war criminals. Subsequently, the German Justice department announced that one of them, [[Herbertus Bikker]], was to appear for court on 8 September 2003 for his part in the murder of Dutch [[Resistance movement|resistance]] member Jan Houtman.

'''Edward Anseele''' (26 July 1856 – 18 February 1938) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[socialist]] politician. Although his parents rather belonged to the lower middle class (his father was a shoemaker), Edward Anseele became active in the early socialist movement. Anseele attended the Royal Athenaeum in Ghent until the age of 17.

==Career==
The socialist congress of 1877 in Ghent was the start of his socialist commitment. He became employed as a journalist of the magazine ''De Volkswil'', later transformed into the socialist daily ''Vooruit!'' (English: "Forward!"). He organized a cooperative bakery ''Vooruit'' which was founded in 1880. This was the start of a complete range of [[cooperative]] ventures which in the long term would create an industrial empire. This way, Anseele tried to create a counterweight to the [[capitalism|capitalist]] ventures, and was able to provide support to workers' actions. During the economic crisis of the thirties this network of cooperatives would be largely lost.

Anseele was for a long time municipality Council member and [[alderman]] in Ghent, temporary burgomaster and a Member of Parliament. He was one of the founders of the socialist [[Belgian Labour Party|Belgische Werkliedenpartij]]. During [[World War I]] the Germans offered him the title of ''President of Belgium'', which he declined. After the war, he was rewarded for this stance with several ministerial functions: from 1918 until 1921, he was the minister for Public Works and from 1925 until 1927 minister of Railroads and PTT (Mail Telegraph and Telephone). In 1930, he got the honorary title of Minister of State.

== Biography ==
Einars Repše graduated from Latvia State University (now known as [[University of Latvia]]) in 1986 with a degree in [[physics]] (specialisation – radio electronics).
He first entered politics in 1988 as one of the founders of the [[Latvian National Independence Movement (LNNK)|Latvian National Independence Movement]] (LNNK), a political organization promoting Latvia's independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. He was elected to the [[Saeima|parliament of Latvia]] in 1990.

From 1991 to 2001, Repše was the president of the [[Bank of Latvia]] (Latvia's central bank). During this period, he oversaw the introduction of the [[Latvian rublis]], Latvia's temporary transition currency, and the [[Latvian lats|Lats]], independent Latvia's new currency. Under Repše, the Bank of Latvia pursued a tight [[monetary policy]], implementing a de facto [[currency board]] for the Lats. As a result, the [[exchange rate]] of the lat has been stable since the early 1990s till now. The success of the Lats made Repše very popular in Latvia.

In 2001, Repše resigned from the Bank of Latvia to return to politics. He founded the [[New Era Party]], a [[populism|Populist]] anti-corruption party. After the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 elections]], Repše became the [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] in November 2002. He led a [[Coalition government|coalition]] of his own New Era Party, the [[Latvia's First Party]], the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] and [[For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK]]. Repše's government became known for an outspoken fight against corruption and [[tax evasion]]. Several high-ranked government officials, including the head of Latvia's state revenue service, were fired or resigned. The anti-corruption measures resulted in some success, as the revenues from the [[Fuel tax|gasoline tax]], previously notorious for tax evasion, increased by 30% in one year. The revenues from other taxes, however, were not significantly different, compared to the previous governments, and some of the anti-corruption measures backfired (for example, some of the fired officials successfully sued the Latvian government for wrongful dismissal). Repše's government also implemented a tight control on [[budget]] expenses, reducing the [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]] from 3% of GDP in 2002 to 1.8% in 2003.

Starting in September 2003, a conflict between Repše and the Latvia First Party, one of his coalition partners, became apparent. Repše blamed the conflict on vested interests resisting his anti-corruption plans. The coalition partners mentioned Repše's authoritarian management style and unofficially delegating many of his powers as prime minister to his chief of staff Dans Titavs as the main reason for the conflict. Repše's government became a [[Minority government|minority administration]] in January 2004 after the Latvia First Party left the government. He and his cabinet resigned in February 2004. After being in [[Parliamentary opposition|opposition]] during [[Indulis Emsis]] government, the New Era Party joined the [[Aigars Kalvītis]] coalition government in December 2004, with Repše becoming the [[Defence minister|minister of defense]]. During his service, however, he at times was portrayed by the press as more involved in his hobbies and business, than in governmental activities, losing popularity among electorate.

In 2003, Repše bought real estate at various locations in rural Latvia for a total of 323 718 lats (approx. 500 000 euros). His real estate purchases were funded by loans from two Latvian banks, Hansabanka and Nord/LB Latvia. Repše's opponents immediately questioned his real estate deals, claiming that Repše has used his position to obtain loans on conditions better than those available to the general public.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His deals were investigated by a special committee of the Latvian parliament. In December 2005, a criminal investigation was started by the [[Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB)]]. Due to this investigation, Repše resigned from his position as the minister of defense. On 12 October 2007 KNAB closed the criminal investigation – no wrongdoing was discovered.

Repše's questionable real estate deals, confrontational management style and flamboyant lifestyle led to a major decline in his popularity. In 1999 and 2000, Repše was one of the most trusted politicians in Latvia, with 75%–80% Latvians having a positive opinion of him. By the time of his resignation in 2005, he was the least popular minister in the Latvian government.

Repše was [[Minister of Finance of Latvia]] from 12 March 2009 to 3 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mk.gov.lv/en/mk/sastavs/repse/|title=The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia: Einars Repše|work=[[Internet Archive]]|publisher=Republic of Latvia|accessdate=22 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915233427/http://www.mk.gov.lv/en/mk/sastavs/repse/|archivedate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a chairman of the Association for Latvian Development (founded in March 2012).

As to his hobbies, he is known to be interested in [[General aviation|Flying]], aircraft building, and painting.

[[Image:D'albert2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eugen d'Albert in 1904]]
'''Eugen''' (originally '''Eugène''') '''Francois Charles d'Albert''' (10 April 1864{{spaced ndash}}3 March 1932) was a Scottish-born German pianist and composer.

Educated in Britain, d'Albert showed early musical talent and, at the age of seventeen, he won a scholarship to study in Austria. Feeling a kinship with German culture and music, he soon emigrated to Germany, where he studied with [[Franz Liszt]] and began a career as a concert pianist. D'Albert repudiated his early training and upbringing in Scotland and considered himself German.

While pursuing his career as a pianist, d'Albert focused increasingly on composing, producing [[List of operas by Eugen d'Albert|21 operas]] and a considerable output of piano, vocal, chamber and orchestral works. His most successful opera was ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'', which premiered in Prague in 1903. His successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. In 1907, d'Albert became the director of the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Hochschule für Musik]] in Berlin, where he exerted a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He also held the post of [[Kapellmeister]] to the Court of Weimar.

D'Albert was married six times, including to the pianist-singer [[Teresa Carreño]], and was successively a British, German and Swiss citizen.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
[[Image:Eugen dalbert age 20.jpg|thumb|left|upright|d'Albert aged 20]]
D'Albert was born at 4 Crescent Place,&lt;ref&gt;The nearby address of 9 Newton Terrace has been widely copied in the literature and on the web, but 4 Crescent Place is given in the statutory register of births (Gen. Reg. Office Scotland ref 644/08 0715) and in the notice of Eugène's birth in the Glasgow Herald of 12 May 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow]], Scotland, to an English mother, Annie Rowell, and a German-born father of French and Italian descent, Charles Louis Napoléon d'Albert (1809–1886), whose ancestors included the composers [[Giuseppe Matteo Alberti]] and [[Domenico Alberti]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Williamson, John. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/00434 "Albert, Eugen d'"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; D'Albert's father was a pianist, arranger and a prolific composer of salon music&lt;ref&gt;See works by Charles d'Albert at imslp.org: http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Albert,_Charles_d'&lt;/ref&gt; who had been ballet-master at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] and at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Sands, John. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/articles/arrangements/dance_music.html "Dance Arrangements from the Savoy Operas"]. ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=4150 Dance arrangements by Charles d'Albert of numerous [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] pieces]&lt;/ref&gt; D'Albert was born when his father was 55 years old. ''The Musical Times'' wrote in 1904 that "This, and other circumstances, accounted for a certain loneliness in the boy's home-life and the years of his childhood. He was misunderstood, and 'cribbed, cabined, and confined' to such an extent as to largely prejudice him against the country which gave him birth".&lt;ref name=MT&gt;''The Musical Times'', vol. 45, no. 741, 1 November 1904, pp. 697–700&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Albert was brought up in Glasgow and taught music by his father until he won a scholarship to the new National Training School for Music (forerunner of the [[Royal College of Music]]) in London, which he entered in 1876 at the age of 12.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; D'Albert studied at the National Training School with [[Ernst Pauer]], [[Ebenezer Prout]], [[John Stainer]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]]. By the age of 14, he was winning public praise from ''[[The Times]]'' as "a bravura player of no mean order" in a concert in October 1878. He played [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Schumann's Piano Concerto]] at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in 1880, receiving more encouragement from ''The Times'': "A finer rendering of the work has seldom been heard."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 17 October 1878, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 February 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1880, d'Albert arranged the piano reduction for the vocal score of Sullivan's sacred music drama ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'', to accompany the chorus in rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/conductor.html Information about ''The Martyr of Antioch''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905080640/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/conductor.html |date=5 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with writing, under Sullivan's direction, the overture to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1881 opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Biographer Michael Ainger wrote that on the evening of 21 April 1881, "Sullivan gave his sketch of the overture to Eugene d'Albert to score. D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student ... and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year" (Ainger, p. 195). [[David Russell Hulme]] studied the handwriting in the manuscript score of ''Patience'' and confirmed that it is that of Eugene, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by biographer [[Arthur Jacobs]]), both of whose script Hulme sampled. (Hulme, David Russell, Doctoral Thesis ''The Operettas of Sir Arthur Sullivan: a study of available autograph full scores'', 1985, [[University of Wales]], pp. 242–43. The Thesis is available from academic libraries including The British Library Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa, Wetherby W. Yorks, Ref # DX171353, and [[Northern Illinois University]], Call# :ML410.S95 H841986B)&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, d'Albert dismissed his training and work during this period as worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Mark and Allan Evans [http://www.arbiterrecords.com/notes/147notes.html Extensive notes on d'Albert], Arbiter of Cultural Traditions website (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' wrote that he "was born and educated in England, and won his earliest successes in England, although, in a freak of boyish impetuosity, he repudiated some years ago all connexion with this country, where, according to his own account, he was born by mere accident and where he learnt nothing."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 May 1886, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, however, he modified his views: "The former prejudice which I had against England, which several incidents aroused, has completely vanished since many years."&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40935 "D'Albert, Eugen Francis Charles (1864–1932)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 11 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugen und Hermine d'Albert.jpg|thumb|left|d'Albert and Hermine Finck in 1902]]
In Germany and Austria, d'Albert built a career as a pianist. Liszt called him "the second [[Carl Tausig|Tausig]]", and d'Albert can be heard in an early recording of Liszt works. He played his own piano concerto with the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1882, the youngest pianist who had appeared with the orchestra.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; D'Albert toured extensively, including in the United States from 1904 to 1905. His virtuoso technique was compared to that of [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', vol. 102, no. 1422 (August 1961), pp. 489–90: [[Artur Schnabel]] said that if Busoni and d'Albert had been combined in one, the result would have been one of the greatest musicians of all times, "for d'Albert had all the raw material and Busoni all the refinement."&lt;/ref&gt; He was praised for his playing of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s preludes and fugues and of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s sonatas.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; "As an exponent of Beethoven, Eugen d'Albert has few, if any, equals."&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; Gradually, d'Albert's work as a composer occupied his time more and more, and he reduced his concert playing.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was the recipient of a number of dedications, most notably of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Burleske|Burleske in D minor]]'', which he premiered in 1890.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODM/&gt;

D'Albert was a prolific composer. His output includes a large volume of successful piano and chamber music and [[lieder]]. He also composed twenty-one operas, in a wide variety of styles, which premiered mostly in Germany.  His first, ''Der Rubin'' (1893) was an oriental fantasy; ''[[Die Abreise]]'' (1898), which established him as an opera composer in Germany, was a one-act domestic comedy; ''Kain'' (1900) was a setting of the biblical story; and one of his last operas, ''[[Der Golem (opera)|Der Golem]]'', was on a traditional Jewish theme.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 4 March 1932, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; His most successful opera was his seventh, ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'', which premiered in Prague in 1903. When [[Thomas Beecham]] introduced the opera to London, ''The Times''  observed, "the scoring owes more than a little to the discipline of Sullivan; there is also a curiously English fragrance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 October 1910, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tiefland'' played in opera houses throughout the world and has retained a place in the standard German and Austrian repertoire, with a production at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], in November 2007. According to biographer Hugh Macdonald, it "provides a link between Italian verismo and German expressionist opera, although the orchestral textures recall a more Wagnerian language."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another stage success was a comic opera called ''[[Flauto solo]]'' in 1905. D'Albert's most successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. "Though not a composer of profound originality ... he had an unfailing sense of dramatic appropriateness and all the resources of a symphonic technique to give it expression and was thus able to achieve success in so many styles".&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

D'Albert edited critical editions of the scores of Beethoven and Bach, transcribed Bach's organ works for the piano and wrote cadenzas for Beethoven's piano concertos. In 1907, he succeeded [[Joseph Joachim]] as director of the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Hochschule für Musik]] in Berlin, in which capacity he had a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He also held the post of [[Kapellmeister]] to the Court of Weimar.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Personal life and death===
[[Image:GrabAlbert.jpg|thumb|Grave of d'Albert at the cemetery of [[Morcote]]]]
D'Albert's friends included [[Richard Strauss]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Ignatz Waghalter]] and [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], the dramatist. He was married six times and had eight children. The first wife was Louise Salingré. The second, from 1892 to 1895, was the Venezuelan pianist, singer and composer [[Teresa Carreño]], herself much married and considerably older than d'Albert. D'Albert and Carreño were the subject of a famous joke: "Come quick! Your children and my children are quarrelling again with our children!"&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., {{cite book|last=Walker|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Walker (musicologist)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWL6fBaKHzcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA422&amp;lpg=RA1-PA422&amp;dq=%22your+children+and+my+children+are%22+%22our+children%22+albert&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kaWOBH-2Gb&amp;sig=eihZNEBNJEMnim9LnJszrH0-fsM |title=Franz Liszt: The final years, 1861–1886|isbn=0-8014-8453-7|pages=423, footnote 14|year=1997|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line, however, has also been attributed to others. His later wives were [[mezzo-soprano]] Hermine Finck, who originated the role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]''; actress Ida Fulda; Friederike ("Fritzi") Jauner; and Hilde Fels. His last companion was a mistress, Virginia Zanetti.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1914, d'Albert moved to [[Zurich]] and became a Swiss citizen. He died in 1932 at the age of 67 in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], where he had travelled for a divorce from his sixth wife. In the weeks preceding his death, d'Albert was the subject of attacks by the press in Riga concerning his personal life.&lt;ref&gt;Waghalter, Ignatz. ''Aus dem Ghetto in der Freiheit'' (Marienbad, Czechoslovakia, 1936)&lt;/ref&gt; D'Albert was buried in the cemetery overlooking [[Lake Lugano]] in [[Morcote]], Switzerland.

==Recordings==
As pianist, d'Albert did not record extensively, although his recordings represent a wide range of music. They include his own Scherzo, Op. 16; Capriolen, Op. 32; Suite, Op. 1, Gavotte and Minuet; and piano arrangements from his opera ''Die Toten Augen''. He made several [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] recordings, including the Piano Sonatas Nos. 18 and 21 ([[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|"Waldstein"]]), and the [[Violin Sonata No. 5 (Beethoven)|"Spring" Sonata]] for violin and piano (with Andreas Weissgerber). A selection of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] pieces were recorded in the 1910s and 1920s, with [[Études (Chopin)|études]], [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] and [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] represented. Perhaps surprisingly, his teacher [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] is not strongly represented among d'Albert's recordings, though he committed "Au bord d'une source" from ''[[Années de pèlerinage]]'' (1st year) to disc in 1916. [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] also feature in his discography.&lt;ref name=discography&gt;Arnest, Mark.

'''Fergus mac Róich''' (son of ''Ró-ech'' or "great horse"; also '''mac Róig''', '''mac Rossa''') is a character of the [[Ulster Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Formerly the king of [[Ulaid|Ulster]], he is tricked out of the kingship and betrayed by [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], and becomes the ally and lover of Conchobar's enemy queen [[Medb]] of [[Connacht]], and joins her expedition against Ulster in the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]''. The name ''Fergus'' (later Irish ''Fearghus'') means "man-strength" or "virility", and Fergus is described as being of enormous size and sexual potency.&lt;ref name="tcn"&gt;[[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] (ed. &amp; trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/conchobar2.html "The Tidings of Conchobar son of Ness"], ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'' vol. 2, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; This leads him into many a precarious situation as in the story of the [[Táin Bó Flidhais]].

==King of Ulster==
Fergus becomes king of Ulster after his predecessor, [[Eochaid Sálbuide]], is killed, along with the [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Fachtna Fáthach]], by [[Eochu Feidlech]] in the Battle of Leitir Ruad.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Dobs (ed. &amp; trans), "La Bataille de Leitir Ruibhe", ''[[Revue Celtique]]'' 39, 1922, pp. 1–32&lt;/ref&gt; While king, he desires Eochaid Sálbuide's daughter [[Ness (Irish mythology)|Ness]], but she will only consent to marry him if he allows her son Conchobar to be king for a year, so his sons will be the sons of a king. The nobles of Ulster reassure him that the boy will be king in name only, so Fergus agrees, but Conchobar, with his mother's help, rules so wisely that the nobles make him king permanently in Fergus's place.&lt;ref name="tcn" /&gt; Fergus remains Conchobar's loyal retainer, and becomes the [[Fosterage|foster-father]] of Conchobar's eldest son [[Cormac Cond Longas]] and nephew [[Cúchulainn]].

==Fergus' exile==
Conchobar's intended bride, [[Deirdre]], elopes with the young warrior [[Naoise]] and his two brothers, and after some time of wandering they are tracked down to an island off Scotland. Conchobar announces he has forgiven them and sends Fergus, Cormac, [[Dubthach Dóeltenga]], and Fergus' son Fíachu, to offer them safe conduct home. Naoise and his brothers swear they will eat no food until they dine with Conchobar at [[Emain Macha]]. Conchobar, however, orders the Ulstermen to invite Fergus, Cormac and Dubthach to feasts, and, as it is shameful to refuse hospitality, Fergus is separated from his charges, and Fíachu is left to escort them to Emain alone. When they arrive, Fíachu, Naoise and his brothers are murdered by [[Éogan mac Durthacht]], a former enemy of Conchobar who has recently made peace with him. After hearing of this betrayal, Fergus, Cormac and Dubthach burn Emain Macha and defect to Connacht with three thousand followers, where they enter the service of king [[Ailill mac Máta]] and queen [[Medb]]. Conchobar forcibly marries Deirdre, who later commits suicide after he offers her to Éogan.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Leahy (trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/usnech.html "The Exile of Sons of Usnach"], ''Heroic Romances of Ireland'' Vol. 1, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

==Táin Bó Flidhais==
[[Flidais]], wife of Ailill Finn, a petty king of the [[Erris]] district of Connacht, falls in love with Fergus from afar. In [[Táin Bó Flidhais]] Fergus and Dubthach visit Ailill Finn, claiming to have fallen out with [[Ailill mac Máta]] and [[Medb]], and provoke him to battle. However, he proves difficult to defeat, beating Dubthach in single combat and holding out against a siege of his stronghold. Fergus is only able to defeat him when Ailill arrives with the army of Connacht. After that, Fergus marries Flidais.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Leahy (trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/flidais.html "The Driving of the Cattle of Flidais"], ''Heroic Romances of Ireland'' Vol. 2, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that unless he could have Flidais, it took seven women to satisfy him.&lt;ref name="tcn" /&gt; He also becomes Medb's lover, and she is said to have needed thirty men to satisfy her if she couldn't have Fergus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kuno Meyer]], "The Cherishing of Conall Cernach and the Deaths of Ailill and of Conall Cernach", ''Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie'' vol. 1, 1897, pp. 102–111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunford, Stephen, [[Táin Bó Flidhais]], 'The Mayo Táin' (2008) Enniscrone&lt;/ref&gt;

==Táin Bó Cúalnge==
When Ailill and Medb raise a huge army and launch the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' (Cattle Raid of [[Cooley peninsula|Cooley]]) to steal Ulster's stud bull, [[Donn Cúailnge]], Fergus' knowledge of the terrain means he is chosen to lead the way. He leads the army by a roundabout route, hoping to give the Ulstermen time to raise their own army, but they are disabled by a curse. He sends a message to Cúchulainn, who begins his single-handed defence of the province.

The Connacht army separates, with Ailill leading one section, and Medb and Fergus leading the other. Ailill is suspicious, and sends his charioteer to spy on them. The charioteer finds Fergus and Medb having sex, and unnoticed, steals Fergus' sword, which Ailill keeps safe as proof. Fergus makes himself a dummy sword of wood to hide his loss. Cúchulainn holds up the army's progress by fighting a series of champions in single combat. Fergus is sent to face him, but as foster-father and foster-son, neither wants to fight the other, and in any case Fergus has no sword. Cúchulainn agrees to yield on this occasion, on the condition that Fergus yields the next time they meet.

Eventually the Ulstermen recover from their curse, and the final battle begins. Ailill gives Fergus back his sword. Fergus meets Conchobar on the battlefield, and has him at his mercy, but is prevented from killing him by Cormac. He redirects his rage into cutting off the tops of three hills with his sword. Cúchulainn, who has so far sat out the battle, recuperating from his wounds, enters the fray and challenges Fergus. Fergus honours his promise and yields, pulling his followers from the field. Medb's other allies, seeing him withdraw, panic and begin to retreat. The Connacht army is routed, and Fergus bitterly remarks, "It is the usual thing for a herd led by a mare to be strayed and destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kinsella]] (trans.), ''The Táin'', 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and death==
After the death of Conchobar, some of the Ulstermen propose inviting him home to be their king, but they ultimately decide to appoint Cormac, Conchobar's son and Fergus' foster-son, who is also in exile in Connacht. Cormac promises to remain friendly with Ailill and Medb, and sets out for Ulster. Fergus remains in [[Cruachan, Ireland|Cruachan]]. On his journey, Cormac discovers a Connacht war-party raiding Ulster, and Cormac reluctantly attacks and defeats them. Word gets back to Medb, who sends her army after him, while keeping Fergus occupied. Eventually he hears what is happening and sets off in his chariot, but arrives too late – Cormac is already dead.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley Stokes (ed. &amp; trans.), "Da Choca's Hostel", ''[[Revue Celtique]]'' 21, 1900, pp. 388–402&lt;/ref&gt;

One day, after Fergus has been in exile for fourteen years, Ailill sees him swimming in a lake with Medb, and is overcome with jealousy. He tells his brother, Lugaid Dalleces, who is blind, that deer are playing in the water, and persuades him to throw a spear at them. He does so, and the spear hits Fergus in the chest. He climbs out of the water and throws the spear back, killing Ailill's deer-hound, before dying. His death-tale relates that he had killed Éogan mac Durthacht, but this story is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer (ed. &amp; trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/fergus.html "The Death of Fergus mac Róich"], ''The Death-Tales of the Ulster Heroes'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other legends==
The story is told that, in the 6th century, the poet [[Senchán Torpéist]] gathered the poets of Ireland together to see if any of them knew the story of the ''Táin Bó Cúailnge'', but they all only knew parts of it. His son Muirgen came to Fergus' grave and spoke a poem, and Fergus' ghost appeared to him and related the events of the ''Táin'' as they happened.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kinsella, "How the ''Táin Bó Cúailnge'' Was Found Again", ''The Táin'', 1969, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legendary Ulster king, [[Fergus mac Léti]], is regarded as a double of Fergus mac Róich: both die in water,&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', 1998, pp. 190–192.&lt;/ref&gt; and are associated with the sword [[Caladbolg]]. Another legendary Fergus, [[Fergus Foga]] of the [[Corca Oíche|Corcu Óchae]] of [[Munster]], is identified with Fergus mac Róich by [[T. F. O'Rahilly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[T. F. O'Rahilly]], ''Early Irish History and Mythology'', 1946, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;
==Issue==
The [[Ciarraige]], an early medieval people who gave their name to [[County Kerry]], traced their ancestry to Ciar, a son of Fergus and Medb, as do the [[Conmhaícne]] of Leitrim, Sligo, and Galway, through Conmac. The [[Masraige]], a tribe inhabiting [[Magh Slécht]] in [[County Cavan]] were descended from Fergus according to [[Corpus Genealogiarum Hiberniae]], 1 16r A44, 279. According to ''The Stem of the Irish Nation'' by [[John O'Hart]], Fergus had the following triplets with Medb;

* [[Conmac mac Fergus]]
* [[Ciar mac Fergus]]
* [[Corc mac Fergus]]

Other issue attributed to Fergus by O'Hart includes;

* Dallan mac Fergus
* Anluim mac Fergus
* Conri mac Fergus
* Aongus Fionn mac Fergus
* Oiliol mac Fergus
* Firceighid mac Fergus
* Uiter mac Fergus
* Finfailig mac Fergus

==Early life==
Dunham was born and raised in New York City.&lt;ref name=TinyFurniturePressKit&gt;{{cite press release |title=''Tiny Furniture'' Press Kit from IFC Films |url=http://www.tinyfurniture.com/assets/presskit/TF_PressKit.pdf |page=7 |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunham's mother, [[Laurie Simmons]], is an artist and photographer, and their father, [[Carroll Dunham]], is a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Falconer.

In November 2015 Dunham interviewed transgender rights activist [[Janet Mock]] for [[Buzzfeed]]'s ''Women Of The Hour'' podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/meredithtalusan/janet-mock-grace-dunham-women-of-the-hour#.dl1RKPLPo|title=Grace Dunham Interviewed Janet Mock And It Was Really Wonderful|work=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Dunham presented the talk "Why Am I Valuable?" during a panel at the [[Frieze Art Fair]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversations.e-flux.com/t/why-am-i-valuable-speech-at-an-art-fair/3400|title=Why am I valuable? (Speech at an art fair)|website=e-flux conversations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk begins:{{Quote|text=Some things about me are that I'm white, that I have relatively famous parents, and that my sister is a celebrity. I also have a vagina, which makes people think I'm a woman. I have an intimate relationship with a black trans activist, Reina, who by being in a public collaborative relationship with me validates my perspective and—despite my whiteness, my class, and my proximity to fame—makes my critique of power seem legitimate in ways it otherwise might not. In other words, as a commodity, I have power through my associations with social capital; in addition, I hold a set of marginalized identities which give me intellectual authority and increased use-value in contexts seeking "diversity."|sign=|source=}} In 2016, Dunham's first collection of poetry and short essays titled ''The Fool'' was published. The publication is a free, online-only "web-book" published by Curse of Cherifa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefool.us|title=Grace Dunham - The Fool|website=www.thefool.us|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curseofcherifa.org|title=Curse of Cherifa|website=www.curseofcherifa.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film work ==
Dunham's first film appearance was in the 2006 short ''Dealing'' as June, a 13-year-old art dealer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All in the family |first=V.A. |last=Musetto |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/all_in_the_family_zKgMLLt2T3JWmutXdPhV5O |newspaper=New York Post |date=November 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dealing'' was written and directed by Dunham's older sister, Lena.

Dunham later starred in the 2010 feature film ''[[Tiny Furniture]]'' as Nadine, the younger sister of Aura, played by Lena, who also wrote and directed the film. ''Tiny Furniture'', which also featured Lena and Grace's real-life mother [[Laurie Simmons]], was shot at the family's actual home in New York's [[Tribeca]] neighborhood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lena Dunham: Unwatchable in the Best Way |first=Lorrie |last=Moore|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/03/lena-dunham-girls-hbo.html |work=The New Yorker |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the three characters portrayed by Grace, Lena, and their mother are based loosely on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Tiny' Voice Makes Loud Noise |first=Steve |last=Dollar |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703805704575594561349592240 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunham stars as Junior in the forthcoming film ''[[Happy Birthday, Marsha!]]'' about the transgender activists [[Marsha P. Johnson]] and [[Sylvia Rivera]] in the hours before the [[Stonewall riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4406114/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1|title=Happy Birthday, Marsha! (2016)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunham also appeared in artist A.K. Burns' multi-channel video installation ''A Smeary Spot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023224825/http://participantinc.org/wp-content/uploads-new/AKBurns_PR.pdf|title=A Smeary Spot|archivedate=23 October 2015|publisher=|url=http://participantinc.org/wp-content/uploads-new/AKBurns_PR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Passages in Lena's memoir ''[[Not That Kind of Girl]]'', which recount childhood interactions between then seven-year-old Lena and then one-year-old Grace, attracted controversy when some commentators perceived them to be overly sexual. Experts described these passages as either too ambiguous to judge, or as describing behavior consistent with normal childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Soraya Nadia|title=Lena Dunham responds to sites accusing her of sexually abusing her sister|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/03/lena-dunham-responds-to-sites-accusing-her-of-sexually-abusing-her-sister/|accessdate=November 8, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark-Flory|first1=Tracy|title=Child therapists: Stop freaking out about Lena Dunham|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham/|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=Salon|issue=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oldenburg|first1=Ann|title=Lena Dunham: Sexual abuse or sexual exploration?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/11/06/lena-dunam-sexual-abuse-sister-grace-exploration-lawsuit/18524915|accessdate=13 February 2015|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace publicly rejected claims by media commentators that the behavior was harmful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/11/05/lena-dunhams-sister-grace-twitter-defends-sexual-abuse/18525487/ Lena Dunham's sister, Grace, defends sex stories].

[[File:Hathi Singh Jain Temple 82.jpg|thumb|[[Hutheesing Jain Temple]] ]]
The '''Hutheesing family''' ({{lang-gu|હઠીસિંહ }}) is an old [[Jain]] family from [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat. Several temples and charitable institutions in [[Ahmedabad]] have been built or founded by members of this mercantile family. [[Krishna Hutheesing]], a sister of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was a member of this family by marriage.

==History==
The family has a known history of over 250 years. In the mid-1700s, the Mughal empire was in decline, rebellions were breaking out in several places, and general lawlessness prevailed in much of northern India. The traditional trade routes between northern India and central Asia were unworkable. Meanwhile, the European powers had established their trading interests on the coast and this presented a lucrative and safe business opportunity. To meet the changing dynamics of the era, some members of the [[Jain]] trading community moved from [[Osian, Jodhpur|Osian]] in the [[Marwar]] region of [[Rajasthan]] to [[Khambhat]] (Cambay) in [[Gujarat]], which was at that time a major port city and a center of the European trade. The progenitors of the Hutheesing family were among the immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[Art connoisseur in the Hutheesing mould, Sunday, 8 July 2001, http://www.gujaratplus.com/news/Ahmedabad/97112.html Move from Marwar to Gujarat]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, the wealthy and industrious immigrants were not unwelcome. They ingratiated themselves with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]-appointed governors of Khambhat and prospered to the extent that they soon became the owners of a few ships that sailed abroad for trade. However, this happy situation was not to last long. The group from [[Osian, Jodhpur|Osian]] became involved in certain intrigues and their ships were consequently confiscated by the Mughal authorities. They also lost the goodwill of the local authorities and were unable to carry on their trade in the atmosphere of suspicion and hostility. Ultimately, they abandoned direct involvement with international trade and moved inland, to the large trading city of [[Ahmedabad]], which was ruled by a rival (albeit Mughal-appointed) satrap. Here they became prosperous traders.

===Seth Hutheesing===
&lt;ref&gt;[https://amdavadblog.com/heritage-hutheesing-ni-haveli-ahmedabad/ Hutheesing family]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Ahmedabad, the community prospered in trade. Perhaps the most prosperous trader among them was Hutheesing, son of Kesrising, who amassed a colossal fortune. Hutheesing was the grandson of one of the men who emigrated from [[Osian, Jodhpur|Osian]] to [[Khambhat]] and then to [[Ahmedabad]]. He lived during the first half of the 19th century. His descendants (both adopted and biological) took his first name as their surname and came to be known as the "Hutheesing family."

Hutheesing Kesarising was married three times but neither his first wife nor his second wife produced a living male heir, although there were at least two living daughters and one boy who lived to the age of five, besides some miscarriages and other infant deaths. His third wife (who was much younger than him) produced no child at all for several years after their marriage. This third wife was named Harkunwar and she hailed from the village of [[Ghogha]] near [[Bhavnagar]]. The two daughters were married at a young age, per the custom of that era, and sent away to live in their marital homes. Thereafter, in keeping with Indian tradition, the couple adopted the three sons of Hutheesing's brother, Dolabhai. The boys were named Jaisingbhai, Maganbhai and Mulchandbhai. Ironically, within a couple of years after the adoptions, Harkunwar finally became pregnant and gave birth to a son, whom they named Umabhai.

According to Jain custom and society, their biological son was treated just like his adopted brothers; before his death, Hutheesing portioned out his wealth in equal measure to all his sons, and at his death, it was the eldest adopted boy, Jaising, who officiated at his funeral as his eldest son.

===Harkunwar Bai===
After the death of Seth Hutheesing, his sons carried on the family's trading business harmoniously, while his wife, Harkunwar Bai, devoted herself to prayer and charities. The entire family continued to [[Hindu Undivided Family|live together]] in their palatial residence, ''Hutheesing-ni-Vadi.'' This was a massive ''haveli'' (Indian-style mansion-with-courtyards) built by Huteesing just outside the gates of the old walled city of [[Amedabad]]. The mansion stood within a large compound, which contained walled gardens, an orchard, [[mews]] and small houses for servants and dependents. 

Hutheesing had intended to build a grand Jain temple within this compound. Before his death, Hutheesing and Harkunwar had performed the required religious ceremonies and jointly laid the symbolic "first stone" of the temple. Hutheesing had finalized the layout and plan of the temple and was in the process of arranging finances and engaging craftsmen. The task of bringing his pious dream to fruition fell upon Harkunwar and her sons. It was Harkunwar who supervised the construction of the 52-Jinalaya  [[Hutheesing Jain Temple]] within the compound of her house.&lt;ref&gt;Mangilal Bhutoria, Itihas ki Amar Bel- Oswal, Priyadarshi Prakashan, Calcutta, 1988, p. 372-373&lt;/ref&gt; The temple took several years to be built. It is constructed of stone in the traditional way, without steel, cement or mortar. It is richly ornamented with intricate and beautiful stone carvings and is now regarded as one of the architectural treasures of the city. It houses 238 stone images, 83 metal images and 21 ''yantras.'' The ''Pratishtha'' (consecration) of the temple was conducted by Shantisagar Suri, a famous saint. The festivities were attended by as many as 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;અમદાવાદના પ્રસિદ્ધ હઠીસિંહના દેરાં, આચાર્ય શ્રી ‘વાત્સલ્યદીપ’ સૂરિજી  https://sites.google.com/site/jainphilosophy/notes/30-12-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the construction of the Hutheesing Jain temple was nearing completion, and preparations were afoot for its grand consecration, the need was felt for a suitable [[Dharamshala (type of building)|Dharamshala]] to accommodate the expected visitors. It occurred to Harkunwar Bai that a ''Derasar'' or Jain monastery should be built, which would accommodate the visitors in the first instance and then serve as a center of the [[Jainism|Jain faith]] for all time to come. she decided to build a ''Derasar,'' or [[Jainism|Jain]] monastery in the city. The presence of such an institution would add luster and virtue to the beauty of the temple. She mentioned her wishes to her sons, and they readily agreed that it was an excellent idea, and the ''Dharmanath Derasar'' was duly built and endowed by them, and its consecration was held a couple of days before the consecration of the temple. The ''Derasar'' is situated in the Nisha Pol precinct of [[Ahmedabad]], in the near vicinity of the Hutheesing temple.

Harkunvar Bai, who had been much younger than her husband, lived to a ripe old age. After the death of her husband, as a pious Indian widow, she wore only plain white cotton [[saree]]s for the rest of her life, entirely gave up all jewelry and ornamentation, and spent a large portion of her waking hours in prayer. She later built two further temples, on a smaller scale, within one kilometer from her house in Ahmedabad. These are the ''Sambhavnath'' and ''Chintamani Parshvanath'' temples in the Zaveriwad neighbourhood of [[Ahmedabad]]. She commissioned the construction of a ''Gaushala'' or animal shelter for aged cattle and other animals. She constructed ''Piaos'' and ''Sada-varta'' shelters near certain Jain temples, where basic food, cool water and a shady shelter were provided free to pilgrims and devotees. She constructed and endowed a ''[[Dharamshala (type of building)|Dharamshala]],'' or free pilgrims' inn, at [[Shikharji|Samet Shikhar]], a center of Jain pilgrimage located in distant [[Jharkhand]]. She organized and funded pilgrimages for poor Jain families of Ahmedabad to travel to [[Shikharji|Samet Shikhar]]. She donated funds towards building the [[Ahmedabad Civil Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;HISTORICAL BACKGROUND http://civilhospitalamdavad.org/?page_id=115&lt;/ref&gt; Her pious charities, good works and personal austerity made her a figure of veneration among the people of Ahmedabad.

He also built a school for girls&lt;ref&gt;Ahmedabad in Sidi Sayyed ni Jali http://www.desigujju.com/gujarattourism/en/place/56/Ahmedabad_in_Sidi_Sayyed_ni_Jali&lt;/ref&gt; Maganlal Karamchand Girls' School in Ahmedabad, when general public was still not in favor of female education.

The family trade included wooden furniture in association with [[Lockwood de Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood De Forest: Furnishing the Gilded Age With a Passion for India, Roberta A. Mayer, Lockwood De Forest, Associated University Presse, 2008 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; which was a rage in the US then, and kundan jewellery to Tiffany's in the US.

Purushottam Hutheesing's son Gunottam was married to [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s sister  [[Krishna Hutheesing|Krishna Nehru Hutheesing]]. But in 1946 Raja Gunottam Hutheesing (INC)lost his first electoral bid for the Nagpada-Kamathipura BMC election constituency to an unknown independent [[Linganna Pujari]] (1914-1999). Pujari subsequently joined the Congress Party in 1947 at [[Nehru]]ji's invitation.

Gunottam's sister Shrimati was married to Saumendranath Tagore, a nephew of [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-02/ahmedabad/31537530_1_rabindranath-tagore-rabindra-sangeet-ahmedabad&lt;/ref&gt; Shrimati had studied at Shantiniketan and had remained associated with it. [[Revolutionary Communist Party of India|Saumendranath Tagore]] became one of the founders of the Communist movement in India.

He later migrated to the US in the early 1960s and became one of the first Indians on Wall Street when he started his investment banking career. He had three sons, Nikhil, Vivek and [[Ravi Hutheesing|Ravi]], and three grandchildren, Kirin Hutheesing, Remy Hutheesing and Mirai Hutheesing.

'''James Ingram McDonald''' (11 June 1865 &amp;ndash; 13 April 1935) was a New Zealand [[painter]], [[photographer]], [[filmmaker|film-maker]], [[museum director]], [[cultural ambassador]] film censor, and promoter of Maori arts and crafts.

==Career ==
James McDonald was born in [[Milton, New Zealand|Tokomairiro]], [[South Otago]], New Zealand on 11 June 1865. He began painting early in his life and took art lessons as a young man in Dunedin with [[James Nairn]], [[Nugent Welch]] and [[Girolamo Nerli]]. He continued his art studies in [[Melbourne]], Australia, but returned to New Zealand in 1901, where he worked as a photographer. From 1905 he was a museum assistant and draughtsman in the Colonial Museum, later to become the [[New Zealand Dominion Museum building|Dominion Museum]] and even later the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]). He began making films about various scenic sights. At the museum he was responsible for the maintenance of the photographic collection and the production of paintings, drawings and photographs for the Dominion Museum bulletins.&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Dennis|first=Jonathan|id=3m5|title=James Ingram McDonald|accessdate=&lt;!--23 April 2017 and--&gt; 3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Photograph of the reproduction of a painting by James I McDonald, "He taua! He taua", painted in 1906 ATLIB 306214.png|thumb|Reproduction of ''He taua! He taua'', painted in 1906]]
He began to gather information about [[Māori people|Māori]] tribal traditions. His films show [[poi (performance art)|poi]] dances and whai [[string figure|string games]]. He was probably the earliest known ethnographic filmmaker in New Zealand. In 1920 he filmed the gathering of the Māori tribes in Rotorua, when they welcomed the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]], and other aspects of the royal journey. He filmed traditional skills and activities, including the make of fishing nets and traps, weaving, digging kumara camps and cooking food in a hangi. Most of his often unedited and fragmentary negatives became only known in 1986 after restoration by the New Zealand film archive.&lt;ref Name="Dennis"/&gt;

In 1914, due to the poor health of his predecessor, J. A. Thomson, he was appointed as Interim Director of the Dominion Museum. One of his tasks was the design of the New Zealand coat of arms, for which the royal commission was awarded on 26 April 1911. He was appointed as Assistant Censor of Cinema Films in August 1918 and held this position for eight years.&lt;ref Name="Dennis"/&gt;

In 1926 James McDonald was appointed to the board of Māori Arts, and in the same year he resigned from his posts in the museum. He moved to Tokaanu, where he helped building the Te Tuwharetoa School of Māori Arts and Crafts. Its aims were the revival of traditional art, which was in danger of being lost, and the encouragement of the Māori of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]] to produce handicrafts for sale at home and abroad. The school received no state subsidies, so McDonald and his family suffered from considerable financial difficulties. McDonald earned mutual trust and deep respect from local Māori.&lt;ref Name="Dennis"/&gt;

He died in Tokaanu on 13 April 1935 and was buried at Taupo cemetery. The School of Applied Arts, which he had founded, doesn't exist anymore, but many examples of McDonald's work have been preserved. Many hundreds of his photographic negatives are kept by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. There are prints of his works in the collections of the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]] and the [[Bernice P. Bishop Museum]] in [[Hawaii]]. The four ethnographic films he has made are preserved in the collection of the New Zealand Film Archive Nga Kaitiaki or Nga Taonga Whitiahua.&lt;ref Name="Dennis"/&gt;

==Family ==
On 29 April 1891 he married Mary (May) Brabin and had three daughters with her, Marjorie, Flora and Dorothy, as well as a son, Donald Douglas. On the marriage certificate they stated his activity as an accountant, which suggests that he was not able to earn a living as an artist.&lt;ref Name="Dennis"/&gt;

'''Robert James "Jim" Schoppert''' (May 28, 1947 – September 2, 1992) was an [[Alaska Native]] artist.  Born in [[Juneau, Alaska]] to a father of German descent and a [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ᵻ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|l|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|ᵻ|t}}) mother, Schoppert became one of the most prodigious and influential Alaska Native artists of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=jim1&gt;''Jim Schoppert: Instrument of Change: Retrospective Exhibition''. [[Anchorage Museum of History and Art]], Anchorage, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work includes carving, painting, poetry and essays. He has been described as an innovator, that made traditional and contemporary Alaska Native works often pushing the boundaries of what was considered "traditional" Northwest Coast art. Throughout his career he was a spokesman for Alaska Native artists and artists in general. Having taught at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) as a guest professor and giving talks and lectures at elementary schools throughout the states of [[Alaska]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], his positive influence was spread through his work and words over the course of his career.&lt;ref name=jim1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Ament|first1=Deloris Tarzan|title=Robert James Schoppert, 45, Used Tlingit Heritage in his Artwork|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920919&amp;slug=1513875|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=September 19, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:James Schoppert Clam Shell 1992 Wood, Pigment, Glue Rattle.jpg|thumb|''Clam Shell'' (1992) – wood, pigment, glue rattle]]
In 1973, Schoppert came to [[Anchorage]] for a construction job which, it turned out, was no longer available.&lt;ref name="DunhamADN"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Dunham|first1=Mike|title=A Bridge Unfinished: Late Tlingit Artist's Quest for Unity in Diversity Celebrated in New Show|work=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|date=March 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26 of that year, using the last of his money, he bought a piece of [[soapstone]] and carved an owl.&lt;ref name=deck1&gt;Julie Decker. Icebreakers: Alaska's Most Innovative Artists. Anchorage Museum, Anchorage, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He put it up for sale at the urging of his sister and was able to sell it quickly, which marked the formal beginning of his career as an artist.&lt;ref name=deck1/&gt; Understanding that knowledge was important, he went on to earn a BFA from the [[University of Alaska Anchorage]] and a MFA from the [[University of Washington]]. But "his apprenticeship was with himself" according to Steven Brown, associate curator at the [[Seattle Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=jim1/&gt;&lt;ref name="DunhamADN"/&gt; Continuing to produce work while still an undergraduate, he won first place in the statewide ''Earth, Fire and Fiber'' juried show in 1976.&lt;ref name="DunhamADN"/&gt; This sculpture should have been an indication of things to come as it was a separation from his traditional work which would define him as an artist and create controversy and curiosity in later years. Although he created art using the traditional [[formline]], he chose a different approach for a great deal of his work that did not neatly fit into either contemporary or [[Northwest Coast art]]. He was quoted as saying "There is tremendous pressure for conformity from collectors and scholars, who want work that fits into the classic definition of Northwest Indian art. When things don't fit their expectations there's a raised eyebrow, and a sort of suggestion of 'What do we do with it now?'".&lt;ref name=jim1/&gt; This mindset is what allowed Schoppert to create his most recognizable pieces which are large carved panels made of multiple planks, painted in non traditional colors and the planks rearranged to create an entirely new look and a break from traditional methods and form line. Examples of this style are seen in his works ''Teasing Eagle'' and ''Raven Opens Box of Stars''.

During his career as an artist he also served on the state arts councils of both [[Alaska]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="DunhamADN"/&gt; He created the North Coast Indian flat design that is on the entrance to the west end of the [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] tunnel in [[Seattle]].  There are several of his works throughout Alaska and Washington.  This includes one of the last pieces he made, a large carving for the [[Port of Seattle]] to be installed at the [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]]{{Update after|2016|1|30|reason=The passage "to be installed" appears to reflect events and sources from around the time of his death.  It's nearly a quarter century later as I write this, so I think plenty of opportunity exists to ascertain whether the carving has actually been installed there or not.}}.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

==Artwork==
[[File:James Schoppert 1986 Alder, Pigment.jpg|thumb|''Blueberries'' (1986).]]
Schoppert's artwork covered a wide range of techniques such as traditional carving, abstract paintings, drawings, mask making and most notably his large carved panel pieces that are his most recognized. The wood panel pieces are also what created some controversy over whether his art was contemporary or Northwest Coastal. Schoppert learned that the Tlingit formline that was considered the traditional method was only a relatively recent development among the Northwest Indian. It was his opinion that enforcing the practices of 1850's or 1950's as the rule for all time amounted to artistic tyranny.&lt;ref name="DunhamADN"/&gt; He has been quoted as saying "Learn the rules, then break them".&lt;ref name="DunhamADN"/&gt; When talking about his panels, his intention was to further the art by following what he considered its natural progression. "If Art has a Master, Imagination cracks the whip".(1987)&lt;ref name=jim1/&gt; It is clear that he was true to his beliefs when examining his work. He went beyond the boundaries of traditional Northwest Coastal art and was a contributor to the evolution of contemporary native art.&lt;ref name="nmai1"&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa242.htm Smithsonian National Museum on the American Indian of Change: Retrospective Exhibition 1947-1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Modern Mask 1992.jpg|thumb|Modern Mask 1992]]

Although Schoppert is best known for his panels, he also produced several pieces that followed traditional methods and formline design. This is most evident in his mask making, an example of Jim using this style can be found in his mask ''Forehead Mask'' (1977) and ''Mussel Shell Rattle'' (1992). In addition he had several paintings and drawings that incorporate a Native theme, however, show no use of formline, again pushing the boundaries of what was considered "traditional" [[Northwest Coast art]].

'''Johann Schmidlap'''  of [[Schorndorf, Bavaria|Schorndorf]] was a 16th-century [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] [[fireworks]] maker and [[history of rockets|rocket pioneer]]. 

He published  a book on fireworks, ''Künstliche und rechtschaffene Fewrwerck zum Schimpff'' ("artful and well-made fireworks for entertainment"), printed in [[Nuremberg]] in 1561 (reprinted 1564, new edition by [[Katharina Gerlachin]] in 1590, 1591).

He may have been the first to successfully fly [[Multistage rocket|staged rockets]], although the concept is also discussed in the work of [[Conrad Haas]], which was a direct influence on Schmidlap.&lt;ref&gt;Doru Todericiu, 'Raketentechnik im 16. Jahrhundert', ''Technikgeschichte'' 34.2 (1967), 97&amp;ndash;114 (107f.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIA career==
Kiriakou was recruited into the CIA by a graduate school professor who had been a senior CIA official.&lt;ref name="ReluctantSpy2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvBrPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22John+Kiriakou%22&amp;num=100&amp;ei=_wqXS9TvCoKOygSWou3DCg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2|title=The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA's War on Terror|publisher=Random House|year=2010|isbn=9780553807370|author=John Kiriakou, Michael Ruby|accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiriakou spent the first eight years of his career as a [[Middle East]] analyst specializing on [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=ReluctantSpy2010 /&gt; He maintained a [[Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information]] security clearance.&lt;ref name=ReluctantSpy2010 /&gt; He learned Arabic and from 1994-1996 he was assigned to the American Embassy in [[Manama, Bahrain]], as an economic officer.&lt;ref name=ReluctantSpy2010 /&gt; He returned to Washington, D.C., and went back to work on Iraq until 1998 when he transferred to the CIA's [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]].&lt;ref name=ReluctantSpy2010 /&gt; He became a counter-terrorism [[operations officer]] and worked in [[Athens, Greece]], on [[Eurocommunist]] terrorism. In Greece, Kiriakou recruited foreign agents to spy for the United States, and was nearly assassinated by leftists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coll, Steve |authorlink=Steve Coll |authormask= |date=April 1, 2013 |title=The spy who said too much : why the Administration targeted a C.I.A. officer |department=The Political Scene |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=54–63 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/01/the-spy-who-said-too-much |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Kiriakou returned to [[CIA headquarters|CIA Headquarters]].&lt;ref name=ReluctantSpy2010 /&gt;

Following the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], Kiriakou was named Chief of Counterterrorist Operations in [[Pakistan]]. In that position, he led a series of [[raid (military)|military raid]]s on [[al-Qaeda]] [[safehouse]]s, capturing dozens of al-Qaeda fighters. Kiriakou led a raid on the night of March 28, 2002, in [[Faisalabad, Pakistan]], capturing [[Abu Zubaydah]], then thought to be al-Qaeda's third-ranking official.&lt;ref name=ReluctantSpy2010 /&gt; Following a 2002-2004 domestic assignment, Kiriakou resigned from the CIA in 2004.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Life after the CIA==
From 2004 until 2008, Kiriakou worked as a senior manager in Big Four accounting firm [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]]'s competitive intelligence practice.&lt;ref name="cnbcaccountantsandspies"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Javers|first1=Eamon|title=Accountants and spies: The secret history of Deloitte's espionage practice|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/19/accountants-and-spies-the-secret-history-of-deloittes-espionage-practice.html?__source=Facebook|accessdate=December 20, 2016|work=CNBC|date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 2008 until March 2009, [[Kiriakou]] was a terrorism consultant for [[ABC News]]. Following Senator [[John Kerry]]'s (D-MA) ascension to the chairmanship of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] in 2009, Kiriakou became the Committee's senior investigator, focusing on the Middle East, [[international terrorism]], [[piracy]], and [[counter-narcotics]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Ex-CIA Officer's Path from Terrorist Hunter to Defendant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/us/john-kiriakous-path-from-ambitious-spy-to-federal-defendant.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he left the Committee to become managing partner of Rhodes Global Consulting, and an [[Arlington, Virginia]]-based political [[risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] firm.&lt;ref name="Rhodes Global Consulting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhodes Global Consulting|author=Rhodes Global Consulting|url=http://rhodesglobal.com/about.html|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 2011 to April 2012, he resumed counter-terrorism consulting for ABC News.&lt;ref name="Rhodes Global Consulting"/&gt; He speaks often at colleges and universities around the country about the CIA, terrorism, torture, and ethics in intelligence operations.

== Disclosing torture ==
On December 10, 2007, Kiriakou gave an interview to ABC News&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/business/media/28abc.html "How ’07 ABC Interview Tilted a Torture Debate"], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described his participation in the capture of Abu Zubaydah, who was accused of having been an aide to Osama bin Laden. Kiriakou said he did not witness his waterboarding, but he had been told by CIA associates, it had taken only a single brief instance of waterboarding to extract answers.

{{quote|... He was able to withstand the waterboarding for quite some time. And by that I mean probably 30, 35 seconds ... and a short time afterwards, in the next day or so, he told his interrogator that Allah had visited him in his cell during the night and told him to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/images/Blotter/brianross_kiriakou_transcript1_blotter071210.pdf "Part One of the Transcript with John Kiriakou"], ABC.com 7 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kiriakou's accounts of Abu Zubaydah's waterboarding, and the relatively mild nature of it, were widely repeated in 2007, and paraphrased,&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;"... The waterboarding lasted about 35 seconds before Abu Zubaida broke down, according to Kiriakou, who said he was given a detailed description of the incident by fellow team members. The next day, Abu Zubaida told his captors he would tell them whatever they wanted ... He said that Allah had come to him in his cell and told him to cooperate, because it would make things easier for his brothers ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and he became a regular guest expert on news and public affairs shows, on the topics of interrogation, and counter-terrorism.

In 2009, it was reported that Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded at least 83 times,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/world/04/20/09/cia-waterboarded-key-al-qaeda-suspects-266-times-memo "CIA waterboarded key Al-Qaeda suspects 266 times: memo"], Agence France-Presse, 20 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and that little or no useful extra information may have been gained by "harsh methods".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032802066.html "Detainee's Harsh Treatment Foiled No Plots"], The Washington Post 28 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html "My Tortured Decision"], Ali Soufan, 22 April  2009, The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Kiriakou was under the mistaken belief that Zubaydah was waterboarded only once, and even that single instance he described as a form of torture and expressed reservations about whether the value of the information was worth the damage done to the United States' reputation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Kiriakou has said that he chose not to blow the whistle on torture through internal channels because he believed he "wouldn't have gotten anywhere" because his superiors and the congressional intelligence committees were already aware of it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/secretsources_low-res.pdf |title=Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression |date=November 10, 2015 |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |website= |publisher=PEN America |last= |first= |page=24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114165100/http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/secretsources_low-res.pdf |archivedate=November 14, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity==

Kiriakou is a founding member of the [[Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity]].&lt;ref name=AndyWorthington2015-09-15/&gt; In September 2015, Kiriakou and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the [[United States]] [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate Intelligence Committee]] on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s use of torture.

==Trial, sentence, and imprisonment==
Nearly five years after the Justice Department had concluded Kiriakou committed no crime by giving his 2007 ABC interview, the CIA approached the new Obama Justice Department,&lt;ref name=WashPo2018&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/i-went-to-prison-for-disclosing-the-cias-torture-gina-haspel-helped-cover-it-up/2018/03/15/9507884e-27f8-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html| title=I went to prison for disclosing the CIA's torture.

On April 5, 2012, Kiriakou was [[indictment|indicted]] for one count of violating the [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]], three counts of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]], and one count of [[making false statements]] for allegedly lying to the Publications Review Board of the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2012/former-cia-officer-john-kiriakou-indicted-for-allegedly-disclosing-classified-information-including-covert-officers-identity-to-journalists-and-lying-to-cias-publications-board Former CIA Officer John Kiriakou Indicted for Allegedly Disclosing Classified Information, Including Covert Officer’s Identity, to Journalists and Lying to CIA’s Publications Board] FBI Press release  April 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, Kiriakou pleaded [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]] to all charges and was released on bail.&lt;ref name=extrib&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/364529/reluctant-cia-spy-pleads-not-guilty-to-leaking-charges-gets-bail/ |title='Reluctant' CIA spy pleads not guilty to leaking charges, gets bail |newspaper=[[Express Tribune]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=April 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, [[Bruce Riedel]], a former intelligence adviser to [[Barack Obama]] who turned down an offer to be considered for CIA director in 2009, sent the President a letter signed by eighteen other CIA veterans urging that the sentence be [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]].&lt;ref name="jan 2013" /&gt;

On February 28, 2013, Kiriakou began serving his term at the low-security [[Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto]] in [[Loretto, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="BBC News" /&gt;
In June 2013, Kiriakou wrote an open "Letter From Loretto" to [[Edward Snowden]] expressing his support and giving advice, including "the most important advice that I can offer, DO NOT, under any circumstances, cooperate with the [[FBI]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2013/07/02/cia-whistleblower-john-kiriakous-open-letter-to-edward-snowden/  |author=Kevin Gosztola  |authorlink=Kevin Gosztola |title=CIA Whistleblower John Kiriakou's Open Letter to Edward Snowden  |publisher=Firedoglake  |date=July 2, 2013  |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2013, Kiriakou published an open letter, on [[Firedoglake]], warning former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] to beware of being tricked by [[FBI]] officials.&lt;ref name="PressTV2013-07-03"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.presstv.ir/usdetail/312042.html| title= CIA leaker warns Snowden of FBI agents|publisher   = [[Press TV]]| author = | date= 2013-07-03| accessdate  = 2013-07-03| archivedate = 2013-07-03| archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.presstv.ir%2Fusdetail%2F312042.html&amp;date=2013-07-03| quote = "FBI agents will lie, trick, and deceive you," Kiriakou wrote in an open letter to Snowden published by FireDogLake on Tuesday.

The FBI is the enemy; it's a part of the problem, not the solution," he said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned Snowden to anticipate FBI officials wearing clandestine listening devices who may attempt to betray and entrap him into making comments that, heard out of context, would seem incriminating.

On February 3, 2015, Kiriakou was released from prison to serve three months of house arrest at his home in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/JohnKiriakou/status/562780600323805185 |title=John Kiriakou on Twitter |date=February 3, 2015 |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shane|first1=Scott|title=Former C.I.A.

[[Saint#Catholic Church|Saint]] '''Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás''' (9 January 1902&amp;nbsp;– 26 June 1975) was a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest from [[Spain]] who initiated [[Opus Dei]], an organization of [[Catholic Laity|laypeople]] and [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]s dedicated to the teaching that everyone is called to holiness by God and that ordinary life can result in [[Sacred|sanctity]]. He was [[canonization|canonized]] during 2002 by [[Pope John Paul II]], who declared Saint Josemaría should be "counted among the great witnesses of Christianity." 

Escrivá gained a doctorate in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] and a doctorate in [[theology]] at the [[Pontifical Lateran University|Lateran University]] in Rome. His principal work was the initiation, government and expansion of Opus Dei.  Escrivá's best-known publication is ''[[The Way (book)|The Way]]'', which has been translated into 43 languages and has sold several million copies.

Escrivá and Opus Dei have aroused controversy, primarily concerning allegations of secrecy, [[elitism]], [[cult]]-like practices, and political involvement with [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] causes, such as the [[Francoist State|rule of Francisco Franco]] in Spain (1939–1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutchison|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his canonization attracted considerable attention and controversy, by some Catholics and the worldwide press.&lt;ref name="Woodward-Book"&gt;{{citation|last=Woodward|first=Kenneth L.|title=Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why|publisher=Touchstone|year=1996|isbn=978-0-684-81530-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several journalists who have investigated the history of Opus Dei, among them Vatican analyst [[John L.

==Biography==

===Early life===

'''José María Mariano Escrivá y Albás''' was born to José Escrivá y Corzán and his wife, María de los Dolores Albás y Blanc on 9 January 1902, in the small town of [[Barbastro]], in [[Huesca (province)|Huesca, Aragon, Spain]], the second of six children and the first of two sons. José Escrivá was a merchant and a partner of a textile company which eventually became bankrupt, forcing the family to relocate during 1915 to the city of [[Logroño]], in the northern province of [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], where he worked as a clerk in a clothing store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berglar|1994|pp=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Josemaría first felt that "he had been chosen for something", it is reported, when he saw footprints left in the snow by a [[monk]] walking barefoot.&lt;ref name="VDP"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vázquez de Prada|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Helming|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his father's blessing, Escrivá prepared to become a [[priest]] of the [[Catholic Church]].  He studied first in Logroño and then in [[Zaragoza]], where he was ordained as deacon on Saturday, 20 December 1924. He was ordained a [[priest]], also in Zaragoza, on Saturday, 28 March 1925. After a brief appointment to a rural parish in [[Perdiguera]], he went to [[Madrid]], the Spanish capital, during 1927 to study [[law]] at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Central University]]. In Madrid, Escrivá was employed as a private tutor and as a [[chaplain]] to the Foundation of Santa Isabel, which comprised the royal [[Convent of Santa Isabel]] and a school managed by the [[Little Sisters of the Assumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berglar|1994|pp=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission as the founder of Opus Dei===
A prayerful retreat helped him to discern more definitely what he considered to be God's will for him, and, on 2 October 1928, he "saw" [[Opus Dei]] ({{lang-en|Work of God}}), a way by which Catholics might learn to sanctify themselves by their secular work.&lt;ref name=Burger&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-real-st.-josemaria-escriva-and-the-film-version/ Burger, John. "The Real St. Josemaria Escriva and the Film Version", ''National Catholic Register'', May 16, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; He founded it during 1928, and Pius XII gave it final approval during 1950. According to the decree of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], which contains a condensed biography of Escrivá, "[t]o this mission he gave himself totally. From the beginning his was a very wide-ranging apostolate in social environments of all kinds. He worked especially among the poor and the sick languishing in the slums and hospitals of Madrid."&lt;ref name="ACF" /&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Escrivá fled from Madrid, which was controlled by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|republican]]s, via [[Andorra]] and [[France]], to the city of [[Burgos]], possessed by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalist]] forces of General [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berglar|1994|pp=135–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war ended during 1939 with Franco's victory, Escrivá was able to resume his studies in Madrid and complete a doctorate in law, for which he submitted a thesis on the historical jurisdiction of the [[Abbess]] of [[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas|Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]].&lt;ref name="Rocca"&gt;{{citation|first=Giancarlo|last=Rocca|title=Gli studi accademici di s. Josemaría Escrivá y Albás|language=Italian|journal=Claretianum|volume=49|pages=241–297|year=2009|url=http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Rocca_est.htm}} (available in Italian and Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, affiliated with Opus Dei, was founded on Sunday, 14 February 1943.  Escrivá relocated to [[Rome]] during 1946. The decree declaring Escrivá "Venerable" states that "in 1947 and on Monday, 16 June 1950, he obtained approval of Opus Dei as an institution of pontifical right. With tireless charity and operative hope he guided the development of Opus Dei throughout the world, activating a vast mobilization of lay people ... He gave life to numerous initiatives in the work of evangelization and human welfare; he fostered vocations to the priesthood and the religious life everywhere... Above all, he devoted himself tirelessly to the task of forming the members of Opus Dei."&lt;ref name="ACF" /&gt;

===Later years===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stjosemariagettogethermen.gif|thumb|right|250px|''' Josemaría Escrivá''' in a meeting with men. Pope John Paul II called Opus Dei's founder the "Saint of Ordinary Life."]] --&gt;

According to some accounts, at the age of two he suffered from a disease (perhaps [[epilepsy]]&lt;ref&gt;Luis Carandell, ''Vida y milagros de Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer, fundador del Opus Dei''. The relevant passage is available in Spanish [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Carandell/torreciudad.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;) so severe that the doctors expected him to die soon, but his mother had taken him to [[Torreciudad]], where the Aragonese locals venerated a statue of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] (as "Our Lady of the Angels"), thought to date from the 11th century. Escrivá recovered and, as the director of Opus Dei during the 1960s and 1970s, promoted and oversaw the design and construction of a major shrine at Torreciudad. The new shrine was inaugurated on 7 July 1975, soon after Escrivá's death, and to this day remains the spiritual center of Opus Dei, as well as an important destination for pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/our-lady-of-torreciudad "Our Lady of Torreciudad"], official Opus Dei website on Escrivá&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Escrivá’s death during 1975, the members of Opus Dei numbered some 60,000 in 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192421/Saint-Josemaria-Escriva-de-Balaguer Saint Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer]." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 1 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, Escrivá suffered from [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berglar|1994|pp=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to some sources, also epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Jesús Ynfante, ''El santo fundador del Opus Dei'', see [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Santo_fundador/capitulo_9.htm chapter 9] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1950, Escrivá was appointed an [[Honorary prelate#Reform|Honorary Domestic Prelate]] by Pope [[Pius XII]], which allowed him to use the title of [[Monsignor]]. During 1955, he received a doctorate of theology from the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Rocca"/&gt; He was a consultor to two Vatican congregations (the Congregation for Seminaries and Universities and the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]]) and an honorary member of the Pontifical Academy of Theology. The [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) confirmed the importance of the [[universal call to holiness]], the role of the laity, and the Mass as the basis of Christian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20021006_escriva_en.html|title=Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer (1902-1975)|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1948 Escrivá founded the Collegium Romanum Sanctae Crucis (Roman College of the Holy Cross), Opus Dei's educational center for men, in Rome. During 1953 he founded the Collegium Romanum Sanctae Mariae (Roman College of Saint Mary) to serve the women's section (these institutions are now joined into the [[Pontifical University of the Holy Cross]].) Escrivá also established the [[University of Navarre]], in [[Pamplona]], and the [[University of Piura]] (in [[Peru]]), as secular institutions affiliated with Opus Dei. Escrivá died on 26 June 1975, aged 73.

Three years after Escrivá died, the then Cardinal Albino Luciani (later [[Pope John Paul I]]) celebrated the originality of his contribution to Christian spirituality.&lt;ref name="A. Luciani 1978"/&gt;

==Personality and attitudes==

===Attitudes in general===
One of the persons who knew Escrivá best was the Bishop of Madrid, where Opus Dei was initiated, Bishop Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, for Escrivá would visit and report to him quite frequently and the two established a very strong friendship. In a 1943 report to Rome, the bishop stated: "The distinctive notes of his character are his energy and his capacity for organization and government; with an ability to pass unnoticed. He has shown himself most obedient to the Church hierarchy -- one very special hallmark of his priestly work is the way he fosters, in speech and in writing, in public and in private, love for Holy Mother Church and for the Roman Pontiff." Bishop Eijo y Garay wrote to the Jesuit Provincial of Toledo, Carlos Gomez Martinho, S.J. during 1941: "Fr. Escrivá is an exemplary priest, chosen by God for apostolic enterprises; humble, prudent, self-sacrificing in work, docile to his bishop, of outstanding intelligence and with a very solid spiritual and doctrinal formation." Eijo y Garay told an officer of the [[Falange]] that "[T]o think that Fr. Josemaría Escrivá is capable of creating anything secret is absurd. He is as frank and open as a child!" {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Viktor Frankl]], an Austrian psychiatrist and neurologist, founder of "[[logotherapy]]", and a Nazi concentration camp survivor, met Escrivá in Rome during 1970 and later wrote of "the refreshing serenity which emanated from him and warmed the whole conversation", and "the unbelievable rhythm" with which his thought flowed, and finally "his amazing capacity" for getting into "immediate contact" with those with whom he was speaking. Frankl went on: "Escrivá evidently lived totally in the present moment, he opened out to it completely, and gave himself entirely to it."&lt;ref&gt;The Tablet: [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/articles/4627/ How Escrivá changed my life], 19 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joan Baptista Torelló, [http://www.istmoenlinea.com.mx/articulos/23709.html?PHPSESSID=224e812b99ad4b7f4824bfc42513d369 Recuerdo de Víktor E. Frankl] (in Spanish), ''Archivo histórico'', '''48''' (286), septiembre/octubre 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Álvaro del Portillo]], who was Escrivá's closest collaborator for many years, there was one basic quality of Escrivá "that pervaded everything else: his dedication to God, and to all souls for God's sake; his constant readiness to correspond generously to the will of God."&lt;ref name="del Portillo 1996"&gt;{{Harvnb|del Portillo|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Paul VI]] summarized his opinion of what he termed the "extraordinariness" of Escrivá's sanctity in this way: "He is one of those men who has received the most charisms (supernatural gifts) and have corresponded most generously to them."

"The first impression one gets from watching Escrivá 'live'", [[John L. Allen, Jr.]] writes after watching some movies on the founder of Opus Dei during 2005, "is his effervescence, his keen sense of humor. He cracks jokes, makes faces, roams the stage, and generally leaves his audience in stitches in off-the-cuff responses to questions from people in the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;Mitch Finley review of [http://explorefaith.org/books/opusdei.html ''Opus Dei'' by John L. Allen Jr.] at explorefaith.org, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics, such as Spanish architect Miguel Fisac, who was one of the earliest members of Opus Dei and who associated with Escrivá for nearly twenty years before ending his relation with Escrivá and Opus Dei, have given a very different description of Escrivá as a pious but vain, secretive, and ambitious man, given to private displays of violent temper, and who demonstrated little charity towards others or genuine concern for the poor.&lt;ref name="Fisac1"&gt;Miguel Fisac, [http://www.opuslibros.org/escritos/miguel_fisac.htm "Nunca le oí hablar bien de nadie"], in ''Escrivá de Balaguer - ¿Mito o Santo?'' (Madrid: Libertarias Prodhufi, 1992); {{ISBN|84-7954-063-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to British journalist [[Giles Tremlett]], "biographies of Escrivá have produced conflicting visions of the saint as either a loving, caring charismatic person or a mean-spirited, manipulative egoist".&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Tremlett]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/05/spain.gilestremlett "Sainthood beckons for priest linked to Franco"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK), 5 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; French historian Édouard de Blaye has referred to Escrivá as a "mixture of mysticism and ambition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blaye|1976||pp=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towards God===
[[File:Benedictxvistjosemariastatue.jpg|frame|left|Benedict XVI blessing a statue of the founder of Opus Dei at an outside wall of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].]]

====Prayer====
On the centennial of Escrivá's birthday, Cardinal Ratzinger (who became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) commented: "I have always been impressed by Josemaría Escrivá's explanation of the name 'Opus Dei': an explanation ... gives us an idea of the founder's spiritual profile. Escrivá knew he had to found something, but he was also conscious that what he was founding was not his own work, that he himself did not invent anything and that the Lord was merely making use of him. So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God's Work). [This] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us and with us... If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, it seems to me that he is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Ratzinger]]: [http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfjosma.htm St Josemaría: God Is Very Much At Work In Our World Today], ''L'Osservatore Romano'', 9 October 2002, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In his canonization homily, Pope John Paul II described Escrivá as "a master in the practice of prayer, which he considered to be an extraordinary 'weapon' to redeem the world...It is not a paradox but a perennial truth; the fruitfulness of the apostolate lies above all in prayer and in intense and constant sacramental life." In John Paul II's ''Decree of Canonization'', he refers to the five brief prayers or aspirations of Escrivá through which "one can trace the entire life story of Blessed Josemaría Escrivá. He was barely sixteen when he began to recite the first two aspirations [''Domine, ut videam!'', Lord, that I might see! and ''Domina, ut sit!'', Lady, that it might be!], as soon as he had the first inklings of God's call. They expressed the burning desire of his heart: to see what God was asking of him, so that he might do it without delay, lovingly fulfilling the Lord's will.&lt;ref&gt;cf Lk 18:41&lt;/ref&gt; The third aspiration [''Omnes cum Petro ad Iesum per Mariam!'', All together with Peter to Jesus through Mary!] appears frequently in his writings as a young priest and shows how his zeal to win souls for God went hand in hand with both a firm determination to be faithful to the Church and an ardent devotion to Mary, the Virgin Mother of God. ''Regnare Christum volumus!'' We want Christ to reign!:&lt;ref&gt;cf 1 Corinthians 15:25&lt;/ref&gt; these words aptly express his constant pastoral concern to spread among all men and women the call to share, through Christ, in the dignity of God's children. God's sons and daughters should live for the purpose, to serve Him alone: ''Deo omnis gloria!'' All the glory to God!"&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Canon of the Mass|Roman Canon]], Major Doxology and minor elevation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romana: [http://en.romana.org/?s=1.0&amp;n=33&amp;ID=1 Towards the canonization of Josemaría Escrivá], '''33''', July–December 2001, pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

During the thanksgiving Mass for the canonization of St. Josemaría, [[John Paul II]], said: "In the Founder of Opus Dei, there is an extraordinary love for the will of God. There exists a sure criterion of holiness: fidelity in accomplishing the divine will down to the last consequences. For each one of us the Lord has a plan, to each he entrusts a mission on earth. The saint could not even conceive of himself outside of God's plan. He lived only to achieve it. St Josemaría was chosen by the Lord to announce the universal call to holiness and to point out that daily life and ordinary activities are a path to holiness. One could say that he was the saint of ordinary life."&lt;ref name="JPII-2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pope John Paul II|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Catholic commentators, however, were impressed equally by Escrivá's spirituality.  For instance, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] wrote in an article of 1963 that Escrivá's ''The Way'' provided an "insufficient spirituality" to sustain a religious organization and that the book was hardly more than "a little Spanish manual for advanced [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scouts]]".&lt;ref name="Balthasar"&gt;{{citation|first=Hans Urs|last=von Balthasar|title=Integralismus|language=German|journal=Wort und Wahrheit|volume=18|pages=737–744|year=1963}}. Published originally on 23 November 1963 in the periodical ''Neue Zürcher Nachrichten-Christliche Kultur''. A Spanish translation is available [http://www.opuslibros.org/prensa/balthasar.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Von Balthasar also questioned the attitudes towards prayer described by ''The Way'', declaring that Escrivá's use of prayer {{quote|moves almost exclusively within the circle of the self, of a self that must be great and strong, equipped with [[Paganism|pagan]] virtues, apostolic and [[Napoleon]]ic. That which is most necessary, which is the contemplative rooting of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]] "on good soil" (Matthew 13:8), that which constitutes the aim of the prayers of the saints, of the great founders, the prayer of a [[Charles de Foucauld|Foucauld]], is something one will search for in vain here.&lt;ref name="Balthasar" /&gt;}}
Von Balthasar repeated his negative evaluation of ''The Way'' during a television interview during 1984.&lt;ref name="Allen 2005 64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2005|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar criticism of Escrivá's spirituality has been stated by other commentators: for instance, according to Kenneth L. Woodward, a journalist who specializes in articles about the Catholic Church, "to judge by his writings alone, Escrivá's was an unexceptional spirit, derivative and often banal in his thoughts, personally inspiring, perhaps, but devoid of original insights", whose book ''The Way'' reveals "a remarkable narrowness of mind, weariness of human sexuality, and artlessness of expression."&lt;ref name="Woodward-Book-TheWay"&gt;{{citation|last=Woodward|first=Kenneth L.|title=Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why|publisher=Touchstone|year=1996|isbn=978-0-684-81530-5|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Towards the liturgy====
Escrivá conceived the Mass as the "Source and summit of the Christian's interior life," a terminology which was later used by the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref name="VDP"/&gt; According to [[Giovanni Battista Re]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]], "St. Josemaría strove with all his strength to make the Eucharist the center of his life... For him, Jesus was not an example to imitate from afar, an abstract moral ideal, but ''his Jesus'', a person we should live alongside continuously." {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Escrivá strove to obey whatever was indicated by the competent authority regarding the celebration of Mass and "[h]e took all necessary steps to ensure that the prescriptions of Vatican II, notably in the area of the liturgy, were applied within Opus Dei."&lt;ref&gt;Francois Gondrand, At God's Pace, Scepter, London-Princeton, 1989, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; As his prayer was much integrated with traditional liturgy, Escrivá found the transition difficult and asked Echevarría to help him with respect to the new rites. Although he missed the practices of the old rites, especially some gestures such as the kissing of the [[paten]] (a small plate, usually made of silver or gold, used to hold Eucharistic bread), he prohibited his devotees to ask for any dispensation for him "out of a spirit of obedience to ecclesiastical norms... He has decided to show his love for the liturgy through the new rite", commented Echevarría. However, when Msgr. [[Annibale Bugnini]], Secretary of the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy, learned of Escrivá's difficulties, he granted Escrivá the possibility of celebrating the Mass using the old rite. Whenever Escrivá celebrated this rite, he did so only in the presence of one Mass server.&lt;ref name="Echevarría Rodríguez 2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Echevarría Rodríguez|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Other priests&amp;nbsp;— such as Blessed Padre Pío and Blessed Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei&amp;nbsp;— continued to use the old Mass privately in preference to the new rite."''&lt;br /&gt; [http://www.latinmassireland.org/thelatinmass/what_is_the_latin_mass.html Latin Mass Society of Eire-Ireland. Member of Una Voce International, a lay organization approved by the Holy See]&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/4774|title=Latest News about Catholicism and Christianity in The Tablet|first=The Tablet - w:|last=enquiries@thetablet.co.uk|website=www.thetablet.co.uk|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a priest who worked as Escrivá's personal assistant before quitting Opus Dei during 1981,&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Annabel Miller, [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/4774 "Muscular Catholicism"], ''[[The Tablet]]'', 17 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in an interview for ''[[Newsweek]]'' that Escrivá was so distraught by the reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council that he and his deputy, [[Álvaro del Portillo]], "went to Greece in 1967 to see if [they] could bring Opus Dei into the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. Escrivá thought the [Catholic] church was a shambles and that the Orthodox might be the salvation of himself and of Opus Dei as the faithful remnant."&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;  Felzmann claims that Escrivá soon abandoned those plans as impracticable. Monsignor Flavio Capucci, a member of Opus Dei and the postulator of the cause for Escrivá's [[canonization]], denies that Escrivá ever contemplated quitting the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;  This was also denied by the information office of Opus Dei, which stated that Escrivá's visit to Greece during 1966 was done in order to analyze the convenience of organizing Opus Dei in that country, and that Escrivá even brought back [[icon]]s as presents for Pope Paul VI and Monsignor [[Angelo Dell'Acqua]] (then the substitute to the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Vatican Secretary of State]]), whom he had informed of the visit beforehand.&lt;ref name="Felzmann-EP" /&gt;

====Mortification====
Escrivá taught that "joy has its roots in the form of a cross", and that "suffering is the touchstone of love", convictions which were represented in his own life.&lt;ref name="BIOG"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gondrand|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Le Tourneau|1987}}, {{Harvnb|Vázquez de Prada|2001}}, {{Harvnb|Berglar|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He practiced [[Mortification of the flesh|corporal mortification]] personally and recommended it to others in Opus Dei. In particular, his enthusiasm for the practice of self-[[flagellation]] has attracted controversy, with critics quoting testimonies about Escrivá whipping himself furiously until the walls of his cubicle were speckled with blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutchison|2006|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the practice of self-mortification as a form of penance, and the conviction that suffering can help a person to acquire sanctity, have ample precedent in Catholic teaching and practice. Referring to Escrivá, John Paul II stated in ''Christifideles omnes'':{{quote|During the Spanish Civil War he personally experienced the fury of anti-religious persecution and gave daily proof of heroism in a constant priestly activity seasoned with abundant prayer and penance. It did not take long before many came to consider him a saint. When the war was over many bishops invited him to preach retreats to their clergy, thereby greatly contributing to the renewal of Christian life in Spain. Many religious orders and congregations also requested his pastoral services. At the same time, God allowed him to suffer public attacks. He responded invariably with pardon, to the point of considering his detractors as benefactors. But this Cross was such a source of blessings from heaven that the Servant of God's apostolate spread with astonishing speed.&lt;ref name="ACF"&gt;{{Harvnb|Angelo Felici|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Towards the Virgin Mary===
[[File:Univnavarrefairlove.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mother of Fair Love, a gift of Josemaría Escrivá to the [[University of Navarra]]: John Paul II stated: "Love for our Lady is a constant characteristic of the life of Josemaría Escrivá."]]
Pope John Paul II stated on Sunday, 6 October 2002, after the Angelus greetings: "Love for our Lady is a constant characteristic of the life of Josemaría Escrivá and is an eminent part of the legacy that he left to his spiritual sons and daughters." The Pope also said that "St. Josemaría wrote a beautiful small book called ''The Holy Rosary'' which presents spiritual childhood, a real disposition of spirit of those who wish to attain total abandonment to the divine will". {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

When Escrivá was 10 or 11 years old, he already had the habit of carrying the rosary in his pocket. As a priest, he would ordinarily end his homilies and his personal prayer with a conversation with the Blessed Virgin. He instructed that all rooms in the offices of Opus Dei should have an image of the Virgin. He encouraged his spiritual children to greet these images when they entered a room. He encouraged a Marian apostolate, preaching that ''"To Jesus we go and to Him we return through Mary"''. While looking at a picture of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] giving a rose to San [[Juan Diego]], he commented: "I would like to die that way." On 26 June 1975, after entering his work room, which had a painting of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], he slumped on the floor and died.&lt;ref name="BIOG"/&gt;

===Towards people===
"Escrivá de Balaguer was a very human saint", preached John Paul II. "All those who met him, whatever their culture or social status, felt he was a father, totally devoted to serving others, for he was convinced that every soul is a marvellous treasure; indeed, every person is worth all of Christ's Blood. This attitude of service is obvious in his dedication to his priestly ministry and in the [[magnanimity]] with which he started so many works of evangelization and human advancement for the poorest persons."&lt;ref name="JPII-2002"/&gt;

Former numerary María del Carmen Tapia (born 1925), who worked with Escrivá for 18 years inside the organization, seven as his secretary, wrote in her book, ''Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei'', that Escrivá often became angry, and that as secretary in charge of recording his words and actions, she was not allowed to record anything negative that she witnessed. She claims she was subjected to abusive words from Escrivá, who called her filthy names, and then screamed during this meeting with both men and women present, upbraiding a member who helped Tapia send letters. She was kept prisoner in the headquarters of Opus Dei in Rome from November 1965 until March 1966. "I was held completely deprived of any outside contact with the absolute prohibition to go out for any reason or receive or make telephone calls or to write or receive letters. Nor could I go out for the so-called weekly walk or the monthly excursion. I was a prisoner."&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Fox (priest)|Fox, Matthew]]. ''The Pope's War''. Sterling Ethos: New York (2011); {{ISBN|978-1-4027-8629-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some of his devotees claim that, through him, Opus Dei has been able to better the quality of life of many women, and refer to his respect for women and his interest in improving their lives.&lt;ref name="BIOG"/&gt; Historian [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], a Catholic convert, asserted that "Opus Dei has an enviable record of educating the poor and supporting women, whether single or married, in any occupation they choose."&lt;ref name="BIOG"/&gt;

===Towards his family===
Opus Dei's founder modified his name in several ways over the course of his life. In the Church records of the cathedral at Barbastro, he appears as having been baptized four days after birth with the name José María Julián Mariano, and his surname was spelled Escriba.&lt;ref name="Walsh-name"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh|2004|pp=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as his school days, José Escrivá had "adopted the rather more distinguished version spelled with a "v" rather than a "b."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh|2004|pp=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is spelled Escrivá in the memento of his first Mass. According to critics like Luis Carandell&lt;ref name="Carandell-name"&gt;Luis Carandell, ''Vida y milagros de Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer, fundador del Opus Dei''. The relevant passage is available in Spanish [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Carandell/estetica_apellido.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Walsh&lt;ref name="Walsh-name" /&gt; a former Jesuit priest, he also adopted the use of the conjunction ''y'' ("and") joining his father's and mother's surnames ("Escrivá y Albás"), a usage which he claims is associated with aristocratic families, even though that has been the legal naming format in Spain [[Spanish naming customs#The particle .E2.80.9Cy.E2.80.9D .28and.29|since 1870]].

On 16 June 1940, the Spanish ''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]]'' ("Official State Bulletin") records that Escrivá requested of the government that he be permitted to change his "first surname so that it will be written Escrivá de Balaguer". He justified the petition on the grounds that "the name Escrivá is common in the east coast and in [[Catalonia]], leading to harmful and annoying confusion".  On 20 June 1943, when he was 41 years old, the registry book of the Barbastro cathedral and the baptismal certificate of José María were annotated to represent "that the surname Escriba was changed to Escrivá de Balaguer".&lt;ref name="Carandell-name" /&gt;  [[Balaguer]] is the name of the town in Catalonia from which Escrivá's paternal family derived.

One of the earliest members of Opus Dei, and a friend for many years, the architect Miguel Fisac, who later quit Opus Dei, said that Escrivá found it embarrassing to have his father's family name since his father's company became bankrupt, that he had a "great affection for the aristocracy", and that, when Escrivá was a chaplain at the Foundation of Santa Isabel in Madrid, he would often meet aristocratic visitors who would ask, upon learning that his name was Escrivá, whether he belonged to the noble Escrivá de Romaní family, only to ignore him when they learned that he did not.&lt;ref name="Fisac1" /&gt; According to Vásquez de Prada, a writer, Opus Dei member, and official biographer who produced a three-volume biography of Escrivá, the act had nothing to do with ambition but was motivated rather by fairness and loyalty to his family.&lt;ref name="VDP"/&gt; The main problem is that in Spanish the letters ''b'' and ''v'' are pronounced in the same way and therefore bureaucrats and clerics had made mistakes in transcribing the Escrivá family name in some official documents throughout the generations. Defenders of Escrivá have also argued that the addition of "de Balaguer" corresponded to a practice adopted by many Spanish families that felt a need to distinguish themselves from others with the same surname but proceeding from [[Spanish naming customs#The particle .E2.80.9Cde.E2.80.9D .28of.29|different regions]] and consequently having different histories.

Escrivá's younger brother Santiago stated that his brother "loved the members of his family" and took good care of them.&lt;ref name="SANTIAGO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1992/05/17/061.html|work=Conocer el Opus Dei|author=Santiago Escrivá|date=17 May 1992|title=Mi hermano Josemaría|publisher=[[Diario ABC|ABC (Madrid)]]|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their father died, he says, Escrivá told their mother that "she should stay calm, because he will always take care of us. And he fulfilled this promise." Escrivá would find time in his busy schedule to chat and take a walk with his younger brother, acting like a father towards him. When the family transferred to Madrid, he obeyed the instructions of their father that he obtain a doctorate in Law. "Thanks to his docility to this advice", says Santiago, "he was able to support the family by giving classes in Law, and with this he acquired a juridical mentality ... which would later be so necessary to do Opus Dei." Monsignor Escrivá also modified his first name. From José María, he changed it to the original Josemaría. Biographers state, that around 1935 [age 33], "he joined his first two names because his single love for the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph were equally inseparable".&lt;ref name="VDP"/&gt;

===Towards his country===
Many of his contemporaries recount the tendency of Escrivá to preach about patriotism as opposed to nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Escrivá|1987|loc=Maxim 315}} ''"Love your own country: it is a Christian virtue to be patriotic. But if patriotism becomes nationalism, which leads you to look at other people, at other countries, with indifference, with scorn, without Christian charity and justice, then it is a sin."'' [http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/furrow-point-315.htm Furrow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Escrivá|2002|loc=Maxim 525}}. ''"To be 'Catholic' means to love your country and to be second to no one in that love. And at the same time, to hold as your own the noble aspirations of other lands.&amp;nbsp;— So many glories of France are glories of mine! And in the same way, much that makes Germans proud, and the peoples of Italy and of England..., and Americans and Asians and Africans, is a source of pride to me also. Catholic: big heart, broad mind."'' [http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/the_way-point-525.htm Excerpt from ''The Way'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have alleged that Escrivá personally, as well as the organization of Opus Dei, were associated originally with the ideology of "National Catholicism", particularly during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and during the years immediately after it, and that they were therefore also closely associated with the authoritarian regime of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. According to [[Catalonia|Catalan]] sociologist Joan Estruch:

{{quote|More than "a classic of the spirituality of all time", Escrivá de Balaguer is at bottom ''a child of his time'': he is the product of a specific country, a specific epoch, a specific church. These are the [[Francoist Spain|Spain of General Franco]] and the church of [[Pope Pius X]]. If Opus Dei had "never seen the need to bring itself up to date", as Escrivá maintained, Opus would today be a [[paramilitary]], pro-[[Fascism|fascist]], [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|antimodernist]], [[Integrism|integralist]] (reactionary) organization.  If it is not, it is because it has evolved over time, just as the Catholic Church, the Franco regime, and Msgr. Escrivá himself evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Estruch|1995|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Estruch cites, for instance, the fact that the first edition of Escrivá's ''The Way'', finished in [[Burgos]] and published in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] during 1939, had the dateline ''Año de la Victoria'' ("Year of the Victory"), referring to Franco's military triumph over the [[Republican Faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] forces in the civil war,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Estruch|1995|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a prologue by a pro-Franco bishop, Msgr. Xavier Lauzurica, which ended with the admonition to the reader to "always stay vigilant and alert, because the enemy does not sleep. If you make these maxims your life, you will be a perfect imitator of Jesus Christ and a gentleman without blemish. And with Christs like you Spain will return to the old grandeur of its saints, wise men, and heroes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Estruch|1995|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escrivá preached personally to General Franco and his family during a week-long spiritual retreat at the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|Pardo Palace]] (Franco's official residence) in April 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2005|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vittorio Messori]] claims that the ties between Escrivá and Francoism are part of a [[black legend]] propagated against Escrivá and Opus Dei.&lt;ref name="MESSORI" /&gt; Allen states that based on his research Escrivá could not be said to be ''pro-Franco'' (for which he was criticized for not joining other Catholics in openly praising Franco) nor ''anti-Franco'' (for which he was criticized for not being "pro-democracy"). According to Allen, there is no statement from Escrivá for or against Franco.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOOK"/&gt; Escrivá's devotees and some historians have emphasized his personal effort to avoid partiality in politics. Professor [[Peter Berglar]], a German historian, asserts that Franco's [[falangists]] suspected Escrivá of "internationalism, anti-Spainism and Freemasonry" and that during "the first decade of Franco's regime, Opus Dei and Escrivá were attacked with perseverance bordering on fanaticism, not by enemies, but by supporters of the new [[Spanish State]]. Escrivá was even reported to the ''Tribunal for the Fight against Freemasonry''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berglar|1994|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honors===
Escrivá received several awards:
*The Grand Cross of Alfonso X the Wise (1951)
*The Gold Cross of St. Raymond of Penyafort (1954)
*The [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|Grand Cross of Isabella the Catholic]] (1956)
*The [[Order of Charles III|Grand Cross of Charles III]] (1960)
*Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Zaragoza (Spain, 1960)
*The Gold Medal by the City council of [[Barbastro]] (1975).

Some biographers have said that Escrivá did not seek these awards, that they were nevertheless granted to him, that he accepted them due to charity to those who were granting these, and that he did not give the slightest importance to these awards.&lt;ref name="BIOG" /&gt;  Journalist Luis Carandell, however, recounts testimonies about how members of Opus Dei paid for the insignia of the Grand Cross of Charles III to be made from gold, only to have Escrivá angrily reject it and demand instead one encrusted with [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamond]]s. Carandell holds that this episode was part of a larger pattern in Escrivá's life of ambition for social prestige and the trappings of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Carandell, "La otra cara del beato Escrivá", ''Cambio 16'', March 1992. Available in Spanish [http://www.opuslibros.org/prensa/luis_carandell.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; Sympathetic biographers, however, insist that Escrivá taught that material things are good, but that people should not get attached to them and should serve only God.  It is reported that he declared that "he has most who needs least" and that it took only 10 minutes to gather his possessions after his death.&lt;ref name="BIOG"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In addition to the questions raised about the depth of Escrivá's spirituality and theological thinking, about his purported habits of secretiveness and elitism (although, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle-to-low levels of society, in terms of education, income, and social status),&lt;ref name="MESSORI"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Messori, Vittorio| title=Opus Dei, Leadership and Vision in Today's Catholic Church | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=1997 | isbn=0-89526-450-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; about his alleged bad temper and ambition for social status and worldly luxuries, several other specific aspects of Escrivá's life and work have generated some criticism, particularly regarding his [[canonization]] by the Catholic Church. These sources of criticism include his alleged private statements in defense of [[Adolf Hitler]], collaboration by members of Opus Dei with right-wing political causes (especially during General [[Francisco Franco]]'s dictatorship in [[Spain]]), Escrivá's request for the rehabilitation in his favor of an [[Nobility|aristocratic]] title, and allegations that he maintained bad relations with other Catholic officials, of whom he could be very critical in private.

===Alleged defence of Hitler===
During Escrivá's beatification process, Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann, who had been Escrivá's personal assistant before Felzmann quit Opus Dei and became a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster]] and an aide to [[Basil Hume|Cardinal Basil Hume]], sent several letters to Fr. Flavio Capucci, the postulator (i.e., chief promoter) of Escrivá's cause. In his letters, Msgr. Felzmann claimed that, during 1967 or 1968, during the intermission to a [[World War II]]-themed movie, Escrivá had said to him "Vlad, Hitler couldn't have been such a bad person. He couldn't have killed six million. It couldn't have been more than four million".&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, Kenneth L., [http://www.newsweek.com/1992/01/12/a-questionable-saint.html "A Questionable Saint"], ''[[Newsweek]]'', 13 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;[[Damian Thompson|Thompson, Damian]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/01/18/bbdavi16.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/01/18/ixartleft.html "A creepy scrape with the Da Vinci Code set"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK), 18 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Felzmann later explained that those remarks should be regarded in the context of Catholic [[anti-communism]] in Spain, emphasizing that during 1941 all of the male members of Opus Dei (who then numbered about fifty) offered to join the "[[Blue Division]]", a group of Spaniard volunteers who joined the [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] in their fight against the [[Soviet Army]], along the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]].&lt;ref name="Felzmann-EP"&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1992/01/08/sociedad/694825201_850215.html "Escrivá de Balaguer justificó el genocidio judío, según el semanario ''Newsweek''"], ''[[El País]]'' (Madrid), 1 August 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2005|p= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another phrase that has been attributed to Escrivá by some of his critics is "Hitler against the Jews, Hitler against the Slavs, means Hitler against Communism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2005|p= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Álvaro del Portillo]], who succeeded Escrivá as the director of Opus Dei, declared that any claims that Escrivá endorsed Hitler were "a patent falsehood" and part of "a slanderous campaign".&lt;ref name="del Portillo 1996"/&gt; He and others have stated that Escrivá regarded Hitler as a "pagan", a "racist", and a "tyrant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pontealdia.net/criticas/nazismo.htm|title=El hombre de Villa Tevere|year=1995|author=Pilar Urbano|author-link=Pilar Urbano|accessdate=2007-01-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210145836/http://www.pontealdia.net/criticas/nazismo.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Opus Dei and politics]].)

===Alleged support for right-wing leaders===
One of the most controversial accusations against Escrivá is that he and Opus Dei were active in bolstering far-right regimes,&lt;ref name="BBCDECODING"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4249444.stm|work=BBC News|date=16 September 2005|title=Decoding secret world of Opus Dei|accessdate=2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] in Spain.  After 1957, several members of Opus Dei served as ministers in Franco's government.&lt;ref&gt;See a [http://www.opusdei.es/art.php?p=36332 list] given in Opus Dei's official website&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the "technocrats" most associated with the "[[Spanish miracle]]" of the 1960s were members of Opus Dei: [[Alberto Ullastres]], Mariano Navarro Rubio, [[Gregorio López-Bravo y Castro|Gregorio López-Bravo]], [[Laureano López Rodó]], Juan José Espinosa, and Faustino García-Moncó.  Most of them came to the government with the patronage of Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] who, though not a member of Opus Dei himself, was reportedly quite sympathetic to the organization and its values and who, as Franco grew older, increasingly came to exercise the day-to-day control of the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutchison|2006|pp=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist Luis Carandell, when Ullastres and Navarro Rubio were first appointed to the government during 1957, Escrivá gleefully exclaimed "They have made us ministers!"&lt;ref&gt;Luis Carandell, ''Vida y milagros de Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer, fundador del Opus Dei'' (Madrid: Editorial Deriva, 2nd ed., 1992). See transcription of the relevant passages [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Carandell/ministros.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; something which Opus Dei has officially denied.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.unav.es/capellania/fluvium/textos/documentacion/igl169.htm Entrevista al Cardenal Julián Herranz], 16 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 May 1958, Escrivá sent a letter to Franco, which said, in part:

{{quote|Although a stranger to any political activity, I cannot help but rejoice as a priest and Spaniard that the Chief of State’s authoritative voice should proclaim that, "The Spanish nation considers it a badge of honour to accept the law of God according to the one and true doctrine of the Holy Catholic Church, inseparable faith of the national conscience which will inspire its legislation." It is in fidelity to our people’s Catholic tradition that the best guarantee of success in acts of government, the certainty of a just and lasting peace within the national community, as well as the divine blessing for those holding positions of authority, will always be found. I ask God our Lord to bestow upon your Excellency with every sort felicity and impart abundant grace to carry out the grave mission entrusted to you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odan.org/escriva_to_franco.htm|title=Letter from Escriva to Franco|website=www.odan.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During 1963, Swiss theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], also a Catholic, wrote a scathing critique of Escrivá's spirituality, describing Escrivá's method of religion as a form of "[[integrism]]" (also called "Catholic integralism"), stating "despite the affirmations of the members of Opus Dei that they are free in their political options, it is undeniable that its foundation is marked by [[Francoism]], that that is the 'law within which it has been formed'".&lt;ref name="Balthasar" /&gt; In another essay, published the next year, von Balthasar characterized Opus Dei as "an integrist concentration of power within the Church" and the main motivation of integrism as "imposing the spiritual with worldly means".&lt;ref name="Balthasar-2"&gt;{{citation|first=Hans Urs|last=von Balthasar|title=Friedliche Fragen an das Opus Dei|language=German|journal=Der Christliche Sonntag|volume=16|pages=117|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1979, von Balthasar distanced himself from a newspaper attack on Opus Dei which had cited his earlier accusations of integrism.  He wrote in a personal letter to the Prelature, sent also to the ''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'', that "because of my lack of concrete information, I am not able to give an informed opinion about Opus Dei today. On the other hand, one thing strikes me as obvious: many of the criticisms levelled against the movement, including those of your own journal concerning the religious instruction given by Opus Dei members, seem to me to be false and anti-clerical."&lt;ref name="MESSORI" /&gt;  Von Balthasar maintained his unfavourable judgment of Escrivá's spirituality and repeated it in a television interview during 1984, but he did not renew his criticism of Opus Dei as an organization.&lt;ref name="Allen 2005 64" /&gt;

In response to the accusations of "integrism", Escrivá declared that, "Opus Dei is neither on the left nor on the right nor in the centre" and that "as regards religious liberty, from its foundation Opus Dei has never practised discrimination of any kind."&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations with Saint Josemaría Escrivá'', Scepter Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59417-057-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59417-057-7}}, pgs. 72-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Opus Dei officials state that individual members are free to choose any political affiliation, emphasizing that among its members were also two important people of the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchist]] political opposition of the 1970s in Spain: the writer [[Rafael Calvo Serer]], who was forced into exile by Franco's regime, and the journalist [[Antonio Fontán]], who became the first president of the Senate after the transition to democracy.

The alleged involvement of Opus Dei in Latin American politics has also been a topic of debate.  According to US journalist [[Penny Lernoux]], the [[Argentine Revolution|1966 military coup]] in Argentina occurred soon after its leader, General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], attended a retreat sponsored by Opus Dei.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2004 131–132"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh|2004|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his 1974 visit to Latin America, Escrivá visited [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/catechetical-trips|title=Opus Dei - Saint Josemaría|website=www.josemariaescriva.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This visit occurred nine months after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]] in Chile that deposed [[Marxism|Marxist]] president [[Salvador Allende]] and installed a right-wing military dictatorship, directed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]].  Critics have charged that Opus Dei members endorsed Pinochet's coup and then had a role in the "[[Miracle of Chile]]" of the 1980s similar to that of the "technocrats" during the Spanish Miracle of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2004 131–132"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Escobar Martínez, [http://www.insumisos.com/diplo/NODE/3458.HTM "El Opus Dei en Chile"], in ''Opus Dei - Génesis y expansión en el mundo'' (Santiago: [[LOM Ediciones]], 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, among the major right-wing politicians, only [[Joaquín Lavín]] (who did not occupy public office under Pinochet) has been unequivocally identified as a member of Opus Dei.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Franklin, "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/15/2 Chile bowled over by God's technocrat]", ''The Guardian'', 15 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Another member of Opus Dei, Jorge Sabag Villalobos, belongs to a centre-left party that opposed Pinochet's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Arellano, "[http://www.cambio21.cl/cambio21/site/artic/20111215/pags/20111215171650.html El insólito mundo del diputado Sabag]", ''Cambio21'', 18 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berglar]], a German historian and member of Opus Dei, has written that connecting Opus Dei with fascist regimes is a "gross slander".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berglar|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Noam Friedlander]] states that allegations about Opus Dei involvement with the Pinochet regime are "unproven tales."&lt;ref name="Noam"/&gt; Several of Escrivá's collaborators stated that he actually despised dictatorships.&lt;ref name="del Portillo 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Echevarría Rodríguez 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Julian Herranz|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julián Herranz, ''En las afueras de Jericó: Recuerdos de los años con san Josemaría y Juan Pablo II'', Rialp 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

John Allen has written that Escrivá was neither anti-Franco nor pro-Franco.&lt;ref name="Allen 2005 61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2005|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critics of Opus Dei, such as Miguel Fisac&lt;ref name="Fisac1" /&gt; and [[Damian Thompson]], have argued that the group has always sought "advancement not only of its message but also of its interests",&lt;ref name="Thompson-Allen"&gt;[[Damian Thompson]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3647363/A-veiled-approach-to-the-Vatican.html "A veiled approach to the Vatican"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK), 25 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and that it has consistently courted those with power and influence, without maintaining a coherent political ideology.

===Title of nobility===
Another source of controversy about Escrivá was the fact that, during 1968, he requested and received from the Spanish [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of Justice]] the rehabilitation in his favor of the [[Nobility|aristocratic]] title of [[Marquess]] of [[Peralta de Calasanz|Peralta]].&lt;ref name="delaCierva"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín Oficial del Estado,'' 25 January 1968; ''Ibid'', Decree 1851/1968, 3 August 1968.  Referenced in [[Luis Carandell]], ''Vida y milagros de Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer, fundador del Opus Dei'' (Madrid: Editorial Deriva, 2nd ed., 1992); extract transcribed [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Carandell/marques_de_peralta.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official ''Guía de grandezas y títulos del reino'' ("Guide to the [[grandee]]ships and titles of the realm"), the title of Marquess had originally been granted during 1718 to Tomás de Peralta, minister of state, justice and war for the [[Kingdom of Naples]], by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio de Justicia, ''Grandezas y Títulos del Reino: Guía Oficial'', (Madrid: Centro de Publicaciones, 1967-1969), pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1715, Archduke Charles had been, as "Charles III", a pretender to the Spanish throne (''see'' [[War of Spanish Succession]]), and from 1711 until 1740 he ruled as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Naples]].

Escrivá's successful petition of a title of nobility has aroused controversy not only because it might seem at odds with the humility befitting a Catholic priest, but also because the same title of Marquess of Peralta had been rehabilitated during 1883 by [[Pope Leo XIII]] and King [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] in favor of a man to whom Escrivá had no male-line family association: the [[Costa Rica]]n diplomat [[Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro]] (1847–1930).&lt;ref name="Borel"&gt;[[André Borel d'Hauterive]],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=OSsYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=genealogique%20de%20la%20maison%20de%20peralta&amp;pg=PA294#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Notice historique et généalogique sur la maison de Peralta,"] ''Annuaire de la Noblesse de France et des Maisons Souveraines de l'Europe 1886'' (Paris: Plon, Nourrit &amp; Cie., 1885), pgs. 292-304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saenz"&gt;Jorge Sáenz Carbonell, [http://www.rree.go.cr/file-dd.php?id_file=14 "Biografía: Don Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro (1847-1930), II Marqués de Peralta, Embajador Emérito de Costa Rica"], Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, República de Costa Rica.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodiplomatico.org/art_diplomatico_especial/manuel_maria_peralta_alfaro.pdf "Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro, Diplomático e historiador costarricense: Carrera diplomática"] ''México Diplomático'', Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion, the documents ordering the rehabilitation claimed that the original title had been granted during 1738 (not 1718) to Juan Tomás de Peralta y Franco de Medina, by Charles of Austria in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor, not as pretender to the Spanish throne. Ambassador Peralta, who during 1884 had married a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[count]]ess, Jehanne de Clérembault,&lt;ref name="Borel"/&gt; died without children during 1930.&lt;ref name="Saenz"/&gt; None of his kinsmen in Costa Rica requested the transmission of the marquessate, but one of them has published an extensive genealogical study that would seem to contradict any claim by Escrivá to the title.&lt;ref name="delaCierva"&gt;{{Harvnb|de la Cierva|1993|pp=143–158}} The passage is transcribed [http://www.opuslibros.org/prensa/marques_delacierva.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Fernández Peralta, "Genealogía de la Casa Peralta en Costa Rica", ''Revista de la Academia Costarricense de Ciencias Genealógicas'', '''30-31''' (1987), pgs. 7-63; see also genealogy [http://www.genealogia.or.cr/academia/presidentes/ricardofernandezperalta.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Extracto del dictamen del abogado español don Carlos Amigó, del Colegio de Abogados de Barcelona, sobre el mayorazgo de don Manuel María de Peralta", ''Revista de la Academia Costarricense de Ciencias Genalógicas'', August 1955, pgs. 31-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Escrivá did not use the title of Marquess of Peralta publicly and, during 1972, he ceded it to his brother Santiago.  The argument by endorsers of Escrivá that he requested the rehabilitation of the title as a favor to his family, and that it was his intention from the beginning to cede it to his brother, seems belied by the fact that, during 1968, Santiago had requested for himself the rehabilitation of a different title of nobility, the [[baron]]y of San Felipe, which was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín Oficial del Estado'', 25 January 1968; Referenced in Luis Carandell, ''Vida y milagros de Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer, fundador del Opus Dei'' (Madrid: Editorial Deriva, 2nd ed., 1992).  See transcription of the relevant passages [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Carandell/marques_de_peralta.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Ricardo de la Cierva]] (a former [[Ministry of Culture (Spain)|Minister of Culture]] in the Spanish government) and to architect Miguel Fisac (who knew Escrivá personally at the time), Escrivá's original request for the title might have been part of an unsuccessful attempt to join the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), a Catholic religious order which required its members to be of noble birth and of which his deputy in Opus Dei, Msgr. [[Álvaro del Portillo]], was already a member.&lt;ref name="Fisac1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="delaCierva"/&gt;

Several biographers say Escrivá prohibited his devotees from asking for the title of Marquess of Peralta. They state that Escrivá accepted it due to the advice of some cardinals who told him that he had the obligation to do so for the sake of his brother, Santiago, and so as to practice what he preached about fulfilling civil duties and exercising rights.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} His brother Santiago said: "The decision was heroic because he knew that he will be vilified as a result... Josemaría did what is best for me. After the right amount of time has passed, without making use of the title (in fact he never had the intention of using it), he passed the title on to me."&lt;ref name="SANTIAGO"/&gt;

Giancarlo Rocca, a Church historian and a professor at the ''[[Institute of the Theology of the Consecrated Life Claretianum|Claretianum]]'' in Rome, claims that Escrivá actively sought the rank of [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] but was twice refused by the [[Roman Curia|Vatican curia]], first during 1945, and later during 1950 (when he and his devotees had lobbied for his appointment as bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vitoria|Vitoria]]). According to Fr. Rocca, in both instances the curial officials privately expressed concerns about the organization of Opus Dei and about the psychological profile of Escrivá.&lt;ref name="Rocca" /&gt;

Sociologist Alberto Moncada, a former member of Opus Dei, has collected and published various oral testimonies about Escrivá's difficult relations with other officials of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Moncada-oral"&gt;Alberto Moncada, ''Historia oral del Opus Dei'', (Barcelona: Plaza &amp; Janés, 1987).  {{ISBN|84-01-33337-7}}. Available in Spanish [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/historia_oral/capitulo1.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Moncada quotes Fr. Antonio Pérez Tenessa, who at the time was secretary general of Opus Dei in Rome, as witnessing Escrivá's intense displeasure concerning the election of [[Pope Paul VI]] during 1963, and later even expressing doubts in private about the salvation of the Pope's soul.&lt;ref name="Moncada-oral" /&gt;  Journalist Luis Carandell claims that, during his years in Rome, Escrivá kept his distance from the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superior General]], [[Pedro Arrupe]], to the extent that Arrupe once joked with Monsignor [[Antonio Riberi]], the [[nuncio|apostolic nuncio]] to Spain, about doubting whether Escrivá really existed.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Carandell, ''Vida y milagros de Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer, fundador del Opus Dei''. The relevant passage is available in Spanish [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Carandell/prologo1992.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to María del Carmen Tapia, who worked with Escrivá in Rome, the founder of Opus Dei had "no respect" for Popes [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] or Paul VI and believed that his own organization of Opus Dei was "above the Church in holiness."&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; According to Moncada, Escrivá's years in Rome were dedicated in large part to his campaign to make Opus Dei independent from the authority of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Diocesan bishops|diocesan bishop]]s and the Vatican curia, something which was finally achieved, after Escrivá's death, with the establishment during 1982, by Pope [[John Paul II]], of Opus Dei as a [[personal prelature]], subject only to its own prelate and to the Pope.&lt;ref name="Moncada-oral" /&gt; As such, Opus Dei is currently the only personal prelature in the Catholic Church, although this juridical figure - similar in nature to other kinds of hierarchical organization in the Church's history, such as military and personal ordinariates - is fruit of the Second Vatican Council's aim to provide pastoral attention in ways more suited to the actual situation of many of its faithful.&lt;ref name="Prelatures, Ordinariates"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preguntas Frecuentes|url=http://prelaturaspersonales.org/prelaturas-personales/preguntas-frecuentes-2/|website=Prelatures, Ordinariates, and other personal circumpscriptions|accessdate=3 October 2017}}The relevant passages are available in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, its work complements that of the dioceses, and in some cases even takes the form of a more direct collaboration: for example, when priests of Opus Dei assume pastoral care of parishes at the request of the local bishops.&lt;ref name="Dolan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stagnaro|first1=Angelo|title=Faith and the City: Opus Dei Assumes Responsibility for St. Agnes Church|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/faith-and-the-city-opus-dei-assumes-responsibility-for-st.-agnes-church|accessdate=3 October 2017|work=National Catholic Register|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escriva may have had this in mind when he wrote, "The only ambition, the only desire of Opus Dei and each of its members is to serve the Church as the Church wants to be served, within the specific vocation God has given us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ocariz et al.|first1=Fernando|title=The Canonical Path of Opus Dei|date=1994|publisher=Scepter|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the prelature does not exempt a Catholic from the authority of the local diocesan bishop.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOOK" /&gt;

==Beatification and canonization==
{{Main article|Canonization of Josemaría Escrivá}}

After the death of Escrivá de Balaguer on 26 June 1975, the Postulation for the Cause of his beatification and canonization received many testimonies and postulatory letters from people all over the world.{{Harvnb|Holy See|}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the fifth anniversary of Escrivá's death, the Postulation solicited the initiation of the cause of [[beatification]] from the Vatican [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. One-third of the world's bishops (an unprecedented number) petitioned for Escrivá's beatification.&lt;ref name="MESSORI"/&gt;

His cause for beatification was introduced in Rome on 19 February 1981 on the strength of the apparently [[miracle|miraculous]] cure during 1976 of a rare [[disease]], [[lipomatosis]], suffered by Sister Concepción Boullón Rubio, whose family had prayed to Escrivá to help her. On 9 April 1990, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared that Escrivá possessed Christian virtues to a "heroic degree", and on 6 July 1991 the Board of Physicians for the Congregation of the Causes of Saints unanimously accepted the cure of Sister Rubio. He was beatified on 17 May 1992.

By way of a letter dated 15 March 1993, the Postulation for the Cause received news about the miraculous cure of Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey from cancerous chronic [[radiodermatitis]], an incurable disease, which took place in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reported miracle, apparently brought about by Escrivá's intervention, was ruled valid by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and approved by Pope John Paul II during December 2001, enabling the [[canonization]] of Escrivá. John Paul II, who frequently expressed public endorsement of Opus Dei and its work, canonized Escrivá on 6 October 2002.  The canonization Mass was attended by 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, general superiors of many orders and religious congregations, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During the days of the canonization event, Church officials commented on the validity of the message of the founder, repeating John Paul II's decree ''Christifideles Omnes'' on Escrivá's virtues, which said that "by inviting Christians to be united to God through their daily work, which is something men will have to do and find their dignity in as long as the world lasts, the timeliness of this message is destined to endure as an inexhaustible source of spiritual light, regardless of changing epochs and situations." {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Criticism of the process===
Various critics questioned the rapidity of [[Josemaría Escrivá: Canonisation#Criticism about process of canonization|Escrivá's canonization]]. On the eve of Escrivá's beatification during 1992, journalist William D. Montalbano, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', described it as "perhaps the most contentious beatification in modern times."&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;Montalbano, William D., [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-16/news/mn-1978_1_opus-dei-members "Pope to Beatify Controversial Spanish Priest"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that the process was plagued by irregularities. However, endorsers refer to Fr. Rafael Pérez, an [[Augustinian]] priest who presided over the tribunal in Madrid for Escrivá's cause, as "one of the best experts" on canonization. Fr. Pérez stated that the process was fast because Escrivá's figure is "of the universal importance," the Postulators "knew what they were doing", and, during 1983, the procedures were simplified in order to present "models who lived in a world like ours." Fr. Flavio Capucci, the Postulator, also reported that the 6,000 postulatory letters to the Vatican showed "earnestness".&lt;ref&gt;''Documentation Service'', '''V''', pg. 3, March 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Escrivá's canonization was one of the first to be processed after the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] streamlined the procedures for canonization, and so it was processed more quickly than was typical before. [[Mother Teresa]] was canonized even more quickly, having been beatified just 6 years after her death (Escrivá was beatified in 17 years). According to journalist Kenneth L. Woodward, the 6,000-page long ''[[positio]]'' (the official document about the life and work of the candidate for sainthood prepared by the postulators) was declared confidential, but leaked to the press in 1992, after Escrivá's beatification. Woodward declared that, of 2,000 pages of testimonies, about 40% are by either [[Álvaro del Portillo]] or [[Javier Echevarría Rodríguez]] who, as successors of Escrivá at the head of Opus Dei, would have the most to gain from the Church recognizing that organization's founder as a saint. The only critical testimony quoted in the ''positio'' was by Alberto Moncada, a Spanish sociologist who had been a member of Opus Dei and whose testimony might have been easier for the Church authorities to dismiss because he had had little personal contact with Escrivá and had left the Catholic Church altogether. This critical testimony covered a mere two pages.&lt;ref name="Woodward-Book-positio"&gt;{{citation|last=Woodward|first=Kenneth L.|title=Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why|publisher=Touchstone|year=1996|isbn=978-0-684-81530-5|pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the process also questioned the fact that some of the physicians involved in the authentication of the two "scientifically inexplicable cures" achieved through the posthumous intercession of Escrivá, such as Dr. Raffaello Cortesini (a heart surgeon), were themselves members of Opus Dei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutchison|2006|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican has stated that the Medical Consultants for the Congregation affirmed unanimously that the miraculous cure of a cancerous state of chronic radiodermatitis in its third and irreversible stage in Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey (a country doctor in the village of [[Almendralejo]]) was "very quick, complete, lasting and scientifically inexplicable." After six months, the theological consultants, according to the Vatican, also unanimously attributed this cure to Escrivá.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/latest/documents/escriva_cronologia-causa_en.html|work=Vatican|author=Vatican Congregation for Causes of Saints|title=Chronology of the Cause for Canonization of Josemaria Escriva|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the year of his canonization, the Opus Dei prelate reported that the Postulation has gathered 48 reports of unexplained medical favors attributed to Escriva's intercession, as well as 100,000 ordinary favours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opusdei.it/art.php?p=4637%7cLuigi|title=Accattoli, Corriere della sera, 5 October 2002|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Opus Dei members critical of Escrivá's character who claim that they were refused a hearing during the beatification and canonization processes include Miguel Fisac (a well-known Spanish architect who was one of the earliest members of Opus Dei and remained an associate of Escrivá for nearly twenty years),&lt;ref name="Fisac1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisac2"&gt;[[Miguel Fisac|Fisac, Miguel]] [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/ESCRIVA_DE_BALAGUER/_JOSE_MARIA/OPUS_DEI/Mentiras/piadosa/caridad/cristiana/elpepisoc/19920420elpepisoc_20/Tes "Mentiras bajo la piadosa 'caridad cristiana'"], ''[[El País]]'' (Madrid), 20 April 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Msgr.

According to journalist Kenneth L. Woodward, before the official beatification he

{{quote|was able to interview six other men and women who had lived and/or worked closely with Escrivá.  The examples they gave of vanity, venality, temper tantrums, harshness toward subordinates, and criticism of popes and other churchmen were hardly the characteristics one expects to find in a Christian saint.  But their testimony was not allowed to be heard.  At least two of them were vilified in the ''positio'' by name, yet neither of them was permitted to defend their reputations.&lt;ref name="Woodward-Book-critics"&gt;{{citation|last=Woodward|first=Kenneth L.|title=Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why|publisher=Touchstone|year=1996|isbn=978-0-684-81530-5|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Catholic theologian [[Richard McBrien]] termed Escrivá's sainthood "the most blatant example of a politicized [canonization] in modern times."&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IuOlQJPbycwC&amp;pg=PA52 ''Lives of the Saints: From Mary and St. Francis of Assisi to John XXIII and Mother Teresa''], (Harper Collins, New York, 2003), pg. 52; {{ISBN|978-0-06-123283-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catholic writer and biographer John Allen such views are countered by many other ex-members, the present members, and the estimated 900,000 people who attend activities of Opus Dei. He says that the interpretation of the facts "seems to depend upon one's basic approach to spirituality, family life, and the implications of a religious vocation."  Allen's account of Opus Dei and its founder, however, was not accepted by all reviewers as impartial.&lt;ref name="Thompson-Allen" /&gt;

===Reports of discord among judges===
Escrivá's canonization attracted an unusual amount of attention and criticism, both within the Catholic Church and by the press. Father Capucci, the [[postulator]] of Escrivá's cause for sainthood, summarized the main accusations against Escrivá: that "he had a bad temper, that he was cruel, that he was vain, that he was close to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, that he was pro-[[Nazi]] and that he was so dismayed by the [[Second Vatican Council]] that he even travelled to [[Greece]] with the idea that he might convert to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religion".&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Poggioli: [http://www.culteducation.com/reference/opus/opus34.html ''Controversy over the canonization of Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer''], National Public Radio (NPR), 6 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Newsweek]]'' article by Woodward claimed that, of the nine judges of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] presiding over Escrivá's cause for beatification, two requested a suspension of the proceedings. The dissenters were identified as [[Luigi De Magistris (cardinal)|Luigi De Magistris]], a prelate working in the Vatican's tribunal of the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]], and  Justo Fernández Alonso, rector of the Spanish National Church in [[Rome]].  According to Woodward, one of the dissenters wrote that the beatification of Escrivá could cause the church "grave public scandal."&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; The same article quoted Cardinal [[Silvio Oddi]] as declaring that many bishops were "very displeased" with the rush to canonize Escrivá so soon after his death.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; In interviews, [[José Saraiva Martins]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], has denied being aware of that dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2897659813414712158|title=Politics, Religion, Democracy: Opus Dei and the Vatican|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal ''Il Regno'', published in [[Bologna]] by the congregation of the [[Leon Dehon|Priests of the Sacred Heart]] (the Dehonians), reproduced, during May 1992, the confidential vote of one of the judges in Escrivá's cause of beatification, in which the judge asks that the process be suspended and questions the undue haste of the proceedings, the near absence of testimony from critics in the documentation gathered by the postulators, the failure of the documentation to properly address issues about Escrivá's relations with the Franco regime and with other Catholic organizations, and suggestions from the official testimonies themselves that Escrivá lacked proper spiritual humility.&lt;ref name="VoteSuspension"&gt;{{citation|last=Congregazione per le cause dei santi|title=Mons. Escrivá: l’eroicità delle virtù|language=Italian|journal=Il Regno|volume=37|pages=297–304|year=1992|url=http://www.ilregno.it/it/archivio_articolo.php?CODICE=4678|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040030/http://www.ilregno.it/it/archivio_articolo.php?CODICE=4678|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}. The text of the vote for suspension is available [http://www.opuslibros.org/libros/Causa_Escriva/Voto_suspensivo.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;

This document does not identify the judge by name, but he indicates that he met Escrivá only once, briefly, during 1966, while serving as a notary for the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]], which implies that the judge in question was De Magistris. In his vote (which its own contents date to August 1989), De Magistris also argues that the testimony from the main witness, [[Álvaro del Portillo]], who was Escrivá's [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confessor]] for 31 years, should have been excluded from the proceedings.&lt;ref name="VoteSuspension" /&gt;  John Allen Jr. comments that, according to some observers, De Magistris suffered as a result of his opposition to Escrivá's beatification. De Magistris became director of the Apostolic Penitentiary during 2001, an important position in the Vatican bureaucracy which normally is followed by elevation to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and retired less than two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2005|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmag.html|title=Luigi Cardinal de Magistris [Catholic-Hierarchy]|first=David M.|last=Cheney|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope Francis made De Magistris a cardinal on 14 February 2015.

==Teachings and legacy==

The significance of Escrivá's message and teachings has been a topic of debate, by Catholics and others.  The Protestant French historian [[Pierre Chaunu]], a professor at the Sorbonne and president of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, said that "the work of Escrivá de Balaguer will undoubtedly mark the 21st century. This is a prudent and reasonable wager. Do not pass close to this contemporary without paying him close attention".&lt;ref&gt;Vue Culturelle'', 5–6 February 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], who was appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by Pope John Paul II (but died during 1988 before his investiture), dismissed Escrivá's principal work, ''The Way'', as "a little Spanish manual for advanced Boy Scouts" and argued that it was quite insufficient to sustain a major religious organization. However, the monk and spiritual writer [[Thomas Merton]] declared that Escrivá's book "will certainly do a great deal of good by its simplicity, which is the true medium for the Gospel message".&lt;ref name="Allen 2005 64" /&gt;

[[File:Ourladyofpeaceopusdeiprelaticchurchsjosemariaremains.jpg|right|frame|Opus Dei's prelatic church, Our Lady of Peace, located in its central headquarters in Rome: Below the altar lie the mortal remains of St. Josemaría de Escrivá.]]

Critics of Opus Dei have often argued that the importance and originality of Escrivá's intellectual contributions to theology, history, and law, at least as measured by his published writings, has been grossly exaggerated by his devotees.&lt;ref name="Allen 2005 64" /&gt; However, various officials of the Catholic church have spoken well of Escrivá's influence and of the relevance of his teachings. In the decree introducing the cause of beatification and canonization of Escrivá, Cardinal [[Ugo Poletti]] wrote during 1981: "For having proclaimed the [[universal call to holiness]] since he founded Opus Dei during 1928, Msgr. Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, has been unanimously recognized as the precursor of precisely what constitutes the fundamental nucleus of the Church's magisterium, a message of such fruitfulness in the life of the Church."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[Sebastiano Baggio]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]], wrote a month after Escrivá's death: "It is evident even today that the life, works, and message of the founder of Opus Dei constitutes a turning point, or more exactly a new original chapter in the history of Christian spirituality." A Vatican ''peritus'' or consultor for the process of beatification said that "he is like a figure from the deepest spiritual sources". [[Franz König]], Archbishop of Vienna, wrote in 1975:

"The magnetic force of Opus Dei probably comes from its profoundly lay spirituality. At the very beginning, in 1928, Msgr. Escrivá anticipated the return to the Patrimony of the Church brought by the Second Vatican Council ... [H]e was able to anticipate the great themes of the Church's pastoral action in the dawn of the third millennium of her history."&lt;ref&gt;''Opus Dei:Leadership and Vision In Today's Catholic Church'' Messori, Vittoria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSbtSHaPzpwC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=The+magnetic+force+of+Opus+Dei+probably+comes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3EDQHFjmQB&amp;sig=S47lO6ZufON5b5fSmd7M-xDZC4U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SoQVUuUj48bbBZO2gOAI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The+magnetic+force+of+Opus+Dei+probably+comes&amp;f=false|title=Opus Dei: Leadership and Vision in Today's Catholic Church|first=Vittorio|last=Messori|date=20 November 1997|publisher=Regnery Pub.|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "absolutely central" part of Escrivá's teaching, says American theologian William May, is that "sanctification is possible only because of the grace of God, freely given to his children through his only-begotten Son, and it consists essentially in an intimate, loving union with Jesus, our Redeemer and Savior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Belda, Manuel|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Escrivá's books, including ''Furrow'', ''The Way'', ''Christ is Passing By'', and ''The Forge'', continue to be read widely, and emphasize the laity's calling to daily sanctification (a message also to be found in the documents of [[Vatican II]]). Pope John Paul II made the following observation in his homily at the beatification of Escrivá:

{{quote|With supernatural intuition, Blessed Josemaría untiringly preached the universal call to holiness and apostolate. Christ calls everyone to become holy in the realities of everyday life. Hence work too is a means of personal holiness and apostolate, when it is done in union with Jesus Christ.}}

John Paul II's decree ''Christifideles omnes'' states: "By inviting Christians to seek union with God through their daily work&amp;nbsp;— which confers dignity on human beings and is their lot as long as they exist on earth&amp;nbsp;— his message is destined to endure as an inexhaustible source of spiritual light regardless of changing epochs and situations".&lt;ref name="ACF"/&gt;

Paxton he recorded the novelty song "[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]", which reached # 1 on the charts in 1960 and was credited to the non-existent group [[the Hollywood Argyles]]. In 1961 he co-produced the instrumental "Like, Long Hair", arranged by Paxton, which became a #38 hit for [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]]. He arranged "[[Nut Rocker]]" for [[B. Bumble and the Stingers]], which became a # 1 hit in the UK in 1962 and talent scouted "[[Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow]]", a #48 hit for [[the Rivingtons]]. The following year he produced "Popsicles and Icicles" by [[the Murmaids]], which reached #3 in the charts in 1963 and which was written by a pre-[[Bread (band)|Bread]] [[David Gates]], then a [[session musician]] and songwriter who had met Fowley while Kim was [[hitchhiking]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="amg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="byrds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/relassociates06.html |title=Musicians Associated with the Byrds - F |publisher=Ebni.com |accessdate=January 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120181130/http://ebni.com/byrds/relassociates06.html |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1960s, Fowley publicized/consulted singer [[P.J. Proby]] and relocated for a time to London, England. Fowley wrote the [[lyrics]] for the song "Portobello Road", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of [[Cat Stevens]]' first single, "[[I Love My Dog]]". He produced a [[Them (band)|Them]] spin-off band led by two ex-Them members, brothers Pat and Jackie McAuley (who were only allowed to use the band name Other Them in the UK, but called themselves Them on the European continent, releasing an album called ''Them Belfast Gypsies'' and a single "Let's Freak Out" under the name Freaks of Nature); an early incarnation of [[Slade]] known as the N'Betweens; [[Soft Machine]] (he produced "[[Love Makes Sweet Music]]", their first single); and the Lancasters, an [[instrumental]] rock group featuring a young [[Ritchie Blackmore]]. He worked with an up-and-coming band, the Farinas, and renamed them "[[Family (band)|Family]]".

Fowley worked on occasion as a recording artist in the 1960s, issuing albums such as ''Love Is Alive and Well''. In 1965 he wrote and produced a song about the [[psychedelic experience]], "[[The Trip (Kim Fowley song)|The Trip]]". He later was credited for "hypephone" on [[Frank Zappa]]'s first album ''[[Freak Out!]]'' Other singles by Fowley as a recording artist included "Animal Man", during the song he remarks "Its too dirty, it'll be banned"  from his popular 1968 album ''[[Outrageous (Kim Fowley album)|Outrageous]]''.  All his efforts as a solo artist since 1970 have become cult items, both in reissue and bootleg formats.

In 1968, Fowley joined forces with a young band from [[Topanga Canyon]] California, [[St John Green]], to produce their only album containing songs, musical soundtracks, comedy and dark poetry.  The band comprised Ed Bissot (bass), Bill Kirkland (guitars), Vic Sabino (vocals, harmonica and percussion), Mike Baxter (organ), and Shel Scott (drums). The album was engineered by [[The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band|Michael Lloyd]]. Fowley later claimed it to be "one of the great lost records...Somebody will reissue it someday and people will start crying and jacking off and smoking dope to it. It's a great record. There's only a handful of records that I’ve made that are great."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Kim Fowley by Mike Stax, ''[[Ugly Things]]'' magazine, issue #19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released by [[MGM Records|MGM]] on the Flick Disc label, but the group disbanded soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.60sgaragebands.com/stjohngreen.html  St. John Green, ''60sgaragebands.com''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221153047/http://www.60sgaragebands.com/stjohngreen.html |date=December 21, 2014 }}.

He is credited with being the inspiration behind promoter John Brower's call to [[John Lennon]] that resulted in the last-minute appearance of the [[Plastic Ono Band]] at the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] on September 13, 1969, where Fowley was the [[MC]].  At this event, Fowley invited the audience to light matches and lighters to welcome a nervous John Lennon to the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kim-fowley-runaways-dead-at-75-20150115 |first=Kory |last=Grow |title=Kim Fowley, Runaways Producer and L.A. Rock Icon, Dead at 75 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=15 January 2015 |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Fowley produced the album ''I'm Back and I'm Proud'' for [[Gene Vincent]]. He co-wrote for [[Warren Zevon]]'s first [[solo album]], ''[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Warren Zevon album)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon''&lt;/ref&gt; Fowley collaborated with his friend Skip Battin during Battin's membership as bassist with [[the Byrds]] on a number of songs which appeared on their early '70's albums:
"The Hungry Planet", "You All Look Alike", "Tunnel of Love", "Citizen Kane", "Absolute Happiness", "Precious Kate", and "America's Great National Pastime". The latter song was released as a single in late 1971. When Battin moved on to the New Riders of the Purple Sage in 1974, Fowley and Battin co-wrote five songs for the New Riders: "On the Amazon", "Big Wheels", "Singing Cowboy", "Neon Rose" and "Strangers on a Train".

===1970s===
In 1973, Fowley produced three recordings by [[Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids]] for the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973). These songs were "[[At the Hop]]", "[[Louie Louie]]" and "[[He's So Fine|She's So Fine]]". He co-wrote songs for [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Leon Russell]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. He made recordings with [[Jonathan Richman]] and [[the Modern Lovers]], which were eventually released in 1981 as ''[[The Original Modern Lovers]]''. Fowley's tracks were not included on the original versions of the album ''[[The Modern Lovers (album)|The Modern Lovers]]'' but some were included on later CD reissues.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;Tim Mitchell, ''There's Something About Jonathan'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-7206-1076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Fowley placed an advertisement in local fanzine ''[[Who Put the Bomp]]'' looking for female performers. He hoped to form an all-girl group that he could produce and would perform his songs, but no one responded to the advert. In 1975, he met the teenage guitarist [[Joan Jett]] who expressed interest in forming an all-girl band. Less than two weeks later, he met 15-year-old drummer [[Sandy West]] who introduced herself outside of the [[Rainbow Bar and Grill]] in Hollywood, California. West told Fowley of her aspirations to form an all-girl band after playing in all male groups. This meeting led to Fowley giving West Jett's phone number. The two met and began playing together at West's home the following week. A short time later Fowley recruited [[Lita Ford]], [[Cherie Currie]], and [[Jackie Fox]]. They eventually became [[the Runaways]]. While he did produce some of their albums and contributed lyrics to songs, the band was primarily responsible for creating their own music. The group severed their ties with Fowley in 1977.

Fowley co-wrote two [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] songs "[[King of the Night Time World]]" and "[[Do You Love Me? (Kiss song)|Do You Love Me?]]" with [[Paul Stanley]] and producer [[Bob Ezrin]]. Both appeared on Kiss' 1976 album ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]''.

In 1978, Fowley formed [[the Orchids]], another all-female rock band, with [[Laurie McAllister]], the last bassist from [[The Runaways]], and [[Sandy Fury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1202691/|title=Sandy Fury|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 13-year-old rock prodigy on rhythm guitar and vocals.

In 1979, Fowley signed new artists, such as Tommy Rock, the Popsicles, and the Orchids.  Fowley promoted "Kim Fowley Night" featuring these bands at the [[Whisky a Go Go]]. Fowley brought Stiv Bators &amp; the Dead Boys, the Popsicles, and the Orchids into Leon Russell's Cherokee Recording Studio in Hollywood to record "LA, LA (I'm on a Hollywood High)".

===1980s===
In the 1980s Fowley moved to Australia where he announced that he was "looking for the new [[The Beatles|Beatles]] or [[ABBA]]". His search turned up power pop band Beathoven who were still under a [[recording contract]] with [[EMI]]. Changing their name to [[The Innocents (Australian band)|the Innocents]], he secured a new record deal with Trafalgar Records and produced several songs for the group. They too became a cult band in later bootlegs/reissues. Fowley produced the first demos for the iconic power pop band, [[Candy (band)|Candy]], which featured [[Gilby Clarke]] and [[Kyle Vincent]]. Vincent was Fowley's personal assistant. Producer Fowley and attorney David Chatfield recorded the first album for [[Steel Breeze]] at Rusk studios in Hollywood and got Steel Breeze their recording contract with RCA. Casey Kasem, on the edition of March 12, 1983 of American Top 40, describes how Fowley discovered Steel Breeze while going through approximately 1200 demo tapes that were about to be discarded by a local Hollywood nightclub, Madam Wongs. "You Don't Want Me Anymore" was the first single from the band's self-titled album and quickly jumped into the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 supported by a video that was a favorite of early MTV, and peaked at # 16. The next single, "Dreamin' Is Easy", also made it into the Top 40.

In 1984, still owning rights to the name "the Runaways", Fowley rebuilt the image around Gayle Welch, an unknown teenager from [[New Zealand]]. Adding Denise Prior, Missy Bonilla (then a typist for Denny Diante at what was [[Sony Music|CBS Records]]) and Cathy DiAmber (Catherine Dombrowski) with David Carr on keyboards, a Chicago guitarist Bill Millay and numerous [[session musician]]s. Fowley, assisted by New Zealander Glenn Holland, sought to cash in on the fame of the former Runaways members who had gone on to significant success in their individual solo careers. In 1985, he returned to the United States and recorded further songs with the Innocents' David Minchin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/theinnocents|title=The Innocents|author=|work=ReverbNation|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Fowley spotted the band Shanghai (consisting of [[Eric Leach]] and Taz Rudd of [[Symbol Six (band)|Symbol Six]], [[Brent Muscat]] of [[Faster Pussycat]], [[Patrick Muzingo]], and Todd Muscat of Decry) at the Troubadour. After seeing their performance he asked, "Are you ready to make a record?!" They immediately moved in with Fowley and began writing and recording songs. [[David Libert]], [[Alice Cooper]]'s ex-road manager and agent for [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]], was recruited to come in to handle the day-to-day babysitting chores. Shanghai played the reopening of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in April 1986 with [[Guns N' Roses]] and Faster Pussycat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w-axl-rose.com/Venues/1986/1986.html |title=~ Guns N' Roses Venues : 1986 |publisher=W-axl-rose.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their last show was at the Scream in Los Angeles in 1987.

===2000s===
Fowley is featured in ''[[Mayor of the Sunset Strip]]'', a 2003 documentary about the disc jockey [[Rodney Bingenheimer]].

Also in 2003, Fowley made a return trip to London, England, where he made an in-store appearance at Intoxica Records on Portobello Road and curated and performed an evening of music and entertainment at the Dirty Water Club at its then base at the Boston Music Room in North London.

Kim became an experimental filmmaker after the DVD release of ''Mayor of the Sunset Strip''. His written and directed works include: ''Black Room Doom'', ''Dollboy: The Movie'', ''Satan of Silverlake'', ''The Golden Road to Nowhere'', ''Frankenstein Goes Surfing'', ''Trailer Park's On Fire'' and ''Jukebox California''. Video clips/scenes from these movies can be seen on YouTube and Myspace, and feature a cast of regulars including but not limited to musical oddities such as the Fabulous Miss Wendy, Giddle Partridge, Richard Rogers (Crazy White Man) and Clown Porn Queen Hollie Stevens.

Fowley released the 21 track solo album ''Adventures in Dreamland'' on WEED/[[Innerstate Records]] in 2004. It contained the songs "Mayor of the Sunset Strip," "Terrors in Tinseltown," and "Ballad of Phil Spector."&lt;ref name=dreamland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/adventures-in-dreamland-mw0000334652|title=Adventures in Dreamland - Kim Fowley - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Fowley was reunited with Cherie Currie at Houdini's mansion in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lecaro |first=Lina |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/play/news/no-harm-no-fowley-runaways-riv |title=Los Angeles – After 30 Years the Runaways' Cherie Currie Buries the Hatchet with Kim Fowley – Play – LA Weekly |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116041626/http://blogs.laweekly.com/play/news/no-harm-no-fowley-runaways-riv/ |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played three dozen gigs between June 2007 and February 2009 as the act ''Crazy White Man'', a duo featuring him on vocals and Richard Rogers on guitar. The bulk of the Crazy White Man shows took place during 2008 and included the Tribute to Gidget Gein, which raised funds for Gidget's [[Hollywood Forever]] memorial.&lt;ref name="kimfowley1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=http://www.kimfowley.net/victories/2008.htm|title=2008 Current Activities|publisher=Kim Fowley|date=|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitol re-released several of his titles, and director [[Guy Ritchie]] used his song "The Trip" in the 2008 film ''[[RocknRolla]]''. Fowley was recently regularly heard on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] with a four-hour show on Saturdays and Sundays.

Currie wrote a memoir of her time in the Runaways, which was turned into the film, ''[[The Runaways (film)|The Runaways]]'', released on March 19, 2010. It featured [[Kristen Stewart]] playing Jett, and [[Dakota Fanning]] portraying Currie. [[Michael Shannon]] played the part of Fowley.

In 2012, Fowley won the Special Jury Prize at the 13th [[Melbourne Underground Film Festival]] for his two feature projects – ''Golden Road to Nowhere'' and ''Black Room Doom''.

===2010s===
In his last years, Fowley worked on writing and publishing his autobiography, which he divided between three distinct books. He released the first volume of his autobiography, ''Lord of Garbage,''  published by Kicks Books, in 2012. It covers the years 1939–1969 and describes his early childhood and beginning years in the music business. The second volume of his autobiography was intended to be called ''Planet Pain'' and to cover the years 1970–1994. The last volume of his autobiography was intended to be finished on his deathbed and to be released posthumously, for as the 2010s began, Fowley was disease-stricken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelosangelesbeat.com/2013/10/offbeat-l-a-kim-fowley-bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold-last-stop-before-the-neon-graveyard/|title=Offbeat L.A.: Kim Fowley- Bad Boy With a Heart of Gold (Last Stop Before the Neon Graveyard)|work=The LA Beat|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 2014, Fowley married longtime girlfriend and music executive Kara Wright-Fowley, in a private ceremony in Los Angeles.

== Death ==
Fowley died of [[bladder cancer]] in Hollywood, California on January 15, 2015 at the age of 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McDonald |first1=Soraya Nadia |title=Kim Fowley, creator of The Runaways, dead at 75 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/01/16/kim-fowley-creator-of-the-runaways-dead-at-75/ |accessdate=July 10, 2015 |work=Washington Post |date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In a 2001 interview, [[Michael Steele (musician)|Michael Steele]] of [[The Bangles]] fame claims she was fired from the Runaways by Fowley for refusing his sexual propositions.&lt;ref name="WeGotTheNeutronBomb"&gt;{{cite news

In 2015, [[Jackie Fox|Jackie Fuchs]] (formerly Jackie Fox of the Runaways) claimed that Fowley had raped her while he was involved with the band.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/09/the-runaways-jackie-fuchs-claims-she-was-raped-by-manager-kim-fowley  "The Runaways' Jackie Fuchs claims she was raped by manager Kim Fowley in 1975", ''The Guardian'', 9 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fox also alleges that Jett and Currie witnessed the rape, a claim which Jett denies, but songwriter Kari Krome and other bystanders corroborated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/the-lost-girls/  Jason Cherkis, "The Lost Girls", ''Huffington Post'', 9 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Religious text primary|date=December 2010}}
'''Laban''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|b|ə|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «lā´bun»&lt;/ref&gt; was the name of a person in the first part of the [[Book of Mormon]], a scripture of the [[Latter Day Saint]] movement.  Although he only makes a brief appearance in the narrative, his [[brass]] plates would play an important role amongst the [[Nephite]]s, who are the book's main protagonists.

==Background==
In the book of [[First Nephi]], chapters three and four, Laban is described as a notable citizen of [[Jerusalem]] who commanded great wealth and many servants.  Among his possessions was a set of [[brass]] plates containing the [[genealogy]] of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]], a major character in the early portion of the Book of Mormon.  Lehi, having left the city with his family in response to God's command, enjoined his four sons to return to Jerusalem and retrieve them: "For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehi furthermore stated that this injunction did not originate with himself, but with the Lord, who had spoken to him on this matter in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrieving Laban's brass record==
Lehi's two older sons, [[Laman and Lemuel]], were reluctant to obey their father's order at first, fearful of Laban's power and ruthless reputation.  However, Lehi's fourth son, [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], vowed that he would obey God's command: "For I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the four sons of Lehi set out for Jerusalem.

First, Laman went to Laban alone to request the records, but Laban cast Laman out of his house and threatened to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, Nephi and his brothers offered all of their families valuables that they had left behind in Jerusalem after they had fled into the wilderness, to Laban in return for the brass plates.  The Book of Mormon then states that Laban "did lust" after their wealth and "thrust" Nephi and his brothers from his house, but then sent his servants to kill them. In their haste to escape with their lives, Lehi's sons had to abandon their families goods and flee, thus allowing Laban to take possession of their families wealth .&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fleeing Jerusalem, the elder brothers Laman and Lemuel were angry with Lehi and their younger, more faithful, brothers [[Sam (Book of Mormon)|Sam]] and Nephi, so they beat their siblings with rods.  Suddenly, an [[angel]] appeared, commanding the elder duo to desist and all of them to return forthwith to the city, where Laban would fall into their hands.  Laman and Lemuel demurred: "Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?"&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Nephi encouraged his brothers by reminding them of God's might, it was only with great reluctance that they agreed to press on.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Undaunted, Nephi slipped back into Jerusalem alone that night, where he soon found Laban lying unconscious in a [[Alcohol intoxication|drunken]] stupor.  The [[Holy Spirit|Spirit of God]] told Nephi to kill Laban with his own [[sword]] and seize the records, saying "It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  After complying, Nephi disguised himself as Laban and headed towards Laban's treasury where the brass plates were kept.  On the way there he found one of Laban's servants, Zoram, whom he commanded to retrieve the brass plates&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and to follow him out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zoram obeyed, and once outside the city, Nephi revealed that he was not Laban, and he and his brothers convinced Zoram to join them and their family in their journey to the New World.

==The content of the brass plates==
Upon returning to his family in the wilderness, Nephi turned over the "Plates of Laban" to Lehi, who made a complete inspection of them.  Lehi determined that the plates contained:

*The [[Five Books of Moses]] (the Jewish Torah);&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A history of the Jewish people, down to the reign of [then current] King [[Zedekiah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=12}}.  Zedekiah's story is found in II Kings 24:18-25:7 and II Chronicles 36:11-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The prophecies of the Israelite prophets down to [[Jeremiah]], seen in the Book of Mormon as a contemporary of Lehi;&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
*A genealogy of all the tribes of Israel including a genealogy of Lehi's own ancestors, revealing him to be a descendant of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], son of the patriarch [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading the contents of the brass plates, Lehi prophesied that they would "never be dimmed any more by time,"&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they would ultimately "go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sword of Laban==
When Nephi encountered the unconscious Laban, he noticed that Laban was wearing a fine sword made of "precious steel" with a hilt of "pure gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  After slaying Laban, Nephi took this sword for himself.  He would later use it as a model for manufacturing similar weapons for his people's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently Laban's sword was passed down through the centuries to future prophets, kings, and warriors, as it is mentioned many centuries later in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=1|verse=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon orthodoxy maintains that the sword exists to the present day, and was hidden away with the [[Gold Plates]] found by [[Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.about.com/library/weekly/aa111402a.htm |title=The Destiny of the Sword of Laban |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2006-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of the Law of the Lord==
[[James J. Strang]], one of several contenders to succeed Joseph Smith during the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|1844 succession crisis]], asserted that he had been given the "Plates of Laban" in fulfillment of Lehi's prophecy.  His translation of selections from them was published in 1851 as ''The Book of the Law of the Lord: Being a Translation from the Egyptian of the Law Given to Moses in Sinai''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/book_of_the_law.htm Book of the Law of the Lord, Being a Translation from the Egyptian of the Law Given to Moses in Sinai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013071439/http://mormonbeliefs.com/book_of_the_law.htm |date=2007-10-13 }}''. (The Royal Press, St. James, 1856), pp. 312-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its preface, Strang clearly identifies the "Plates of Laban" as the source for most of his book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strangite.org/Law.htm.  See under Table of Contents.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strang's Book of the Law comprises a constitution for a Mormon monarchy, wherein the Prophet-leader of the Latter Day Saint church equally rules as king over God's kingdom on earth.  His 1856 expanded version also contains other revelations and teachings by Strang to enhance understanding of the work.  The ''Book of the Law'' was seen by Strang as making up only a portion of the Plates of Laban, rather than the whole, showing that it was a more complete bible that included books now lost. The Book of Mormon also claims this in reference to works by Zenos and Zenock, prophets who lived in Jerusalem, but are now unknown to history.

Seven witnesses testified to having seen and handled the plates Strang claimed to possess.  They described the plates as being eighteen in number, each measuring approximately seven and three-eighths inches wide, by nine inches long.  The plates themselves were "occasionally embellished with beautiful pictures," and all appeared to be of "beautiful antique workmanship, bearing a striking resemblance to the ancient oriental languages."&lt;ref&gt;"Testimony," from Book of the Law, pg. iv. http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/book_of_the_law_1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent history of Strang's "Plates of Laban," and their current whereabouts, is a mystery.

The Book of the Law of the Lord is not viewed as sacred scripture to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Brighamite) or [[Community of Christ]] (Josephite) churches, the two largest factions of the Latter Day Saint movement, although the Community of Christ (then RLDS) was formed primarily of Strang's followers under Joseph Smith III, and held the book as sacred until Strang was official decanonized due to persecution and the scandal surrounding polygamy.

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'', adapted from First and Second Nephi, Laban was portrayed by the actor Michael Flynn.

The film was rated PG-13 by American censors for "a scene of violence", having contained an image of Nephi with blood splattered on his face after beheading Laban. This image was removed for home media releases, and the film received a PG rating.

The film was widely panned by Mormon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700003321/Book-of-Mormon-Movie-Volume-1-The-Journey-The.html The Book of Mormon Movie], Deseret News&lt;/ref&gt; and non-Mormon critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2004-03-05/199711/ The Book of Mormon Movie, Volume 1: The Journey] in the Austin Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;. The Austin Chronicle wrote of "''Michael Flynn turning in a ripping good [[Edward G. Robinson]] impersonation as the villainous Laban''."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9879">{{Jewish Labour Bund}}

'''Mikhail Isaakovich Liber''' (5 June 1880 – 4 October 1937), sometimes known as '''Mark Liber''', was a leader of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Workers' Union]] (the 'Bund'). He also played a role in the [[Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party]] (RSDRP) and among the [[Mensheviks]]. Liber was instrumental in the soviets during the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 but opposed to [[October Revolution]]. He was reportedly shot during the Purges. Liber played a defining role in the development of the Bund and helped shaped the policies of the leaders of the February Revolution.

==Life and career==

Mikhail Isaakovich Goldman was born in the Lithuanian city of [[Vilnius]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], into a secular Jewish family. His father was a poet and office clerk. Like his older brothers, Boris and Lev (known as 'Gorev' and 'Akim' respectively), Mikhail became involved in radical student politics and was drawn to Marxism. He took an interest in the plight of Jewish workers in the Russian empire and joined the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (''Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland'', אַלגעמײַנער ײדישער אַרבעטער בונד אין ליטע פוילין און רוסלאַנד) in 1897. Goldman took the revolutionary pseudonym 'M. Liber', by which he became known. He soon rose to prominence in the Bund and was elected to its Central Committee in 1902.

The Bund competed, on the one hand, with non-Marxist Jewish socialist groups that were influenced by Russian [[Narodnik|populism]] and, on the other, with the emerging Jewish Zionist movement. The Bund rejected Jewish national separatism and eventually came out against the Zionist project of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. The Bund stressed that the struggle for Jewish emancipation in the Russian empire must be linked with the struggle of the Russian proletariat, and for that reason sought close relations with Russian Social-Democracy. Nevertheless, the Bund insisted on the cultural autonomy of the empire's Jews and, accordingly, the organisational autonomy of the Bund within a federal Russian Social-Democratic party. In internal debates within the Bund, younger Bundists like Liber placed greater emphasis on Jewish cultural identity than their more assimilationist elders (such as the Bund's founder, [[Arkadi Kremer]]), and on the need for propaganda in Yiddish aimed specifically at Jewish workers. In relation to the RSDRP, they argued for a looser, federal form of organisation, rather than a unitary centralised one.

Liber was one of the Bund's representatives at the fateful [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] of the RSDRP in 1903, and the third most frequent speaker at the congress (after [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]]). He defended the Bund's demand to be recognised as an autonomous organisation within the RSDRP and as the sole legitimate representative of the Jewish proletariat in the Russian empire. This position was roundly rejected by both Lenin and [[Julius Martov|I.O. Martov]], soon to emerge as the leaders of the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions of the RSDRP. Martov had himself been a member of the Bund in the 1890s and one of Liber's former collaborators, but at the second congress, he supported Lenin in demanding the integration of the Jewish proletariat in an All-Russian Social-Democratic party. Martov proposed a more liberal criterion of party membership than Lenin, but by the time that issue led to the schism between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Liber and his fellow Bundist delegates had withdrawn in protest from the congress and from the RSDRP. It was the Bundists' exit that gave Lenin a slight majority at the congress (and hence enabled him to call his faction 'Bolshevik' - 'Majoritarian'). 

As the division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks hardened, the Bund was increasingly drawn to the Menshevik side. The Mensheviks reversed their position on organisational federalism, making it possible for the Bund to rejoin the Menshevik wing of the RSDRP. In 1906, Liber represented the Bund at the [[4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|4th, Unification, Congress of the RSDLP]] in [[Stockholm]] when the Bund rejoined the party. At the [[5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|5th Congress]] in [[London]] in 1907 he was elected to the RSDLP [[Central Committee]]. During the abortive [[Revolution of 1905]], Liber played a role as a Bundist representative in the soviets, even though he, like most SDs (including Lenin), initially greeted the new, spontaneous workers' organisation with some scepticism. When the Revolution petered out in 1907 and the autocracy reasserted its authority, Liber was one of those who advocated a more cautious, legalistic course of action for the RSDRP. Known as 'Liquidators' because they wanted to 'liquidate' the illegal underground organisation of the party, this group was fiercely opposed by Lenin as well as by 'Party Mensheviks' like Martov and Trotsky (then a Menshevik). However, Social-Democratic 'Liquidators' like Liber had counterparts among the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionaries]], including Liber's contemporary [[Avram Gots|A.R. Gots]]. Liber's subsequent close alignment with Gots in 1917 may have had its roots in their common 'Liquidationism' of the 1910s. During this period, Liber married, which may also have encouraged his emphasis on legal work.

In 1914, Liber at first opposed the First World War and took a moderate '[[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|Internationalist]]' position. However, after the [[February Revolution of 1917]], Liber called for war 'in defence of the revolution' and took up a 'Revolutionary Defencist' position. As a representative of the Bund and the Mensheviks, Liber played amajor role in the soviets. He collaborated closely with Menshevik and SR 'Revolutionary Defencists' like [[Fyodor Dan|F.I. Dan]], [[Irakli Tsereteli|I.G. Tsereteli]], A.R. Gots, [[Vladimir Zenzinov|V.M. Zenzinov]] and [[Nikolai Avksentiev|N.D. Avksentiev]] - so closely that his name was often linked in Bolshevik propaganda with those of Dan and Gots, in a pun on the German phrase ''Dann lieber Gott!'' ('then, dear God!), as ''Danlibergots''. Liber was a staunch supporter of [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s Provisional Government, although he declined an offer to join the cabinet, preferring to concentrate on his work in the soviet. He represented the Bund in the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and was a member of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet. As such, Liber opposed not only the Bolsheviks but also Menshevik Internationalists like his old comrade Martov.

Liber opposed the [[October Revolution of 1917]] and rejected the position taken by the Mensheviks and many Bundists, which called for negotioation with the Bolsheviks for the purpose of forming an all-socialist coalition government. This proposal then had considerable support among Mensheviks, SRs and even some Bolsheviks (such as [[Lev Kamenev|L.B. Kamenev]]), to Lenin's great annoyance. Nothing came of it beyond a brief cooperation of the Left SRs with the Bolsheviks. Liber, for opposite reasons, agreed with Lenin that a unity government uniting the Bolsheviks with the moderate socialists they had just overthrown was politically impossible and would destroy the revolution. In taking this view, Liber parted ways with Dan, who had gone over to Martov's Menshevik Internationalists and eventually migrated to the far left of the Menshevik party. Owing to his anti-Bolshevism, Liber lost his leadership positions in the Menshevik party and in the Bund, but found himself in agreement with anti-Bolshevik SRs like Gots and Avksentiev.

Despite his fierce and public opposition to the Bolsheviks, Liber was not at first persecuted (perhaps because his brother-in-law was [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|F.E. Dzerzhinky]], first head of the [[Cheka]]). Liber spent most of the Civil War years in the Ukraine, returning to Moscow in 1920. He resumed work in the Menshevik party (which was abandoning hopes of co-operation with the Bolsheviks). In 1922 he protested against the death sentences passed against A.R. Gots and his co-defendants at the 'Trial of the Right SRs'. Shortly thereafter, Liber was himself arrested and sentenced to internal exile. It was the first of several arrests in the course of the next 15 years. His final arrest occurred in March 1937, at the height of the [[Purges]]. Reportedly he was shot in October of that year, together with Gots. However, Soviet sources deny this and claim that Gots lived until 1940, while Liber retired from politics, devoted himself to business and died of natural causes.

==Death==
{{main | Death of Mutula Kilonzo}}
Kilonzo died at his farm bordering Maanzoni lodge on Mombasa road [[Machakos County]] on 27 April 2013.

Investigations into Senator Mutula Kilonzo's death have ruled out a heart attack and have narrowed down to a likelihood of poisoning. Massive internal bleeding and a finding that all his internal organs were intact was a pointer to the presence of a toxin. An examination of the body had revealed that both the arteries and the heart had not been ruptured as is normally the case when one suffers a heart attack, the source said. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Mutula-Kilonzos-lungs-had-blood/-/1056/1843000/-/s9upvf/-/index.html|title=Experts seek poison clues in Mutula case|work=Daily Nation|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postmortem examination was conducted by seven doctors, led by the chief government pathologist, Dr Johansen Oduor and his colleague Dr Dorothy Njeru at the [[Lee Funeral Home]] in [[Nairobi]]. British pathologist [[Calder Ian Maddison]] flew to Kenya at the family's request and took part in the examination.

'''Fortunata "Natuzza" Evolo''' (23 August 1924 &amp;ndash; 1 November 2009) was an Italian [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] mystic and [[Servant of God]].  She is said to have evidenced [[stigmata]].&lt;ref name=zenit&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
A few months before Natuzza's birth at Paravati, near [[Mileto]] in [[Calabria]], her father emigrated to [[Argentina]] to look for work and the family never saw him again. Maria Angela Valente, Natuzza's mother, took on all sorts of work to feed her numerous family. As soon as she was able, Natuzza (a diminutive of Fortunata, a common name in Calabria) tried to help her mother and brothers; she was therefore unable to go to school, and indeed never learned to read or write.

In 1944 she married Pasquale Nicolace, a carpenter, and they had five children, but from quite an early age she was said to have had visions of [[Jesus Christ|Our Lord]] and [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]]. There is a 10-volume bibliography on Natuzza by Prof. Valerio Marinelli, with many interviews where she explains these facts. The bibliography also has interviews with others who claim to have been healed by her prayers or to have received other [[Divine grace|graces]].
Natuzza became known for the appearance on her body of blood-coloured images and words around the time of Easter, and these caused her great psychological and physical pain. Some of the words were found to be Hebrew and Aramaic, which was strange because she could not read or write, even in her native Italian. For decades, devout Catholics from Calabria, then the rest of Italy, began coming to her to ask for advice and prayers, and to ask her for information about the souls of their relatives.

On 13 May 1987 work began on building a shrine in Paravati dedicated to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]], [[Refuge of Sinners]], destined to be her home for the rest of her life and to provide accommodation for the elderly. This is still awaiting authorisation by the Archbishop of Mileto. Italian television crews came several times to interview her and in 1994 she published her autobiography. A documentary film about her was produced in 1987.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396760/
|publisher=IMDb
|title=Natuzza evolo (1987)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a special programme was broadcast about an enterpreneur from Calabria who had recovered from leukaemia, and he interviewed Natuzza.

Fortunata Evolo was admitted to hospital on 29 October 2009, but almost immediately she was released, and died of renal failure on the morning of Sunday 1 November at the Immaculate Heart old people's home. The Church bells were ordered by the Parish Priest, Natuzza's spiritual director, to peal out for the Feast of All Saints. Thousands of Catholics came from all over Europe to pay their respects, and the cause for her [[beatification]] is expected to be started very soon.

==Skepticism==

Psychotherapist and skeptic Armando De Vincentiis has published an article claiming that Evolo may have suffered from [[painful bruising syndrome]]:

{{quote|It appears quite simple for the reader to understand how the entire phenomenology of Natuzza Evolo can be compatible with the hypothesis of Gardner-Diamond syndrome or psychogenic purpura. Signs of Natuzza were not limited only to the stigmata of the hands or feet sacred iconography, but were also occurring in different parts of the body.  At the same time, as an adult, the conviction to communicate with the dead, the sudden ecstatic journeys described, beyond the mystical-religious interpretations outside of any scientific evidence, does not leave much doubt about the psychological implications of the phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Armando De Vincentiis. (2011). [https://www.cicap.org/new/articolo.php?id=274400 "New insights into the phenomenon of Natuzza Evolo"]. [[CICAP|Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims on the Paranormal]].

==Arrest==
{{Main|Akbot}}
Walker was arrested under sections 248-252 of New Zealand's Crime Act after international investigations by the [[FBI]] found him to be involved in an attack on the computer network of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=199&amp;objectid=10481058&amp;pnum=0 |title=Bot-boy caught in his own net |publisher=New Zealand Herald | date=8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was orchestrated via a [[botnet]] established by Walker, using servers he exploited and rented, the majority of which were located in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="cw-ateam"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/scrt/693DE1B864708EABCC25741E0068E114 | title=Owen 'Akill' Walker was part of botnet 'A-team' | publisher=[[Computerworld]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412084041/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/scrt/693DE1B864708EABCC25741E0068E114 | archivedate=12 April 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
He pleaded guilty to his connection in the crime, was fined for the cost of the damage to the University of Pennsylvania computer and was discharged without conviction, the presiding judge concluded that a conviction would only harm his future.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10521614"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10521614 |title=Conviction would harm hacker's future - judge |author=Shenagh Gleeson and Newstalk ZB |date=15 July 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
In 2008 he was hired by [[TelstraClear]], the New Zealand subsidiary of Australian telecommunications company Telstra, to work with their security division [[DMZGlobal]]. As a security consultant, he presented seminars and appeared in advertising. TelstraClear spokesman Chris Mirams said it was not the equivalent of hiring a bank robber to advise on bank security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watoday.com.au/national/telstra-offshoot-hires-teen-hacker-akill-20090324-97yn.html?page=-1 Telstra Offshoot Hires Teen Hacker Akill], WAToday [Westarn Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul John Gascoigne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|s|k|ɔɪ|n}}, born 27 May 1967) is an English former professional [[association football|football]] player and manager. He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career and has been described by the [[National Football Museum]] as "the most naturally gifted English midfielder of his generation".&lt;ref name="nfm" /&gt;

Born and raised in [[Gateshead]], the [[midfielder]] signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a £2.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for £5.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for £4.3 million, and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a £3.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998–99 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].

He was part of the England squad that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]], which meant he would have been suspended for the final itself had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] which was described as one of the best of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/15/1 |title=Football: Rob Smyth: On second thoughts: England 4-1 Holland, Euro 96 |first=Rob |last=Smyth |date=15 February 2008 |publisher= |accessdate=21 October 2017 |via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been involved in a number of high profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the [[Goal celebration#Memorable celebrations|"dentist's chair" celebration]] from Euro ‘96, and mimicking playing a flute with Rangers in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, and he has not worked in football since being dismissed as the manager of [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 2005.

==Early life==
Gascoigne was born in [[Gateshead]], County Durham on 27 May 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|7083|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newcastle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424061003/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archivedate=24 April 2008 |title=Heroes: Paul Gascoigne |publisher=Newcastle United F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John (1946–2018), was a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]], and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Breckenbeds Junior High School]], then the [[Heathfield Senior High School]], both in the [[Low Fell]] area of Gateshead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was noticed by football scouts while playing for Gateshead Boys, though failed to impress in a trial at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further trials at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] also proved unsuccessful, before the team he supported, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], signed him as a schoolboy in 1980.&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2004 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was usually overweight whilst signed to Newcastle and frequently got into trouble with his friend Jimmy "Five Bellies" Gardner, particularly when the pair were taken to court and fined over a [[hit and run]] incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcastle chairman [[Stan Seymour, Jr.|Stan Seymour]] described Gascoigne as "[[George Best]] without brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Gascoigne was successful on the football field, his childhood was marked by instability and tragedy. Initially his family lived in a single upstairs room in a council house with a shared bathroom, and moved several times during Gascoigne's early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ten, Gascoigne witnessed the death of Steven Spraggon, the younger brother of a friend, who was killed in a [[traffic collision]].&lt;ref name="page 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, his father began to suffer from [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]].&lt;ref name="page 17"/&gt; Gascoigne began developing obsessions and [[Tic|twitches]], and was taken into therapy at age ten, but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the treatment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne developed an addiction to [[Slot machine|gaming machines]], frequently spending all his money on them, and also began shoplifting to fund his addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2292333/The-life-and-times-of-Paul-Gascoigne.html |location=London, UK |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Rob |last=Stewart |title=The life and times of Paul Gascoigne |date=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He experienced further tragedy when a friend, whom he had encouraged to join Newcastle United from Middlesbrough, died whilst he was working for Gascoigne's uncle on a building site.&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2004 31"/&gt;

At the age of 15, he took the decision to provide for his family – his parents and two sisters – financially, as he saw professional football as a way of earning more money than the rest of the family were capable of.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed football, and later wrote that "I didn't have twitches or worry about death when I was playing football".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was signed on as an apprentice at Newcastle on his sixteenth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Newcastle United===
Gascoigne captained Newcastle United's youth team to the [[FA Youth Cup]] in the [[1984–85 Newcastle United F.C. season|1984–85]] season, and scored twice in the 4–1 victory over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the final at [[Vicarage Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Jack Charlton]] handed Gascoigne his first team debut as a substitute for [[George Reilly]] in a 1–0 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 13 April 1985 at [[St James' Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18 Gascoigne signed a two-year £120 a week contract at Newcastle, with the club also having a further two-year option clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willie McFaul]] took over as manager for the [[1985–86 Newcastle United F.C. season|1985–86]] season, and named Gascoigne in his first eleven from the opening game of the campaign; he took the place of [[Chris Waddle]], who had been sold to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal at home to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in a 3–0 victory on 21 September 1985, and claimed a further eight goals in the 1985–86 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcastle finished 11th in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] that season and, at the end of it, Gascoigne was featured on the front cover of the ''[[Sky Sports Football Yearbook|Rothmans Football Yearbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newcastleunited-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=115&amp;teamno=386 |title=Results – Newcastle United FC |date=21 July 2011 |publisher=Newcastle United Mad |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004183900/http://www.newcastleunited-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=115&amp;teamno=386 |archive-date=4 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored five goals in 24 league games in the [[1986–87 Newcastle United F.C. season|1986–87]] season,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the "Magpies" slipped to 17th place, just three points above the relegation play-offs.&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1986-87.html |title=England 1986–87 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=24 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127102628/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1986-87.html |archivedate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 0–0 draw with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] at [[Plough Lane]] hard-man [[Vinnie Jones]] singled him out for attention, and in an incident that would become a much-publicised photograph, Jones grabbed him by the genitals as Gascoigne screamed in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne subsequently sent Jones a red rose, and the two became good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Edge |first1=Simon |title=Vinnie Jones: From 'violent thug' to changed man |url=http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/429320/Vinnie-Jones-From-violent-thug-to-changed-man |accessdate=25 January 2016 |work=Daily Express |date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named as the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] and listed on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in the [[1987–88 Newcastle United F.C. season|1987–88]] season, and was the subject of offers from both [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. His first choice was [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] but with no offer forthcoming, Gascoigne promised [[Alex Ferguson]] that he would sign for Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson duly went on holiday to [[Malta]], where he received the news that Gascoigne had signed for Spurs, for a record British fee of £2.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson claimed that Gascoigne was wooed into signing for Tottenham after they bought a house for his impoverished family.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Alex (1999) ''Managing My Life''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, pp&amp;nbsp;264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
In [[1988–89 Football League|his first season]] at [[White Hart Lane]] Gascoigne helped [[Terry Venables]]'s Spurs to sixth in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], scoring seven goals in 37 appearances.&lt;ref name="page 131"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rose to third place in [[1989–90 Football League|1989–90]], but were still 16 points behind champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="page 131"/&gt; He was named as [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1990, and on accepting the award said that "I haven't won anything in the game as yet. But the World Cup did help to put England on the map".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named as [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tottenham Hotspur FC Player of the Year Awards 1987 to 2013-14 |url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/SpursPlayeroftheYear.html |website=myfootballfacts.com |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne was named on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in the [[1990–91 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1990–91]] season as Tottenham reached the [[1991 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], with victories over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[North London derby]] rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He scored the opening goal of the 3–1 victory over Arsenal at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] with a free-kick, one of six goals he scored in the competition. Going into the final against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] he had already agreed terms to join Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in an £8.5&amp;nbsp;million deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; However just 15 minutes into the game he committed a dangerous knee-high foul on [[Gary Charles]] and ruptured his own [[cruciate ligament]]s in his right knee. England teammate [[Stuart Pearce]] scored from the resultant free kick, and Gascoigne subsequently collapsed after the kick-off, forcing him to leave the match on a stretcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tottenham went on to win the Cup in extra-time.

He missed the entire [[1991–92 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1991–92]] season while he recovered, suffering a further knee injury in late 1991, when an incident at a nightclub on [[Tyneside]] kept him out for even longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/21/newsstory.sport2 |title=Paul Gascoigne: a troubled life |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=21 July 2009 |author=Staff and agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news of that time – namely the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8149630.stm |title=Election countdown – 1990s style |date=21 July 2009 |last=Wheeler |first=Brian |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lazio===
Gascoigne eventually joined Lazio for a fee of £5.5&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|5.5|1992|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|UK}}); he received a £2&amp;nbsp;million signing-on fee and signed a contract worth £22,000 a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Serie A]] debut on 27 September 1992 in a match against [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] which was televised in Britain as well as Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to fully settle in Italy and was beset by negative media interest which was not helped by the numerous occasions he punched reporters and the time when he [[Burping|belched]] down a microphone on live television.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well received by the club's fans, but not by the club's owner [[Sergio Cragnotti]], who resented him after Gascoigne greeted him by saying "''Tua figlia, grande tette''" (roughly translated as "Your daughter, big tits").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form was inconsistent in his [[1992–93 Serie A|first season]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] as he had previously spent a year out injured, but he endeared himself to [[S.S. Lazio fans|Eagles fans]] when he scored in the 89th minute to equalise during the [[Derby della Capitale|Rome derby]] against [[A.S. Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; He broke his cheekbone whilst on international duty in April 1993, and had to play the remaining games of the season in a mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazio ended the campaign in fifth place, which was considered a success as it meant qualification for European competition for the first time in 16 years.&lt;ref name="page 174"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He fell badly out of shape before the [[1993–94 Serie A|1993–94]] season and was told by manager [[Dino Zoff]] to lose two stone (13&amp;nbsp;kg) by the start of the campaign else he would lose his first team place.&lt;ref name="page 174"/&gt; Gascoigne went on an extreme weight loss diet and succeeded in shedding the excess fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his place in the team and captained the club against [[US Cremonese]] when regular captain [[Roberto Cravero]] was substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April he broke his leg in training whilst attempting to tackle [[Alessandro Nesta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his recovery he was disgruntled with new head coach [[Zdeněk Zeman]]'s stern fitness approach, and both club and player decided to part ways at the end of the [[1994–95 S.S. Lazio season|1994–95]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rangers===
Gascoigne signed for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in July 1995, for a [[List of Rangers F.C. records and statistics|club record]] fee of £4.3&amp;nbsp;million, on wages of £15,000 a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an immediate impact; in the fifth league game of the season in the [[Old Firm]] match at [[Celtic Park]] he scored a goal after running almost the full length of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December, in a match against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], Gascoigne was booked by referee Dougie Smith after he picked Smith's yellow card up from the ground and jokingly 'booked' the referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers went on to win the league in the [[1995–96 Rangers F.C. season|1995–96]] season, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] at [[Ibrox Stadium]]; Gascoigne scored a hat-trick during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers won the double as they also won the [[Scottish Cup]] by knocking out [[Keith F.C.|Keith]], [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] and Celtic, before beating [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] 5–1 in [[1996 Scottish Cup Final|the final]] at [[Hampden Park]]. He scored 19 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions, and was named as both [[PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year]] and [[SFWA Footballer of the Year]].&lt;ref name="Paul John Gascoigne"&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul John Gascoigne |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersG/BioGascoignePJ.html |website=englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scotland - Player of the Year |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/scotpoy.html |website=rsssf.com |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rangers won the league title again in [[1996–97 Rangers F.C. season|1996–97]], their ninth in succession. Gascoigne claimed hat-tricks against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], and ended the campaign with 17 goals in 34 games. However manager [[Walter Smith]] and assistant [[Archie Knox]] became increasingly concerned over Gascoigne's reliance on alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Gers" won another double by winning the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]], knocking out [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]], [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]], [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] en route to [[1996 Scottish League Cup Final|the final]]. Rangers beat Hearts 4–3 in the final at [[Celtic Park]], with Gascoigne scoring two goals and [[Ally McCoist]] claiming the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1997, Gascoigne received a five-match ban after being sent off for violent conduct during the Old Firm derby following an incident with Celtic midfielder [[Morten Wieghorst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/33102.stm |title=Five-match ban for Gascoigne |date=20 November 1997 |accessdate=8 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1998, Gascoigne courted serious controversy during a [[goal celebration]] where he mimed playing a flute (symbolic of the flute-playing of [[Orange Order]] marchers) during an Old Firm match at Celtic Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/44396.stm |title=SFA probes piper Gascoigne |date=3 January 1998 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/44813.stm |title=Gazza faces flute fine |date=5 January 1998 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture infuriated Celtic fans who had been taunting him and Gascoigne was fined £20,000 by Rangers after the incident.&lt;ref name="page 234"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received a [[death threat]] from an [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) member following the incident.&lt;ref name="page 234"/&gt; The [[1997–98 Rangers F.C. season|1997–98]] season was not a success, as Gascoigne scored just three goals in 28 games and Rangers failed to win any trophies, losing the league title to Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scottish Premier Division 1997-1998 : Table |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/scotland/premier-division/1997-1998 |website=statto.com |accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085112/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/scotland/premier-division/1997-1998|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middlesbrough===
Gascoigne left Scotland to join [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for £3.45&amp;nbsp;million in March 1998, where former England teammate [[Bryan Robson]] was manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nixon |first=Alan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/football-middlesbrough-win-the-race-to-sign-troubled-gascoigne-1151165.html |title=Middlesbrough win the race to sign troubled Gascoigne |date=19 March 1998 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first match was the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]] defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], where he came on as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played seven games in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], helping "Boro" into the [[Premier League]] as runners-up to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at the end of the [[1997–98 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1997–98]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=English Premier League 1997-1998 : Table |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/1997-1998/table |website=statto.com |accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006100710/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/1997-1998/table|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[1998–99 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1998–99]] campaign began, Gascoigne began suffering from [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blackouts]] after blaming himself for the death of a friend, who died after Gascoigne and a group of friends went on a night out drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his ongoing personal problems and his spell in rehab, Gascoigne started the season in good form and helped Middlesbrough into fourth place by Christmas.&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2004 277"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ended the season in ninth place and having scored three goals in 26 top-flight games Gascoigne was linked with a recall to the England squad, who were now managed by former teammate [[Kevin Keegan]] and lacking a creative presence in midfield.&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2004 277"/&gt;

His career went into terminal decline during the [[1999–2000 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1999–2000]] campaign, with Gascoigne breaking his arm after elbowing opposition midfield player [[George Boateng]] in the head during Middlesbrough's 4–0 defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at the [[Riverside Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gascoigne charged after Boateng clash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/feb/16/newsstory.sport1 |work=The Guardian |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |location=London |date=16 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently received a three match ban and £5,000 fine from [[the Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Russell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/mar/03/newsstory.sport3 |title=Gascoigne recovery hit by ban for three games |date=3 March 2000 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
Gascoigne signed a two-year contract with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], managed by former Rangers boss [[Walter Smith]], after joining on a free transfer in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Ian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jul/17/newsstory.sport4 |title=Gascoigne offered two-year lifeline by Everton |date=17 July 2000 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/837023.stm |title=Gazza signs for Everton |date=17 July 2000 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the [[2000–01 Everton F.C. season|2000–01]] season well despite not playing every game due to his lack of fitness, but a series of niggling injuries and his ongoing depression took him out of the first team picture by Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending time at an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in [[Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bright |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/3006721/Gascoigne-in-clinic.html |title=Gascoigne in clinic |date=4 June 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne was fit enough to play for the "Toffees" in the [[2001–02 Everton F.C. season|2001–02]] season, and he scored his first goal for the club – and last in English football – away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 3 November.&lt;ref name="page 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he then suffered a hernia injury, which kept him out of action for three months.&lt;ref name="page 296"/&gt; Walter Smith left [[Goodison Park]] in March, and Gascoigne left the club shortly after his successor, [[David Moyes]], took charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Gascoigne finished the [[2001–02 Burnley F.C. season|2001–02]] season with [[Stan Ternent]]'s [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/1875304.stm |title=Gascoigne joins Burnley |date=16 March 2002 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made six First Division appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club narrowly missed out on the play-offs, and he left [[Turf Moor]] after only two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he was inducted to the [[National Football Museum]], being described as "the most naturally gifted English midfielder of his generation".&lt;ref name="nfm"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/paul-gascoigne |title=Paul Gascoigne |publisher=[[National Football Museum]] |access-date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow England midfielder [[Paul Ince]] said that Gascoigne was "the best player I've ever played with ... he had everything. He was amazing."&lt;ref name="nfm" /&gt;

In summer 2002, Gascoigne went on trial with American club [[D.C. United]], but rejected a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then [[English Football League Championship|First Division]] [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] also made enquiries and Gascoigne had an unsuccessful trial with the club.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/gillingham-on-the-gazza-trail-135232.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, he signed a nine-month contract with [[China League One]] club [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] in both a playing and coaching role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/256052/gascoigne-nets-contract-in-china |title=Gascoigne nets contract in China |date=27 January 2003 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=William |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395122/Gleeful-Gascoigne-nets-job-in-China.html |title=Gleeful Gascoigne nets job in China |date=28 January 2003 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne scored in his first match in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/262437 |title=Gazza scores in winning China debut |date=29 March 2003 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_football/2898091.stm |title=Gazza scores on China debut |date=29 March 2003 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in total scored two goals in four league games but his mental state meant that he had to return to America for treatment against drink and depression in April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/270229/chinese-club-hand-gazza-ultimatum |title=Chinese club hand Gazza ultimatum |date=21 June 2003 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he never returned despite the club ordering him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Gascoigne was signed as player-coach by [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_of_wales/3865987.stm |title=Gascoigne joins Boston |date=30 July 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon signing spoke of his coaching aspirations, saying that "I can become a great coach and a great manager".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11778/2306053/gazza-i-can-be-a-great-coach |title=Gazza: I can be a great coach |date=30 July 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne left Boston after he made five appearances in a three-month spell, citing professional reasons including his coaching career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/3718344.stm |title=Gascoigne quits Boston |date=5 October 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Plummer |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/06/newsstory.sport4 |title=Gascoigne departs Boston and hangs up his boots |date=6 October 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Gascoigne was called up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] side in summer 1987, and scored with a free-kick in his debut in a 2–0 win over [[Morocco national under-20 football team|Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win 12 caps for the under-21s under [[Dave Sexton]].&lt;ref name="fap"&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/all-teams/players/g/paul-gascoigne |website=thefa.com |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne was first called up to the full [[England national football team|England squad]] by [[Bobby Robson]] for a friendly against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on 14 September 1988, and came on as a late substitute for [[Peter Beardsley]] in a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for England in a 5–0 victory over [[Albania national football team|Albania]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] on 26 April 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start in the following game against [[Chile national football team|Chile]], and kept his first team place for most matches in the run in to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played four games for the [[England national football B team|England B]] team. He secured his place in the World Cup squad in a 4–2 win against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] when he scored one goal and was a key component in the other three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played in all three of the group games in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and England topped [[1990 FIFA World Cup Group F|Group F]], Gascoigne providing the assist for [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]]'s winner against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first knockout game against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] he made another assist after chipping a free-kick into the penalty area, where [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] volleyed the ball into the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] when he gave away a penalty, which Cameroon converted. In extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which [[Gary Lineker]] won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 1990, England played [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in a World Cup semi-final match at [[Juventus]]'s [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. Gascoigne, having already received a yellow card during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium in the second round, was booked for a foul on [[Thomas Berthold]],&lt;ref name="newcastle" /&gt; which meant that he would be suspended for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] if England won the match.

Robson quit the England job after the tournament, and his successor [[Graham Taylor]] dropped Gascoigne in favour of 32-year-old [[Gordon Cowans]] in a [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 7|Euro '92 qualifier]] against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] in November 1990, citing tactical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the starting eleven for a friendly against Cameroon the following February, before injury in the FA Cup final three months later caused him to miss the next 21 England fixtures, including all of [[UEFA Euro 1992]], where England failed to progress beyond the group stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne returned to fitness in time for the opening [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] game against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in October 1992, and before playing in the 1–1 draw he responded to a Norwegian television crew's request to say 'a few words to Norway' by saying "fuck off Norway".&lt;ref name="page 185"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; His message was broadcast on Norwegian television and he was forced to apologize for the remark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovejoy |first=Joe |title=Gascoigne's Norwegian blue note |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-gascoignes-norwegian-blue-note-1556964.html |accessdate=24 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=12 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Gascoigne: a troubled life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/21/newsstory.sport2 |accessdate=5 October 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he scored two goals in a 4–0 victory over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].&lt;ref name="page 185"/&gt; Qualification ended badly for England, as they ended in third place behind Norway and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and missed out on a place in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Cup 1994 qualifications |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/94qual.html#gr2 |website=rsssf.com |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broken leg in 1994 meant Gascoigne was unable to play for 15 months, but by the time he returned to fitness, [[Terry Venables]] – his former manager at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] – had been appointed as England manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; As England were hosting [[UEFA Euro 1996]] they did not have to go through the qualification process, so they instead played numerous friendlies, most of which featured Gascoigne in the starting line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these games was played in [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]], after which numerous England players were photographed on a night out in which Gascoigne and several others having drinks poured into their mouths whilst sitting in the "dentist's chair".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament opened with a 1–1 draw with [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], during which Gascoigne was substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a memorable goal in the second game of the tournament, against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], when he received the ball from [[Darren Anderton]] outside the Scotland penalty area, flicked the ball over [[Colin Hendry]] with his left foot and changed direction; Hendry was completely wrong-footed and, as the ball dropped, Gascoigne volleyed it with his right foot past [[Andy Goram]].&lt;ref name="page 214"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was followed by the [[Goal celebration#Memorable celebrations|"dentist's chair" celebration]] referring to the incident before the tournament, where Gascoigne lay on the ground as if he were sitting in the dentist's chair, and teammates sprayed [[lucozade]] from bottles into his open mouth.&lt;ref name="page 214"/&gt; England beat the Netherlands 4–1 to make it through to the knock-out stages. They then drew 0–0 with [[Spain national football team|Spain]] before winning 4–2 on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]], the last of which was converted by Gascoigne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; England drew 1–1 with Germany in the semi-finals, and Gascoigne missed the chance to win the game in extra-time when he came inches away from connecting to an [[Alan Shearer]] cross yards in front of an unguarded German net.&lt;ref name="page 216"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; England lost to Germany in the resulting penalty shoot-out, with [[Gareth Southgate]] missing England's sudden death penalty.&lt;ref name="page 216"/&gt;

Under [[Glenn Hoddle]], Gascoigne was picked regularly and helped England win the [[Tournoi de France]] in 1997 ahead of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[France national football team|France]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|Qualification]] for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] went down to the last group game against Italy at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], and Gascoigne put in a disciplined and mature performance to help England secure the 0–0 draw that was enough to take them through to the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, British tabloid newspapers showed pictures of Gascoigne eating kebabs late at night with DJ friend [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] only a week before the final squad was due to be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=101055 |title=Turbulent life of football genius Paul Gascoigne |work=Metro |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoddle elected not to pick Gascoigne in the final squad and after hearing the news Gascoigne wrecked Hoddle's room in a rage before being restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne was never to play for his country again, having won 57 caps and scored 10 goals.&lt;ref name="fap"/&gt;

==Managerial and coaching career==
Having already gained some coaching experience in China, Gascoigne signed for [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] on 30 July 2004. After being at the club for 11 games he left (partly as a result of the club refusing to let him participate in the reality television show ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=61630 |title=Gazza gets his dancing shoes on |work=Metro |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 October, to begin a football coaching course. After leaving Boston, he stated that he was interested in taking over as manager of Scottish side [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-321576/Gascoigne-interested-Morton-job.html |title=Gascoigne interested in Morton job |work=Daily Mail |date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gazza-has-green-eyes-4636334 |title=Gazza has Green eyes |newspaper=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this came to nothing.

In mid-2005 he spent two months as player-coach at the recently founded Portuguese team Algarve United, but he returned to England after a proposed contract never materialised.&lt;ref name="page 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed manager of [[Conference North]] club [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] on 27 October 2005, and also planned to put in enough money to own one-third of the club to show his commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous manager [[Kevin Wilson (footballer born 1961)|Kevin Wilson]] was appointed as [[director of football]], and [[Paul Davis (footballer born 1961)|Paul Davis]] was appointed as the club's assistant manager.&lt;ref name="page 37"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookmakers put odds on Gascoigne being dismissed before Christmas, though he insisted that he was at the club "for the long haul".&lt;ref name="page 37"/&gt; Attempts to get new sponsors on board were successful, though results on the pitch soon went against Kettering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure lasted just 39 days, and he was dismissed by the club's board on 5 December. The club's owner, [[Imraan Ladak]], blamed Gascoigne's alcohol problems, stating that he drank almost every day he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/4500388.stm |title=Kettering sack manager Gascoigne |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=21 July 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne later claimed that the owner had interfered incessantly and harboured ambitions of being a manager himself, despite knowing little about football.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was never on a contract at the club, and was never paid for his six weeks work, nor was he given the chance to invest money in the club as he had first planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne came close to being appointed manager of [[Garforth Town A.F.C.|Garforth Town]] in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/06/paul-gascoigne-garforth-town-warrington |title=Paul Gascoigne absent as Garforth Town face Warrington |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2010 |agency=Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after weeks of talks between his agent and the club he decided to turn down the offer, though reiterated his desire to return to football management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/football/Gascogine-39not-done-a-Uturn39.6571167.jp |title=Gascogine 'not done a U-turn' over Garforth |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 2016 Gascoigne was hospitalised with head injuries including broken teeth after being kicked in the back down stairs in a London hotel, where he allegedly made racist remarks according to a witness. In July 2017 his assailant was jailed for 23 weeks and ordered to pay £7,800 compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/paul-gascoigne-former-footballer-hospital-east-london |title=Paul Gascoigne 'taken to hospital after drunken brawl' |work=The Guardian |agency=Press Association |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4720216/Thug-kicked-Gascoigne-flight-stairs-jailed.html |title=Thug who kicked Paul Gascoigne down flight of hotel stairs jailed |publisher= |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne was hailed as a hero after, on 17 April 2017, he reportedly confronted and repelled would-be burglars of a neighbour's home near his own in Poole. He was treated in hospital for injuries sustained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/football-legend-paul-gascoigne-punched-10272487 |title=Paul Gascoigne 'punched as he tried to tackle burglars at neighbour's flat' |first=KEITH |last=PERRY |date=21 April 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne has three autobiographies: ''Gazza: My Story'' (with [[Hunter Davies]]) published in 2004, ''Being Gazza: Tackling My Demons'' (with Hunter Davies and John McKeown), published in 2006, and ''Glorious: My World, Football and Me'', published in 2011.

===Mental illness, alcoholism and assault===

Gascoigne first entered therapy sessions in October 1998 when he was admitted into [[Priory Hospital]] after a drinking session where he drank 32 shots of [[whisky]] which left him at "rock bottom"; then-manager [[Bryan Robson]] signed him into the clinic whilst Gascoigne was unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released, at his own insistence, two weeks into the suggested minimum stay of 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent visits to the Priory became more infrequent, and he eventually returned to drinking alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001 Gascoigne's then-chairman [[Bill Kenwright]] contacted Gascoigne's therapist at the Priory, John McKeown, who organised more treatment to help Gascoigne to control his drinking.&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2006 27"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the treatment he was sent to the United States where he had a stay at a clinic in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]]. He was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2006 27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed at the clinic in 2003 after he suffered low points working in China, and again in 2004 after retiring from football.&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2006 28"&gt;{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2006|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 he was [[Involuntary commitment|sectioned]] under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act]] after an incident at the Malmaison Hotel in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. He was taken into protective custody to prevent [[self-harm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7256761.stm |title=Gazza held after hotel incident |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sectioned again in June, and in September he was hospitalised after he overdosed on alcohol and drugs in an apparent suicide attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wynne-Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=Paul Gascoigne rushed to hospital after 'overdose' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2908576/Paul-Gascoigne-rushed-to-hospital-after-overdose.html |accessdate=26 October 2014 |work=The Telegraph |date=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascoigne was arrested for a disturbance outside a takeaway in February 2010. The following month he was charged with drunk driving, driving without a licence, and driving without insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Gascoigne charged with drink-driving |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/8592771.stm |accessdate=26 October 2014 |work=BBC News |date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2010 Gascoigne appeared at the scene of the tense stand-off between the police and the fugitive [[2010 Northumbria Police manhunt|Raoul Moat]], claiming to be a friend of Moat and stating that he had brought him "a can of lager, some chicken, a fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown." He was denied access to Moat.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Nick.

In October 2010, Gascoigne was arrested for drunk driving. He subsequently admitted being more than four times over the limit at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-11584520 |title=Jail warning for Gazza for drink driving |date=20 October 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day after being warned he could face a prison sentence for drunk driving, Gascoigne was arrested for possession of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Laura |title=Paul Gascoigne arrested one day after being warned he faces prison |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8079795/Paul-Gascoigne-arrested-one-day-after-being-warned-he-faces-prison.html |accessdate=26 October 2014 |work=The Telegraph |date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He should have appeared in court on 11 November to be sentenced for the drink driving offence, but instead he went into [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] on the south coast of England.&lt;ref name="chroniclelive.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2010/11/12/paul-gascoigne-admitted-into-rehab-72703-27647038/ |title=Paul Gascoigne admitted into rehab |publisher=Chronicle Live |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given an eight-week suspended sentence on 9 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-11954284 |title=Paul Gascoigne given suspended drink-driving sentence |publisher=BBC News |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 his agent, Terry Baker, told [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] that Gascoigne had relapsed again: "He won't thank me for saying it but he immediately needs to get help&amp;nbsp;... His life is always in danger because he is an alcoholic. Maybe no one can save him – I don't know. I really don't know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Gascoigne needs immediate help, says his agent |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311843 |accessdate=3 February 2013 |publisher=BBC News |date=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gascoigne was placed in intensive care in a US hospital while being treated for alcoholism in Arizona in a [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programme thanks to financial support provided by ex-cricketer [[Ronnie Irani]] and broadcaster Chris Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21401141 |title=Paul Gascoigne recovering after spell in intensive care |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 February 2013 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested for assaulting a railway security guard and being drunk and disorderly at [[Stevenage railway station]] on 4 July 2013; he was fined £1,000 after admitting the offence, and ordered to pay £100 compensation to the guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Gascoigne fined for Stevenage railway station assault |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23574371 |accessdate=26 October 2014 |work=BBC News |date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Gascoigne entered rehab for his alcohol addiction for a seventh time at a £6,000-a-month clinic in [[Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Selby |first=Jenn |title=Paul Gascoigne back in rehab for alcohol addiction |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/paul-gascoigne-back-in-rehab-for-alcohol-addiction-9087442.html |accessdate=23 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August he was again admitted to hospital in relation to his problems following an incident outside his home.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gardner |first=Bill |title=Paul Gascoigne 'in hospital' after being found drunk outside his home |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11050108/Paul-Gascoigne-in-hospital-after-being-found-drunk-outside-his-home.html |accessdate=22 August 2014 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2014, police were called to his home in [[Poole]] after he was in a drink binge; he was [[Involuntary commitment|sectioned]] under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act]] the next day and taken to a hospital for a three-day [[Alcohol detoxification|detox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gazza 'sectioned under Mental Health Act' |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/gazza-sectioned-under-mental-health-act-647629.html |accessdate=26 October 2014 |work=Irish Examiner |date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2017, a spokesman for Gascoigne confirmed that he had entered a rehabilitation centre in a serious effort to stay “alcohol-free” in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/paul-gascoigne-in-rehab-to-stay-alcohol-free-for-2017-after-suffering-fractured-skull-10719488 |title=Paul Gascoigne in rehab to stay alcohol free for 2017 after suffering fractured skull |publisher=Sky News |date=6 January 2017 |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Gascoigne was arrested at Durham station by British Transport Police for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman on board a train.&lt;ref name=sexcharge&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-46261574 |title=Paul Gascoigne charged with sex assault on Durham train |publisher=BBC News |date=19 November 2018 |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018 he was charged with sexual assault and was due to appear in court on the charge in December 2018.&lt;ref name=sexcharge/&gt;

[[File:Duke2costumePA.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Anderson design for ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', 1917]]
'''Percy Anderson''' (1851 – 30 October 1928) was an English stage designer and painter, best known for his work for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company at [[His Majesty’s Theatre]] and [[Edwardian musical comedies]].

==Life and career==
Anderson's first significant production was the comic opera ''Lady of the Locket'', composed by [[William Fullerton Jr.]] with a libretto by [[Henry Hamilton (playwright)|Henry Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin, pp. 25–27 and 34–39&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), Anderson designed the costumes for all the original productions of the [[Savoy Operas]]. He continued to design costumes for D'Oyly Carte revivals in the early twentieth century, including for ''[[Trial by Jury]], [[H.M.S. Pinafore]], [[The Pirates of Penzance]], [[Patience (opera)|Patience]], [[Iolanthe]], [[Princess Ida]], [[Ruddigore]], The Yeomen of the Guard,'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]].'' For [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], Anderson designed ''[[Twelfth Night]], [[The Merry Wives of Windsor]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]], [[The Life and Death of King John|King John]], [[A Midsummer Night’s Dream]], [[The Tempest]]'', and two plays by [[Stephen Phillips]], ''Herod'' and ''Ulysses''.&lt;ref name=Times31&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 31 October 1928, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the costumes for [[Henry James]]’s ill-fated theatrical effort, ''[[Guy Domville]]''; ''The Times'' was not impressed by either the play or the costumes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 January 1895, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Anderson's other successes were ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells']]'' (1898), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902), ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' (1904), the hit British premiere of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' in 1907, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909), ''[[Kismet (play)|Kismet]]'' (1911) and ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' (1916).  He designed the costumes for various productions of [[Edwardian musical comedies]] for [[George Edwardes]], such as the hit musical ''[[San Toy]]'' in 1899 and ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]'' in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lily-elsie.com/shows.htm Lily Elsie], Lily-Elsie.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Opera House]] commissioned Anderson to design costumes in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturenet.hr/v1/english/attachments/760.pdf |title=Biography of Milka Ternina describing Anderson costumes designed for her |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203025537/http://www.culturenet.hr/v1/english/attachments/760.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's designs were also used in a number of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?ID=25206 Percy Anderson at the IBDB database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson had private means, and for a time roomed with [[Morton Fullerton]]. He was part of a circle of rich, artistic homosexual men, who included [[Lord Ronald Gower]], the courtier Alec Yorke and [[Charles Hamilton Aide|Hamilton Aïdé]].&lt;ref&gt;Mainwaring, pp. 43 and 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s, Anderson was closely associated with the young novelist [[Hugh Walpole]]&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Times'', in its obituary notice, said of Anderson that he escaped from the pedantry of his predecessors and paved the way in a most interesting manner for [[Bakst]], [[Claud Lovat Fraser]] and [[Edward Gordon Craig|Gordon Craig]].&lt;ref name=Times31/&gt; As a painter, Anderson achieved a modest success, and his portraits hang in the collections of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], the [[Louvre]], and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploreart.co.uk/author_display.asp?SF1=sort_name&amp;ST1=ANDERSONPERCY Portrait of Winifred Dickinson by Anderson] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130420112034/http://www.exploreart.co.uk/author_display.asp?SF1=sort_name&amp;ST1=ANDERSONPERCY |date=2013-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated the 1907 book, ''Costume: Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical''.&lt;ref&gt;''Costume: Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical'', compiled by Mrs. Eliza Davis Aria. (1907) New York: The Macmillan Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson died in King's College Hospital, London, in 1928, aged 76 or 77.&lt;ref name=Times31/&gt;

'''Peter van Diest''' ([[Latin]]ised as '''Petrus Diesthemius''') was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] writer from the [[Low Countries]]. The late-15th-century [[morality play]] ''[[Elckerlijc]]'' is attributed to him.

''Elckerlijc'', which was translated into English to become the famous ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', has come down to us in manuscripts that fail to mention the play's author. A 1539 [[Latin]] translation by [[Georgius Macropedius]], however, states that its original author is one Petrus Diesthemius ('Peter of Diest'). Little else is known of this writer; he has been identified with the [[Carthusian]] monk [[Petrus Dorlandus]] (1454&amp;ndash;1507), who lived in [[Diest]] (in present-day [[Belgium]]) and wrote [[Hagiography|lives of the saints]]. This identification, however, is controversial among [[philologist]]s.

'''Pierina Gilli''' (August 3, 1911 &amp;ndash; January 12, 1991), was a Roman Catholic Italian [[visionary]] born in the municipality of [[Montichiari]]  which is located in the [[Province of Brescia|Brescia province]] of the [[Lombardy]] region in northern [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourladysmantle.org/index_files/Page2130.htm Sutlovich, Paul, "Maria Rosa Mystica:1947-1991"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daily news"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/07/11/fea13.asp | title=Feast of Rosa Mystica on Friday | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318071408/http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/07/11/fea13.asp | archivedate=March 18, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died there  when she was 79 years old.&lt;ref name="mary in our life"&gt;{{cite book | title=Mary in Our Life: Atlas of the Names and Titles of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and Their Place in Marian Devotion | publisher=iUniverse | author=Santoro, Nicholas J. | year=2011 | pages=539 | isbn=9781462040216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Historia de Pierina Gilli"'': http://rosamystica13.com/page5.php&lt;/ref&gt; She is mainly known as the [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] [[clairvoyant|seer]] to whom the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] revealed herself as [[Rosa Mystica]], especially in regard to Our Lady's maternal role pertaining to her deeply beloved [[consecration|consecrated]] [[souls]] of [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] and of male and female members of [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institutes]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="mary in our life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marypages"&gt;''"Montichiari-Fontanelle: Apparitions of Our Lady, Rosa Mystica"'', MaryPages (website): http://www.marypages.com/MontichiariEng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood ==
Pierina Gilli was born on August 3, 1911, in the San Giorgio section of the northern Italian municipality of Montichiari.&lt;ref name="daily news"/&gt; Her parents, Pancrazio Gilli and Rosa Bartoli, had three children, of which Pierina was the eldest. Her family was poor, as her father worked as a daily hired farm-worker. Due to its limited household income, the family often moved to various residences in Montichiari.&lt;ref&gt;"''Pierina Gilli: Prima Parte"'': http://www.entraevedi.org/Notizie%20sulla%20vita%20di%20P.Gilli.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pierina was seven years old her father, died, leaving her mother to support the three children. Between 1918 and 1922, Pierina was placed in a Montichiari [[orphanage]], conducted by the [[nun|sisters]] of the [[Handmaids of Charity]].&lt;ref name="ancelledellacarita"&gt;{{cite web|title=Website of the Handmaids of Charity |url= http://www.ancelledellacarita.it/sito/storia.asp?lang=1|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience had a lasting impact on Pierina. Pierina received her [[First Holy Communion]] in the orphanage when she was eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical stories about Pierina Gilli, from the official website of ''Mystical Rose Association of Fontanelle-Montichiari''|url= http://www.rosamisticafontanelle.it/ITA/Associazione/Associazione_Rosa_Mistica.asp|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierina returned to her family to assist her mother with the care of her two younger siblings, at the age of 11.  At age 12, her mother (who was now remarried), and eight siblings moved to live in a cottage with her step-family.&lt;ref&gt;Nine children, altogether: Pierina and her two full siblings, and six other children by the step-father&lt;/ref&gt; Pierina claimed she had received inappropriate attention from her step-father. Although not wishing to introduce any discord into these two families that were now living together, Pierina eventually confided everything to her mother.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical information about Pierina Gilli, from the website of ''Mary the Mystical Rose at Montichiari-Fontanelle''|url= http://www.preghiereagesuemaria.it/libri/maria%20rosa%20mistica%20a%20montichiari%20fontanelle%20apparizione.htm|language=Italian|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to that trauma, Pierina decided to consider a [[vocation]] in the [[religious life]] at age seventeen. Her [[Sacrament of Penance|confessor]] advised her to wait, in order to further discern any genuine [[religious calling]] to the [[consecrated life]].&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

Despite all of Pierina's troubles, a soothing glimpse of her caring and devout family upbringing can be observed by this early childhood reminiscence from Pierina's diary: ''"I was the first of nine children, I the first to be delighted in the joy, the bliss, and the caresses of my parents. The day of 3 August 1911 was the dawn of my earthly coming, and I was baptized on August 5, the feast of the Madonna of the Snow; on that given day, my Mamma consecrated me to the true Mamma in Heaven, so that her maternal protection would preserve me as white and pure as snow. How many times my dear Mamma repeated to me, by spurring me to be good and not to be capricious, because I was consecrated to the Madonna and therefore I must love her very much."''.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

== Young Adulthood ==

At eighteen, Pierina worked as a children's assistant at a communal nursery school in [[Montichiari]]. When she was twenty years old, a marriage proposal was made to her by an honest and well-intentioned young man. For two months Pierina intimately suffered so much, because she did not feel herself to be called to the married life, but rather, she felt that the Lord wanted her totally for Himself. Her confessor finally spoke concerning her most genuine thoughts, thus confirming her vocation. Pierina was initially accepted as a [[postulant]] by the religious sisters' community of the [[Handmaids of Charity]], but this soon had to be renounced for the first time by Pierina  due to her health problems, including [[pleurisy]], that persisted for several months. Pierina was in no condition to take her place among the postulants). Instead, forced by such circumstances, Pierina sought employment, and she worked for about seven years (from age 20 to 26: from 1931 to 1937) as a domestic servant of Father Giuseppe Brochini, and as caretaker of his elderly (frail and blind) mother, in the nearby small town of [[Carpenedolo]].

Pierina then focused on obtaining her nursing license at the "White Villa" Care Home (managed by the Sisters of Charity of St. Antida Thouret) in the large city of [[Brescia]]. Subsequently, starting at age 29, and throughout the four years of [[World War II]] (1941–1945), she worked as a licensed nurse's aide in the Civil Hospital (managed by the Handmaids of Charity) in the smaller city of [[Desenzano del Garda]], located on the southern shore of [[Lake Garda]], within sight of the north Italian [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

Although accustomed to many trials from an early age, and perhaps even because of those tribulations, Pierina was selected as the chosen visionary of Our Lady by becoming the faithful messenger of Mary the Mystical Rose (in Italian, ''"Maria Rosa Mistica"''). It was believed that Our Lady the Mystical Rose expressed her [[Christian theology of love|Christian love]] by embracing the souls of all her human children, and by closely caressing, through the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]], those predilected souls in consecrated religious life.

Pierina devotedly underwent and patiently endured the innumerable physical, moral and spiritual [[suffering]]s as a dedicated quiet [[martyr]] and voluntary [[victim soul]], to the end of her life.&lt;ref name="entraevedi.org"&gt;''"Pierina Gilli"'': Lungo periodo di attesa: http://www.entraevedi.org/lungo%20periodo%20delle%20attese.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earliest Apparitions of Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose ==

The [[Handmaids of Charity]] is the Roman Catholic order of religious sisters' Montichiari orphanage was where the young adolescent Pierina stayed, and at whose Brescia postulancy house the adult Pierina (at age 32 years) entered the [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated life]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''"Ancelle della Carità"'', ''"Handmaids of Charity"'' article at the Italian Wikipedia: [[:it:Ancelle della Carità]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She never attained the profession of final [[religious vows]] at this [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institute]]. Even so, this holy order of women deeply influenced and crucially impacted her spiritual growth and mystical development during her formative years, continuing well into her later life.&lt;ref name="entraevedi.org"/&gt;

Pierina maintained detailed diaries of her many [[Christian mysticism|mystical experiences]], in particular her spiritual visions and of the heavenly messages that were conveyed to her. From these documentary pages one can read of her encounters with Mary the Mystical Rose, and that they were anticipated and prepared for by Pierina's preliminary visions of [[Maria Crocifissa di Rosa|Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short Biographical Notes on the life of Saint Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose|url= http://www.ancelledellacarita.it/sito/biografia.asp?lang=1|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose was the foundress of the congregation of the Handmaids of Charity, who was [[beatified]] on May 26, 1940 by [[Pope Pius XII]] (Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli: 1876-1958) and then [[canonized]] a saint on June 12, 1954 by him.&lt;ref name="ancelledellacarita" /&gt;

On April 14, 1944, Pierina, then 32 years old, was accepted as a [[postulant]] by the Handmaids of Charity where she was subsequently assigned as a nurse at the Children's Hospital in the city of Brescia. On December 1, 1944, Pierina contracted [[meningitis]], and was taken to her religious order's infirmary in Ronco for infectious isolation and medical treatment. The infirmary was  located in a tiny section of the small Alpine village of [[Corteno Golgi]], in the Brescia province.  After twelve days in a comatose state Pierina was administered the Last Rite sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Extreme Unction]]).

Beginning December 17, 1944, the Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose started to appear to her, as recorded in the visionary's diary. She announced to Pierina that she would be cured, and that she would undergo future trials. This holy foundress of the Handmaids of Charity, had in her hands a vial of ointment that was given to her by Our Lady, and she anointed Pierina, saying comfortingly to her: ''"You will be cured, but you will have a heavy cross to bear."'' Because of this, December 17, 1944 became the Blessed's feast day, which was moved to December 15 after her canonization as a saint in 1954.&lt;ref name="rosamisticafontanelle"&gt;{{cite web|title=''"Preparazione all'incontro con la Madonna"'' (''"Preparation for the encounter with Our Lady"'')|url= http://www.rosamisticafontanelle.it/ITA/Storia/Preparazione_incontro/Preparazione_incontro.asp|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 1946, Pierina was stricken by an [[Bowel obstruction|intestinal occlusion]] and was again taken to the Civil Hospital in the  Montichiari. During the night of November 23–24, 1946, the Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose appeared to her again. Also, for the first time, the Madonna appeared, as described in Pierina's diary: ''"Then I see the most beautiful Lady, as if transparent, dressed in purple with a white veil that descends from her head to her feet; she held her arms open, and I saw three swords piercing her heart."'' Our Lady did not speak to, nor converse with, Pierina at that time.&lt;ref name="rosamisticafontanelle" /&gt;

A few months later, on March 12, 1947, after suffering [[heart failure]] followed by [[renal colic]], Pierina had to be admitted again to the Civil Hospital of Montichiari, where she lost consciousness, She was assisted by her congregational sisters as well as by her mother and sisters, who feared that she might die. Again, Pierina convalesced slowly, and she would again have apparitions of Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose, even daily visions of her from June 11 to July 12, 1947, as well as a second apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary with three swords piercing her Immaculate Heart. It was at 3:15 am on the night of June 1, 1947 when the Madonna said just three words to her: ''"Preghiera, Sacrificio, Penitenza"'', with Pierina becoming cured once more by the direct intervention of Our Lady. Pierina had offered her intense [[redemptive suffering]]s for the sake of the [[sacred]] [[sanctification]] of Roman Catholic [[consecrated life|consecrated]] [[Soul in the Bible|souls]] (namely, for the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] and for the members of male and female [[List of some religious institutes (Catholic)|religious institutes]], as listed in the Holy See's ''"Pontifical Yearbook"'', in Italian, ''"[[Annuario Pontificio]]"'').&lt;ref name="rosamisticafontanelle" /&gt;

=== Early 1947: First Cycle of Marian Apparitions at Montichiari ===

During 1947, again the alleged apparitions of the Madonna as Mary the Mystical Rose, began speaking with Pierina. The first event occurred on June 1, 1947, in Pierina's room at the Civil Hospital of Montichiari. Pierina was very ill, again near the point of death. In her diary she described the appearance of Mary, in a purple dress and long white veil and with three swords piercing her Immaculate Heart, the same as on the night of November 23–24, 1946; and so, on June 1, 1947, to the extremely sick Pierina, Our Lady spoke only these three words: ''"Prayer, Sacrifice, Penance."'' Previously, during the month of May 1947, the mystic Pierina was being subjected to diabolical vexations and would have a vision of Hell. On July 1, 1947, there was another Marian apparition, during the recitation of the Rosary, and the Virgin has again she saw the three swords piercing her heart.

Then, on July 13, 1947, there occurred the first "grand" apparition.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As noted in Pierina's diary, the Blessed Virgin Mary was accompanied by the Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose; and Our Lady appeared in a splendidly different manner: in a white dress and with a white cape around her head that reached to the floor; the three swords were on the floor, and on the chest of the Virgin were three roses: one white, one red, and one gold. She explained to Pierina, ''"I am the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of all of you. Our Lord sends me to bring a new Marian devotion for all male and female institutes, religious orders, and secular priests. I promise those religious institutes, orders and secular priests who venerate me in this special way my special protection, an increase of spiritual vocations, few betrayed vocations, and great sanctity among the servants of God. I wish the 13th day of each month to be celebrated as the day of Mary. On the 12 preceding days, special prayers of preparation should be said."'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The apparition continued...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mary had identified herself as the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of all Humanity, explaining to Pierina the meaning of the three swords and the three roses. The first sword means loss of the vocation as a priest or a monk. The second sword means priests, monks, and nuns who live in deadly sin. The third sword means priests and monks who commit the treason of Judas. While giving up their vocation, they often lose also their faith, their eternal beatitude, and become enemies of the Church. The white rose means the spirit of prayer. The red rose means the spirit of expiation and sacrifice. The yellow or golden rose means the spirit of penitence.&lt;ref&gt;''"Our Story"'', Rosa Mystica Foundation of America: http://www.rosamysticaofamerica.org/our-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Our Lady as Mary the Mystical Rose has kindly exhorted a new Marian devotion, in favor of all Roman Catholic religious institutes and priests, by specifically requesting to be honored with a special monthly Marian Day, on the 13th of every month, and most especially on July 13, in order to expiate for the many sinful offenses made particularly by consecrated souls. Additionally, on these first thirteen days of every month, Our Lady as Mary the Mystical Rose has precisely asked for the prayerful observance of the following four long-standing Roman Catholic devotional practices: the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Holy Mass]], the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Holy Communion]], the [[Rosary|Holy Rosary]], and the [[Holy Hour]] of [[Eucharistic adoration|Eucharistic Adoration]].&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

Therefore, two eminently different aspects of these Marian apparitions became manifested on June 1 and July 13, 1947 to Pierina Gilli. The first transformation pertains to Our Lady's auditory presence: the initially silent Madonna (first appearing on the night of November 23–24, 1946) ''then becomes'' the speaking Madonna (beginning on June 1, 1947). The second transformation pertains to Our Lady's visual presentation: the sorrowful and tearful Madonna (first appearing on the night of November 23–24, 1946: when Our Lady appears in purple dress and long white veil, covering her head and extending to her feet, and with three swords piercing her Immaculate Heart: this first manner represents her appearance as the grieving Madonna) ''then becomes'' the hopeful and resplendent Mary as the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of all Humanity (beginning on July 13, 1947: when Our Lady appears in white dress and long white cape, likewise covering her head and extending to the floor, and with three roses [white, red, and gold] adorning her Immaculate Heart: this second manner represents her appearance as Mary the Mystical Rose). Also, significantly, the apparitions of the Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose (that started on December 17, 1944) preceded, and then often accompanied, the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, particularly throughout these two eminent transformations, as though the Blessed Sister Mary guides Pierina Gilli to the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in that same year, on October 22, 1947, at 7:00 pm, during a [[prayer meeting]] (while the Rosary was being recited by Pierina and some of her religious sisters and nurses and doctors and patients) in the chapel of the Montichiari hospital of Pierina's religious order where she was serving as a nurse, Pierina saw a luminous ray of light emanating from the [[Eucharist]] [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] to a nearby statue of Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose (holding a [[crucifix]]). She saw the statue of the Blessed and the figure on the Crucifix seemed to become animated; Pierina rose up and knelt in front of the statue, and, from the crucifix in its hands, were miraculously emerging drops of blood, which Pierina wiped dry with the purification cloth from the [[altar (Catholicism)|altar]], as instructed by her holy foundress.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

The Blessed Sister Mary then spoke grievingly to Pierina:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"See how much blood is lost uselessly"''; and next the holy foundress pleadingly asked Pierina to recite the following prayer: ''"My Jesus, mercy, pardon our sins."'' Then, Mary the Mystical Rose appeared, announcing her final visitation to the premises of the Handmaids of Charity, by saying to Pierina: ''"For the last time I come to request the devotion already recommended at other times. My divine Son wanted to leave proof by his most precious Blood in order to witness how great is his love for all humanity, from which is returned such great offenses. Get the purification cloth, and show it to all here present. Behold, the drops of blood of the Lord. Let it be covered by a white cloth, and then let it be exposed for three days in this chapel, together alongside with the statute of Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose that will become miraculous for the sake of the devotion of the faithful. Have the coming factual test be referred to the Bishop, and say to him that conversions and revival of faith will verify it. I interpose myself as Mediatrix between all human beings and particularly for religious souls and my divine Son who, tired of the continuously received offenses, wanted to exercise His justice. I vitally desire that this Institute of the Handmaids of Charity may be the first to honor me with the title of Mystical Rose. By such am I, as the protectress of all religious institutes, assuring my protection for a lively re-awakening in the Faith so that these elect souls may return to the primal spirit of their Founders."'' After a silent pause, Mary the Mystical Rose stretched open her arms and white mantle as a gesture and a sign of her protection, revealing again the three roses upon her chest, and saying sweetly to Pierina: ''"Live for the sake of love!"'', as Our Lady slowly disappeared from sight.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Latter 1947: Second Cycle of Marian Apparitions at Montichiari's Minor Basilica ===

Successive apparitions of Mary the Mystical Rose  would then occur to Pierina, her chosen soul, while at the Dome of Montichiari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''"Il Duomo"'', |url= http://www.comune.montichiari.bs.it/index2.php?action=story&amp;cat=17&amp;file=ilduomo}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''il Duomo di Montichiari'' was a minor basilica, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title as Saint Mary of the Assumption on September 15, 1729. It was constructed on the site of an earlier church called Saint Mary Major, which was built in the 15th century.

Perhaps prophetically, the city's name of Montichiari means the Clear Mountains in English. Thus, this Marian apparitional site (Santa Maria Assunta di Montichiari, in Italian) can be rendered into English as Saint Mary of the Assumption at the Clear Mountains It was there where she would further reveal herself as Mary the Mystical Rose &amp;ndash; thereafter consistently wearing a long white dress, with only her bare feet and her hands uncovered, wearing a full-length white cowled cape around her face with wisps of her hair showing, clasped at the bottom of her neck, descending around her shoulders and down to the floor, opened in front (thus showing on her upper chest the characteristic three roses of white and red and gold, and sometimes even showing her glowing and radiant Immaculate Heart).

At the first such event in Montichiari's minor basilica of Saint Mary of the Assumption, on November 16, 1947, while Pierina was praying in thanksgiving after having attended the 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Sunday [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], it was near the altar in a wonderful light the Madonna as the Mystical Rose appeared in the midst of a garden of white and red and golden roses.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She asked Pierina to make, as an act of reparational humility, the sign of the Cross with her tongue on four tiles in the center of the basilica's floor. She requested prayer and sacrifice and penitence in reparation for the numerous offenses of humanity to the Lord. Pierina asked the Madonna if she would take her to heaven; Our Lady smiled and said to Pierina: "''If you can be generous, then many graces can be obtained for the whole world.''" Then, the Mystical Rose delicately joined together her hands in prayer, slowly turning away and distancing herself into a waning light.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Next, during an interior locution to Pierina while praying in her hospital's chapel at mid-day on November 22, 1947, the Blessed Virgin Mary summoned her to meet at the Montichiari minor basilica at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.; after conferring with her sister superior, Pierina, accompanied by five of her religious community's sisters, went to the basilica, where a few priests were already present.

While they were reciting the Rosary, in a descending and increasingly luminous light Mary the Mystical Rose, surrounded by a tapestry of roses, appeared to Pierina, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"I have come down to this place because here will be great conversions."'' Then, Our Lady specifically pre-announced (the only time that she would ever do so) that her upcoming visitation to this basilica would occur on December 8 the feast day of the Immaculate Conception, at 12:00 noon, in order to solemnly request the ''Hour of Grace''.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Sunday, December 7, 1947, the eve of the feast of the Immaculate Conception, while Pierina was being visited by and conversing with some relatives at her hospital, she received an inner locution to come quickly to the Montichiari basilica. Taking leave of her relatives and going to her superior Mother Luigia Romanin, they proceeded to the basilica, along with Pierina's priest confessor Father Luigi Bonomini: they prayed the [[Miserere (Allegri)|Miserere]] and were just beginning to recite the [[Rosary]], when in a flash of light the Madonna appeared, beautiful and smiling, with two small angelic children (a boy clasping her right hand and a girl clasping her left hand, both dressed in shining white robes and headbands: they were identified as the Fatima children, by Mary the Mystical Rose). Our Lady spoke to Pierina Gilli, addressing her and her mother superior Luigia Romanin and her priest confessor Father Luigi Bonomini:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"I have come to bring graces and blessings to the three of you, for the work and sacrifices that you have done for my intentions."'' She confided some secrets to Pierina, and then with a penetrating glance said to her: ''"Tomorrow at noon I shall come and show you a smallest part of Paradise. ... Tomorrow I will show you my Immaculate Heart, so little known by humanity. At Fatima I made known the devotion of consecration to my Heart. At Bonate I sought to make this penetrate into Christian families. Instead here at Montichiari I desire to deeply enkindle the Mystical Rose devotion; united with the devotion to my Heart, it comes profoundly into religious institutes, so that religious souls may draw abundant graces from my maternal Heart. With this apparition for the sanctification of religious souls, I close the cycle of such apparitions."'' Our Lady promised that she would continue to provide special graces for the Handmaids of Charity, and she also specifically requested prayers (as at Fatima) for the conversion of Russia, whose soldiers were affecting the tranquility and peace of Russia itself and of many nations, and particularly of Italy at that time.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, on December 7, 1947, accompanied by [[Jacinta and Francisco Marto]], the two youngest of the three famous Marian visionary shepherd children of [[Fatima, Portugal]], Mary the Mystical Rose had reappeared, explaining to the visionary Pierina as she wrote in her diary about these two heavenly children who were entrusted to her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"They will be your companions in every tribulation. They also have suffered, although much younger than you."'' Francisco Marto (June 11, 1908 – April 4, 1919) and Jacinta Marto (March 11, 1910 – February 20, 1920), brother and sister to each other, died as victim souls in their very early teenage years.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 13, 2000, they were beatified as Blessed Francisco Marto and Blessed Jacinta Marto by [[Pope John Paul II]] (Karol Jozef Wojtyla: 1920-2005), at the Marian basilica renowned throughout the world as the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima]], in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''"The Beatification"'',|url=http://www.ewtn.com/fatima/beatification/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the profound mystical sense of deep spiritual developments pertaining to these three inter-connected Marian apparitions that occurred within the 20th century, the story of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] (in Fátima, Portugal; during 1917) is thereby continued by the story of Our Lady of Ghiaie (in Bonate, Italy; during 1944)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''"La Madonna di Ghiaie di Bonate"''|url= http://www.madonnadelleghiaie.it/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the story of Mary the Mystical Rose (in Montichiari, Italy; during 1946 to 1983).

Various aspects concerning these three Marian apparitions are explored and explained in ''La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church)'', a book of testimonials, compiled over the course of four years and published in the Holy Year 1975, by Father Eligio Garbo; which informs mostly about the Montichiari apparitions but also presents the similarities and complementarities pertaining to the Fatima&lt;ref&gt;''"Apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima"'', MaryPages (website): http://www.marypages.com/fatimaEng1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Bonate&lt;ref&gt;''"Apparitions of Ghiaie di Bonate (Italy)"'', MaryPages (website): http://www.marypages.com/Bonate.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Montichiari&lt;ref name="marypages" /&gt; supernatural events, as concisely noted on page 7:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Thousands were the persons that assisted with the facts and at the apparitions of Montichiari: some have done notations and writings; many others even today can testify. Therefore we have collected and transcribed these manifestations of love, these recollections made about the Madonna. These remembrances moreover are reconnected, by the Madonna herself, about Fatima and about Bonate: at Fatima, the devotion and the consecration (of individual Souls) to the Immaculate Heart of Mary; at Bonate, the consecration and the sanctification of the Family; at Montichiari, the sanctification and the devotion lived by (religious) Vocations and by the Mystical Body, the Church, of which She is the Mother."'' &lt;ref&gt;Father Eligio Garbo, ''La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church'', Propaganda Mariana, Rome, 1975, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Pierina was greatly discouraged and even pressured by numerous persons, including Monsignor Agostino Gazzoli, representing the Bishop of the Brescia diocese, from going to the Montichiari minor basilica at the time appointed (the noon hour of December 8, 1947) by the Blessed Virgin Mary, so as not to make a bad impression about herself. As the mid-day hour approached, Pierina, even though reproved and given injunctions by some authoritative ecclesiastical figures who tried mightily to dissuade her, with an inner strength that she herself could not explain, decisively said, at 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 8, 1947: ''"Now it is necessary that I go."'' Pierina would have preferred to have been accompanied by her supportive mother and the sister superior of her hospital, but she hastily reached the destination on her own, arriving at Montichiari's minor basilica of Saint Mary of the Assumption, just at the noon hour.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

Significantly, on December 8, 1947, at 12:00 noon, Mary the Mystical Rose resplendently appears to Pierina in the Montichiari basilica, where about a thousand persons are attending the Mass for the feast of the Immaculate Conception. As had been pre-announced (the only instance when any of Our Lady's apparitions was specifically noted before-hand to Pierina), the visionary sees Mary the Mystical Rose majestically descending a wide staircase, beautifully lined with numerous white and red and gold roses, to the center of the basilica's floor; and Our Lady says to Pierina:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 ''"I am the Immaculate Conception. I am Mary of Grace, the Mother of my Divine Son Jesus Christ. By my coming to the Clear Mountains (Montichiari), I desire to be called the Mystical Rose. Furthermore my desire is to see instituted ''the Hour of Grace'' for the whole world, by celebrating it on December 8th of every year, in order to obtain graces and conversions; and to request the construction of railings for the custody of these cited four floor tiles, together with a statue that replicates the Mystical Rose."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And then, as soon as Pierina was seeing on the Madonna's breast, in a blazing light, her Immaculate Heart, there simultaneously was happening in the basilica the two attributed miraculous cures, regarding a paralyzed child and a mute woman.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Hierzenberger, Otto Nedomansky, ''Tutte le apparizioni della Madonna in 2000 anni di storia'' (''All the Apparitions of Our Lady in 2000 Years of History''), Piemme, 1996, pp. 312–323&lt;/ref&gt;

These two instantaneous healings involved: a young boy Ugo Senici about six years old, having suffered from polio and not being able to stand or to walk (who suddenly ran around and jumped up and down excitedly; later in life he would marry); and a 26-year-old woman Teresina Magli, having suffered for nine years from severe tuberculosis and not being able to speak even a word (who suddenly sang out a spontaneous song of praise in a loud voice; she would soon thereafter become a pious nun, living sacrificially only to expiate for the sins of priests and of members of religious orders). A third miraculous cure also happened during the same time as the other two, involving a mentally disturbed 36-year-old woman, Lauriana Zamboni, who was healed at home while her supportive family members were praying for her inside Montichiari's minor basilica, precisely when Mary the Mystical Rose was appearing during the Hour of Grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the ''Catholic Tradition'' website|url=http://www.catholictradition.org/Mary/rosa-mystica.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Father Eligio Garbo, ''La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church'', Propaganda Mariana, Rome, 1975, pages 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Our Lady further revealed herself as Mary the Mystical Rose on December 8, 1947; and moreover, she requested that the Hour of Grace be celebrated annually on December 8 at 12:00 noon.

After these episodes at Montichiari's minor basilica of Saint Mary of the Assumption, Pierina was soon investigated and closely interrogated by the diocesan ecclesiastical authorities. Subsequently, she secluded herself, at age 38 years, on May 20, 1949, at the convent of the Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Child (whose superior was Sister Agnese Lanfaloni) in Brescia, Italy. She would not become a member of that religious order.

Pierina stayed at this convent for 19 years, rendering her nursing services to this community of religious sisters, even though Pierina herself sometimes needed to be cared for. Pierina had placed herself under the spiritual guidance of Fr. Giustino Carpin, O.F.M.Conv.(superior of the Conventual Franciscan Fathers in Brescia, Italy that would span 20 years.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

Pierina then found that the Marian apparitions occurred very rarely for a long time, but they were to return newly intensified in 1966.

=== 1966: Third Cycle of Marian Apparitions at Fontanelle ===

According to the testimony of Francesca (Franca) Dal Ri Cornado (1924–1993: foundress of the [Roman Catholic] Charismatic Movement of Assisi, in Brescia, Italy),&lt;ref&gt;"Francesca Dal Ri Cornado", brief biographical article: http://www.mcassisi.it/index2.php?lingue_id=1&amp;id0=0&amp;id1=2&amp;id2=45&lt;/ref&gt; the apparitions of Pierina were resumed as a requested sign, by their mutual spiritual director, Fr. Giustino Carpin, O.F.M.Conv., in order to verify the interior locutions that Franca Cornado had been receiving since 1958.

Reportedly, Fr. Giustino had invited Franca, without entering into any details, to ask for an especial grace from the Lord &amp;ndash; and the grace was exactly that his other spiritual daughter Pierina would see again the Madonna who had promised to newly manifest herself without specifying when and where.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt; Over time, Fr. Giustino  and Pierina became close friends.

As vaguely pre-announced on February 27, 1966, Our Lady as Mary the Mystical Rose would reappear to Pierina, then being almost 55 years old,  on April 17, 1966, Whitsunday (White Sunday, ''"domenica in albis"''), near a spring of water located at Fontanelle (in English, the Little Fountains), a small locality about three kilometers from the center of Montichiari, in the direction of Carpenedolo. The Madonna communicated the following message, pertaining to the small stairway leading down to the spring, as recorded in Pierina's diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"My Divine Son Jesus is all love. He has invited me to render miraculous this spring. As a sign of penance and of purification, give a kiss to the (top) step, then go down a few steps, stop, then give another kiss and go down further. For a third time, give again a kiss to the (bottom) step, and here can be placed the Crucifix. The sick and all my children, before taking and drinking the water, should ask pardon from my Divine Son. ... Now here is your mission, in the midst of the sick and the needy."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a second apparition at Fontanelle, on May 13, 1966, the 49th anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady of Fatima, Mary the Mystical Rose conveyed to Pierina to call the spring ''"The Font of Grace"'', inviting humanity to prayer, to sacrifice, and to penance, in order to save ourselves from ruin.

The third apparition happened on June 9, 1966. The Solemnity of Corpus Christi: the Blessed Virgin would express her desire according to which a part of the grain from the nearby fields would be transformed into ''"the Eucharistic Bread"'' and brought to Fatima on October 13. Moreover, she would express also her desire that the people of Montichiari would consecrate themselves to her Immaculate Heart.

In the fourth and final apparition at Fontanelle, on August 6, 1966, the feast of the Transfiguration of Jesus, the Madonna would request the institution of ''"the World Union of Reparative Communion"'', to be held on October 13; additionally, her function as the mediatrix between her Son and humanity was recorded, by adjoining:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"I have chosen this place of Montichiari because in its children that work the soil, there is still humility as in a poor Bethlehem."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Fontanelle is a small section (fraction, or ''"frazione"'') of Montichiari. Thus, even prophetically and spiritually in its meek humbleness and mere littleness, Maria Rosa Mistica a Fontanelle di Montichiari can be rendered from Italian into English as Mary the Mystical Rose at the Little Fountains of the Clear Mountains.

Since then, at Fontanelle (the Little Fountains, the springs of living water), there has been established the Sanctuary of Mary the Mystical Rose (in Italian, il Santuario di Maria Rosa Mistica), which is sometimes also referred to as ''"the little Lourdes of Italy"'' (in Italian, ''"la piccola Lourdes italiana"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''"Le Fontanelle, piccolo Lourdes italiana"'' |date=December 29, 1998|url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/dicembre/29/Fontanelle_piccola_Lourdes_italiana_co_0_98122912183.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Quella Piccola Lourdes Dimenticata?"'': http://www.sanpaolo.org/club3/0808c3/0808Art_Fontanelle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Blessed Virgin Mary, appearing as the Mystical Rose to Pierina Gilli, said on May 19, 1970:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Montichiari can be a second Lourdes."''&lt;ref&gt;Father Eligio Garbo, ''La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church'', Propaganda Mariana, Rome, 1975, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Last Years ==

Pierina began a very reclusive life from the late 1960s onwards, living simply and prayerfully in a donated little, humble house with a small prayer chapel (dedicated to Mary the Mystical Rose), making herself quietly available at her private home (in Montichiari's section or ''"frazione"'', called Boschetti, which in English means "the little forests"), in order to receive cordially and to pray fervently with the visitors coming on pilgrimage to Fontanelle (and to the Montichiari minor basilica), while the Marian apparitions and messages were continuing thereafter.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

The last recorded Marian apparition occurred on March 24, 1983 to Pierina, being 71 years old, in her Boschetti home, Mary the Mystical Rose would express her desire to see the realization of a special Marian Sanctuary with five cupolas in Montichiari, and Our Lady would specifically request that progress be made in producing a Mystical Rose Sanctuary medal according to her instructions.&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;

Pierina Gilli, at the age of 79, died on January 12, 1991, at Montichiari, in the Boschetti section.&lt;ref name="marypages" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="preghiereagesuemaria" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Maria Rosa Mystica: 1947-1991"'', Our Lady's Mantle (website): http://www.ourladysmantle.org/index_files/Page2130.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After Pierina's death, during the 1990s and 2000s (decade), despite the local Brescia diocese's generally unsupportive historical stance, some 40 reported apparitions of Our Lady, a few times as the sorrowful Madonna, though mostly as Mary the Mystical Rose; as recorded in Pierina Gilli's diaries.

The number of pilgrims coming to Fontanelle and Montichiari has increased &amp;ndash; so much that since May 5, 2001, Father Piero Boselli (as named by Bishop Giulio Sanguineti; and as assisted by Father Emilio Treccani) has been serving as director in regard to the spiritual care and needs of the numerous pilgrims, coming not only from Italy and other nearby European countries such as Germany and Austria but also from other nations as well, even as far away as from Brazil; as permitted by Bishop Giulio Sanguineti,&lt;ref name="diocesi.brescia.it"&gt;''"Direttorio per il Culto Mariano in Locatita' Fontanelle di Montichiari (Brescia, 5 maggio 2001)"'' (''"Directive for the Marian Cult in the Fontanelle Locality of Montichiari [Brescia, 5 May 2001]"''): http://www.diocesi.brescia.it/diocesi/uffici_servizi_di_curia/u_cancelleria/documenti/Direttorio_c._il_Culto_Mariano_in_localita_Fontanelle_maggio_2001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Bruno Massaro has researched the apparitions, and has written a book on his findings ''The Case of Pierina Gilli of Montichiari'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''The Case of Pierina Gilli of Montichiari'' (2003), by sociologist Bruno Massaro; a book review: http://www.tanogabo.it/religione/fontanelle.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to Montichiari and to Fontanelle, the spiritual conversions and the miraculous cures and the liberation from diabolical possessions are still continuing, accompanied by other supernatural signs, such as (for examples) solar prodigies and luminous crosses in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Hierzenberger, Otto Nedomansky, opera citata (op. cit.), page 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Maria: Rosa Mistica"'', lengthy article (in Italian) at the blog named SolamentePerAmore (OnlyForLove): http://blog.libero.it/Solamenteperamor/9888243.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions of the Roman Catholic Church ==

The following five pronouncements were made over the course of several decades by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brescia as cited by Alfredo Tradigo:&lt;ref&gt;''"Pierina Gilli"'', biographical article (in Italian): [[:it:Pierina Gilli]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Communicated by the Episcopal Curia on June 30, 1968: ''"The Monsignor Bishop vividly exhorts all the faithful that they declare themselves respectful to the directives of the Church not to favor either by publications or by pilgrimages the spreading of devotions that are founded upon a non-approved interpretation of facts neither objectively controlled nor responsibly evaluated."''
# Communicated by Monsignor Luigi Morstabilini on November 25, 1975: ''"The Monsignor Bishop renews the firm invitation to the faithful and to the clergy because by their obsequious acceptance of preceding decisions they might find at other sanctuaries and places recognized by the Church the better form to experience the right and necessary devotion to the Mother of God according to more authentic contents of faith and of Catholic spirituality."''
# Declaration of Monsignor Bruno Foresti on October 15, 1984: ''"The Bishop of Brescia supported by the authoritative opinion of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, communicates that (a) the afore-mentioned apparitions of Our Lady the Mystical Rose in Montichiari do not present motives of credibility; (b) the cult relative to Our Lady the Mystical Rose, therefore, is not approved and can not be practiced nor favored; (c) whosoever favors it, by spreading publications or by organizing pilgrimages, does not help, but disturbs the faith of believers by inducing them to behave contrary to the disposition of the Church."''
# Declaration of Monsignor Bruno Foresti on February 19, 1997: ''"The Bishop of Brescia holding accountable some various sollicitations that come continuously requested in merit, both from Italy and from external nations, reconfirms that which was disposed by him and by his predecessors."
# In the attachment to Decree number 229/08 by Monsignor Luciano Munari on March 19, 2008 at point 2 is read: ''"In a particular way there is explicitly asked of individuals and of groups, that until now are more or less directly dedicated to promote the Marian cult in the Fontanelle locality, to respect all the indications of the Directory, and not to spread the messages or publications, neither to promote the acts of the cult, nor to send compositions that might even only indirectly induce the faithful to restrain both the judgment and the Church on the afore-mentioned apparitions or other extraordinary phenomena, even as may be modified in a positive sense."''

Nearly all of the Brescia diocesan bishops' pronouncements have been generally cautious and not openly approving, yet not entirely negative, judgments; although, in view of the spiritual needs of the faithful multitudes who have continuously and increasingly been coming on pilgrimages to the Montichiari minor basilica and to the springs at Fontanelle. These pilgrimages are based on their devotion to Mary the Mystical Rose.

Bishop Giulio Sanguineti in a supportive manner has appointed since May 5, 2001, and which still remains in effect, Monsignor Piero Boselli, Director of the Liturgical Office of the Diocesan Curia, as the Presider of a constituted Committee, ''"with the purpose of watching over the devotional manifestations, while avoiding what might rest entrusted to the arbitrariness of occasional (casual) and passing-through priests"''; moreover, ''"Responsible for the activities and for the judgment of Marian devotions is the diocesan Bishop only, in which the singular care directed on the part of the Diocese can avoid the possible multiplications of episodes tending to reinforce some simple convictions around presumed extraordinary phenomena. This responsibility is necessarily retained also to avoid slightly illuminated devotional practices and certain forms of tendentious preachings."'' &lt;ref name="diocesi.brescia.it"/&gt;

:One of the earliest publications (originally published in German [264 pages], and translated into other languages, including Italian and English [200 pages], as well as French and Spanish: about the visionary Pierina Gilli and her apparitions of Mary the Mystical Rose), was printed with ecclesiastical permission granted by the German Bishop Rudolf Graber on February 12, 1974 from the documentary materials accumulated and provided by Father Thaddeus Laux, professor at the Salvator College in Bad Wurzach, Germany).
;
:This book, based on the Montichiari-Fontanelle Marian apparitions (beginning in 1947, and still on-going in 1974), focused on Mary as Mother of the Church, and especially on her timely intervention by means of her maternal renewal of the priesthood and of male and female religious orders within the Roman Catholic Church. As described in the book's introduction by Father Weigl: ''"Every renewal of the Church must begin with the head and then be achieved in the members, must start with the shepherds and spread to the flock. Today it is more necessary than ever. If Our Lady really appeared as "Rosa Mystica" in Montichiari &amp;ndash; and there is much to support this, as the following exposition will show &amp;ndash; it is not only an urgent admonition, but also a great responsibility, and even more, a great grace and help for the most painful, the most dangerous wounds of the Church of our time."''
;
:Weigl's book coincided with the numerous grave problems concerning the priesthood and religious orders, particularly during the 1970s in the confusing aftermath of the Second Vatican Council, when many thousands of priests and of religious brothers and sisters were leaving their vocations, or worse, staying while being openly defiant or secretly undermining the holiness of the spiritual callings of their souls. This book carefully documents and meaningfully highlights the particular occurrences and messages of Our Lady, as Mary the Mystical Rose; however, it does not delve so much into the inner personal life nor into the outer public persona of the visionary Pierina Gilli, who was still alive at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Alfons Maria Weigl, ''Mary, "Rosa Mystica": Montichiari-Fontanelle'' (1974), page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

:An historical account (in Italian, 388 pages) of the Montichiari apparitions (based mainly on the four-year-long collection of many testimonials from eye-witnesses), which also includes more discretely detailed and personal descriptions about the visionary Pierina Gilli (then still living), as well as studious explorations and explanations in regard to researching the inter-connections pertaining to the three 20th-century Marian apparitions (at Fatima, Portugal; at Bonate, Italy; and at Montichiari, Italy).
;
: Unlike the German priests (including Fr. Alfons Maria Weigl and Fr. Thaddeus Laux) who had previously published with the congenial approval of their local bishop, Fr. Garbo was treated rather harshly by his own superior, for his immense efforts on behalf of the Marian apparitions at Montichiari: ''"It can be said that these "apparitions" (at Montichiari) have already had a negative confirmation from "Rome". I respond with certainty that the Congregation of Cults and the Secretariate of State were never informed of the '''insoluble interrogatives''' described above: neither of the content, nor were the direct testimonies and the miraculously (healed persons) ever investigated. As usual, "Rome" remains sufficiently presumptuous when it is signaled by the (Brescia) Diocesan Ordinary and concurs with him. Personally I have irrefutable proof: regarding the punishment that was meted out to me of not being allowed to celebrate (Mass) and of confessing in the local Parishes, while I was able anywhere else to carry on my ministry in all other churches. To the contrary, the German priests, who have published books about these apparitions, translated also into Italian, were never given even a single punishment: neither was ever punished the abbot-priest Monsignor Rossi who cared for the works at Fontanelle: the Chapel, the statue of the Madonna, the Crucifix, the pool, and the Fountain."'' &lt;ref&gt;Father Eligio Garbo, ''La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church'', Propaganda Mariana, Rome, 1975, page 386.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{cite book|author=Franz Speckbacher|title=Novena to the Rosa Mystica|year= 1986|publisher=Mediatrix-Verlag, Zishkin &amp; Co. GmbH, A-3423 St. Andra-Worden, Austria}}
:A 48-page (English) booklet, published in 1986, not only in German but also in Italian, French, and English. This booklet contains some biographical information about Pierina Gilli, and provides brief descriptions of Mary the Mystical Rose, specifically pertaining to her apparitions to Pierina Gilli: the six Marian apparitions in the Montichiari minor basilica during 1947, and the four Marian apparitions at the springs of Fontanelle during 1966. However, more than half of this booklet presents a devotional novena to Mary the Mystical Rose, as well as the Litany of Maria Rosa Mystica.
;
:From the Introduction by the author: ''"Our dear Mother of God has been appearing in Montichiari-Fontanelle (Italy) since 1947, at a time when Faith is diminishing more and more, and sins are on the increase at a most alarming speed. If you ever visited one of the great places of pilgrimage, you will no doubt have returned from it firmly convinced that you visited a place where Heaven touches Earth. The many obvious favours received in answer to one's prayers are an indirect proof that the apparitions and revelations are genuine. The reason for this nine-day devotion is to rouse blind and materialistically-minded mankind and to open its eyes. The Rosa Mystica said in Montichiari: ''"Be assured that your sacrifices will be transformed into abundant, indeed triumphant graces, and into rich rewards by the Heart of Our Lord."'' These words should give us strength and confidence in that our prayers, sacrifices, and penances &amp;ndash; and therefore also this novena &amp;ndash; will achieve their purpose. May this nine-day prayer help you with your intentions."'' &lt;ref&gt;Franz Speckbacher, ''Novena to the Rosa Mystica'', Mediatrix-Verlag, Zishkin &amp; Co. GmbH, A-3423 St. Andra-Worden, Austria, 1986. Published in German, Italian, French, and English. {{ISBN|3 85406 082 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:This book (in Italian, 264 pages) is published posthumously in 2008, as the author died in 2004. The title translates as ''Mary the Mystical Rose, Mother of the Church''), with the subtitle: ''Le apparizioni della Madonna a Fontanelle-Montichiari'' (''The Apparitions of Our Lady at Fontanelle-Montichiari''). The author, a biblical scholar and theologian, speaking about Pierina's diary, writes: ''"Its authenticity is beyond doubt; the writing is always the same, the errors of syntax and grammar repeat themselves from start to finish."'' After having analyzed the personality of the mystic, lingering particularly on her simplicity, reserve and humility, and after having examined also the symbolic aspects of the apparitions, such as the three swords in the chest of Our Lady, symbols of the three categories of religious infidelity, and then in place of the swords the three roses (white, red and golden), which symbolize prayer, sacrifice and penitence, Monsignor Galbiati compares theological passages that ''"a simple woman would not have been able to write: for example, the fact that Mary presents herself in 1948 as Mother of the Church (a title approved by Pope Paul VI in 1964); or that Jesus communicates to Pierina in that same year in "clear and complete form" the dogma of the Assumption, proclaimed in 1950 by Pope Pius XII."'' &lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Tradigo, ''Pubblicato Dalle Edizioni Ares, Un Manoscritto Inedito di Monsignor Galbiati [Maggio 2008]'' (''Published by Ares Editions, An Unedited Manuscript by Monsignor Galbiati [May 2008]''): http://www.alfredotradigo.it/articoli08/at-08-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Schechter Letter]], '''Serakh''' is the wife of the [[Khazar]] ruler [[Bulan (Khazar)|Sabriel]]. A [[Jew]], she encourages her husband and other Khazars to [[religious conversion|convert]] to [[Judaism]] and establish it as the official religion of Khazaria.
Serakh is not mentioned in the [[Khazar Correspondence]] or the [[Kuzari]]. 

Some scholars have postulated that the Khazar conversion to Judaism came as a result of contact with existing Jewish populations in the [[Crimea]] and the [[Caucasus]], possibly the ancestors of the [[Krymchaks]] or [[Mountain Jews]]. As with so much of [[Khazar studies]], the absence of documentary evidence renders the question of whether Serakh belonged to one of these groups a matter of speculation.

'''Séverine Autesserre''' (born 6 December 1976) is a French author and researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/analysis-of-what-went-wrong-in-congo-wins-grawemeyer-award/|title=Analysis of what went wrong in Congo wins Grawemeyer Award|last=|first=|date=Nov 8, 2011|website=|publisher=Grawemeyer Award|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes about war and peace, [[peacebuilding]], [[peacekeeping]], [[humanitarian aid]], and the ongoing conflict in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Her research has influenced policy interventions as well as scholarly debates on peacebuilding and on Congo. She is a Professor of Political Science at [[Barnard College]], [[Columbia University]] (New York, USA), where she specializes in international relations and African studies.

== Education ==

Autessere holds a post-doctorate from [[Yale University]] (2007), a Ph.D. in political science from [[New York University]] (2006), master's degrees in international relations and political science from [[Columbia University]] (2000) and [[Sciences Po]] (France, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://barnard.edu/profiles/severine-autesserre|title=Severine Autesserre - Barnard Faculty Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=Barnard College - Columbia University|publisher=|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, and a B.A in political science from [[University of Paris|Sorbonne University]] (France, 1997). 

== Books and scholarly publications ==

Dr. Autesserre's most well-known research focuses on local violence and international intervention in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It culminated in her book, ''The Trouble with the Congo: Local Violence and the Failure of International Peacebuilding'', released by Cambridge University Press in 2010.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This book explains why international efforts to end civil wars so often fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=John F.|title=Book review: The Trouble with the Congo|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=2011|volume=9|issue=4|pages=202–203|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/div-classtitlethe-trouble-with-the-congo-local-violence-and-the-failure-of-international-peacebuilding-by-autesserreseverine-new-york-cambridge-university-press-2010-344p-9000-cloth-2899-paperdiv/83542610EFD83E95092FBA1AE516A2E2|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from over 330 interviews and a year and a half of field research, it presents a case study of the international intervention during the Democratic Republic of Congo’s unsuccessful transition from war to peace and democracy (2003–06).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Popiden|first1=Sandra|title=Local dimensions of war and peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo|journal=International Studies Review|date=2013|volume=15|pages=302–306|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/misr.12039/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that local rivalries over land, resources, and political power motivated widespread violence. However, an international peacebuilding culture shaped the intervention strategy in a way that precluded action on local conflicts, ultimately dooming the international effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordås|first1=Ragnhild|title=Book Notes: The Trouble With the Congo|journal=Journal of Peace Research|date=November 2012|volume=49|issue=6|pages=873–881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Mahavoric in [[North Hollywood, California]], on February 29, 1960.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Brian |last=O'Keefe |date=October 31, 2014 |title=Tony Robbins, The CEO Whisperer |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/tony-robbins-best-advice-executive-coach/ |accessdate=November 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robbins is the eldest of three children and his parents divorced when he was 7. His mother then remarried (more than once), including a marriage with Jim Robbins, a former semi-professional baseball player who legally adopted Anthony when he was 12.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/tony-robbins-best-advice-executive-coach/|title=Tony Robbins, The CEO Whisperer|last=O'Keefe|first=Brian|website=Fortune|access-date=June 29, 2017|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Robbins was raised in [[Glendora, California|Glendora]], California, and attended [[Glendora High School]]. He was elected student body president in his senior year.

During high school, Robbins grew ten inches, a growth spurt later attributed to a [[pituitary tumor]].&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; He has said his home life was "chaotic" and "abusive". When he was seventeen years old, he left home and never returned.&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; Robbins later worked as a janitor, and did not attend college.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"/&gt;

==Career==
Robbins began his career promoting seminars for [[motivational speaker]] and author [[Jim Rohn]] when he was 17 years old.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1987 p.409"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motivationlife.com/?p=27 |title=Anthony Robbins: A true motivation life |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |publisher=MotivationLife |author=Rolando Ponce de Leon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016135441/http://motivationlife.com/?p=27 |archivedate=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.success-guide.com/tony-robbins-tribute-jim-rohn/|title=Tony Robbins tribute to Jim Rohn - Success Guide|website=www.success-guide.com|language=en-US|access-date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.success.com/mobile/article/who-inspires-tony-robbins|title=Who Inspires Tony Robbins?|date=November 17, 2016|work=SUCCESS|access-date=July 2, 2017|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710100055/http://www.success.com/mobile/article/who-inspires-tony-robbins|archivedate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, soon after meeting [[Neurolinguistic Programming]] co-founder [[John Grinder]], the two became partners. At this time Robbins taught NLP and [[Ericksonian hypnosis|Ericksonian Hypnosis.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1983 Robbins learned to firewalk, and incorporated it into his seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Awaken the Giant Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny|last=Robbins|first=Tony|publisher=Free Press|year=2007|isbn=0-671-79154-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991 an estimated 100 million Americans in 200 media markets had seen his infomercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-01/news/vw-3520_1_tony-robbins/3|title=A True Believer :  Tony Robbins Has Attracted Converts--and Critics--to His Positive-Thinking Empire|last=GRANBERRY|first=MICHAEL|date=October 1, 1991|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to tell a story about a "very powerful man" who passed on hiring a female candidate even though she was the most qualified because she was too attractive and would be "too big a risk".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following criticism for these comments, Robbins posted an apology on his Facebook page, saying 'I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimel|first1=Erin|title=Popular Life Coach Tony Robbins Tried to Mansplain #MeToo—and Movement Founder Tarana Burke Responded|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/tony-robbins-metoo-burke-response|website=Glamour.com|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
