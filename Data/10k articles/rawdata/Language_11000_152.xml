{{New Testament Apocrypha}}
The '''Acts of Peter and the Twelve''' is one of the texts from the [[New Testament apocrypha]] which was found in the [[Nag Hammadi library]].

The text contains two parts, an initial allegory, and a subsequent [[gnostic]] exposition of its meaning. The allegory is thought to have been originally a work in its own right. The text is dated to the 2nd or 3rd century and is attested Greek and Coptic. The author claims to be [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]], and thus is [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/3791971/c7.pdf |title=7. Acts of Peter and the Twelve |author=István Czachesz |work=Apostolic commission narratives in the canonical and apocryphal Acts of the Apostles |publisher=University of Groningen |date=2002 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegory describes the tale, similar to the [[Parable of the Pearl]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], of a pearl merchant who is selling a pearl at a great price (note—this text is not to be confused with the [[Mormon]] scripture ''The [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]]''). The merchant is shunned by the rich but the poor attend him in droves, and learn that the pearl is kept at the home city of the merchant, "Nine Gates", rather than being carried on him. As such those who desire it must trek the arduous journey to Nine Gates. 

The name of the merchant is Lithargoel, which the text translates as being "lightweight, glistening stone", i.e. the merchant himself is the "pearl". Ultimately the merchant reveals himself to be [[Jesus]].

Faleti later found his way back to school by getting a job in a primary school, in which he worked for six years to raise enough funds for his secondary schooling with the financial support of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nigeriafilms.com/content.asp?contentid=5418&amp;ContentTypeID=5 |title=My mother thought I was impotent – Faleti |work=Nigeria Films |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he attended the [[University of Dakar]] in [[Senegal]] and obtained a Certificate of proficiency in French Language and Civilization.

{{Administrative law}}

An '''administrative court''' is a type of [[court]] specializing in [[administrative law]], particularly disputes concerning the exercise of [[public power]]. Their role is to ascertain that official acts are consistent with the law. Such courts are considered separate from general courts.

The administrative acts are recognized from the hallmark that they become binding without the consent of the other involved parties. The contracts between authorities and private persons fall usually to the jurisdiction of the general court system. Official decisions contested in administrative courts include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.om.fi/Etusivu/Julkaisut/Esitteet/Oikeudenkayntihallintooikeudessa Oikeusministeriö - Justitieministeriet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210053941/http://www.om.fi/Etusivu/Julkaisut/Esitteet/Oikeudenkayntihallintooikeudessa |date=February 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Deutschland).JPG|left|thumb|The [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] in [[Leipzig]] is the highest administrative court in Germany.]]In several countries, in addition to general courts, there is a separate system of administrative courts, where the general and administrative systems do not have jurisdiction over each other. Accordingly, there is a local administrative court of first instance, possibly an appeals court and a [[Supreme Administrative Court (disambiguation)|Supreme Administrative Court]] separate from the general Supreme Court.

[[File:Stenbockska palatset Stockholm 4 mars 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden]] in [[Stockholm]] is the highest administrative court in Sweden.]]The parallel system is found in countries like Egypt, Greece, Germany, France, Italy, some of the Nordic Countries, Portugal, Taiwan and others. In France, Greece, Portugal and Sweden, the system has three levels like the general system, with local courts, appeals courts and a Supreme Administrative Court. In Finland, Italy, Poland and Taiwan, the system has two levels, where the court of first instance is a regional court. In Germany, the system is more complicated, and courts are more specialized.

[[File:Conseil d'Etat Paris WA.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'Etat]]  in [[Paris]]  is the Supreme Administrative court in [[France]] .]]

In Finland, legality of decisions of both state agencies and [[Municipalities of Finland|municipal]] authorities can be appealed to the administrative courts. In accordance with the principle of the legal autonomy of municipalities, administrative courts can only review and rule on the formal legality of the decision, not its content. In the case of state agencies, administrative courts may rule on the actual content of the decision.

In the [[United States]], administrative courts are [[tribunals]] within administrative agencies, and are distinct from judicial courts. Decisions of administrative courts can be appealed to a judicial court.

Notably, in 1952, the [[Communist]] [[East Germany|East German government]] abolished the administrative courts as "bourgeois". This limited the citizens' ability to contest official decisions. In 1989, re-establishment of the system began in DDR, but the [[German reunification]] made this initiative obsolete.

The {{Nihongo|'''Agency for Cultural Affairs'''|文化庁|bunkachō}} is a special body of the [[Japan]]ese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). It was set up in 1968 to promote Japanese arts and culture. As of April 2018, it is led by the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, [[Ryohei Miyata]].  

The agency's budget for FY 2017 rose to ¥104.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Policy of Cultural Affairs in Japan Fiscal Year 2017 |year=2017 |p=8 |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503085647/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the [[Cultural Properties Protection Division]] protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, art [[copyrights]], and improvements in the [[Japanese language|national language]]. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and film-making. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and [[The National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the [[Japan Art Academy]], which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who personally bestows the highest accolade, the [[Order of Culture]]. In 1989, for the first time two women — a writer and a costume designer — were nominated for the [[Order of Culture|Order of Cultural Merit]], another official honor carrying the same stipend.

The Cultural Properties Protection Division originally was established to oversee restorations after [[World War II]]. As of April 2017, it was responsible for 1,784 historic sites, including the ancient capitals of [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], [[Heijō Palace|Heijokyo]], and [[Fujiwara-kyō|Fujiwara]], 402 scenic places, and 1,024 national monuments, and for such indigenous fauna as [[ibis]] and [[stork]]s. In addition, about 13,500 items had the lesser designation of [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]], with fine arts and crafts accounting for the largest share, with over 10,000 so designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Policy of Cultural Affairs in Japan Fiscal Year 2017 |year=2017 |p=38 |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503085647/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government protects buried properties, of which some 300,000 had been identified. During the 1980s, many important prehistoric and historic sites were investigated by the archaeological institutes that the agency funded, resulting in about 2,000 excavations in 1989. The wealth of material unearthed shed new light on the controversial period of the formation of the Japanese state.

A 1975 amendment to the [[Cultural Properties Protection Act]] of 1897 enabled the Agency for Cultural Affairs to designate traditional areas and buildings in urban centers for preservation. From time to time, various endangered traditional artistic skills are added to the agency's preservation roster, such as the 1989 inclusion of a kind of ancient doll making.

One of the most important roles of the Cultural Properties Protection Division is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and performing arts through their living exemplars. Individual artists and groups, such as a dance troupe or a pottery village, are designated as ''[[Intangible Cultural Property (Japan)|mukei bunkazai]]'' (intangible cultural assets) in recognition of their skill. Major exponents of the traditional arts have been designated as ''[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|ningen kokuho]]'' (living national treasures). About seventy persons are so honored at any one time; in 1989 the six newly designated masters were a ''[[Kyōgen|kyogen]]'' (comic) performer, a chanter of ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet) theater, a performer of the ''nagauta [[shamisen]]'' (a special kind of stringed instrument), the head potter making [[Imari porcelain|Nabeshima]] decorated porcelain ware, the top pictorial [[lacquer-ware]] artist, and a metal-work expert. Each was provided a lifetime annual pension of ￥2 million and financial aid for training disciples.

A number of institutions come under the aegis of the Agency for Cultural Affairs: the national museums of Japanese and Asian art in [[Tokyo National Museum|Tokyo]], [[Kyoto National Museum|Kyoto]], [[Nara National Museum|Nara]], [[National Museum of Art, Osaka|Osaka]] and [[Kyushu National Museum|Fukuoka]], the cultural properties research institutes at Tokyo and Nara, and the national theaters. During the 1980s, the [[National Noh Theatre]] and the [[National Bunraku Theater]] were constructed by the government.

The agency is based in the [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda Ward]] of [[Tokyo]]. Its relocation to [[Kyoto]] is scheduled by [[Fiscal year#Japan|fiscal]] 2021.&lt;ref name="organization"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organization |url = http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/about/organization/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anationalism''' ({{lang-eo|sennaciismo}}) is a term originating from the community of [[Esperanto]] speakers. It denotes a range of [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] political concepts that combine some or all of the following tendencies and ideas:
*radical [[anti-nationalism|antinationalism]],
*[[Moral universalism|universalism]],
*"one-world-ism",
*acceptance of the historic trend toward [[language death|linguistic homogenization]] on a world scale, and in some cases even a striving to accelerate that trend,
*the necessity of [[propaganda|political education]] and organization of the world [[proletariat]] in accordance with those ideas, and
*the utility of Esperanto as an instrument of such political education.

Although conceived within the World Anational Association (''SAT'', ''[[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]'') and promoted by its founder [[Eugène Lanti]], anationalism is not espoused by that organization as its official ideology.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===

Anationalistic ideas appeared in embryonic form in the plan for an "International Esperantist Workers' Federation" put forth by the Bohemian Esperantist Workers' Federation before World War I. These ideas, having gained impetus as a result of the war, were central to the thinking of the founders of SAT in 1921. They are very apparent in [[Eugène Lanti|Lanti]]'s work ''For la Neŭtralismon!'' ("Away with Neutralism!"), which first appeared under the pseudonym "Sennaciulo" ("Nationless Man").

The first members of SAT often regarded anationalism as a kind of all-embracing overall ideology of SAT, and liked to call themselves "sennaciuloj" ("nationless people"). Nevertheless, prior to the publication of Lanti's ''Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj'' ("Manifesto of the Anationalists") "anationalism" was a term that was applied to several rather diverse ideas. For many members of SAT who espoused anationalism at that time, it simply meant "(proletarian) internationalism plus Esperanto" or it signified a workers' version of [[L.L. Zamenhof]]'s ''[[homaranismo]]''.

A comparison of ''ABC de Sennaciismo'' written by [[Elsudo]] (Kolchinski) and published by SAT, with the ''Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj'' ("Manifesto of the Anationalists") shows how large a gap existed between various concepts of anationalism. Elsudo clearly defines SAT in his work as a "movement for anationalism". [[Ernst Drezen]] at the time of the schism in the workers' Esperanto movement of the 1930s, reproached SAT not so much for its "anationalism", something the communists within SAT had previously advocated as they understood it, but for its "Lanti-brand anationalism".

Little by little, a concept of anationalism was formulated in articles by Lanti in the organs of SAT.

=== A more stringent formulation ===
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In 1928, Lanti published a brochure, ''La Laborista Esperantismo'' ("Worker Esperantism"), in which he devoted an entire chapter to the definition of the new term. The anationalist tendency had previously encountered no opposition in the non-partisan organization. But in 1929 SAT entered a crisis, and anationalism became the main argument used by the opposition to attack the organization's leadership.

That opposition claimed that anationalism was pro-[[imperialism|imperialist]] and, as such, "[[counterrevolutionary]]". The sudden and unexpected attack moved Lanti to publish anonymously in 1931 a brochure in 3000 copies: ''Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj'', which was later translated into several languages, including a French version that appeared in 2000 copies.

Anationalism was defined as follows in that manifesto: ''"What characterizes anationalism is not primarily its acknowledgement of the huge role played by production of artifacts in the world. It is that capability that has made man the king of other living beings. Human beings adapt nature to their own needs, while animals must [[adaptation|adapt to nature]]. Anationalists therefore do not deny the great strength that lies in the human will. They do not doubt that humans cannot shed their own weight or jump away from their own shadow. Nevertheless, the limited space in which man is free to act is relatively large. His will can thus engender great works. We therefore believe that the [[determinism|fateful laws of history]] are only relative."''

The following quotation from the same work, which provides for a more precise understanding of the new doctrine, was denounced in its time by [[stalinism|Stalinist]] internationalists for clearly contradicting the then prevailing theory of "construction of [[socialism in one country]]": ''"The anationalists combat all that is national: national languages and cultures, national customs and traditions. For them, Esperanto is their primary language and they consider national languages to be merely auxiliary. They refuse to participate in any national struggle and they acknowledge as necessary and advantageous to the [[working class|exploited class]] only [[class struggle]] that seeks to eliminate classes, nationalities and all forms of exploitation."'' (ibid.)

As the heretical doctrine that was so expressed met up with opposition in SAT, the anationalists coalesced to form a faction independent of the organization, which they continued to support fervently. They began to publish the ''Sennaciista Bulteno'' ("Anationalist Bulletin") on a fairly regular basis.

[[Anarchism]] as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism as well as of the Esperanto language.&lt;ref&gt;"Anarkiistoj estis inter la pioniroj de la disvastigo de Esperanto. En 1905 fondiĝis en Stokholmo la unua anarkiisma Esperanto-grupo. Sekvis multaj aliaj: en Bulgario, Ĉinio kaj aliaj landoj. Anarkiistoj kaj anarki-sindikatistoj, kiuj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito apartenis al la nombre plej granda grupo inter la proletaj esperantistoj, fondis en 1906 la internacian ligon Paco-Libereco, kiu eldonis la Internacian Socian Revuon. Paco-libereco unuiĝis en 1910 kun alia progresema asocio, Esperantista Laboristaro. La komuna organizaĵo nomiĝis Liberiga Stelo. Ĝis 1914 tiu organizaĵo eldonis multe da revolucia literaturo en Esperanto, interalie ankaŭ anarkiisma. Tial povis evolui en la jaroj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito ekzemple vigla korespondado inter eŭropaj kaj japanaj anarkiistoj. En 1907 la Internacia Anarkiisma Kongreso en Amsterdamo faris rezolucion pri la afero de internacia lingvo, kaj venis dum la postaj jaroj similaj kongresaj rezolucioj. Esperantistoj, kiuj partoprenis tiujn kongresojn, okupiĝis precipe pri la internaciaj rilatoj de la anarkiistoj."[http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/anarkiismo.htm "ESPERANTO  KAJ  ANARKIISMO" by Will Firth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naturismo"&gt;"Proliferarán así diversos grupos que practicarán el excursionismo, el naturismo, el nudismo, la emancipación sexual o el esperantismo, alrededor de asociaciones informales vinculadas de una manera o de otra al anarquismo. Precisamente las limitaciones a las asociaciones obreras impuestas desde la legislación especial de la Dictadura potenciarán indirectamente esta especie de asociacionismo informal en que confluirá el movimiento anarquista con esta heterogeneidad de prácticas y tendencias. Uno de los grupos más destacados, que será el impulsor de la revista individualista ''[[Iniciales|Ética]]'' será el Ateneo Naturista Ecléctico, con sede en Barcelona, con sus diferentes secciones la más destacada de las cuales será el grupo excursionista Sol y Vida."[{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/ekintza/article.php3?id_article%3D310 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014704/https://www.nodo50.org/ekintza/article.php3?id_article=310 |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }} {{cite web|url=http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618051019/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-18 |df= }} "La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923–1938)" by Xavier Díez&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish Civil War]], Francoist Spain persecuted [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchists]] and [[Catalan nationalist]]s, among whom the use of Esperanto was extensive.&lt;ref name="Del Barrio"&gt;''[http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/artik68es.htm La utilización del esperanto durante la Guerra Civil Española]'', [[Toño del Barrio]] and [[Ulrich Lins]]. Paper for the International Congress on the Spanish Civil War, (Madrid, 27–29 November 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the death of Lanti ===

After Lanti's death in 1947 and the post-war reconstitution of SAT, the anationalists revived their SAT faction in 1948 under the chairmanship of R. Roberts. Anationalists in SAT initiated and funded two reeditions of the ''Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj'' (1951 and 1971) and several other of Lanti's writings on anationalism.

In 1978, the SAT congress in Lectoure passed a resolution over the objections of the anationalists, which declared, among other things: ''"The preservation of ethnic language and culture is linked to the struggle for a new social order, and, as such, is part of the general efforts on the part of SAT's members to achieve justice and individual liberty."''

During the 80's, while [[T. Burnell]] was the secretary of the Anationalist Faction, a ''Declaration on Anationalism'' was passed, which emphasized the struggle of the anationalists against nationalism and in favor of a general individual right to self-determination including the individual right to define one's own identity as an exercise of free will. The faction remained active, with the exception of periods of inactivity during the 80's and 90's, during which the debate over anationalism continued unabated in ''Sennaciulo'', the monthly organ of SAT.

=== Today ===

At the SAT congress in [[Nagykanizsa]] (Hungary) in 2001, the Anationalist Faction of SAT was reestablished as a result of renewed interest in anationalism and related subjects, which had evidenced itself previously, when an "anationalism" [[internet mailing list]] was founded. During that meeting another ''Declaration on Anationalism'' was passed, which was a revised version of the previous declaration.

The presently active anationalists in the Anationalist Faction cultivate and develop the universalistic and (radical) antinationalist currents of thought that were characteristic of previous formulations of anationalism. Their orientation is less strictly Lantian than that of previous generations of anationalists, and they do not seek to achieve doctrinal uniformity. Some members of the Faction work to oppose ideologies that have become very influential within the general Esperanto movement in the past decades: [[ethnism]], the instrumentalization of Esperanto in favor of various sorts of [[identity politics]], [[differentialism]] ([[ethnopluralism]]) and language nationalism and [[Linguistic protectionism|purism]] (so-called "language defence").

Outside of SAT and the Anationalist Faction there are also a number of Esperantists that adhere in various degrees to anationalist ideas. Anationalism has generally not been propagated outside the Esperanto-speaking community. Lanti justified this in Chapter 5 of ''La Laborista Esperantismo'' with the statement that "disseminating anationalism among those who differ by language would be as foolish as teaching literature to illiterates". This view, however, has been modified at times, as national language translations of the ''Manifesto de la Sennaciistoj'' were published out of the conviction that this would help to popularize Esperanto. The ''Manifesto'', moreover, concludes with a direct appeal to non-speakers of Esperanto: "The anationalists call upon the workers of the whole world: Learn Esperanto! Esperantists denationalize yourselves!"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">An '''ancient language''' is any [[language]] originating in times that may be referred to as ancient. There is no formal criterion for deeming a language ancient, but a traditional convention is to demarcate as "ancient" those languages that existed prior to the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Roger D. Woodard, ''The Ancient Languages of Europe'' (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Roger Woodward has said that "[p]erhaps, then, what makes an ancient language different is our awareness that it has outlived those for whom it was an intimate element of the psyche".&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

By this definition, the term includes languages attested from ancient times in the [[list of languages by first written accounts]], and described in [[historical linguistics]], and particularly the languages of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[Tamil language]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language]], [[Old Persian]], [[Avestan]], [[Middle Persian]], [[Sanskrit language]],  [[Chinese language]], [[Latin]], [[Arabic language]]. The term may also encompass other [[classical language]]s and various [[extinct language]]s.

==Popular culture==
The description of fictional races and realms having their own "ancient languages" adds depth and richness to storytelling, even if the vocabulary and grammar of the languages themselves is never provided.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Conley and Stephen Cain, ''Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages'' (2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include a fictional language in the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' young-adult novels, the language of the race called [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] in the [[Mythology of Stargate]], and various languages in writings by J.R.R. Tolkien.

'''Bipartisanship''', sometimes referred to as '''nonpartisanship''', is a political situation, usually in the context of a [[two-party system]] (especially those of the [[United States]] and some other western countries), in which opposing [[Political party|political parties]] find common ground through [[compromise]]. This is in contrast to [[Partisan (politics)|partisanship]], where an individual or political party only adheres to their interests without compromise. It has been debated among [[Political philosophy|political theorists]] however that in practice, each party advances their own [[political agenda]] at the expense of the other party because of the conflicting [[Ideology|ideologies]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Usage==
The adjective ''bipartisan'' can refer to any [[Bill (law)|bill]], [[Act of Congress|act]], [[Resolution (law)|resolution]], or other [[political]] act in which both of the two major [[political parties]] agree about all or many parts of a political choice. Bipartisanship involves trying to find common ground, but there is debate whether the issues needing common ground are peripheral or central ones.&lt;ref name=twsNovA23&gt;{{cite news |author= Dan Froomkin |title= What Bipartisanship Is -- and Isn't |publisher= ''The Washington Post'' |date= April 30, 2009 |url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/white-house-watch/what-bipartisanship-is----and.html |accessdate= 2010-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[compromise]]s are called bipartisan if they reconcile the desires of both parties from an original version of [[legislation]] or other proposal. Failure to attain bipartisan support in such a system can easily lead to [[gridlock (politics)|gridlock]], often angering each other and their [[constituencies]]. An analysis in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in March 2010 suggested that the present state of American politics is marked by ''oppositional politics'' which has left the voters cynical about the process.&lt;ref name=twsNovA16&gt;{{cite news |author= CARL HULSE and ADAM NAGOURNEY |title= Senate G.O.P.

==Feature of two-party systems==
According to political analyst [[James Fallows]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', bipartisanship is a phenomenon belonging to a [[two-party system]] such as the political system of the [[United States]] and does not apply to a [[parliamentary system]] such as [[Great Britain]] since the minority party is not involved in helping write legislation or voting for it.&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa&gt;{{cite news |author= [[James Fallows]] |title= Why bipartisanship can't work: the expert view |publisher= ''The Atlantic'' |date= February 1, 2010 |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/02/why-bipartisanship-cant-work-the-expert-view/35101/ |accessdate= 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallows argues that in a two-party system, the minority party can be obstructionist and thwart the actions of the majority party.&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa/&gt; However, analyst [[Anne Applebaum]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' suggested that partisanship had been rampant in the [[United Kingdom]] and described it as "a country in which the government and the opposition glower at each other from opposite sides of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], in which [[backbencher]]s jeer when their opponents speak."&lt;ref name=twsNovA21&gt;{{cite news |author= [[Anne Applebaum]] |title= Can the Brits learn bipartisanship? |publisher= ''The Washington Post''
|date= June 1, 2010 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/31/AR2010053103112.html |accessdate= 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applebaum suggested there was ''bipartisanship'' in Britain, meaning a coalition in 2010 between the opposing major parties but that it remained to be seen whether the coalition could stay together to solve serious problems such as tackling Britain's [[Great Recession|financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=twsNovA21/&gt;

Bipartisanship (in the context of a two-party system) is the opposite of [[partisanship]] which is characterized by a lack of cooperation between rival political parties.&lt;ref name=twsNovA13/&gt; [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framer]] [[James Madison]] argued in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' that a danger to democracies were factions, which he defined as a group that pushed its interests to the detriment of the national interest. While the framers of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not think that political parties would play a role in American politics, political parties have long been a major force in American politics, and the nation has alternated between periods of intense party rivalry and partisanship, as well as periods of bipartisanship. According to Robert Siegel of ''[[National Public Radio]]'', there has been virtually no cooperation between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. during the few years before 2010.&lt;ref name=twsNovA13&gt;{{cite news |author= ROBERT SIEGEL |title= Sen. Cornyn On Bipartisanship, Health Care |publisher= ''NPR'' |date= October 21, 2010 |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130732170 |accessdate= 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bipartisanship can also be between two or more opposite groups (e.g. liberal and conservative) to agree and determine a plan of action on an urgent matter that is of great importance to voters. This interpretation brings bipartisanship closer to the more applied notion of [[postpartisan]] decision-making; a solution-focused approach that creates a governance model with third-party arbiters used to detect [[bias]].

It is also argued that bipartisanship exists in policy-making that does not have bipartisan support. This is  the case if it involves bipartisan exchanges. This element is a central feature in the legislative process and is a bipartisan concept in the sense that it serves as a mechanism for achieving consensus and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Affordable Care Act: Examining the Facts: Examining the Facts|last=Rawal|first=Purva|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2016|isbn=9781440834424|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In U.S. politics==
There have been periods of bipartisanship in American politics, such as when the Republicans supported legislation by Democratic President [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] in the early 1960s, and when Democrats worked with Republican President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=twsNovA24&gt;{{cite news |author=John R. Bohrer |title=Because Bipartisanship Is Dead Until 2011: A Defense of Senate Moderates|work=Huffington Post |date=September 30, 2009 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-bohrer/because-bipartisanship-is_b_305366.html |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that the non-partisanship in foreign policy was a precursor to the concept of modern bipartisanship in the U.S. politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bipartisanship &amp; the Making of Foreign Policy: A Historical Survey|last=Collier|first=Ellen|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=2011|isbn=9781462844388|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was articulated in 1912 by [[William Howard Taft|President William Howard Taft]], who stated that the fundamental foreign policies of the United States should be raised above party differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In recent years, this was also shown in the case of [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]]'s administration, which began with an atmosphere of bipartisanship on foreign policy in Washington.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African Studies Newsletter, Volume 11|last=African Studies Association|first=|publisher=African Studies Association|year=1989|isbn=|location=Chico, CA|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the concept of bipartisanship implied a consensus not only between the two parties but also the executive and legislative branches of the government to implement foreign policy. This was seen in the article ''Bipartisan Objectives for American Foreign Policy'', authored by [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Richard Nixon]]'s Secretary of State, and [[Cyrus Vance]], who was Secretary during [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In the [[United States]] in 2010, however, there was wide disagreement between the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] because the minority party has been voting as a bloc against major legislation, according to James Fallows in ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref name="twsNovA11aa"/&gt; In 2010, the minority party has the ability to "discipline its ranks" so that none join the majority, and this situation in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] is unprecedented, according to Fallows.&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa/&gt; He sees this inability to have bipartisanship as evidence of a "structural failure of American government."&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa/&gt; Adviser to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama|Obama]], [[Rahm Emanuel]], said the period from 2008&amp;ndash;2010 was marked by extreme partisanship.&lt;ref name=twsNovA14&gt;{{cite news |author=Linda Feldmann |title=Rahm Emanuel redefines bipartisanship |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 25, 2009 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0625/rahm-emanuel-redefines-bipartisanship |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[U.S. elections of 2010]], with sizeable gains by Republicans in the [[United States House elections, 2010|House]] and [[United States Senate elections, 2010|Senate]], analyst Charles Babington of the [[Associated Press]] suggested that both parties remained far apart on major issues such as immigration and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] while there may be chances for agreement about lesser issues such as [[electric car]]s, [[nuclear power]], and tax breaks for businesses; Babington was not optimistic about chances for bipartisanship on major issues in the next few years.&lt;ref name=twsNovJx42&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles Babington |title=Election doesn't end major discord for GOP, Obama |agency=Associated Press |date=November 4, 2010 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101104/ap_on_el_ge/us_bipartisan_challenge |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; While analyst [[Benedict Carey]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' agrees political analysts tend to agree that government will continue to be divided and marked by paralysis and feuding, there was research suggesting that humans have a "profound capacity through which vicious adversaries can form alliances," according to [[University of California|Berkeley]] professor [[Dacher Keltner]].&lt;ref name=twsNovX445&gt;{{cite news |author=Benedict Carey |title=Cede Political Turf?

A call for bipartisanship is often made by presidents who "can't get their way in Congress," according to one view.&lt;ref name=twsNovA22&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Knoller |title=Obama Says Bipartisanship, But What He Wants Is GOP Surrender |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 9, 2010 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-6191815-503544.html |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military policies of the [[Cold War]] and actions like the [[Iraq War]] were promoted and supported, through the [[mass media]], as bipartisan acts.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda Hammer, [[Douglas Kellner]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSpmn22SqD0C&amp;pg=PA463 ''Media/Cultural Studies: Critical Approaches''] p.463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Bipartisanship has been criticized because it can obscure the differences between parties, making voting for candidates based on policies difficult in a democracy.&lt;ref name=test&gt;{{cite news |author= Sam Haselby |title= Divided we stand: The problem with bipartisanship |publisher= ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |date= March 22, 2009 |url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/03/22/divided_we_stand/ |accessdate= 2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the concept of bipartisanship has been criticized as discouraging agreements between more than two parties, thus exercising a [[tyranny of the majority]] by forcing voters to side with one of the two largest parties.

[[File:Bogurodzica 1407 r.jpg|thumb|[https://polona.pl/item/bogurodzica,Njg5MDU1MDE/0/#info:metadata Bogurodzica manuscript (1407)]]]
'''Bogurodzica''' ({{IPA-pl|bɔɡurɔˈd͡ʑit͡sa}}; "Mother of God/[[Theotokos]]") is the oldest [[Poland|Polish]] hymn. It was composed somewhere between the 10th and 13th centuries. While the origin of the song is not entirely clear, several scholars agree that [[Adalbert of Prague]] is the likely author.&lt;ref name="Vlasto"/&gt;

Polish knights sang it as an anthem before the [[Battle of Grunwald]]. Bogurodzica also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of the first [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian kings]].

== History ==
[[Image:Bogurodzica.jpg|thumb|right|"Bogurodzica"|[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] forces (probably sixteenth - seventeenth century) singing the Bogurodzica [[hymn]] before the battle. Painting by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
It was recorded in writing at the beginning of the 15th century. Two records preserved till today date back to that time: 
# the Kcynia record including two initial stanzas together with musical notation;
# the [[Kraków]] record covering thirteen stanzas without notes.
Other records date back to the second half of the fifteenth century, the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and to the beginning of the 16th century. In 1509 the song was printed in Kraków in [[Jan Łaski]]'s Statut.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The origin of the song is not clear, although [[Adalbert of Prague|St Adalbert]] is a likely author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgaA92_v6DUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Bogurodzica%22+%22Adalbert%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPrJHjl6fKAhUCNSYKHZiyCg0Q6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bogurodzica%22%20%22Adalbert%22&amp;f=false|title=Mapping the Catholic Cultural Landscape|page=84|author1=Paula Jean Miller |author2=Richard Fossey |year=2004|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vlasto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpVOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=%22Bogurodzica%22+%22Adalbert%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPrJHjl6fKAhUCNSYKHZiyCg0Q6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bogurodzica%22%20%22Adalbert%22&amp;f=false|title=The Entry of the Slavs Into Christendom: An Introduction to the Medieval History of the Slavs|author= A. P. Vlasto|page=123|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be related either to Latin liturgy, the tradition of church hymns, Greek or Old Church Slavonic influences, Western or Eastern culture. The two initial stanzas were created first - probably in the middle or at the end of the thirteenth century, or possibly at the very beginning of the fourteenth century.

Bogurodzica is a prayer hymn whose first stanza contains an invocation to Christ through the intercession of Mary. It begins with an apostrophe to her - to the Mother of Christ, the Virgin, praised by God, the chosen one. After the apostrophe, there is an appeal to Mary to win favour for people from her Son.

The second stanza begins with a direct addresses to Christ (called God's Son) - with an invocation to John the Baptist who can support human imploring. The prayer closing this stanza contains a request that Christ give people a blissful stay on earth and, after death, everlasting existence in heaven. The subsequent stanzas develop various motifs: Easter, the Passion, a litany - with invocations to the saints.

Bogurodzica was initially connected with the mass and procession but already in the fifteenth century it became a knight's battle hymn. Thanks to [[Jan Długosz]] (historian, author of Annales seu Cronicae incliti Regni Poloniae) we know that it was sung at Grunwald in 1410 as well as before other battles in subsequent years. It also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of [[Władysław III of Poland]]. That is why Długosz called Bogurodzica "carmen patrium" (the hymn of the motherland). In the next centuries the hymn lost its significance. It regained its position of "carmen patrium" in the nineteenth century and has held it to the present day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7719">In mathematics, '''Carmichael's totient function conjecture''' concerns the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of values of [[Euler's totient function]] ''&amp;phi;''(''n''),  which counts the number of integers less than and [[coprime]] to ''n''. It states that, for every ''n'' there is at least one other integer ''m''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''n'' such that ''&amp;phi;''(''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;phi;''(''n'').
[[Robert Daniel Carmichael|Robert Carmichael]] first stated this conjecture in 1907, but as a theorem rather than as a conjecture. However, his proof was faulty and in 1922 he retracted his claim and stated the conjecture as an [[open problem]].

==Examples==
The totient function ''&amp;phi;''(''n'') is equal to 2 when ''n'' is one of the three values 3, 4, and 6. Thus, if we take any one of these three values as ''n'', then either of the other two values can be used as the ''m'' for which ''&amp;phi;''(''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;phi;''(''n'').

Similarly, the totient is equal to 4 when ''n'' is one of the four values 5, 8, 10, and 12, and it is equal to 6 when ''n'' is one of the four values 7, 9, 14, and 18. In each case, there is more than one value of ''n'' having the same value of ''&amp;phi;''(''n'').

The conjecture states that this phenomenon of repeated values holds for every&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==Lower bounds==
There are very high [[lower bound]]s for Carmichael's conjecture that are relatively easy to determine. Carmichael himself proved that any counterexample to his conjecture (that is, a value ''n'' such that &amp;phi;(''n'') is different from the totients of all other numbers) must be at least 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Victor Klee]] extended this result to 10&lt;sup&gt;400&lt;/sup&gt;. A lower bound of &lt;math&gt;10^{10^7}&lt;/math&gt;was given by Schlafly and Wagon, and a lower bound of &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10}}&lt;/math&gt; was determined by Kevin Ford in 1998.&lt;ref name=HBII228&gt;Sándor &amp; Crstici (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;228&lt;/ref&gt;

The computational technique underlying these lower bounds depends on some key results of Klee that make it possible to show that the smallest counterexample must be divisible by squares of the primes dividing its totient value. Klee's results imply that 8 and Fermat primes (primes of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) excluding 3 do not divide the smallest counterexample. Consequently, proving the conjecture is equivalent to proving that the conjecture holds for all integers congruent to&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;8).

==Other results==
Ford also proved that if there exists a counterexample to the Conjecture, then a positive fraction (that is infinitely many) of the integers are likewise counterexamples.&lt;ref name=HBII228/&gt;

Although the conjecture is widely believed, [[Carl Pomerance]] gave a sufficient condition for an integer ''n'' to be a counterexample to the conjecture {{harv|Pomerance|1974}}. According to this condition, ''n'' is a counterexample if for every prime ''p'' such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 divides ''&amp;phi;''(''n''), ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides&amp;nbsp;''n''. However Pomerance showed that the existence of such an integer is highly improbable. Essentially, one can show that if the first ''k'' primes ''p'' congruent to&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''q'') (where ''q'' is a prime) are all less than ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, then such an integer will be divisible by every prime and thus cannot exist. In any case, proving that Pomerance's counterexample does not exist is far from proving Carmichael's Conjecture. However if it exists then infinitely many counterexamples exist as asserted by Ford.

Another way of stating Carmichael's conjecture is that, if
''A''(''f'') denotes the number of positive integers ''n'' for which ''&amp;phi;''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f'', then ''A''(''f'') can never equal&amp;nbsp;1. Relatedly, [[Wacław Sierpiński]] conjectured that every positive integer other than 1 occurs as a value of A(''f''), a conjecture that was proven in 1999 by Kevin Ford.&lt;ref name=HBII229&gt;Sándor &amp; Crstici (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;229&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cheyenne language''' ('''{{lang|chy|Tsėhésenėstsestȯtse}}'''), is the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] language spoken by the [[Cheyenne people]], predominantly in present-day [[Montana]] and [[Oklahoma]], in the [[United States]]. It is part of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] family. Like all other Algonquian languages, it has complex [[agglutinative]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. This language is considered endangered, at different levels, in both states.

==Classification==
Cheyenne is one of the [[Algonquian languages]], which is a sub-category of the [[Algic languages]]. Specifically, it is a [[Plains Algonquian languages|Plains Algonquian language]]. However, Plains Algonquian, which also includes [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]] and [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], is an [[Sprachbund|areal]] rather than genetic subgrouping.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Tipi parts Cheyenne.JPG|thumb|Tipi parts in Cheyenne]]
Cheyenne is spoken on the [[Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation]] in [[Montana]] and in [[Oklahoma]]. At the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, where as of March 2013, there were approximately 10,050 enrolled tribal members, of which about 4,939 resided on the reservation; slightly more than a quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English.&lt;ref name ="Cheyenne Tribe website"&gt;[http://www.cheyennenation.com Northern Cheyenne Tribe website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current status ===
The Cheyenne language is considered "definitely endangered" in Montana and "critically endangered" in Oklahoma by the UNESCO. In Montana the number of speakers are about 1700 according to the UNESCO. In the state of Oklahoma, there are only 400 elderly speakers. There is no current information on any other state in the United States regarding the Cheyenne language.&lt;ref&gt;

The 2017 film ''[[Hostiles (film)|Hostiles]]'' features extensive dialogue in Northern Cheyenne. The film's producers hired experts in the language and culture to ensure authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Schilling | first =Vincent | title ='Hostiles' Movie Starring Wes Studi, Christian Bale Will Screen in DC: National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), applauds Hostiles for 'authentic representation of Native peoples' and accurate speaking of Native languages | newspaper =[[Indian Country Today]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =January 8, 2018 | url =https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/arts-entertainment/hostiles-movie-starring-wes-studi-christian-bale-will-screen-dc/ | accessdate =February 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revitalization efforts and education ==
In 1997, the Cultural Affairs Department of Chief Dull Knife College applied to the Administration for Native Americans for an approximately $50,000 language preservation planning grant. The department wanted to use this money to assess the degree to which Cheyenne was being spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Following this, the department wanted to use the compiled data to establish long-term community language goals, and to prepare Chief Dull Knife College to implement a Cheyenne Language Center and curriculum guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jaie.asu.edu/sites/default/files/421_2003_7_littlebear.pdf|title=Chief Dull Knife Community is Strengthening the Northern Cheyenne Language and Culture|last=Littlebear|first=Richard|date=2003|website=Arizona State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Chief Dull Knife College sponsored the 18th Annual Language Immersion Camp. This event was organized into two weeklong sessions, and its aim was to educate the younger generation on their ancestral language. The first session focused on educating 5-10 year olds, while the second session focused on 11- to 18-year-olds. Certified Cheyenne language instructors taught daily classes. Ultimately, the camp provided approximately ten temporary jobs for fluent speakers on the impoverished reservation. The State of Montana has passed a law that guarantees support for tribal language preservation for Montana tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resolver.ebscohost.com.proxy.libraries.rutgers.edu/openurl?genre=article&amp;atitle=Keeping%20the%20Cheyenne%20language%20alive.&amp;title=News%20from%20Indian%20Country&amp;issn=15484939&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=8&amp;date=20150801&amp;aulast=Caufield,%20Clara&amp;spage=19&amp;pages=19-19&amp;sid=EBSCO:Supplemental%20Index:109092174|title=Keeping the Cheyenne language alive|last=Caufield|first=Clara|date=2015|website=ProQuest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes in the Cheyenne language are available at [[Chief Dull Knife College]] in [[Lame Deer, Montana]], at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]], and at Watonga High School in [[Watonga, Oklahoma]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Cheyenne has three basic [[vowels|vowel qualities]] ([e a o]) that take four [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s: [[high tone]] as in '''á''' [á]); [[low tone]] as in '''a''' [à]; [[mid tone]] as in '''ā''' [ā]; and [[rising tone]] as in '''ô''' [ǒ]. Tones are often not represented in the orthography. Vowels can also be [[voiceless vowels|voiceless]] (e.g. '''ė''' [e̥]).&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Wayne Leman included one more variant in his ''International Journal of American Linguistics''[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/IJAL/home.html] (1981) article on Cheyenne pitch rules, a lowered-high pitch (e.g. à), but has since recognized that this posited pitch is the same as a low tone.&lt;/ref&gt; The high and low tones are [[phonemic]], while voiceless vowels' occurrence is determined by the [[phonetic context]], making them [[allophone]]s of the voiced vowels.

|
|}

===Consonants===
The phoneme /h/ is realized as [s] in the environment between /e/ and /t/ (h &gt; s / e _ t). /h/ is  realized as [ʃ] between [e] and [k] (h &gt; ʃ / e _ k) i.e.  /nahtóna/ ''nȧhtona'' - "alien", /nehtóna/ ''nėstona'' - "your daughter", /hehke/ ''heške'' - "his mother".  The digraph "ts" represents assibilated /t/; a phonological rule of Cheyenne is that [[underlying representation|underlying]] /t/ becomes [[affricate]]d before an /e/ {{IPA|(t &gt; ts/_e)}}. Therefore, "ts" is not a separate phoneme, but an allophone of /t/. The sound {{IPA|[x]}} is not a phoneme, but derives from other phonemes, including {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (when {{IPA|/ʃ/}} precedes or follows a non-front vowel, /a/ or /o/), and the past tense [[morpheme]] /h/ which is pronounced {{IPA|[x]}} when it precedes a morpheme which starts with /h/.

===Orthography===
The Cheyenne [[orthography]] of 14 letters is neither a pure phonemic system nor a [[phonetic]] transcription; it is, in the words of linguist Wayne Leman, a "pronunciation orthography". In other words, it is a practical spelling system designed to facilitate proper pronunciation. Some allophonic variants, such as voiceless vowels, are shown. {{angbr|e}} represents the phoneme symbolized /e/, but is usually pronounced as a phonetic {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and sometimes varies to {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. {{angbr|š}} represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

=== Feature system for phonemes ===
The systematic phonemes of Cheyenne are distinguished by seven two-valued features. Scholar Donald G. Frantz defined these features as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Oral: primary articulation is oral (vs. at the glottis)
* Vocoid (voc): central resonant (oral) continuant
* Syllabic (syl): nuclear to syllable (vs. marginal)
* Closure (clos): stoppage of air flow at point of primary articulation ['non-continuant']
* Nasal (nas): velic is open
* Grave (grv): primary articulation at oral extremity (lips or velum) ['non-coronal' for consonants, 'back' for vowels]
* Diffuse (dif): primary articulation is relatively front ['anterior']

0 indicates the value is indeterminable/irrelevant. A blank indicates the value is specifiable, but context is required (even though any value could be inserted because the post-cyclical rules would change the value to the correct one). Parentheses enclose values that are redundant according to the phonological rules; these values simply represent the results of these rules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Donald G.|date=1972-01-01|title=Cheyenne Distinctive Features and Phonological Rules|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–13|doi=10.1086/465178|jstor=1264497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voicing ===

Cheyenne has 14 orthographic letters representing 13 phonemes. [x] is written as ''x'' orthographically but is not a phoneme. This count excludes the results of allophonic devoicing, which are spelled with a [[dot (diacritic)|dot overtop vowels]].  Devoicing naturally occurs in the last vowel of a word or phrase.  It can also occur in vowels at the penultimate and prepenultimate positions within a word. Non-high [a] and [o] is also usually devoiced preceding ''h'' plus a stop. Phonemic /h/ is absorbed by a preceding voiceless vowel. Examples are given below.

==== Penultimate devoicing ====
* /hohkoʃ/ ''hohk'''ȯ'''xe'' 'ax'; 
* /tétahpetáht/ ''tsét'''ȧ'''hpét'''ȧ'''htse'' 'the one who is big';
* /mótehk/ ''motš'''ė'''ške'' 'knife'

Devoicing occurs when certain vowels directly precede the consonants [t], [s], [ʃ], [k], or [x] that are followed by an [e].  This rule is linked to the rule of ''e''-[[epenthesis]], which simply states that [e] appears in the environment of a consonant and a word boundary.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 215"&gt;Leman, 1979, ''Cheyenne Grammar Notes'' p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prepenultimate devoicing ====
* /tahpeno/ ''t'''ȧ'''h'''peno'' 'flute';
* /kosáné/ ''k'''ȯ'''sâne''  'sheep (pl.)';
* /mahnohtehtovot/ ''m'''ȧ'''hn'''ȯ'''hts'''ė'''stovȯtse'' 'if you ask him'

A vowel that does not have a high pitch is devoiced if it is followed by a voiceless fricative and not preceded by [h].&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 215"/&gt;

==== Special [a] and [o] devoicing ====
* /émóheeohtéo/ ''émôhee'''ȯ'''htseo'o'' 'they are gathering'; 
* /náohkeho'sóe/ ''ná'''ȯ'''hkėho'soo'e'' 'I regularly dance'; 
* /nápóahtenáhnó/ ''nápô'''ȧ'''htsenáhno'' 'I punched him in the mouth'

Non-high [a] and [o] become at least partially devoiced when they are preceded by a voiced vowel and followed by an [h], a consonant and two or more syllables.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 218"&gt;Leman, 1979, ''Cheyenne Grammar Notes'' p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consonant devoicing ====
''émane'' [ímaṅi] 'He is drinking.'

When preceding a voiceless segment, a consonant is devoiced.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 218"/&gt;

==== ''h''-absorption ====
* ''-pėhévoestomo'he'' 'kind' + ''-htse'' 'imperative suffix' &gt; ''-pėhévoestomo'ėstse''
* ''tsé-'' 'conjunct prefix' + ''-éna'he'' 'old' + ''-tse'' '3rd pers. Suffix' &gt; ''tsééna'ėstse'' 'the one who is old'
* ''né'' + 'you' + ''-one'xȧho'he'' 'burn' + ''tse'' 'suffix for some 'you-me' transitive animate forms' &gt; ''néone'xȧho'ėstse'' ' you burn me'

The [h] is absorbed when preceded or followed by voiceless vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Leman, 1979, ''Cheyenne Grammar Notes'' p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitch and tone  ===
There are several rules that govern pitch use in Cheyenne.  Pitch can be ˊ = high, unmarked = low, ˉ = mid, and ˆ = raised high. According to linguist Wayne Leman, some research shows that Cheyenne may have a stress system independent from that of pitch. If this is the case, the stress system's role is very minor in Cheyenne prosody. It would have no grammatical or lexical function, unlike pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leman|first=Wayne|date=1981-01-01|title=Cheyenne Pitch Rules|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=47|issue=4|pages=283–309|doi=10.1086/465700|jstor=1265058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-raising====
A high pitch becomes a raised high when it is not followed by another high vowel and precedes an underlying word-final high.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 219"&gt;Leman, 1979, ''Cheyenne Grammar Notes'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
* /ʃéʔʃé/ ''š'''ê''''še'' 'duck'; 
* /sémón/ ''s'''ê'''mo'' 'boat'

====Low-to-high raising====
A low vowel is raised to the high position when it precedes a high and is followed by a word final high.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 219"/&gt;
* /méʃené/ ''méš'''é'''ne'' 'ticks'; 
* /návóomó/ ''návó'''ó'''mo'' 'I see him'; 
* /póesón/ ''pó'''é'''so'' 'cat'

====Low-to-mid raising====
A low vowel becomes a mid when it is followed by a word-final high but not directly preceded by a high vowel.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 219"/&gt;
* /kosán/ ''k'''ō'''sa'' 'sheep (sg.)'; 
* /heʔé/ ''h'''ē''''e'' 'woman'; 
* /éhomosé/ ''éhom'''ō'''se'' 'he is cooking'

===High pushover===
A high vowel becomes low if it comes before a high and followed by a phonetic low.&lt;ref name="Leman 1979, p. 219"/&gt;
* /néháóénáma/ ''néhâ'''oe'''n'''a'''ma'' 'we (incl) prayed'; 
* /néméhótóne/ ''némêh'''o'''t'''o'''ne'' 'we (incl) love him'; 
* /náméhósanémé/ ''námêh'''o'''sanême'' 'we (excl) love'

====Word-medial high raising====
According to Leman, "some verbal prefixes and preverbs go through the process of Word-Medial High-Raising. A high is raised if it follows a high (which is not a trigger for the High Push-Over rule) and precedes a phonetic low. One or more voiceless syllables may come between the two highs.  (A devoiced vowel in this process must be underlyingly low, not an underlyingly high vowel which has been devoiced by the High-Pitch Devoicing rule.)" &lt;ref&gt;Leman, 1979, ''Cheyenne Grammar Notes'' p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;
* /émésehe/ ''ém'''ê'''sehe'' 'he is eating'; 
* /téhnémenétó/ ''tséhn'''ê'''menéto'' 'when I sang'; 
* /násáamétohénoto/ ''nás'''â'''amétȯhênoto'' 'I didn't give him to him'

=== Tone ===
Syllables with high pitch (tone) are relatively high pitched and are marked by an acute accent, á, é, and ó. The following pairs of phrases demonstrate pitch contrasts in the Cheyenne language: 
* ''maxháeanáto'' (if I am hungry)
* ''maxháeanato'' (if you are hungry)
* ''hótame'' (dog)
* ''hotāme'' (dogs)
As noted by Donald G. Frantz, phonological rules dictate some pitch patterns, as indicated by the frequent shift of accent when suffixes are added (e.g. compare ''matšėškōme'' "raccoon"&amp;nbsp;and ''mátšėškomeo'o''&amp;nbsp;"raccoons"). In order for the rules to work, certain vowels are assigned inherent accent. For example, the word for "badger" has a permanent accent position: ''ma'háhko'e'' (sg.), ''ma'háhko'eo'o'' (pl.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Donald G.|date=1972-01-01|title=The Origin of Cheyenne Pitch Accent|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=38|issue=4|pages=223–225|doi=10.1086/465218|jstor=1264297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonnasal reflexes of Proto-Algonquian *''k'' ===
The research of linguist Paul Proulx provides an explanation for how these reflexes develop in Cheyenne: "First, *''n'' and *''h'' drop and all other consonants give glottal catch before *''k''. *''k'' then drops except in element-final position. Next, there is an increment before any remaining *''k'' not preceded by a glottal catch: a secondary ''h'' (replaced by ''š'' after ''e'') ) in words originating in the Cheyenne Proper dialect, and a vowel in those originating in the Sutaio (So'taa'e) dialect. In the latter dialect the *''k'' gives glottal catch in a word-final syllable (after the loss of some final syllables) and drops elsewhere, leaving the vowel increment. Sutaio '''k'' clusters are all reduced to glottal catch."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Grammar==
Cheyenne is a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] language with a sophisticated, [[Agglutinating language|agglutinating]] verb system contrasting a relatively simple noun structure.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 1999, p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Cheyenne verbs can stand alone in sentences, and can be translated by complete English sentences.  Aside from its verb structure, Cheyenne has several grammatical features that are typical of Algonquian languages, including an animate/inanimate [[noun class]]ification paradigm, an obviative third person and distinction of [[clusivity]] in the first person plural pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 1999, p.338-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order and Mode===
Like all Algonquian languages, Cheyenne shows a highly developed modal paradigm.&lt;ref name="Mithun 1999, p.172"&gt;Mithun 1999, p.172.&lt;/ref&gt;  Algonquianists traditionally describe the inflections of verbs in these languages as being divided into three "orders," with each order further subdivided into a series of "modes," each of which communicates some aspect of modality.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mithun 1999, p.172"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray 2016, p.243"&gt;Murray 2016, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;   The charts below provide examples of verb forms of every order in each mode, after Leman (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.24-42.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mithun (1999).&lt;ref name="Mithun 1999, p.172"/&gt;

====Independent Order====
This order governs both declarative and interrogative statements. The modes of this order are generally subdivided along lines of [[evidentiality]].&lt;ref name="Murray 2016, p.243"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|''épėhêvahesėstse''
|"he is said to be good"
|-
|Mediate
|''éhpehêvahêhoo'o''
|"long ago he was good"
|}

====Conjunct Order====
This order governs a variety of dependent clause types.&lt;ref name="Murray 2016, p.243"/&gt;  Leman (2011) characterizes this order of verbs as requiring other verbal elements in order to establish complete meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Verbs in the conjunct order are marked with a mode-specific prefix and a suffix marking person, number and animacy.&lt;ref name="Murray 2016, p.244"&gt;Murray 2016, p.244.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|}

====Imperative Order====     
The third order governs commands.  Cheyenne, in common with several other North American languages,&lt;ref name="Mithun 1999, p.172"/&gt; distinguishes two types of imperative mood, one indicating immediate action, and the other indicating delayed action.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray 2016, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Delayed

|}

===Verb Morphology===
The Cheyenne verb system is very complex and verb constructions are central to the morphosyntax of the language,&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1905, p.451.&lt;/ref&gt; to the point that even adjectives&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1905, p.457.&lt;/ref&gt; and even some nouns&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1915, p.iv.&lt;/ref&gt; are largely substantive in nature.  Verbs change according to a number of factors, such as [[Modal verb|modality]], [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]], as well as the [[animacy]] of the referent, each of these categories being indicated by the addition of an [[affix]] to the basic verb stem.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.22"&gt;Leman 2011, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Locative case|locative]] and [[adverb]]ial affixes that add further information to the larger verb construction.  This can result in very long, complex verbs that are able to stand alone as entire sentences in their own right.  
All Cheyenne verbs have a rigid templatic structure.&lt;ref name="Murray 2016, p.244"/&gt; The affixes are placed according to the following paradigm:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;person – (tense) – (directional) – (preverb) – ROOT – (medial) – final&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.22"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

====Pronominal Affixes====
Cheyenne represents the participants of an expression not as separate [[pronoun]] words but as affixes on the [[verb]]. There are three basic pronominal prefixes in Cheyenne:&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.20"&gt;Leman 2011, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*ná-{{in5|6}}first person
*né-{{in5|6}}second person
*é-{{in5|8}}third person

These three basic prefixes can be combined with various suffixes to express all of Cheyenne's pronominal distinctions. For example, the prefix ná- can be combined on a verb with the suffix -me to express the first person plural exclusive.

====Tense====
Tense in Cheyenne is expressed by the addition of a specific tense morpheme between the pronominal prefix and the verb stem.  Verbs do not always contain tense information, and an unmarked present tense verb can be used to express both past and "recent" present tense in conversation.  Thus, ''návóómo'' could mean both "I see him" and "I saw him"&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.191"&gt;Leman 2011, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the context.

Far past tense is expressed by the morpheme /-h-/, which changes to /-x-/, /-s-/, /-š-/ or /-'-/ before the -h, -t, -k and a vowel, respectively.  Thus:

*''návóómo''&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I see him
*''náhvóómo''&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I saw him

Similarly, the future tense is expressed by the morpheme /-hte/, which changes to -htse after the ná- pronominal, -stse after ne- and -tse in the third-person, with the third-person prefix dropped altogether.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.191" /&gt;

====Directional Affixes====
These prefixes address whether the action of the verb is moving "toward" or "away from" some entity, usually the speaker.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.23"&gt;Leman 2011, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

*-nėh-{{in5|8}}toward
*-nex-{{in5|8}}toward (before -h)
*-ne'-{{in5|9}}toward (before a vowel)
*-nes-{{in5|8}}toward (before -t)
*-ta-{{in5|11}}away from

====Preverbs====
Following Algonquianist terminology, Leman (2011) describes "preverbs", morphemes which add adjectival or adverbial information to the verb stem.  Multiple preverbs can be combined within one verb complex. The following list represents only a small sample.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt;

*-emóose-{{in5|10}}secretly
*-nésta-{{in5|14}}previously 
*-sé'hove-{{in5|10}}suddenly
*-áhane-{{in5|12}}extremely
*-táve-{{in5|15}}slightly
*-ohke-{{in5|15}}regularly
*-pȧháve-{{in5|11}}good, well
*-ma'xe-{{in5|13}}much, a lot
*-hé-{{in5|19}}for the purpose of
*-ha'ke-{{in5|14}}slowly, softly
*-hoove-{{in5|13}}mistakenly

====Medial Affixes====
This large group of suffixes provide information about something associated with the root, usually communicating that the action is done with or to a body part.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.23" /&gt; Thus: ''énėše'xahtse'' (he-wash-mouth) = "he gargled."&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.165"&gt;Leman 2011, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; Following is a sample of medial suffixes:&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt;

*-ahtse{{in5|14}}mouth
*-éné{{in5|17}}face
*-na'evá{{in5|12}}arm
*-vétová{{in5|12}}body 
*-he'oná{{in5|12}}hand
*-hahtá{{in5|14}}foot

Medial suffixes can also be used with nouns to create compound words or to coin entirely new words from existing morphemes, as in:

''ka'énė-hôtame'' [short-face-dog] = bulldog&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.165" /&gt;

====Final Affixes====
Cheyenne verbs take different object agreement endings depending upon the animacy of the subject and the transitivity of the verb itself.  Intransitive verbs take endings depending upon the animacy of their subject, whereas transitive verbs take endings that depend upon the animacy of their object.  All verbs can therefore be broadly categorized into one of four classes: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Instransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA) and Transitive Inanimate (TI).&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following are the most common object agreement markers for each verb class.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.23" /&gt;

*-e{{in5|16}}Animate Intransitive (AI)
*-ó{{in5|16}}Inanimate Intransitive (II)
*-o{{in5|16}}Transitive Animate (TA)
*-á/-é{{in5|12}}Transitive Inanimate  (TI)

====Negation====
Verbs are negated by the addition of the infix -sâa- immediately after the pronominal affix.  This morpheme changes to sáa- in the absence of a pronominal affix, as occurs in the imperative and in some future tense constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Nouns are classified according to animacy.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; They change according to [[grammatical number]] (singular and plural) but are not distinguished according to [[Grammatical gender|gender]]&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1905, p.456.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[definiteness]].&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1905, p.459.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obviation====
When two third persons are referred to by the same verb, the object of the sentence becomes obviated, what Algonquianists refer to as a "fourth person."&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially an "out of focus" third person.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.11"&gt;Leman 2011, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  As with possessive obviation above, the presence of a fourth person triggers morphological changes in both the verb and noun.  If the obviated entity is an animate noun, it will be marked with an obviative suffix, typically -o or -óho.  For example:

*''návóómo hetane''&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  "I saw a man"
*''he'e évôomóho hetanóho''&amp;nbsp; "The woman saw a man"

Verbs register the presence of obviated participants whether or not they are present as nouns.  These forms could be likened to a kind of [[passive voice]], although Esteban (2012) argues that since Cheyenne is a "reference-dominated language where case marking and word order are governed by the necessity to code pragmatic roles," a passive-like construction is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Esteban 2012, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is an example of typical Algonquian "person hierarchy," in which animacy and first personhood take precedence over other forms.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.22" /&gt;

====Number====
Both animate and inanimate nouns are pluralized by the addition of suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1905, p.454.&lt;/ref&gt; These suffixes are irregular and can change slightly according to a complex system of phonological rules.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

*-(h)o, -(n)é{{in5|6}}Inanimate plural
*-(n)ȯtse{{in5|11}}Animate plural

====Possession====
Possession is denoted by a special set of pronominal suffixes.  Following is a list of the most common possession prefixes, although rarely some words take different prefixes.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petter 1905, p.455.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*na-{{in5|6}}first person
*ne-{{in5|6}}second person
*he-{{in5|8}}third person

Generally, possessive prefixes take a low pitch on the following vowel.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.20"/&gt;

When a third person animate noun is possessed by another third person, the noun becomes [[Obviative|obviated]] and takes a different form.  Much of the time, this obviated form is identical to the noun's regular plural form,&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.11"/&gt; with only a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Leman 2011, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; This introduces ambiguity in that it is not always possible to tell whether an obviated noun is singular or plural.&lt;ref name="Leman 2011, p.11"/&gt;

==Historical development==
[[File:Cheyennecatechism page 9.jpg|thumb|Cheyenne catechism page 9]]
Like all the Algonquian languages, Cheyenne developed from a reconstructed ancestor referred to as [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] (often abbreviated "PA"). The sound changes on the road from PA to modern Cheyenne are complex, as exhibited by the development of the PA word ''*erenyiwa'' "man" into Cheyenne ''hetane'':

*First, the PA suffix ''-wa'' drops (''*erenyi'')
*The [[geminate]] vowel sequence ''-yi-'' simplifies to /i/ ([[semivowel]]s were phonemically vowels in PA; when PA */i/ or */o/ appeared before another vowel, it became non-syllabic) (''*ereni'')
*PA */r/ changes to /t/ (''*eteni'')
*/h/ is added before word-initial vowels (''*heteni'')
*Due to a vowel chain-shift, the vowels in the word wind up as /e/, /a/ and /e/ (PA */e/ sometimes corresponds to Cheyenne /e/ and sometimes to Cheyenne /a/; PA */i/ almost always corresponds to Cheyenne /e/, however) (''hetane'').
PA *''θk'' has the Sutaio reflex ' in ''e-nete'e'' "she tells lies", but the Cheyenne-Proper reflex '''k'' in ''hetone'ke'' "tree-bark". According to linguist Paul Proulx, this gave off the appearance that "speakers of both Cheyenne dialects—perhaps mixed bands—were involved in the Arapaho contact that led to this unusual reflex of PA *k.".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proulx|first=Paul|date=1982-01-01|title=Proto-Algonquian *k in Cheyenne|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=48|issue=4|pages=467–471|doi=10.1086/465756|jstor=1264849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicon==
Some Cheyenne words (with the Proto-Algonquian reconstructions where known):
*''[[wikt:ame|ame]]'' "grease" (from PA ''*pemyi'')
*''[[wikt:he'e|he'e]]'' "his liver" (from PA ''*weθkweni'')
*''[[wikt:hē'e|hē'e]]'' "woman" (from PA ''**eθkwe·wa'')
*''[[wikt:hetane|hetane]]'' "man" (from PA ''*erenyiwa'')
*''[[wikt:matana|matana]]'' "milk" (from PA ''*meθenyi'')

Early work was done on the Cheyenne language by Rodolphe Charles Petter, a [[Mennonite]] missionary based in [[Lame Deer, Montana]], from 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/petter_rodolphe_charles_1865_1947/?searchterm=Lame%20Deer "Petter, Rodolphe Charles (1865-1947)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604011412/http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/petter_rodolphe_charles_1865_1947/?searchterm=Lame%20Deer |date=June 4, 2011 }} Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online, accessed September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Petter published a mammoth dictionary of Cheyenne in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015025866867 "Petter, 1915, English-Cheyenne Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the word "center", it is necessary to define a distance between two strings. Usually, this problem is studied with the [[Hamming distance]] in mind.

==Formal definition==
More formally, given ''n'' length-''m'' strings ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the closest string problem seeks for a new length-''m'' string ''s'' such that ''d''(''s'',''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''k'' for all ''i'', where ''d'' denotes the [[Hamming distance]], and where ''k'' is as small as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=More Efficient Algorithms for Closest String and Substring Problems| authors=Bin Ma and Xiaming Sun| url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~bma/CS873/recomb2008.pdf| year=2008| booktitle=Proc. 12th Ann. Int. Conf. on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB)| publisher=Springer |series= [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] |volume=4955| pages= 396-409 | doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-78839-3_33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[decision problem]] version of the closest string problem, which is [[NP-complete]], instead takes ''k'' as another input and questions whether there is a string within Hamming distance ''k'' of all the input strings.&lt;ref name="llmwz"/&gt;

The closest string problem can be seen as an instance of the [[1-center problem]] in which the distances between elements are measured using Hamming distance.

==Motivation==
In [[bioinformatics]], the closest string problem is an intensively studied facet of the problem of finding signals in [[DNA]].

==Simplifications and data reductions==
Instances of closest string may contain information that is not essential to the problem. In some sense, the usual input of closest string contains information, that does not contribute to the hardness of the problem. For example, if some strings contain the character ''a'', but none contains the character ''z'', replacing all ''a''s with ''z''s  would yield an essentially equivalent instance, that is: from a solution of the modified instance, the original solution can be restored, and vice versa.

===Normalizing the input===
When all input strings that share the same length are written on top of each other, they form a matrix. Certain row types have essentially the same implications to the solution. For example, replacing a column with entries (''a'', ''a'', ''b'') with another column (''x'', ''x'', ''y'') might lead to a different solution string, but cannot affect solvability, because both columns express the same structure, viz. the first two entries being equal, but different from the third one. 

An input instance can be ''normalized'' by replacing, in each column, the character that occurs the most often with ''a'', the character that occurs the second most often with ''b'', and so forth. Given a solution to the normalized instance, the original instance can be found by remapping the characters of the solution to its original version in every column.

The order of the columns does not contribute to the hardness of the problem. That means, if we permute all input strings according to a certain permutation π and obtain a solution string ''s'' to that modified instance, then π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''s'') will be a solution to the original instance.

====Example====
[[File:Closest-string problem example svg.svg|thumb|Search space for the normalized problem. The center string ''aaaa'' and ''aaab'' leads to Hamming distances 1,2,1 and 2,1,1, respectively.]]
Given an instance with three input strings ''uvwx'', ''xuwv'', and ''xvwu''. This could be written as a matrix like this:

{|
|-
| ''u'' || ''v'' || ''w'' || ''x''
|-
| ''x'' || ''u'' || ''w'' || ''v''
|-
| ''x'' || ''v'' || ''w'' || ''u''
|}

The first column has the values (''u'', ''x'', ''x''). As ''x'' is the character that appears the most often, we replace it by ''a'', and we replace ''u'', the second most often character, by ''b'', obtaining the new first column (''b'', ''a'', ''a''). The second column has the values (''v'', ''u'', ''v''). As for the first column, ''v'' is replaced by ''a'' and ''u'' is replaced by ''b'', obtaining the new second column (''a'', ''b'', ''a''). Doing the same with all columns gives the normalized instance

{|
|-
| ''b'' || ''a'' || ''a'' || ''a''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b'' || ''a'' || ''b''
|-
| ''a'' || ''a'' || ''a'' || ''c''
|}

====Data reduction obtained from normalization====
Normalizing the input reduces the alphabet size to at most the number of input strings. This can be useful for algorithms whose running times depend on the alphabet size.

==Approximability==
Li et al. evolved a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| authors=M. Li, B. Ma, and L. Wang. |title=On the Closest String and Substring Problems.|journal= [[Journal of the ACM]] | volume=49|issue=2|pages=157-171|year=2002|url=http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~lwang/research/jacm02.pdf|doi=10.1145/506147.506150|arxiv=cs/0002012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is practically unusable because of the large hidden constants.

==Fixed-parameter tractability==
Closest String can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(kL+kd\cdot d^d)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k'' is the number of input strings, ''L'' is the length of all strings and ''d'' is the desired maximum distance from the solution string to any input string.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Fixed-Parameter Algorithms for Closest String and Related Problems|authors=Jens Gramm, Rolf Niedermeier, and Peter Rossmanith|journal=[[Algorithmica]] |year=2003| volume=37|pages=25–42| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.61.736|doi=10.1007/s00453-003-1028-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations to other problems==
Closest string is a special case of the more general [[closest substring]] problem, which is strictly more difficult. While closest string turns out to be [[fixed-parameter tractable]] in a number of ways, closest substring is [[Parameterized complexity#W hierarchy|W[1]-hard]] with regard to these parameters.

'''Cueva''' is a poorly attested and often [[unclassified languages|misclassified]] extinct [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous language]] of [[Panama]]. The [[Cueva people]] were [[Genocide|exterminated]] between 1510 and 1535 during Spanish colonization. During the 17th and 18th centuries the [[Kuna people|Kuna]] repopulated the Cueva area.

==Classification==
Loukotka (1968) mistakenly identified a [[Kuna language|Kuna]] vocabulary from the Darién as Cueva, leading to confusion of Cueva with Kuna in subsequent literature (e.g. Greenberg 1987, Whitehead 1999, ''Ethnologue'' 2009), with some authors reporting that Cueva was a dialect of or ancestral to the Kuna language (Adelaar &amp; Muysken 2004:62). The Kuna language and culture are very different from the Cueva.

Loewen (1963) and Constenla Umaña &amp; Margery Peña (1991) have suggested a connection between Cueva and the [[Chocoan]] family.

[[File:Cursive.svg|right|thumb|200px|An example of D'Nealian [[cursive]] writing]]
'''D'Nealian''', sometimes misspelled '''Denealian''', is a style of writing and [[teaching]] [[cursive]] and [[manuscript]] ("print" and "block") [[handwriting]] for [[English language|English]]. It derived from the [[Palmer Method]] and was designed to ease the learning of manuscript and cursive handwriting. D'Nealian was developed by [[Donald Thurber]] while teaching in a [[primary school]], and was first introduced in 1978. The name of the script comes from Thurber's first name contracted with his middle name ("Neal").

The system was designed as a method to alleviate the problems with teaching children the traditional script method and the subsequent difficulty transitioning to [[cursive]] writing. D'Nealian manuscript form has many similarities to the cursive version. In theory, it is easier for children to learn and acquire basic handwriting skills using this method than traditional cursive writing.&lt;ref name=eduweek&gt;{{cite news|last1=Viadero|first1=Debra|title=D'Nealian Handwriting Method Abandons 'Ball-and-Stick' Approach|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1993/10/06/05write.h13.html|accessdate=23 January 2018|agency=Education Week|date=6 October  1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The D'Nealian is a style of writing and [[teaching]] [[cursive]] and print (block) [[handwriting]] for [[English language|English]], and is a derivative of the [[Palmer Method]]. It was designed to ease the learning of cursive and print handwriting.

== History ==
D'Nealian was developed by [[Donald Thurber]], who developed the system while teaching in a [[primary school]], and was first introduced in 1978. The name of the script comes from Donald's first name contracted with his middle name ("Neal").

The system was designed as a method to alleviate the problems with teaching children the standard [[Zaner-Bloser]] script method and the subsequent difficulty transitioning to [[cursive]] writing. D'Nealian manuscript form has many similarities to the cursive version. In theory, it is easier for children to learn and acquire basic handwriting skills using this method than traditional cursive writing.&lt;ref name="eduweek"/&gt;

==Criticism==
D'Nealian has drawn criticism in many locations, as the addition of so-called "monkey tails"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcnattlearningcenter.com/ph_04.html#What%20about%20monkey%20tails%20for%20transition?|title=Peterson Handwriting Q &amp; A|author=|date=|work=mcnattlearningcenter.com|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manuscript ("print-style" writing) effectively adds a "third step" to how children are instructed to write. Moreover, a common issue is that D'Nealian is taught extremely early, to [[first grade|first]] and [[second grade]] students, many of whom are still learning the rudiments of print-style writing. At times, some school districts have abruptly changed their teaching of handwriting, possibly causing difficulties for students who must then adapt to a different style.

A 1993 research review by Steve Graham concludes that "there is no credible evidence" that D'Nealian makes a difference in children's handwriting.  He also states that D'Nealian creates practical problems for teachers (who must themselves learn the system and defend it to parents) and that it requires many young children to unlearn writing forms that they have already developed before formal instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheehan|first1=Robert J.|last2=Graham|first2=Steve|date=1993|title=Are slanted manuscript alphabets superior to the traditional manuscript alphabet?|journal=Childhood Education|volume=70|issue=2|pp=91–95|doi=10.1080/00094056.1993.10521001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daur Zantaria''' ({{lang-ab|Даур Занҭариа}}) (25 May 1953 – 7 August 2001) was a writer and journalist from [[Abkhazia]], publishing both in [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages.

==Early life and education==
Zantaria was born on 25 May 1953 in the village of [[Tamysh]], [[Ochamchira District]]. He graduated with a gold medal from Tamysh high school in 1971 and with honours from the philological faculty of the [[Abkhazian State University|Sukhum State Pedagogical Institute]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=mkra685&gt;{{cite web|title=Зантария Даур Бадзович – прозаик, поэт, публицист|url=http://mkra.org/vidnye-deyateli/?ELEMENT_ID=685|website=Ministry for Culture of Abkhazia|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Zantaria published his first short story ''Kuasta'' in the magazine ''[[Alashara]]'' in 1976. In the following years, his short stories and poems appeared in ''Alashara'', the children's magazine ''[[Amtsabz]]'', the newspaper ''[[Apsny Kapsh]]'' and the almanac ''[[Literary Abkhazia]]''. In 1984, Zantaria entered the [[Union of Soviet Writers]]. That same year, he participated in a workshop for script writers in [[Moscow]] by [[Valentin Yezhov]] and wrote the script for the film ''Souvenir'', released in 1985.&lt;ref name=mkra685/&gt;

On 19 January 1991, Zantaria presided over the founding congress of Abkhazia's first post-Soviet political party [[Democratic Party of Abkhazia]]. He had conceived of the idea of founding the party along with historian [[Guram Gumba]] and Russian poet [[Aleksandr Bardodym]] during a visit by the latter in 1990. The party was not revived following the [[war in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|1992–1993 war with Georgia]].&lt;ref name=ekho27336432&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharia|first1=Vitali|title="Демократическая Абхазия": вчера, сегодня, завтра|url=http://www.ekhokavkaza.com/content/article/27336432.html|accessdate=14 November 2015|agency=[[Echo of the Caucasus]]|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Zantaria became a member of the [[Union of Abkhazian Writers]] and published stories, essays and articles for ''[[Novy Mir]]'', ''[[Druzhba Narodov]]'', ''[[Znamya]]'', ''[[Expert (magazine)|Expert]]'', ''[[Obshchey Gazeta]]'', as well as a number of novels and collections of short stories and poems.&lt;ref name=mkra685/&gt;

==Death==
Zantaria died on 7 August 2001. He lies buried in Tamysh.&lt;ref name=mkra685/&gt;

What constitutes a '''definition of fascism''' and fascist governments has been a complicated and highly disputed subject concerning the exact nature of [[fascism]] and its core tenets debated amongst historians, political scientists, and other scholars since [[Benito Mussolini]] first used the term in 1915.

A significant number of scholars agree that a "fascist regime" is foremost an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[form of government]], although not all authoritarian regimes are [[Fascist (epithet)|fascist]]. Authoritarianism is thus a defining characteristic, but most scholars will say that more distinguishing traits are needed to make an authoritarian regime fascist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laqueur|first1=Walter|title=Fascism : past, present, future|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195117936|edition= Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eatwell|first1=Roger|title=Fascism : a history|date=1996|publisher=Allen Lane|location=New York|isbn=978-0713991475|edition= 1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=The nature of fascism|date=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0312071325|edition= 1st publ. in the USA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=Eugen|title=Varieties of fascism : doctrines of revolution in the twentieth century|date=1964|publisher=Van Nostrand|location=New York|isbn=978-0898744446|edition= Reprint|ref=Weber1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Stanley G.|title=A history of fascism, 1914-45|date=1995|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-299-14874-4|ref=Payne1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fritzsche1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fritzsche|first1=Peter|title=Rehearsals for fascism : populism and political mobilization in Weimar Germany|date=1990|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Similarly, ''fascism'' as an [[ideology]] is also hard to define. Originally, it referred to a [[totalitarian]] political movement linked with [[corporatism]] which existed in [[Italy]] from 1922 to 1943 under the leadership of [[Benito Mussolini]]. Many scholars use the word "fascism" without capitalization in a more general sense, to refer to an ideology (or group of ideologies) which was influential in many countries at many different times. For this purpose, they have sought to identify what [[Roger Griffin]] calls a "fascist minimum"—that is, the minimum conditions that a certain political movement must meet in order to be considered "fascist".&lt;ref name="Griffin1991" /&gt; According to most scholars of fascism, there are both left and right influences on fascism as a social movement, and fascism, especially once in power, has historically attacked both left, moderate right wing and the opposition in the radical right in order to maintain power.

Scholars have inspected the [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]], millennial and [[millenarianism]] aspects of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;D.

==By fascist thinkers and movements==

===Benito Mussolini===
[[Benito Mussolini]], who was the first to use the term for his political party in 1915, described fascism in ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm|title=Mussolini - THE DOCTRINE OF FASCISM|website=www.worldfuturefund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, this does not mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right', a Fascist century. If the 19th century was the century of the individual (liberalism implies individualism) we are free to believe that this is the 'collective' century, and therefore the century of the State.}}

{{Quotation|The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.}}

{{Quotation|...everything in the state, nothing against the State, nothing outside the state.}}

{{Quotation|Fascism is a religious conception in which man is seen in his immanent relationship with a superior law and with an objective Will that transcends the particular individual and raises him to conscious membership of a spiritual society. Whoever has seen in the religious politics of the Fascist regime nothing but mere opportunism has not understood that Fascism besides being a system of government is also, and above all, a system of thought.}}

===Sergio Panunzio===
[[Sergio Panunzio]], a former [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] who was associated with [[Benito Mussolini]], and who later became a leading [[fascism|fascist]] theorist, stated that the spirit of fascism was [[National Syndicalism]] as formulated by Mussolini before the [[battle of Vittorio Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sergio Panunzio|title=La méta del Fascismo|newspaper=[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]|date=22 June 1924}} Quote: "L'anima del Fascismo è, ricordiamolo sempre, il Sindacalismo Nazionale, la cui formula Mussolini lanciò prima del 1918, prima di Vittorio Veneto "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Maurras===
[[Charles Maurras]], leader of [[Action Française]], a [[far-right politics|far-right]] political movement, praised Italian fascism, although he argued that it was an incomplete form of his ideal [[integral nationalism]].&lt;ref name="David Carroll 1998. p. 90"&gt;David Carroll. ''French Literary Fascism: Nationalism, Anti-Semitism, and the Ideology of Culture''. (Princeton University Press, 1998) p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What in fact is Fascism? A socialism emancipated from democracy. A trade unionism free of the chains of the class struggle had imposed on Italian labour. A methodical and successful will to bring together in a same fascio all the human factors of national production ... A determination to approach, to threat, to resolve the worker question in itself ... and to unite unions in corporations, to coordinate them, to incorporate the proletariat into the hereditary and traditional activities of the historical State of the Fatherland.&lt;ref name="David Carroll 1998. p. 90"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==By scholars==

===Umberto Eco===
In his 1995 essay "Eternal Fascism", cultural theorist [[Umberto Eco]] lists fourteen general properties of fascist ideology.&lt;ref name="Eco1995"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/ Umberto Eco: Eternal Fascism, ''The New York Review of Books'', June 22, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that it is not possible to organise these into a coherent system, but that "it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it". He uses the term "Ur-fascism" as a generic description of different historical forms of fascism. The fourteen properties are as follows:

#"The Cult of Tradition", characterized by cultural [[syncretism]], even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by Tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.
#"The Rejection of [[modernism]]", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.
#"The Cult of Action for Action's Sake", which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with [[anti-intellectualism]] and [[irrationalism]], and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.
#"Disagreement Is Treason" – Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.
#"Fear of Difference", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.
#"Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.
#"Obsession with a [[Conspiracy theory|Plot]]" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to [[xenophobia]] with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society (such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and well-doings; see also [[anti-Semitism]]). Eco also cites [[Pat Robertson]]'s book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]'' as a prominent example of a plot obsession.
#Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as "at the same time too strong and too weak." On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.
#"Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy" because "[[Perpetual war#In socioeconomics and politics|Life is Permanent Warfare]]" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles treaty]] to NOT build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.
#"Contempt for the Weak", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic ''popular elitism'', in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force. 
#"Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero", which leads to the embrace of a ''cult of death''. As Eco observes, "[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death."
#"Machismo", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold "both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality."
#"Selective Populism" – The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of "no longer represent[ing] the Voice of the People."
#"[[Newspeak]]" – Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.

===Emilio Gentile===
Italian historian of fascism [[Emilio Gentile]] described fascism in 1996 as the "sacralization of politics" through totalitarian methods&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Gentile, The Sacralization of Politics in Fascist Italy, translated by Keith Botsford (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and argued the following ten constituent elements:&lt;ref name="paynenov"&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title=A History of Fascism, 1914–1945 |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-299-14874-4 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# a mass movement with multiclass membership in which prevail, among the leaders and the militants, the middle sectors, in large part new to political activity, organized as a party militia, that bases its identity not on social hierarchy or class origin but on a sense of comradeship, believes itself invested with a mission of national regeneration, considers itself in a state of war against political adversaries and aims at conquering a monopoly of political power by using terror, parliamentary politics, and deals with leading groups, to create a new regime that destroys parliamentary democracy;
# an 'anti-ideological' and pragmatic ideology that proclaims itself antimaterialist, anti-individualist, antiliberal, antidemocratic, anti-Marxist, is populist and [[Anticapitalism|anticapitalist]] in tendency, expresses itself aesthetically more than theoretically by means of a new political style and by myths, rites, and symbols as a lay religion designed to acculturate, socialize, and integrate the faith of the masses with the goal of creating a 'new man';
# a culture founded on mystical thought and the tragic and activist sense of life conceived of as the manifestation of the will to power, on the myth of youth as artificer of history, and on the exaltation of the militarization of politics as the model of life and collective activity;
# a totalitarian conception of the primacy of politics, conceived of as an integrating experience to carry out the fusion of the individual and the masses in the organic and mystical unity of the nation as an ethnic and moral community, adopting measures of discrimination and persecution against those considered to be outside this community either as enemies of the regime or members of races considered to be inferior or otherwise dangerous for the integrity of the nation;
# a civil ethic founded on total dedication to the national community, on discipline, virility, comradeship, and the warrior spirit;
# a single state party that has the task of providing for the armed defense of the regime, selecting its directing cadres, and organizing the masses within the state in a process of permanent mobilization of emotion and faith;
# a police apparatus that prevents, controls, and represses dissidence and opposition, including through the use of organized terror;
# a political system organized by hierarchy of functions named from the top and crowned by the figure of the 'leader,' invested with a sacred charisma, who commands, directs, and coordinates the activities of the party and the regime;
# corporative organization of the economy that suppresses trade union liberty, broadens the sphere of state intervention, and seeks to achieve, by principles of technocracy and solidarity, the collaboration of the 'productive sectors' under control of the regime, to achieve its goals of power, yet preserving private property and class divisions;
# a foreign policy inspired by the myth of national power and greatness, with the goal of imperialist expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio in Payne, Stanley ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945'' (1995), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===A. James Gregor===
A professor of political science emeritus at the U.C. Berkeley, [[A. James Gregor]], contends that fascism was a “variant of [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] syndicalism” which also included components of neo-idealism and elitist socialism.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''The Ideology of Fascism: The Rationale of Totalitarianism'', New York, NY, The Free Press, 1969, p. 317, &lt;/ref&gt; Gregor took the position that Stalinism and Fascist totalitarianism would have been impossible without the “transmogrified Marxism, that infilled both.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Marxism, Fascism &amp; Totalitarianism: Chapters in the Intellectual History of Radicalism'', Stanford University Press, 2009, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gregor:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fascism was a variant of classical Marxism, a belief system that pressed some themes argued by both Marx and Engels until they found expression in the form of ‘national syndicalism’ that was to animate the first Fascism.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism'', Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, 1979,  p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, he believes that post-Maoist China displays many fascist traits. He has denied that fascism is "right-wing extremism."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, ''The Search for Neofascism: The Use and Abuse of Social Science'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Griffin===
Historian and political scientist [[Roger Griffin]]'s definition of fascism focuses on the populist fascist rhetoric that argues for a "re-birth" of a conflated [[nation]] and ethnic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.4135/9781452234168.n104 | title=Fascism | journal=Encyclopedia of Modern Political Thought| year=2013 | isbn=9780872899100 | last1=Claeys | first1=Gregory }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Griffin
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[F]ascism is best defined as a [[Revolutionary Nationalism | revolutionary form of nationalism]], one that sets out to be a political, social and ethical revolution, welding the ‘people’ into a dynamic national community under new elites infused with heroic values. The core myth that inspires this project is that only a populist, trans-class movement of purifying, cathartic national rebirth (palingenesis) can stem the tide of decadence&lt;ref name=Griffin1991 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Griffin writes that a broad scholarly consensus developed in English-speaking social sciences during the 1990s, around the following definition of fascism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Fascism is] a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-[[Liberalism|liberal]], and in the last analysis, anti-[[conservative]] nationalism. As such it is an ideology deeply bound up with modernization and modernity, one which has assumed a considerable variety of external forms to adapt itself to the particular historical and national context in which it appears, and has drawn a wide range of cultural and intellectual currents, both left and right, anti-modern and pro-modern, to articulate itself as a body of ideas, slogans, and doctrine. In the inter-war period it manifested itself primarily in the form of an elite-led "armed party" which attempted, mostly unsuccessfully, to generate a populist mass movement through a liturgical style of politics and a programme of radical policies which promised to overcome a threat posed by international socialism, to end the degeneration affecting the nation under liberalism, and to bring about a radical renewal of its social, political and cultural life as part of what was widely imagined to be the new era being inaugurated in Western civilization. The core mobilizing myth of fascism which conditions its ideology, propaganda, style of politics and actions is the vision of the nation's imminent rebirth from decadence.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, ''[http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/history/staff/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf The palingenetic core of generic fascist ideology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910055552/http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/history/staff/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}'', Chapter published in Alessandro Campi (ed.), ''Che cos'è il fascismo?'' Interpretazioni e prospettive di ricerche, Ideazione editrice, Roma, 2003, pp. 97-122.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Griffin argues that the above definition can be condensed into one sentence: "Fascism is a political [[ideology]] whose [[myth]]ic core in its various [[permutation]]s is a [[palingenetic]] form of [[populism|populist]] ultra-[[nationalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, ''[http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf The palingenetic core of generic fascist ideology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120193621/http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf |date=2011-11-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; The word "palingenetic" in this case refers to notions of national rebirth.

===F.A. Hayek===
Classical liberal economist and philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek]], in his 1944 book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', argued that socialism and national socialism had similar intellectual roots. “Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion.”
He cited the following exemplary cases of socialist scholars: [[Werner Sombart]] was hailed as a Marxist and persecuted for his beliefs, but when he later rejected internationalism and pacifism in favor of German militarism and nationalism, he became an intellectual force for national socialism early on. [[Johann Plenge]], another early national socialist intellectual, saw national socialism as a German adaptation of socialism. [[Paul Lensch]] was a socialist politician in the Reichstag who argued for central control of the economy and for militarism that became features of national socialism. He wrote that Western or English liberalism, which includes the ideas of freedom, community, and equality and rule by parliamentary democracy, was anathema in a true Germany, where power should belong to the whole, everyone is given his place, and one either obeys or commands. [[Oswald Spengler]] in his early writings advocated many of the ideas shared by German socialists at this time. [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]], a patron saint of national socialism, per Hayek, claimed that World War I was a war between liberalism and socialism and that socialism lost. Like Plenge and Lensch, he saw national socialism as socialism adapted to the German character and undefiled by Western ideas of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, FA. The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents, Bruce Caldwell, ed., New York 2008, Taylor and Francis, pp 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimitri Kitsikis===
[[Dimitri Kitsikis]], a Greek Turkologist and Sinologist, proposed a model of fascism in 1998 featuring 13 categories by which fascist ideologies, movements and establishments can be analyzed and contrasted with others:&lt;ref&gt;Kitsikis, Dimitri, ''Ἡ τρίτη ἰδεολογία καὶ ἡ Ὀρθοδοξία'', (Athens, Hestia Books, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The idea of [[Social Class|class]] and the importance of [[agrarianism]] 
# Private ownership, the circulation of money, the regulation of the economy by the state, the idea of ethnic [[bourgeois]] class, economic [[self-sufficiency]]
# The nation and the difference between nation and state
# The attitude toward [[democracy]] and [[political parties]]
# The importance of political heroes, i.e. the [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leader]]
# The attitude toward [[Tradition]]
# The attitude toward the [[individual]] and [[society]]
# The attitude toward [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and [[hierarchy]]
# The attitude toward [[women]]
# The attitude toward [[religion]]
# The attitude toward [[rationalism]]
# The attitude toward [[intellectualism]] and [[elitism]]
# The attitude toward the [[Third World]]{{Clarify|reason=this is a list of parameters, not an evaluation of what stance fascism takes|date=January 2012}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using this model, Kitsikis argued that [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], philosopher and father of the [[French Revolution]], laid the foundations of French Fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsikis, Dimitri, ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et les origines françaises du fascisme'' (Nantes, Ars Magna Editions, (Les Documents), 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Kitsikis also applied the model to the Sendero Luminoso ([[Shining Path]]), a Peruvian communist party which claims to follow [[Maoism]]. The results of his analysis showed that the party's ideology satisfies all the criteria of nine categories (nine points), some of the criteria of three categories (1.5 points) and none of the criteria of one category (0 points). A total score of 10.5 out of a possible 13 shows that Shining Path actually follows a fascist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsikis, Dimitri, ''Ἡ τρίτη ἰδεολογία καὶ ἡ Ὀρθοδοξία'', (Athens, Hestia Books, 1998), pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ernst Nolte===
[[Ernst Nolte]], a German historian and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] philosopher, defined fascism in 1965 as a [[Reactionary|reaction]] against other political movements, especially [[Marxism]]: "Fascism is anti-Marxism which seeks to destroy the enemy by the evolvement of a radically opposed and yet related ideology and by the use of almost identical and yet typically modified methods, always, however, within the unyielding framework of national self-assertion and autonomy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=Three Faces of Fascism: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1965|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|title-link=Three Faces of Fascism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kevin Passmore===
Kevin Passmore, a history lecturer at [[Cardiff University]], defines fascism in his 2002 book ''Fascism: A Very Short Introduction''. His definition is directly descended from the view put forth by [[Ernesto Laclau]]:&lt;ref name="Passmore"&gt;Passmore, Kevin,''Fascism: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fascism is a set of ideologies and practices that seeks to place the nation, defined in exclusive biological, cultural, and/or historical terms, above all other sources of loyalty, and to create a mobilized national community. Fascist nationalism is reactionary in that it entails [[implacable hostility]] to socialism and feminism, for they are seen as prioritizing class or gender rather than nation. This is why fascism is a movement of the ''extreme'' right. Fascism is also a movement of the ''radical'' right because the defeat of socialism and feminism and the creation of the mobilized nation are held to depend upon the advent to power of a new elite acting in the name of the people, headed by a charismatic leader, and embodied in a mass, militarized party. Fascists are pushed towards conservatism by common hatred of socialism and feminism, but are prepared to override conservative interests - family, property, religion, the universities, the civil service - where the interests of the nation are considered to require it. Fascist radicalism also derives from a desire to assuage discontent by accepting specific demands of the labour and women's movements, so long as these demands accord with the national priority. Fascists seek to ensure the harmonization of workers' and women's interests with those of the nation by mobilizing them within special sections of the party and/or within a corporate system. Access to these organizations and to the benefits they confer upon members depends on the individual's national, political, and/or racial characteristics. All aspects of fascist policy are suffused with ultranationalism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Robert Paxton===
[[Robert Paxton]], a professor emeritus at [[Columbia University]], defines fascism in his 2004 book ''The Anatomy of Fascism'' as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.&lt;ref name="Paxton2004" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Stanley G. Payne===
Historian of fascism [[Stanley G. Payne]] created a lengthy list of characteristics to identify fascism in 1995:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Payne, Stanley |title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1980 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paynenov2"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1995. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* A. Ideology and Goals:
** Espousal of an idealist, vitalist, and voluntaristic philosophy, normally involving the attempt to realize a new modern, self-determined, and secular culture
** Creation of a new nationalist authoritarian state not based on traditional principles or models
** Organization of a new highly regulated, multiclass, integrated national economic structure, whether called national corporatist, national socialist, or national syndicalist
** Positive evaluation and use of, or willingness to use violence and war
** The goal of empire, expansion, or a radical change in the nation's relationship with other powers
* B. The Fascist Negations:
** Antiliberalism
** Anticommunism
** Anticonservatism (though with the understanding that fascist groups were willing to undertake temporary alliances with other sectors, more commonly with the right)
* C. Style and Organization:
** Attempted mass mobilization with militarization of political relationships and style and with the goal of a mass single party militia
** Emphasis on aesthetic structure of meetings, symbols, and political liturgy, stressing emotional and mystical aspects
** Extreme stress on the masculine principle and male dominance, while espousing a strongly organic view of society
** Exaltation of youth above other phases of life, emphasizing the conflict of the generations, at least in effecting the initial political transformation
** Specific tendency toward an authoritarian, charismatic, personal style of command, whether or not the command is to some degree initially elective&lt;ref name="paynenov2" /&gt;

One of the world's leading experts on fascism, [[Zeev Sternhell]], describes Fascism as a reaction against modernity and a backlash against the changes it had caused to society, as a "rejection of the prevailing systems: liberalism and Marxism, positivism and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Sternhell says that part of what made Fascism unique was that it wanted to retain the benefits of progress and modernism while rejecting the values and social changes that had come with it; Fascism embraced liberal market-based economics and the violent revolutionary rhetoric of Marxism, but rejected their philosophical principles.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===John Weiss===
[[John Weiss (historian)|John Weiss]], a [[Wayne State University]] history professor, described fascist ideas in his 1967 book, ''The Fascist Tradition: Radical Right-Wing Extremism in Modern Europe'': [[Organicism|organicist]] conceptions of community, philosophical [[idealism]], idealization of "[[masculinity|manly]]" (usually peasant or village) virtues, resentment of mass [[democracy]], [[Elitism|elitist]] conceptions of political and social leadership, [[racism]] (and usually [[anti-Semitism]]), [[militarism]] and [[Imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;John Weiss, ''"The Fascist Tradition: Radical Right-Wing Extremism in Modern Europe"'', Harper &amp; Row, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Lukacs===
[[John Lukacs]], Hungarian-American historian and Holocaust survivor, argues in ''the Hitler of History'' that there is no such thing as generic fascism, claiming that National Socialism and Italian Fascism were more different than similar and that, alongside communism, they were ultimately radical forms of populism.&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'' New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==By Marxists==
[[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that fascism represents the last attempt of a [[ruling class]] (specifically, the capitalist [[bourgeoisie]]) to preserve its grip on power in the face of an imminent [[proletarian revolution]]. Fascist movements are not necessarily ''created'' by the ruling class, but they can only gain political power with the help of that class and with funding from big business. Once in power, the fascists serve the interests of their benefactors.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1923/08/fascism.htm|title=Clara Zetkin: Fascism (August 1923)|first=Clara|last=Zetkin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Georgi Dimitrov, "The Fascist Offensive and the Tasks of the Communist International," Main Report delivered at the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International -  "The class character of fascism;" collected in ''VII Congress of the Communist International: Abridged Stenographic Report of Proceedings.'' Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clara Zetkin===
An early study of fascism was written by [[Clara Zetkin]] for the Third Plenum in 1923: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fascism is the concentrated expression of the general offensive undertaken by the world bourgeoisie against the proletariat.... fascism [is] an expression of the decay and disintegration of the capitalist economy and as a symptom of the bourgeois state’s dissolution. We can combat fascism only if we grasp that it rouses and sweeps along broad social masses who have lost the earlier security of their existence and with it, often, their belief in social order.... It will be much easier for us to defeat Fascism if we clearly and distinctly study its nature. Hitherto there have been extremely vague ideas upon this subject not only among the large masses of the workers, but even among the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat and the Communists.... The Fascist leaders are not a small and exclusive caste; they extend deeply into wide elements of the population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Georgi Dimitrov===
[[Georgi Dimitrov]], Bulgarian [[Communist]], was a theorist of [[capitalism]] who expanded [[Lenin]]'s ideas and the work of [[Clara Zetkin]].

Delivering an official report to the [[7th World Congress of the Comintern|7th World Congress]] of the [[Comintern|Communist Third International]] in August 1935, [[Communist Party of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Communist]] leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] cited the definition of fascism formulated with the help of [[Clara Zetkin]] at the Third Plenum as "the open, [[terrorism|terrorist]] dictatorship of the most [[reactionary]], most [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]], and most [[imperialism|imperialist]] elements of [[finance capitalism|finance capital]]".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

According to Dimitrov:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fascism is not a form of state power "standing above both classes -- the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," as Otto Bauer, for instance, has asserted. It is not "the revolt of the petty bourgeoisie which has captured the machinery of the state," as the British Socialist Brailsford declares. No, fascism is not a power standing above class, nor government of the petty bourgeoisie or the lumpen-proletariat over finance capital. Fascism is the power of finance capital itself. It is the organization of terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia. In foreign policy, fascism is jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations.... The development of fascism, and the fascist dictatorship itself, assume different forms in different countries, according to historical, social and economic conditions and to the national peculiarities, and the international position of the given country."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Leon Trotsky===

In the posthumously published 1944 tract, ''Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It,'' Communist opposition leader [[Leon Trotsky]] noted: "The historic function of fascism is to smash the [[working class]], destroy its organizations, and stifle political liberties when the capitalists find themselves unable to govern and dominate with the help of democratic machinery."&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm ''Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It.''] New York: Pioneer Publishers, 1944; pg. ???.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amadeo Bordiga]] argued that fascism is merely another form of bourgeois rule, on the same level as bourgeois democracy or traditional monarchy, and that it is not particularly reactionary or otherwise exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |archivedate=2008-12-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222001648/http://www.skatta.demon.co.uk/eclipse/eclip6.htm |url=http://www.skatta.demon.co.uk/eclipse/eclip6.htm |title=Eclipse &amp; Re-emergence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encyclopedia of Marxism===

The ''Encyclopedia of Marxism'' defines fascism as "right-wing, fiercely nationalist, subjectivist in philosophy, and totalitarian in practice", and identifies it as "an extreme reactionary form of capitalist government."&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/f/a.htm#fascism|title=Glossary of Terms: Fa|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are several fundamental characteristics of fascism, among them are: 
#[[Left-Right politics|Right Wing]]: Fascists are fervently against: Marxism, Socialism, Anarchism, Communism, Environmentalism; etc – in essence, they are against the progressive left in total, including moderate lefts (social democrats, etc). Fascism is an extreme right wing ideology, though it can be opportunistic.
#[[Nationalism]]: Fascism places a very strong emphasis on patriotism and nationalism. Criticism of the nation's main ideals, especially war, is lambasted as unpatriotic at best, and treason at worst. State propaganda consistently broadcasts threats of attack, while justifying pre-emptive war. Fascism invariably seeks to instill in its people the warrior mentality: to always be vigilant, wary of strangers and suspicious of foreigners.
#[[Hierarchy]]: Fascist society is ruled by a "righteous" leader, who is supported by an elite secret vanguard of capitalists. Hierarchy is prevalent throughout all aspects of society – every street, every workplace, every school, will have its local Hitler, part police-informer, part bureaucrat – and society is prepared for war at all times. The absolute power of the social hierarchy prevails over everything, and thus a totalitarian society is formed. Representative government is acceptable only if it can be controlled and regulated, direct democracy (e.g. Communism) is the greatest of all crimes. Any who oppose the social hierarchy of fascism will be imprisoned or executed.
#[[Elitism|Anti-equality]]: Fascism loathes the principles of economic equality and disdains equality between immigrant and citizen. Some forms of fascism extend the fight against equality into other areas: gender, sexual, minority or religious rights, for example.
#[[Religion|Religious]]: Fascism contains a strong amount of reactionary religious beliefs, harking back to times when religion was believed to be "strict, potent, and pure". Nearly all Fascist societies are Christian, and are supported by Catholic and Protestant churches.
#[[Capitalism|Capitalist]]: Fascism does not require revolution to exist in capitalist society: fascists can be elected into office (though their disdain for elections usually means manipulation of the electoral system). They view parliamentary and congressional systems of government to be inefficient and weak, and will do their best to minimize its power over their policy agenda. Fascism exhibits the worst kind of capitalism where [[corporate power]] is absolute, and all vestiges of workers' rights are destroyed.
#[[War]]: Fascism is capitalism at the stage of impotent imperialism. War can create markets that would not otherwise exist by wreaking massive devastation on a society, which then requires reconstruction! Fascism can thus "liberate" the survivors, provide huge loans to that society so fascist corporations can begin the process of rebuilding.
#[[Voluntarism (action)|Voluntarist Ideology]]: Fascism adopts a certain kind of “voluntarism;” they believe that an act of will, if sufficiently powerful, can make something true. Thus all sorts of ideas about racial inferiority, historical destiny, even physical science, are supported by means of violence, in the belief that they can be made true. It is this sense that Fascism is subjectivist.
#[[Tradition|Anti-Modern]]: Fascism loathes all kinds of modernism, especially creativity in the arts, whether acting as a mirror for life (where it does not conform to the Fascist ideal), or expressing deviant or innovative points of view. Fascism invariably burns books and victimises artists; artists who do not promote the fascists ideals are seen as “decadent.” Fascism is hostile to broad learning and interest in other cultures, since such pursuits threaten the dominance of fascist myths. The peddling of conspiracy theories is usually substituted for the objective study of history.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==By other antifascists==

===Franklin D. Roosevelt===
American statesman [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who led the US into war with the fascist Axis powers, wrote about fascism:

{{block quote|The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself.  That, in its essence, is fascism — ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15637 Franklin D. Roosevelt: Message to Congress on Curbing Monopolies]. The American Presidency Project.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt, "Appendix A: Message from the President of the United States Transmitting Recommendations Relative to the Strengthening and Enforcement of Anti-trust Laws",''The American Economic Review'', Vol. 32, No. 2, Part 2, Supplement, Papers Relating to the Temporary National Economic Committee (Jun., 1942), pp. 119-128.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1805350]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759590,00.html "Anti-Monopoly"].  May 9, 1938.  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article12058.htm Message to Congress on the Concentration of Economic Power].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===George Orwell===
Anti-fascist author [[George Orwell]] describes fascism in a 1941 essay, "[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius|Shopkeepers At War]]", in economic terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fascism, at any rate the German version, is a form of [[capitalism]] that borrows from [[Socialism]] just such features as will make it efficient for war purposes... It is a planned system geared to a definite purpose, world-conquest, and not allowing any private interest, either of capitalist or worker, to stand in its way.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell: ‘[http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_saw Shopkeepers At War]’ First published: ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]''. London: February 19, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing for the ''Tribune'' in 1944, Orwell stated:&lt;ref name="OrwellTribune"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orwell|first1=George|title=What is Fascism?|url=http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...It is not easy, for instance, to fit Germany and Japan into the same framework, and it is even harder with some of the small states which are describable as Fascist. It is usually assumed, for instance, that Fascism is inherently warlike, that it thrives in an atmosphere of war hysteria and can only solve its economic problems by means of war preparation or foreign conquests. But clearly this is not true of, say, Portugal or the various South American dictatorships. Or again, antisemitism is supposed to be one of the distinguishing marks of Fascism; but some Fascist movements are not antisemitic. Learned controversies, reverberating for years on end in American magazines, have not even been able to determine whether or not Fascism is a form of capitalism. But still, when we apply the term ‘Fascism’ to Germany or Japan or Mussolini's Italy, we know broadly what we mean.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''Fascist'' as insult====
{{main|Fascist (insult)}}
Some have argued that the terms ''fascism'' and ''fascist'' have become hopelessly vague since the [[World War II]] period, and that today it is little more than a [[pejorative]] used by supporters of various political views to insult their opponents. The word ''fascist'' is sometimes used to denigrate people, institutions, or groups that would not describe themselves as ideologically fascist, and that may not fall within the formal definition of the word. As a political epithet, ''fascist'' has been used in an [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] sense to emphasize the common ideology of governmental suppression of individual freedom. In this sense, the word ''fascist'' is intended to mean [[oppression|oppressive]], [[Toleration|intolerant]], [[chauvinism|chauvinist]], [[genocide|genocidal]], [[dictatorship|dictatorial]], [[racism|racist]], or [[aggression|aggressive]]. [[George Orwell]] wrote in 1944:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else ... Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathisers, almost any English person would accept ‘bully’ as a synonym for ‘Fascist’. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.&lt;ref name="OrwellTribune" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Linda and Morris Tannehill===
[[Anarcho-capitalist]] authors [[Linda Tannehill|Linda]] and [[Morris Tannehill]] claim in their 1970 self-published work ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'' that "Fascism is a system in which the government leaves nominal ownership of the means of production in the hands of private individuals but exercises control by means of regulatory legislation and reaps most of the profit by means of heavy taxation. In effect, fascism is simply a more subtle form of government ownership than is socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/daily/2220|title=The Market For Liberty - Christopher W. Morris, Morris and Linda Tannehill|last=kanopiadmin|date=15 June 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">'''Domhnall Ó Cobhthaigh''' (died 1446) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] poet.

A brother of [[Maeleachlainn Ó Cobhthaigh]] (died 1429) and a son of [[An Clasach Ó Cobhthaigh]] (died 1415), [[Ó Cobhthaigh]] was a member of a [[hereditary]] [[bard]]ic family. However, he was also famous as a [[soldier]]. One of his surviving poems, '' T'aire riot, a mheic Mhurchaidh'' – addressed to the [[Art Óg mac Murchadha Caomhánach|Mac Murchadha Caomhánach]] – urges the men of [[Leinster]] to resist the [[Anglo-Irish]].

He was killed, along with his two sons, on the island of Cróinis on [[Lough Ennell]], by Art [[Ó Mael Sheachlainn]] and the sons of Fiacha [[Mag Eochagáin]].

'''Dumbshow,''' also '''dumb show''' or '''dumb-show''', is defined by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' as "gestures used to convey a meaning or message without speech; mime." In the theatre the word refers to a piece of dramatic mime in general, or more particularly a piece of action given in mime within a play "to summarise, supplement, or comment on the main action".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199571123.001.0001/m_en_gb0248900 "dumbshow"], ''The Oxford Dictionary of English'',  ed. Stevenson, Angus, Oxford University Press, 2010, retrieved 29 November 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance'', Michael Dobson writes that  the dumbshow was originally "an allegorical survival from the [[morality play]]".&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt; It came into fashion in 16th century English drama in interludes featuring "personifications of abstract virtues and vices who contend in ways which foreshadow and moralize the fortunes of the play's characters".&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;Dobson, Michael. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1168 "dumb show"], ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance'', Oxford University Press, 2003, retrieved 29 November 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples in ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' (1561) throughout which dumbshow plays a major part, and in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (1580s), [[George Peele]]'s ''[[The Battle of Alcazar (play)|The Battle of Alcazar]]'' (1594) and ''[[The Old Wives' Tale (play)|The Old Wives' Tale]]'' (1595), [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]]'s ''[[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]]'' (1594) and the anonymous ''A Warning for Fair Women'' (1599).&lt;ref name=cuddon&gt;Cuddon, pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] used dumbshow in ''[[Hamlet]],'' for the [[play within a play]] staged by Prince Hamlet and the players for King Claudius. That, like Revenge's dumbshow in ''The Spanish Tragedy'', suggests by mime the action soon to take place in the main spoken drama.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Dinah. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001/acref-9780192806871-e-2365 "dumb show"], ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'',  Oxford University Press, 2009, retrieved 29 November 2015 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dobson's view the dumbshow was becoming old-fashioned by Shakespeare's time, and the playwright's most elaborate dumbshows are in ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', a play intentionally constructed in "a mock-medieval dramatic idiom".&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt; In the 17th century, dumbshow survived as an element of the courtly [[masque]], and in the Jacobean tragedies of Webster and Middleton dumbshows are featured in masque-within-the-play episodes.&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt;

From the 1630s the dumbshow no longer featured in mainstream British drama, but it resurfaced in [[harlequinade]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[melodrama]]s in the 19th century. [[Thomas Holcroft]] introduced a dumb character in his play ''A Tale of Mystery'' (1802), and the device of using a mute to convey essential facts by dumbshow became a regular feature of melodramas.  In his ''Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (first published in 1977), [[J. A. Cuddon]] lists 19th century plays with the titles ''The Dumb Boy'' (1821), ''The Dumb Brigand'' (1832), ''The Dumb Recruit'' (1840), ''The Dumb Driver'' (1849) and ''The Dumb Sailor'' (1854).&lt;ref name=cuddon/&gt; 

Cuddon notes three 20th century instances of dumbshow in [[André Obey]]'s ''Le Viol de Lucrece'' (1931), [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953) and [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' (1966).&lt;ref name=cuddon/&gt;

'''Eknath''' (1533–1599)&lt;ref name="Tagare1993" /&gt; was a prominent [[Marathi people|Marathi]] [[Sant (religion)|sant]], [[scholar]] and religious poet of the [[Varkari]] sampradaya. In the development of [[Marathi literature]], Eknath is seen as a bridge between his predecessors—[[Dnyaneshwar]] and [[Namdev]]—and the later [[Tukaram]] and [[Samarth Ramdas|Ramdas]].

==Biography==
The precise dates of his life are uncertain but it is traditionally held that Eknath lived during the last three-quarters of the sixteenth-century CE. Legend also says that he was born to a Marathi [[Deshastha Brahmin|Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin]] family that worshiped [[Ekvira]] as their family deity at [[Paithan]],&lt;ref name="Tagare1993"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9788172014568| year=1994| title=Eknath|publisher = Sahitya Akademi| author=Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3V1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Eknath+Deshastha| quote=EKNATH : A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH* (A. D. 1533–1599) A reference to the Marathi Vangmaya Kosh (A biographical dictionary of Marathi writers) shows that there were three authors called "Eknath" and seven authors who used the mudrika (Pen- name) "Eka-Janardan" used by our author Eknath. Eknath was a Rigvedi Deshastha Brahmin, a follower of the Ashvalayana Sutra. His Gotra was Vishvamitra. His family deity was Ekaveera (or Renuka). His family lived at Paithan, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his parents died while he was young and that he was then raised by his grandfather, [[Bhanudas]], a sant also revered by the [[Varkari]] sect.{{sfnp|Novetzke|2013|pp=141–142|ps=}} Some sources say that Bhanudas was his great-grandfather.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeo|1987|p=94|ps=}} It is possible, but not certain, that Eknath's [[guru]], [[Janardan Swami|Janardan]], was a [[Sufi]].{{sfnp|Novetzke|2013|p=142|ps=}}

Once, Eknath, was invited by a [[Mahar]] to eat at his house. Eknath accepted, quoting a verse from the [[Bhagavata Purana]] – "A dog-eating outcaste, who has made an offering to God of his mind, his words, his actions, his property and his very life, is to be considered far superior to a Brahman, who, although gifted with the twelve characteristics of a Brahman, has turned away from the feet of God. The former purifies his whole family, not so the latter puffed up with pride". The Brahmins were enraged when the heard him quoting this. Eknath submitted himself to the penance imposed by them. However, he accepted the invitation again. This time, he was (according to a legend) saved by the God [[Vitthal]] from being ostracized. According to this legend, Vitthal took the form of Eknath and went to the Mahar's house instead of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tradition and Modernity in Bhakti Movements (International Studies in Sociology and Social Anthropology)|editor= J.

==Writings==

He wrote a variation of the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' which is known as the ''Eknathi Bhagavata'',&lt;ref name="Columbia University press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keune|first1=Jon Milton|title=Eknāth Remembered and Reformed: Bhakti, Brahmans, and Untouchables in Marathi Historiography|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University press|location=New York, NY, USA|page=32|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:11409|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variation of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' which is known as the ''[[Bhavarth Ramayan]]''. Eknath wrote ''Rukmini Swayamwar'' ''Hastamalak'', which was comprised 764 ''[[Ovi (poetry)|owees]]'' and based on a 14-shlok [[Sanskrit]] hymn with the same name by [[Shankaracharya]].

His other works were the ''Shukashtak'' (447 ''owees''), the ''Swatma-Sukha'' (510 ''owees''), the ''Ananda-Lahari'' (154 ''owees''), the ''Chiranjeewa-Pad'' (42 ''owees''), the ''Geeta-Sar'', and the ''Prahlad-Wijaya''.  He introduced a new form of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] religious song called ''Bharood'', writing 300 of them.&lt;ref name="Columbia University press"/&gt;

'''''Ethnologue: Languages of the World''''' is an annual reference publication in print and online that provides statistics and other information on the living [[language]]s of the world.  It was first issued in 1951, and is now published annually by [[SIL International]], a U.S.-based, worldwide, Christian non-profit organization.  SIL's main purpose is to study, develop and document languages to promote literacy and for religious purposes. 

As of 2018, ''Ethnologue'' contains web-based information on 7,097 languages in its 21st edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ ''Ethnologue''] 21st edition website&lt;/ref&gt; including the number of speakers, locations, dialects, linguistic affiliations, [[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]], availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, a cursory description of revitalization efforts where reported, and an estimate of language viability using the '''Expanded Graded [[Intergenerationality|Intergenerational]] Disruption Scale''' ('''''EGIDS''''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=M. Paul|first2=Gary F.|last2=Simons|year=2010|title=Assessing Endangerment: Expanding Fishman’s GIDS|journal=[[:fr:Revue Roumaine de linguistique|Romanian Review of Linguistics]]|volume=55|issue=2|pp=103–120|url=http://www-01.sil.org/~simonsg/preprint/EGIDS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Ethnologue'' has been published by [[SIL International]] (formerly known as the Summer Institute of Linguistics), a Christian [[linguistics|linguistic]] service organization with an international office in [[Dallas]], Texas. 
The organization studies numerous minority languages to facilitate language development, and to work with speakers of such language communities in translating portions of the Bible into their languages.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
 
The determination of what characteristics define a single language depends upon [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] evaluation by various scholars; as the preface to ''Ethnologue'' states, "Not all scholars share the same set of criteria for what constitutes a 'language' and what features define a '[[dialect]]'." ''Ethnologue'' follows general linguistic criteria, which are based primarily on mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp |title=Scope of denotation for language identifiers |publisher=[[SIL International]] |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared language intelligibility features are complex, and usually include etymological and grammatical evidence that is agreed upon by experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUxveGrrv-4C&amp;pg=PA464 |title=Basic Linguistic Theory Volume 3: Further Grammatical Topics |first=R. M. W. |last=Dixon |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-13 |p=464 |isbn=9780199571093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to choosing a primary name for a language, ''Ethnologue'' provides listings of the name(s) for the language and any dialects that are used by its speakers, government, foreigners and neighbors.  Also included are any names that have been commonly referenced historically, regardless of whether a name is considered official, politically correct or offensive; this allows more complete historic research to be done. These lists of names are not necessarily complete.

==History==
In 1984, ''Ethnologue'' released a three-letter coding system, called an 'SIL code', to identify each language that it described. This set of codes significantly exceeded the scope of other standards, e.g. [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]].{{sfn|Everaert|2009|p=204}} The 14th edition, published in 2000, included 7,148 language codes.

In 2002, ''Ethnologue'' was asked to work with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) to integrate its codes into a draft international standard. The 15th edition of ''Ethnologue'' was the first edition to use this standard, called [[ISO 639-3]]. This standard is now administered separately from Ethnologue (though still by SIL according to rules established by ISO, and since then ''Ethnologue'' relies on the standard to determine what is listed as a language).&lt;ref name="ELL"&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Ethnologue | first1 = Gary F. | last1 = Simons | first2 = Raymond G. | last2 = Gordon | volume = 4 | pages = 250–253 | title = Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics | editor-first = Edward Kenneth | editor-last = Brown | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-08-044299-0|url=http://www-01.sil.org/~simonsg/preprint/ELL2%20Ethnologue.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In only one case, ''Ethnologue'' and the ISO standards treat languages slightly differently.  ISO 639-3 considers [[Akan language|Akan]] to be a [[ISO 639 macrolanguage|macrolanguage]] consisting of two distinct languages, [[Twi]] and [[Fante dialect|Fante]], whereas ''Ethnologue'' considers Twi and Fante to be dialects of a single language (Akan), since they are mutually intelligible. This anomaly resulted because the ISO 639-2 standard has separate codes for Twi and Fante, which have separate literary traditions, and all 639-2 codes for individual languages are automatically part of 639–3, even though 639-3 would not normally assign them separate codes.

In 2014, with the 17th edition, ''Ethnologue'' introduced a numerical code for language status using a framework called EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale), an elaboration of [[Joshua Fishman|Fishman's]] GIDS ([[Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale]]). It ranks a language from 0 for an [[World language|international language]] to 10 for an [[extinct language]], i.e. a language with which no-one retains a sense of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status |title=Language status |publisher=Ethnologue |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, ''Ethnologue'' launched a metered [[paywall]]; users in [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]] who want to refer to more than seven pages of data per month must buy a [[paid subscription]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Paul Lewis, [http://www.ethnologue.com/ethnoblog/m-paul-lewis/ethnologue-launches-subscription-service#.VmSMQL_bFpE "Ethnologue launches subscription service."] ''Ethnologue.'' December 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, ''Ethnologue'''s 20th edition described 237 [[language families]] including 86 [[language isolates]] and six typological categories, namely [[sign language]]s, [[Creole language|creole]]s, [[pidgin]]s, [[mixed language]]s, [[constructed language]]s, and as yet [[unclassified languages]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueList"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/browse/families |title=Browse by Language Family |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[William Bright]], then editor of the journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', wrote of ''Ethnologue'' that it "is indispensable for any reference shelf on the languages of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William.  1986. "Book Notice on ''Ethnologue''", ''Language'' 62:698.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 in the same journal, Lyle Campbell and Verónica Grondona said: "''Ethnologue''...has become the standard reference, and its usefulness is hard to overestimate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ethnologue: Languages of the world (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/language/v084/84.3.campbell.html|journal = Language|date = January 1, 2008|issn = 1535-0665|pages = 636–641|volume = 84|issue = 3|doi = 10.1353/lan.0.0054|first = Lyle|last = Campbell|first2 = Verónica|last2 = Grondona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Harald Hammarström, an editor of ''[[Glottolog]]'', criticized the publication for frequently lacking citations and failing to articulate clear principles of [[Linguistic typology|language classification]] and identification. However, he concluded that, on balance, "''Ethnologue'' is an impressively comprehensive catalogue of world languages, and it is far superior to anything else produced prior to 2009."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: A comprehensive review|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/language/v091/91.3.hammarstrom.html|journal = Language|date = 2015|issn = 1535-0665|pages = 723–737|volume = 91|issue = 3|doi = 10.1353/lan.2015.0038|first = Harald|last = Hammarström}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand German|Extensionalismus|date=November 2014}}
'''Extensionalism''', in the [[philosophy of language]], in [[logic]] and [[semantics]], is the view that all languages or at least all scientific languages should be [[extensional]]. [[Rudolf Carnap]] (in his earlier work) and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] were prominent proponents of this view.

'''Sextus Julius Frontinus''' (c. 40 – 103 AD) was a prominent [[Roman Empire|Roman]] civil engineer, author, and politician of the late 1st century AD. He was a successful general under [[Domitian]], commanding forces in [[Roman Britain]], and on the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] frontiers. A ''[[novus homo]]'', he was [[Roman consul|consul]] three times. Frontinus ably discharged several important administrative duties for [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]]. However, he is best known to the post-Classical world as an author of technical treatises, especially ''[[De aquaeductu]]'', dealing with the [[aqueducts of Rome]].

== Career ==
In AD 70, Frontinus participated in the suppression of the Rhineland revolt, and later recorded that he received the surrender of 70,000 [[Lingones]].&lt;ref&gt;''Strategemata'' 4.3.14. A.R. Birley, ''The'' Fasti ''of Roman Britain'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Between that date and being appointed [[Roman governors of Britain|governor]] of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to succeed [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] a few years later, Frontinus was appointed [[Roman consul|suffect consul]]. While governor of Britain, he subjugated the [[Silures]] of South Wales and is thought to have likewise campaigned against the [[Brigantes]].&lt;ref name=Birley-71&gt;Birley, ''Fasti'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the father-in-law of the famous historian [[Tacitus]], in 77. Birley believes it "is fair to speculate" that Frontinus was with Domitian during the German campaign of 83. An inscription at [[Hieropolis]] in [[Phrygia]], as well as a number of coins of [[Smyrna]], attests that he was [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in AD 86.&lt;ref name=Birley-71/&gt;

In 97, he was appointed ''[[curator aquarum]]'' (supervisor of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]) by the emperor [[Nerva]], an office only conferred upon persons of very high standing. He was also a member of the [[Augur|College of Augurs]].&lt;ref name=Birley-72&gt;Birley, ''Fasti'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he followed another distinguished Roman statesman, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], the friend, ally and son-in-law of Augustus, who organised in 34 BC a campaign of public repairs and improvements, including renovation of the aqueduct [[Aqua Marcia]] and an extension of its pipes to cover more of the city.

The following year Frontinus held a second consulship as suffect in February, with [[Trajan]] as his colleague, and two years later he was made ''consul ordinarius'' with Trajan. Birley notes, "This exceptional honour underlines the high regard in which he [Frontinus] was held, and suggests, further, that Trajan had a debt to repay."&lt;ref name=Birley-72/&gt; He died in 103 or 104, a date based on [[Pliny the Younger]] writing to his friends that he was elected to the college of augurs to fill the vacancy Frontinus' death had created.&lt;ref name=Birley-72/&gt;

== Family ==
Due to a lack of either a ''titulus honorarius'' or ''sepulcralis'', there is no outline of Frontinus' life, the names of his parents, or of his wife. Some details can be inferred from chance mentions: He is thought to be of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonese]] origins, and originally of the [[equites|equestrian class]].&lt;ref&gt;William McDermott, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44080105 "Stemmata quid faciunt? The descendants of Frontinus"], ''Ancient Society'', 7 (1976), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; From the nomenclature of the name of [[Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus]] (consul c. 84), it is likely Frontinus had a sister, who was the other's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20184085 "P. Calvisius Ruso. One Person or Two?"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik]]'', 56 (1984), pp. 190f&lt;/ref&gt; Frontinus had at least one daughter, the wife of [[Quintus Sosius Senecio]] (cos. 99, II 107) and mother of Sosia Polla.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, "Stemmata quid faciunt?", p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
===Aqueducts of Rome===
[[File:Rome.Porta Maggiore.jpg|thumb|250px|Remains of aqueducts Aqua Claudia and Aqua Anio Novus, integrated into the Aurelian Wall as a gate in 271 AD.]]

Frontinus's chief work is ''[[De aquaeductu]]'', in two books, an official report to the emperor on the state of the [[aqueducts of Rome]].  It presents a history and description of the water-supply of Rome, including the laws relating to its use and maintenance. He provides the history, sizes and discharge rates of all of the nine [[aqueducts of Rome]] at the time at which he was writing at the turn of the 1st century AD: the [[Aqua Marcia]], [[Aqua Appia]], [[Aqua Alsietina]], [[Aqua Tepula]], [[Anio Vetus]], [[Anio Novus]], [[Aqua Virgo]], [[Aqua Claudia]] and [[Aqua Augusta (Rome)|Aqua Augusta]]. Frontinus describes the quality of water delivered by each, mainly depending on their source, be it river, lake, or spring.

====Fraud and theft====
One of the first jobs he undertook when he was appointed water commissioner was to prepare maps of the system so that he could assess their condition before undertaking their maintenance. He says that many had been neglected and were not working at their full capacity. He was especially concerned by diversion of the supply by unscrupulous farmers and tradesmen, among many others. They would insert pipes into the channel of the aqueducts to tap the supply. He, therefore, made a  meticulous survey of the intake and the supply of each line, and then investigated the discrepancies. [[Lead pipe stamp]]s bearing the name of the owner were also used to prevent such water theft. He was well aware of the seminal work ''[[De Architectura]]'' by [[Vitruvius]], which mentions [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] construction and maintenance published in the previous century; Frontinus refers to the possible influence of Vitruvius on the plumbers.&lt;ref&gt;[25:1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RomaAcquedottoTraCelioePalatino.JPG|thumb|Remains of Aqua Claudia]]

====Distribution system====
Distribution of the water depended in a complex way on its height entering the city, the quality of the water, and its rate of discharge. Thus, poor-quality water would be sent for irrigation, gardens, or flushing, while only the best would be reserved for drinking water. Intermediate-quality water would be used for the many baths and fountains. However, Frontinus criticized the practice of mixing supplies from different sources, and one of his first decisions was to separate the waters from each system.

====Maintenance====
He was very concerned by leaks in the system, especially those in the underground conduits, which were difficult to locate and mend, a problem still faced by water engineers today. The aqueducts above ground needed care to ensure that the masonry was kept in good condition, especially those running on arched superstructures. It was, he said, essential to keep trees at a distance so that their roots would not damage the structures. He reviewed the existing law governing the state aqueducts, as well as the need for enforcement of those [[statute]]s.

===Military tactics===
Frontinus also wrote a theoretical treatise on military science, which is lost. His extant work on military matters, the ''[[Stratagems (book)|Stratagems]]'' (Latin: ''Strategemata''), is a collection of examples of military stratagems from Greek and Roman history, for the use of generals. He draws on his own experience as a general in [[Germania]] under [[Domitian]], but similarities between the anecdotes he records and versions of other Roman authors like [[Valerius Maximus]] and [[Livy]] suggest that he drew mainly on literary sources.  The authenticity of the fourth book has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Paper by Rogier van der Wal (Amsterdam) to the 2010 Classical Association Conference, Cardiff&lt;/ref&gt;
One example he gives of control of river water during a siege reads:
{{quote|Lucius Metellus, when fighting in [[Hispania Citerior|Hither Spain]], diverted the course of a river and directed it from a higher level against the camp of the enemy, which was located on low ground. Then, when the enemy were in a panic from the sudden flood, he had them slain by men whom he had stationed in ambush for this very purpose.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7435">'''Functional grammar''' ('''FG''') and '''functional discourse grammar''' ('''FDG''') are [[grammar]] models and theories motivated by [[functional theories of grammar]]. These theories explain how [[Natural language|linguistic]] utterances are shaped, based on the goals and knowledge of natural language users. In doing so, it contrasts with Chomskyan [[transformational grammar]]. Functional discourse grammar has been developed as a successor to functional grammar, attempting to be more psychologically and pragmatically adequate than functional grammar.&lt;ref name="Hengeveld2008"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kees|last1=Hengeveld|first2=J.

The top-level unit of analysis in functional discourse grammar is the [[discourse]] move, not the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] or the [[clause]]. This is a principle that sets functional discourse grammar apart from many other [[linguistics|linguistic]] theories, including its predecessor functional grammar.

== History ==
Functional grammar (FG) is a model of [[grammar]] motivated by [[Functional theories of grammar|functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurford|first1=J|year=1990|title=Nativist and functional explanations in language acquisition|work=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition|editor-last=Roca|editor-first=I. M|pages=85–136|location=Foris, Dordrecht|url=http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/hurford90nativist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally developed by [[Simon C. Dik]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dik|first=Simon C.|title=The Theory of Functional Grammar, Parts 1 &amp; 2|edition=1|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has undergone several revisions since then. The latest standard version under the original name is laid out in the 1997 edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qeMLE_5uvHcC|last=Dik|first=Simon C.|year=1997|title=The Theory of Functional Grammar, Part 1: The Structure of the Clause|edition=2|location=Berlin|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110154047}}&lt;/ref&gt; published shortly after Dik's death. The latest version features the expansion of the model with a pragmatic/interpersonal module by Kees Hengeveld and Lachlan Mackenzie.&lt;ref name="Hengeveld2008" /&gt; This has led to a renaming of the theory to functional discourse grammar. This type of grammar is quite distinct from [[systemic functional grammar]] as developed by [[Michael Halliday]] and many other linguists since the 1970s.

The notion of "function" in FG generalizes the standard distinction of [[grammatical function]]s such as [[grammatical subject|subject]] and [[grammatical object|object]]. Constituents ([[parts of speech]]) of a linguistic [[utterance]] are assigned three types or levels of functions:

#Semantic function (Agent, Patient, Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed
#Syntactic functions (Subject and Object), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression
#Pragmatic functions (Theme and Tail, Topic and Focus), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction

== Principles of functional discourse grammar ==
There are a number of principles that guide the analysis of natural language utterances according to functional discourse grammar.

Functional discourse grammar explains the phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics and semantics in one linguistic theory. According to functional discourse grammar, linguistic utterances are built top-down in this order by deciding upon:
# The [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] aspects of the utterance
# The [[Semantics|semantic]] aspects of the utterance
# The [[Morphosyntax|morphosyntactic]] aspects of the utterance
# The [[Phonology|phonological]] aspects of the utterance

According to functional discourse grammar, four components are involved in building up an utterance:
* The conceptual component, which is where the communicative intention that drives the utterance construction arises
* The grammatical component, where the utterance is formulated and encoded according to the communicative intention
* The contextual component, which contains all elements that can be referred to in the history of the discourse or in the environment
* The output component, which realizes the utterance as sound, writing, or signing

The grammatical component consists of four levels:
* The interpersonal level, which accounts for the [[pragmatics]]
* The representational level, which accounts for the [[semantics]]
* The morphosyntactic level, which accounts for the [[syntax]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]
* The phonological level, which accounts for the [[phonology]] of the utterance

== Example ==
This example analyzes the utterance "I can't find the red pan. It is not in its usual place." according to functional discourse grammar at the interpersonal level.

At the interpersonal level, this utterance is one discourse move, which consists of two [[speech act|discourse acts]], one corresponding to "I can't find the red pan." and another corresponding to "It is not in its usual place."
* The first discourse act consists of:
** A [[declarative sentence|declarative]] [[illocutionary force]]
** A speaker, denoted by the word "I"
** An addressee
** A communicated content, which consists of:
*** A referential subact corresponding to "I"
*** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "find", which has the function [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]]
*** A referential subact corresponding to "the red pan", which contains two ascriptive subacts corresponding to "red" and "pan", and which has the function [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]]
* The second discourse act consists of:
** A declarative illocutionary force
** A speaker
** An addressee
** A communicated content, which consists of:
*** A referential subact corresponding to "it", which has the function [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]]
*** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "in its usual place", which has the function Focus
**** Within this subact there is a referential subact corresponding to "its usual place", which consists of:
***** A referential subact corresponding to "its"
***** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "usual"
***** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "place"

Similar analysis, decomposing the utterance into progressively smaller units, is possible at the other levels of the grammatical component.

A '''general contractor''', '''main contractor''' or '''prime contractor''' &lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. ''Architect's illustrated pocket dictionary''. Oxford: Architectural Press, 2011. 289. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of a [[construction]] site, management of vendors and trades, and the communication of information to all involved parties throughout the course of a building project.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, Chris. &amp; Au, Tung (2000), [http://pmbook.ce.cmu.edu/03_The_Design_And_Construction_Process.html ''The Design and Construction Process. Project Management for Construction: Fundamental Concepts for Owners, Engineers, Architects and Builders''], chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The general contractor is a manager and possibly a tradesman that is employed by the client on the advice of the [[architect]], [[engineer]] or the client him/herself if acting as the manager. A general contractor is responsible for the overall coordination of a project.&lt;ref&gt;Shekhar, R. K.. ''Academic Dictionary of Architecture''. Delhi: Isha Books, 2005. 69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
A general contractor must first assess the project-specific documents (referred to as bid, proposal or tender documents). In the case of renovations, a site visit is required to get a better understanding of the project. Depending on the project delivery method, the contractor will submit a fixed price proposal or bid, cost plus price or an estimate. The general contractor considers the cost of home office overhead, general conditions, materials, and equipment as well as the cost of labor to provide the owner with a price for the project.

Contract documents include drawings, project manual (including  general, supplementary or special conditions and specifications), addendum or modifications issued prior to proposal/ bidding ad prepared by a design professional such as an architect. The general contractor may be the construction manager or construction manager at high risk.

==Responsibilities==
A general contractor is responsible for providing all of the material, labor, equipment (such as [[Heavy equipment (construction)|engineering vehicles]] and tools) and services necessary for the construction of the project. The general contractor hires specialized [[subcontractor]]s to perform all or portions of the construction work.

The general contractor is also responsible for the quality of all work performed by any and all subcontractors. The general contractor's number one priority is safety on the jobsite.

Responsibilities may include applying for building permits, advising the person they are hired by, securing the property, providing temporary utilities on site, managing personnel on site, providing site surveying and engineering, disposing or recycling of construction waste, monitoring schedules, and cash flows, and maintaining accurate records.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Edward, &amp; Iano Joseph (2009). ''Fundamentals of Building Construction Materials and Methods''. 5th ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK and Commonwealth usage==
In the [[United Kingdom]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries, the term 'general contractor' was gradually superseded by 'main contractor' during the early twentieth century. This was the term used by major professional, trade, and consumer organizations when issuing contracts for construction work, and thus the term 'general contractor' fell out of use except in large organizations where the main contractor is the top manager and a general contractor shares responsibilities with professional contractors.

General contractors who conduct work for government agencies are often referred to as "prime contractors". This terms is also used in contexts where the customer's immediate contractor is permitted to sub-contract or circumstances are likely to involve sub-contracting to specialist operators e.g. in various public services.&lt;ref&gt;W2W Solutions, [http://www.w2wsolutions.co.uk/news-article/dwp-prime-contractor-lists/78 DWP Prime Contractor Lists], accessed 9 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Licensing requirements==
Licensing requirements to work legally on construction projects vary from locale to locale. In the United States, it is the states' responsibility to define these requirements: for example, in the [[state of California]], the requirements are stated as follows:
  
{{quote|"With a few exceptions, all businesses or individuals who work on any building, highway, road, parking facility, railroad, excavation, or other structure in California must be licensed by the [[California Contractors State License Board]] (CSLB) if the total cost of one or more contracts on the project is $500 or more."}}

In every state (that requires a license), a [[surety bond]] is required as part of the licensing process. Not all states require General Contractor licenses - these include [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]], among others.

==Licensing qualifications==
There are no set educational qualifications to become a general contractor. Some general contractors obtain bachelor's degrees in [[construction science]], [[building science]], [[surveying]], construction safety, or other disciplines.

General contractors often start out as [[construction worker]]s. While gaining work experience, they learn about different aspects of construction, including [[masonry]], [[carpentry]], [[Framing (construction)|framing]], and [[plumbing]]. Aspiring general contractors communicate with subcontractors and may learn the management skills they need to run their own company.

Experience in the construction industry as well as references from customers, business partners, or former employers are demanded. Some jurisdictions require candidates to provide proof of financing to own their own general contracting firm.

General contractors often run their own business. They hire subcontractors to complete specialized construction work and may manage a team of plumbers, electricians, masons, carpenters, iron workers, and other specialists. General contractors build their business by networking with potential clients, buying basic construction tools, and ensuring that their subcontractors complete high-quality work. General contractors don't usually complete much construction work themselves, but they need to be familiar with construction techniques so they can manage workers effectively.

==As a business owner==
{{Main|Independent contractor}}
Businesses may choose to hire contractors over employees for a variety of reasons. For legal reasons it can be easier to hire and to release a contractor compared to a permanent employee. Additionally, business owners may choose to hire contractors because of economic uncertainty or other factors that make hiring employees impractical. Other reasons include access to specialist skills, flexible hiring and firing, and lower costs.

==General contractor example==
A property owner or [[real estate developer]] develops a program of their needs and select a site (often with an architect). The architect assembles a design team of [[consulting engineer]]s and other experts to design the building and specify the building systems. Today contractors frequently participate on the design team by providing pre-design services such as providing estimations of the budget and scheduling requirements to improve the economy of the project. In other cases the general contractor is hired at the close of the design phase. The owner, architect, and general contractor work closely together to meet deadlines and budget. The general contractor works with subcontractors to ensure quality standards.

''[[Honorific]]s'' are words that connote esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. In the [[German language]], honorifics distinguish people by age, sex, profession, academic achievement, and rank. In the past, a distinction was also made between married and unmarried women.

==Honorific pronouns==
Like many languages, German has pronouns for both familiar (used with family members, intimate friends, and children) and polite forms of address. The polite equivalent of "you" is "'''''Sie'''''." Grammatically speaking, this is the 3rd-person-plural form, and, as a subject of a sentence, it always takes the 3rd-person-plural forms of verbs and possessive adjective/ pronouns, even when talking to only one person. (Familiar pronouns have singular and plural forms.) Honorific pronouns are always capitalized except for the polite reflexive pronoun "'''''sich'''''." In letters, e-mails, and other texts in which the reader is directly addressed, familiar pronouns may be capitalized or not. In schoolbooks, the pronouns usually remain lowercased.

'''Declension of the polite personal pronoun "''Sie''":'''

Nominative case (= Accusative case): ''Sie''
&lt;br /&gt;
Genitive case: ''Ihrer''
&lt;br /&gt;
Dative case: ''Ihnen''

'''Declension of polite possessive adjectives:'''

{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |  !! colspan="3" | Singular !! Plural
|-
! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! All three genders
|-
! Nominative case
| Ihr || Ihre || Ihr || Ihre
|-
! Genitive case
| Ihres || Ihrer || Ihres || Ihrer
|-
! Dative case
| Ihrem || Ihrer || Ihrem || Ihren
|-
! Accusative case
| Ihren || Ihre || Ihr || Ihre
|}

'''Obsolete forms of honorific addresses:'''

In former times, the 2nd person plural ("''Ihr''" ; like the French « ''vous'' ») or the 3rd person singular ("''Er''" He,  "''Sie''" She) and their corresponding possessive adjectives and verb forms were used. The 3rd person plural as polite form of address as it is used today became standard during the 19th and 20th centuries.

For more details about German grammar, see the entries about the German language.

==Sex and age==
;''Herr'' (pl., ''Herren'')
:for men (equivalent to ''[[Mr.|Mister]]'' in [[English language|English]]). Note that this word also means "master, owner, ruler, gentleman, sir" and is also a form of address for the Christian God (English equivalent: Lord). If the surname is not known, e. g. when addressing a stranger in the street, the correct form is ''mein Herr'' or ''werter Herr'' ("Mister" or "sir", literally "my lord" or "worthy gentleman" respectively), though the latter has an old-fashioned touch.
;''Frau'' (pl., ''Frauen'')
:for women (equivalent to ''[[Ms.]], [[Mrs.]]'' and ''[[Madam]]'' in English). Note that this word also means "woman" and "wife." Unlike English Mrs., it is never used with a husband's first name. If the last name of the woman is not known or by domestics towards their employeuse, the correct form is ''gnädige Frau'' ("gracious lady") or its abbreviation ''gnä' Frau'', but this is somewhat old-fashioned except in Austria.
;''Fräulein'' (pl., ''Fräulein'')
:for unmarried women (like ''[[Miss]]'' in English). ''[[Fräulein]]'' (diminutive of "Frau", literally "lady-[[diminutive|kins]]") is now deprecated and may be considered condescending, depending on the circumstances, but it is in all cases acceptable for girls below maturity age.
;''Dame'' (pl., ''Damen'')
: This is not to be confused with British "Dame", which is a title of nobility (which in Germany, curiously enough, ''Frau'' originally was but ''Dame'' never was). It is used as a direct equivalent of the English word ''[[Lady]]'' if ''not'' intended to mean "daughter of an earl upwards or wife of a peer, baronet or knight"; thus, ''sich wie eine Dame benehmen'' to comport oneself like a lady, ''meine'' [in letters: ''sehr geehrte'']'' Damen und Herren'' "Ladies and gentlemen", and so forth. The euphemistic use is included: ''Dame vom horizontalen Gewerbe'' "lady of the night" (literally, "of the horizontal profession"). Also, "Dame" is a technical term for "female dance-partner".

Using "Herr" for very young misters, certainly those below the age of 16, is rather awkward and often avoided (except in letters from the state's bureaucracy) by using the first name, or first name and last name. There used to be a direct equivalent to ''Fräulein'', viz., ''[[Junker]]'' (equivalent to [[Master (form of address)|Master]]), but this word is now only used in describing a specific class (which properly speaking did not consist of "junkers" in this sense at all, but of "Herren") and in the term ''Fahnenjunker'' ("officer candidate 3rd class"), reflecting the tradition that only officers are ''Herren'' (though now used together with "Herr", see below under military). Also, it never lost the touch of describing exclusively those of higher class, which was originally true of all the four mentioned above but has been lost by all of them.

Note that almost all other honorifics will be combined with a ''Herr'' or ''Frau'' respectively (and almost never with a ''Fräulein''); the contrary shall be noted as exceptions in the following.

==Clergy==

All clergy and ministers are usually called ''Herr'' (or Protestants also: ''Frau'') plus the title of their office, e. g., ''Herr Pfarrer''. Adjectival predicates are only used for Roman Catholic clergy, and then in the following order:

*''Seine Heiligkeit'' or ''Heiliger Vater/der Heilige Vater'' for the Pope ("His Holiness", "(the) Holy Father")
*''Seine Seligkeit'' for Patriarchs ("His Beatitude"),
*''Seine Eminenz'' for Cardinals,
*''Seine Exzellenz'' for bishops not Cardinals,
*''Seine Gnaden'' for bishops not Cardinals, and for abbots ("His Grace") - now generally considered outdated,
*''hochwürdigst'' for all [[prelate]]s whosoever (with the usual exception of the Pope) ("the Most/Right/Very Reverend"; e. g. ''der hochwürdigste Herr Generalvikar'' - "the Right Reverend Father Vicar-General")
*''hochwürdig'' for all priests who are not prelates, and for abbesses ("the Reverend") - ''never'' used for seminarians,
*''hochehrwürdig'' for deacons ("the Reverend", literally something like "the Right Honourable"),
*''wohlehrwürdig'' for subdeacons ("the Reverend", literally something like "the Very Honourable"),
*''ehrwürdig'' for (ex-)[[minor orders|minor clergy]] below the rank of subdeacon, male religious not clerics, seminarians and female religious not abbesses ("the Reverend", literally something like "the Honourable").

Whether [[Monsignor]]s of the first degree (that is, Chaplains of His Holiness) are ''hochwürdigst'' or ''hochwürdig'' is a borderline case. The predicate ''hochwürdigst'' is sometimes also extended to other priests of certain high positions (say, [[cathedral chapter|cathedral capitulars]]), but never for parish priests or for deans.

All these predicates are in increasingly sparing use (except for the first, and except for "Excellency" as applied to the [[nuncio]]), but especially ''Seine Gnaden'' (which dates from a time when not all bishops were accorded the style "Excellency" then considered higher) and ''hochehrwürdig'' and ''wohlehrwürdig'' (which tend to be replaced by a simple ''ehrwürdig''), followed by "Excellency" at least as far as [[auxiliary bishop]]s are concerned. It is good style, though, to use them at least in all places where layfolk would be addressed as ''sehr geehrte'' (which they replace), such as at the beginning of letters, speeches and so forth. The oft-seen abbreviation "H. H." (e. g. in obituaries) means "hochwürdigster Herr".

It is incorrect to address an auxiliary bishop as "Herr Weihbischof"; he must be called ''Herr Bischof''. Cardinals are always ''Herr Kardinal'' (or more formally ''Seine/Euer Eminenz''), never, for instance, ''Herr Erzbischof'' even if they are diocesan archbishops and are addressed as such.

The literal translation of "Monsignor" is ''Monsignore'' (using the Italian form), but it is only usually used for Monsignors of the first degree (Chaplains of His Holiness), not for prelates as in English, or for bishops as in Italian. If used, protocol demands to leave away the usual ''Herr'' (to avoid the meaning "Lord Mylord"), but this is as uncommon in German that the incorrect phrase "Herr Monsignore" can often be heard.

Higher prelates are addressed ''Herr Prälat'' (not, usually, "Herr [[Protonotary Apostolic|Protonotar]]"), or possibly with their office (if it is not that of a Cathedral capitular without further distinction, in which case the title of prelate is preferred.)

Abbots are addressed ''Herr Abt'' or ''Vater Abt'' ("Father Abbot"), abbesses ''Frau Äbtissin'' or ''Mutter Äbtissin'' ("Mother Abbess"). (The "Father" and "Mother" versions are one of the few cases where ''Herr'' or ''Frau'' falls away.) Other male religious are called ''Pater'' ("Father", but in Latin) if priests and ''Frater'' ("Brother", but also in Latin) if not, sometimes together with the surname, sometimes also with the first name (though [[Canons Regular]] are called ''Herr'' rather than Pater or Frater). Female religious are called ''Schwester'' ("Sister", but this time in German). This is not used together with both Herr/Frau and their name, though in the address, it is quite common to address a religious priest who does pastoral work in a parish orally as ''Herr Pater'' ("Mr. Father").

(Note generally that the translation of "Father" into ''German'' is only used for the Pope and for abbots, and into ''Latin'' only for religious clergy.)

- The office of "Priester" ([[priest]]) taken simply is nb. ''never'' used as a title (there is "Herr Diakon" and "Herr Bischof" but no "Herr Priester"). In the usually brief period where a secular priest has no office that could be used in addressing him, the phrase "Herr Neupriester" ("Mr. New Priest") is used; after retirement, the title ''Pfarrer'' (parish priest, pastor) can be kept if held at some point in their life. It is also quite common to address such priests with their academic rank, if they have some ("[hochwürdiger] Herr Dr. Lastname", for a doctor), or their civil-servant rank if they have some ("[hochwürdiger] Herr Oberstudienrat", literally something like "Rev. Mr. Teacher-first-class", for a priest who serves as teacher of religion at a state school). Professors of theology are always addressed by their academic function (except, possibly, if prelates, which usually, though of similar eminence, they aren't).

Parochial [[vicar]]s usually have the honorific title ''Kaplan'' (chaplain), while ''actual'' [[chaplain]]s as a rule have the in this case honorific title ''Pfarrer'' ("parish priest").

==Nobility==

The traditional honorifics for nobility are, in descending order,
*''[[Majesty|Majestät]]'' for emperors and kings and their wives (but not husbands),
*''[[Imperial Highness|kaiserliche Hoheit]]'' for the members of imperial houses (though in the German Empire ''only'' the Crown Prince, with the others merely considered Prussian royalty; in Austria after 1867 officially "kaiserlich-königlich")
*''[[Royal Highness|königliche Hoheit]]'' for members of royal houses and grand-dukes
*''[[Highness|Hoheit]]'' generally for other sovereign monarchical rulers, though those titled or translated as ''Fürst'' in Christian Europe prefer ''Durchlaucht'', and even some of the reigning dukes preferred "herzogliche Durchlaucht",
*''[[Durchlaucht]]'' for other dukes and ''Fürsten'' (princes, in the sense of head of the house and possibly ruler of a principality); also used for the members of the houses of German dukes (sovereign or not; bearing the titles of ''Prinz'' or as well duke) and sometimes of members of the house of ''Fürsten'' (if bearing the title "Prinz")
*''[[Erlaucht]]'' for the heads of semi-sovereign comital houses (the mediatised [[Reichsgraf|counts of the Empire]]) - rare -,
*''Hochgeboren'' (lit. the High-born) for ''Grafen'' (Counts), unless "Erlaucht", and for ''Freiherren'' if their house belongs to the [[Uradel]],
*''Hochwohlgeboren'' (lit. the High-well-born) for all other nobility,
*''Wohlgeboren'' - by definition not a style for nobility, but as it were for "semi-nobility", i. e. functionaries of noblemen, bourgeois notables, and so forth.

The last one is now completely obsolete, as is the incorrect practice of elevating bourgeois notables to ''Hochwohlgeboren'' (which emerged in the last years of the German monarchies to give expression to the importance of the bourgeoisie in a society that was ''in its formalities'' still pre-Industrial Revolution). But also ''Erlaucht'', ''Hochgeboren'', ''Hochwohlgeboren'' are increasingly rare (and some make a point of not attaching any such predicate unless to sovereigns of non-German states). Austrian (but not German) nobility is forbidden to attach honorifics to themselves or demand them (but may attach them to family members).

The equivalent of a Baron is called ''Freiherr'' (fem. ''Freifrau'', fem. unmarried ''Freifräulein'', which is rare, or its more usual abbreviation ''Freiin''), though some "Barone" exist with foreign (e. g. Russian) titles. Nevertheless, in address they are usually called "Baron", "Baronin", and "Baroneß". It is considered incorrect to attach ''Herr, Frau, Fräulein'' to "Baron" and so forth, except if the Baron in question is one's actual superior, though this appears often nevertheless. It certainly is incorrect to speak of "Herr Freiherr" and so forth, seeing that this is a doubling, so sometimes the phrase "[sehr geehrter] Freiherr von [e. g.] Sonstwoher" is used (given that ''Freiherr'' is unquestionably part of the name of the person in Germany - not in Austria - while calling him "Baron" means treating him as nobility).

It is likewise considered incorrect to attach ''Herr, Frau, Fräulein'' to Counts (m. ''Graf'', fem. ''Gräfin'', fem. unmarried ''Komteß''), unless the Count in question is one's actual superior, though again this still appears often

==Academics==
{{expand list|date=April 2016}}
;''Professor''
:While actually not an academic rank, but an office (or a honorific for former holders of this office), all [[professor]]s are regularly addressed as ''Professor X'' or ''Herr Professor (X)'' (abbreviated ''Prof.''). If they hold a [[doctorate]] (which is almost always the case), the full title is ''Prof. Dr. X'', possibly enriched by further doctorates they hold, and may be used in this form in the address on letters, in very formal occasions such as the beginning of speeches or introducing a person, and so on. Otherwise, unlike in English it is the title ''Dr.'', &amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp; the title ''Prof.'', that falls away.
;''PD'' (i. e., ''Privatdozent'')
:A doctor who has achieved a [[Habilitation]] and subsequently applied for and been granted [[venia legendi]], but not (yet) given the office or honorary title of professor. Etiquette demands their being called ''Doktor'', with the ''PD'' only in use in the said very formal occasions, but sometimes - especially when specific to their academic profession - the reverse practice can be observed.
;''Doktor''
:The title ''[[Doctor (title)#Germany|Doktor]]'' applies to those who hold a [[doctorate]]; other than ''[[Dr.|Doctor]]'' in English, it is not correct to apply it ''per se'' to a [[physician]] who has completed his studies and received his [[Medical license#Germany|approbation]] (though this usage often happens). However, most physicians do write a Doctor's thesis for precisely this reason, earning them the title of Dr. and, when they translate their titles into English, the title of [[medical doctor]] - but despite the existence of a thesis not usually the title [[PhD]], given that doctor's theses in medicine are in most cases of significantly lower complexity than theses in other subjects.
:Unlike the English-language usage, ''Doktor'' may be repeated for double doctorates (''Doktor Doktor''). It is also combined with other honorifics (''Herr Doktor'' or ''Frau Doktor Doktor''). In oral address, doubling the doctorates only appears in very formal occasions (beginning of speeches, introducing a person etc.) ''Herr Doktor'' without the last name is the usual address for a medical doctor, and sometimes regionally for one's [[attorney-at-law|attorney]] (if he holds a doctorate in law); otherwise the last name is usually attached.
:Honorary degrees are distinguished as ''Doktor honoris causa'', or "Dr. h.c.". For example, Ferdinand Porsche was the recipient of an honorary [[Doktoringenieur]] and would be referred to as "Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche"
;''Magister''
:an academic degree somewhat the equivalent of a [[Master's degree]]. ''In Austria'' this also gives the right to a honorific of the same name (being addressed as "Herr Magister", "Frau Magistra" etc.); in Germany this is not usual.
;''Ingenieur''
:an Austrian honorific for engineers. (In Germany this is a profession, but not even an academic degree ''per se'', which is more properly ''Diplomingenieur'', ''Master of Engineering'', and the like.)

''Doktor'' and ''Magistra'' are the only honorifics (other than those of lower nobility) which can be combined not only with ''Frau'' but also with ''Fräulein'' (subject to the general caveats concerning the use of ''Fräulein''). However, a practicioning female physician or attorney would be ''Frau Doktor'' if holding a doctorate; a ''Fräulein Doktor'' suggests an unmarried woman with a doctorate in an academic (or retired) position.

==Judiciary==

The otherwise outdated use of calling people with ''Herr'' and their functions (when they are not ranks of any kind) is in full vigour as far as courtrooms are concerned, where the participants will all the time be addressed as ''Herr Angeklagter'' ("Mr. Defendant"), ''Herr Verteidiger'' ("Mr. Defending Counsel"), ''Herr Zeuge'' ("Mr. Witness"), ''Herr Kläger'' ("Mr. Plaintiff") and so forth. Judges are ''Herr Richter'', ''Herr Vorsitzender'', ''Herr Vizepräsident'' or ''Herr Präsident'' (depending on their rank), similarly the [[public prosecutor]]s (usually ''Herr Staatsanwalt'').

==Military==

The general address for soldiers is ''Herr'' (or nowadays ''Frau'') plus their [[military rank]], e. g., ''Herr Leutnant''. If needed for distinction, the last name can be attached. Subordinates can alternatively be called with rank plus last-name. For soldiers who know each other, for ''Mannschaften'' (enlisted personnel not NCOs) among themselves, and also for an officer from the same unit to an enlisted soldier whom he knows personally, the rank can fall away except if the subordinate addresses the superior, but ''Herr'' is ''never'' attached to the last-name simply.

Superiors can alternatively call their enlisted subordinates by their function (e. g. ''Richtschütze'' "gunner", ''Kraftfahrer'' "motorist", ''Truppführer'' "assistant squad leader", and so forth).

The [[National People's Army|NVA]] used ''Genosse'' ("Comrade") instead of ''Herr''. In the [[German Empire|Imperial Army]], the style of "Excellency" was appropriate for some high-ranking generals.

A direct equivalent to the frequent anglophone use of "Sir" does not exist.

==Civil service (incl. teachers) ==

Civil servants (''Beamten'') used to be called with ''Herr'' or ''Frau'' plus their rank (for their respective ranks, see the tables at [[Beamter]]). This is in full vigour for police-officers (with the now unused rank ''Wachtmeister'' stepping in if the precise rank is not known and the addresser is not familiar with the shoulder strap), but otherwise somewhat outdating.

As teachers on public schools are, as a rule, civil servants (and on Church schools often receive a similar status), this is likewise true for teachers, with the exception that for teachers not the headmaster, it is perhaps even a bit more outdating to use their rank than for other civil servants.

==Professions==

It used to be the case that the name of professions was used as a honorific, together with ''Herr'' (or ''Frau''), e. g. ''Herr Schriftsteller'' ("Mr. Professional Writer"), ''Herr Installateur'' ("Mr. Plumber") and so forth. This is generally outdated.

Though there is a professional qualification called ''Meister'' ("master craftsman"), and there is also an outdated honorific called ''Meister'' (in this case roughly equivalent to "goodman"; in use, when "Herr" was only applied to high-ranking persons, for the non-dependent men below them), this was never a honorific specifically in use for master craftsmen.

==Professial honorifics==

In ''Austria'' - and in monarchical times also in Germany - the Head of State can give certain titles to people of notable achievements in their profession (and, if not for civil servants, usually considerable donations to public welfare). These, again, are usually used with ''Herr'' and ''Frau'' respectively.

A well-known example is the ''Kommerzialrat'' (Prussia: ''Kommerzienrat'') ("Commercial Counsellor [implied: to the Court]), which denotes an entitled businessman. In the monarchies, there also was an "augmented" form of that, in this case ''Geheimer Kommerzialrat'', generally received by adding the adjective "Geheim" (see [[Geheimrat]]). This literally means "Privy (Commercial, etc.) Councillor" and is roughly the equivalent of a person [[knighting|knighted]] for their (in this case commercial) achievements.

Germany generally has not kept the practice, except for the fine arts ([[Kammersänger]], [[Staatsschauspieler]] and so forth). People who had received a title under the monarchies usually retained them until their death.

On the other hand, the distinction ''[[Hoflieferant]]'' ("Court supplier") was not strictly speaking a honorific (though often used as such), but implied the actual function of someone supplying a Court in at least a marginal rôle with some (high-quality) goods. ''Hoflieferant'' is now still attached to the ''companies'' who had received it under the monarchies, but no longer as previously to their ''proprietors in person'' (if they, as now always the case, came into that position later, whether by inheriting or buying).

'''Impiety''' is a perceived lack of proper respect for something considered sacred.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impiety&lt;/ref&gt; Impiety is often closely associated with [[sacrilege]], though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a [[Cult (religion)|cult]], as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to [[Christianity]] was that, unlike other [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than religious. It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods. 
==Historical relevance==

The issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Filonik|first = Jakub|date = 2013|title = Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal|url = http://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/Dike/article/view/4290|journal = Dike|language = en|volume = 16|pages = 11–96|doi = 10.13130/1128-8221/4290|issn = 1128-8221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Athenian men, including [[Alcibiades]], were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution ([[Andocides]] was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events). Most famously, the philosopher [[Socrates]] was executed for impiety (as well as corrupting Athenian youth) in 399 BC. An Athenian philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] taught that the sun and the stars were fiery stones whose heat we did not feel because of their distance, and was allegedly accused of impiety in Athens. [[Diagoras of Melos]] was reportedly accused of atheism and had to flee Athens after being charged with impiety for revealing the content of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] to the uninitiated. Philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] might have been accused of impiety as well.

== Poetry ==
[[File:Kamal Chowdhury at Dhaka Lit Fest 2017.jpg|thumb|Chowdhury discussing poetry translation at Dhaka Lit Fest 2017]]
The life of Dhaka University was insufficient for Kamal Chowdhury. Here is the close relationship with contemporary poets, including [[Rudra Mohammad Shahidullah]], [[Taslima Nasrin]]. One time to write poetry, he got a post-graduate degree from Dhaka University in Sociology. But there was no end to literacy. In 2000, he completed [[PhD]] in anthropology at the retirement of government jobs. The subject of his Ph.D dissertation is 'Matrutulan Rasa tradition of Garo people'. While studying at the University of Dhaka, on the occasion of the [[Bangla Academy]] of the year 1981, a group of young poets took initiatives to publish the first poetic life of the poet; Kamal Chowdhury is one of them. For this purpose, ''Dravir publication'' was established. Kamal Chowdhury's first poetry book was out of [[Ekushey Book Fair]], he was 48 years old. [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)]] gave him strong insight into the poetry language and style.

'''K. Appukuttan Nair''' (1925–2007), better known as '''Kozhikodan''', was a film critic and writer from [[Kerala]], India. One of the first critics to take a closer look at the mainstream [[Malayalam cinema]], he reviewed about 2,000 Malayalam films over four decades. He began writing on films from the early 1950s. He started writing in ''[[Mathrubhumi]]'' and ''[[Chandrika (Malayalam newspaper)|Chandrika]]'', and later became a regular columnist of ''[[Mathrubhumi Illustrated Weekly]]'' along with Cynic and Nadirsha (TMP Nedungadi). The trio is said to have elevated [[film criticism]] into a serious genre of writing in Malayalam. Kozhikodan received the [[Kerala State Film Award for Best Book on Cinema]] in 1988 for ''Chalathitraswadanam Engane?'' and the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award]] (Humour) in 2010 for the poetry collection ''Padachonikku Salam''. He died on 20 January 2007.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/21/stories/2007012103070500.htm |publisher=hindu.com|title=Film critic Kozhikodan passes away - KERALA - The Hindu |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mail bag''' or '''mailbag''' is a generic term for a type of [[Satchel (bag)|bag]] used for collecting, carrying, categorizing, and classifying different types of postal material, depending on its priority, destination, and method of transport. It is oftentimes used by a post office system in transporting these different grades of mail.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;However, according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], a second definition is "the letters received by a person, especially a public figure." Thus, for example, the "[[MythBusters (2012 season)|Mailbag special]]" featuring letter requests from viewers is a recurrent event on [[MythBusters]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mailbag'' is carried by some means of transporting like a [[mail carrier]], animal (''e.g.'', mule, horse), or a [[mobile post office]]. Letters and printed material delivered by mail in the seventeen-hundreds were carried by horse in a [[saddle bag]]. There are several different types of ''mailbags'' for different purposes (''e.g.'', transporting mail to and from post offices, delivering mail to businesses and homes. These different styles of mailbags depend on its size and purpose. It can range from "a large bag used for transporting mail on a truck, plane, etc." to a simple "postbag" used by a mail carrier to deliver mail.&lt;ref name="Cambrdige"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/mailbag |title=Definition of mailbag noun |work=Cambridge Business English Dictionary |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of having ''mail bags'' on board ships traveling between [[Jamaica]] and [[Great Britain]] was established as early as 1780. The name of the ship carrying a letter was put on the corner of the letter so that it would be put into the proper ''mail bag'' for the destination intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaphilately.info/20_Philatelic/209_Publications/Books/1928-Jamaica/CH01_Jamaica-Post-Office.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=Jamaica: Its Postal History, Postal Stamps and Postmarks: The Jamaica Post Office (1671-1926) |page=1 |chapter=I |first1=C.

A ''mailbag'' throughout the United States history has been called various names depending on its form and function at the time, some of which are now obsolete. Among these names are [[mail sack]], [[mail satchel]], [[mail pouch]], [[catcher pouch]], [[mochila]], and [[portmanteau (mail)|portmanteau]].&lt;ref name= "National Postal Museum"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_BagPrototype.html |work=Former Object of the Month |title=Prototype Mail Pouch |first1=Allison |last1=Marsh |date=March 2006 |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mochila"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Mochila.html |title=Mochila |work=Former Object of the Month |first1=Nancy |last1=Pope |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://si-pwebsrch02.si.edu/search?q=cache:c63C5cxcSukJ:postalmuseum.si.edu/arago/Style_Guide.DOC+portmanteau&amp;site=postal&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;client=postal&amp;proxystylesheet=postal&amp;access=p&amp;oe=UTF-8 Arago Researcher Program Style Guide for Researchers and Editors]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Private Mail Bag]]s or so-called "Locked Bags" are a worldwide solution for specialized mail delivery to a single location. Like [[Post office box|PO Box]] addresses, Private Mail Bag addresses omit the name of the building and street, and include only the number allocated to the user.&lt;ref name="Aussie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auspost.com.au/business/locked-bags.html |title=Locked bags |publisher=Australia Post |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private Mail Bag addresses are often used in countries in [[Africa]] where there may be no street delivery service. In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], where street delivery is more commonplace, large users may be allocated their own [[postal code]]s, and consequently need only use their physical address in correspondence; the postal code implies that the recipient receives mail by caller service.&lt;ref name="Aussie"/&gt; Private mail bags may be in lieu of a [[Post Office Box]],&lt;ref name="Aussie"/&gt; but sometimes can go so far as to have an individualized corporate [[zip code]].&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;For example, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has the [[ZIP code#By type/use|unique ZIP code]] 20071.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The U.S. [[National Postal Museum]] says that any bag that carries mail (''e.g.'', letters, magazines, advertisement brochures, packages) is defined as a "Mailbag".&lt;ref name= "National Postal Museum"/&gt; A '' mailbag '' is called a ''postbag'' in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/postbags |title=Postbag |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postbag |title=Postbag |publisher=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form and structure of mailbags has implications for fatigue and industrial injuries to [[mail carrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors]] |date=June 1994 |volume=36 |pages=210–8 |title=Effect of mailbag design on musculoskeletal fatigue and metabolic load |last1=Bloswick |first1=D.

==Mailbag in popular culture==
[[File:Uniformed Letter Carrier with Child in Mailbag.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Mailing children is forbidden, photo courtesy of Smithsonian Institution]]
* With the advent of [[Parcel Post]] in 1913, after some adults sent their children in the mails{{mdash}} with postage affixed to clothing{{mdash}} the U.S. Postmaster General issued regulations barring such shipment. The theory was that children were under the 50&amp;nbsp;lb. weight limit, and that it was a lot cheaper to mail them than to pay rail fares. In part, the regulation followed a letter inquiring as to whether parcel post would be appropriate, and the Postmaster General was of the opinion that children were not within the definition of "bees and bugs", which were the only fauna permitted to be mailed.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://playingintheworldgame.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/1918-shipping-children-by-parcel-post/ |title=Wants Baby Sent by Mail.; Pathetic Inquiry as to Parcel Post Worries Postmaster General |location=Washington D.C. |date=January 16, 1913 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, several children were actually mailed. On 13 June 1920, sending children by Parcel Post was officially forbidden.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2b2f_parcel.html |title=Precious Packages—America's Parcel Post Service |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, National Postal Museum |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, a mail bag stuffed with a child was prominently featured in a humorous photograph to illustrate the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history1900s.about.com/b/2008/06/26/sending-children-by-parcel-post.htm |title=Sending Children by Parcel Post |first1=Jennifer |last1=Rosenberg |publisher=About.com Guide |date=June 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The form of this [[Mail sack|sack]] is so evocative and [[secular icon|iconic]] that it inspired the "counterfeit mail bag" in [[The J.

Mehdi Huseyn wrote his first "Sheering of sheep" narrative in the last year at the secondary school, and it was published in 1926, in [[Azerbaijan Gadini|Sharg Gadini]] magazine ("Woman of the East"). Since then creativity of the writer began. His earlier stories describe an Azerbaijani village of post-revolutionary years and a struggle against patriarchal and feudal relations. His works dedicated to the [[Civil war]] are stories in "Khaver" and "Spring floods" collections written in 1926-1932, and "Flood" novel (1936). Mehti Huseyn develops a theme of socialistic reconstruction of an Azerbaijani village in "Tarlan" ("Fight"). He is the author of the first historical narrative of Azerbaijan "Commissar" (1942) about [[Meshadi Azizbekov]].

He wrote "Call" narrative and a book of stories called "My motherland" during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. His "[[Absheron (novel)|Absheron]]" novel (1947) narrates about heroic labor of Azerbaijani oilmen. In its sequel called "Black rocks" (1957), he wrote about Mollayev, whose prototype was [[Mir Jafar Baghirov|M.Baghirov]]. Historical novel "Morning" (1949-1952) was dedicated to revolutionary struggle of [[Baku]] laborers in 1907-1908. In 1966, "Underground waters flow to the ocean" novel was published after his death.

Film-drama "Poet" (1937), "Glory" play (1939) – about a frontline village of Azerbaijan, "Nizami" (1940), "Javanshir" (1945), "Waiting" (1944, together with I.Efendiyev) about loyalty to a civic duty, are the most famous drama works of the author. Mehdi Huseyn is also famed as a critic and publicist. Literary-critical articles about the issues of [[socialist realism]], adoption of a literal heritage of the past, learning of classic [[Russian literature]] and works of Russian Soviet writers belong to his pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Miji''' (autonym: '''Dmay'''&lt;ref name="Blench2015"/&gt;), also '''Dhammai''' or '''Sajolang''', is a cluster of possibly [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], northeastern India. "Dialects" include at least two distinct languages, which are not particularly close, with only half of the vocabulary in common between the languages of [[East Kameng District]] and [[West Kameng District]]. Long assumed to be Sino-Tibetan languages, they may be a small independent language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Roger |last1=Blench |first2=Mark |last2=Post |title=(De)classifying Arunachal languages: Reconstructing the evidence |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/General/Lingres/Declassifying%20Arunachal.pdf |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526230734/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/General/Lingres/Declassifying%20Arunachal.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
There are 3 varieties of Miji.&lt;ref name="Blench2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"&gt;{{cite journal | surname1 = Bodt | given1 = Timotheus Adrianus | surname2 = Lieberherr | given2 = Ismael | year = 2015 | title = First notes on the phonology and classification of the Bangru language of India | journal = Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–123 | doi = 10.1075/ltba.38.1.03bod | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Western Miji''': spoken in and around Nafra and Thrizino circles, [[West Kameng District]]. Western Miji speakers refer to themselves as the '''Sajalang''' (''sadʑalaŋ'') or '''Dhəmmai''' (''ðəmmai'') (Bodt &amp; Lieberherr 2015:70).&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt;

===Bangru locations===
Blench (2015),&lt;ref name="Blench2015"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/12657496/The_Mijiic_languages_distribution_dialects_wordlist_and_classification ''The Mijiic languages: distribution, dialects, wordlist and classification'']. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; citing Ramya (2012),&lt;ref name="Ramya2012"&gt;Ramya, T. 2012. Bangrus of Arunachal Pradesh: An Ethnographic Profile. ''International Journal of Social Science Tomorrow'', 1(3):1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the Bangru (Northern Miji) villages Bala, Lee, Lower Lichila, Upper Lichila, Machane, Milli, Molo, Nade, Namju, Palo, Rerung, Sape, Sate (''saːtəː'')&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt;, Wabia, and Walu’, as well as Sarli Town. Traditionally, the Bangru lived in the ‘thirteen Bangru villages’ (Bangru language: ''ləwjɛː neːpeː rəŋleː kətə̃ĩŋ'').&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt;

In China, Bangru (transcribed in Chinese as ''Bengru'' 崩如) is spoken in the area of Bixia 比夏, southern [[Longzi County]] 隆子县, [[Shannan Prefecture]] 山南地区, Tibet &amp;mdash; in the villages of Jieli 结列, Baluo 巴洛, Xiade 夏德, Li 利, Lilaqi 利拉齐, and Gelangge 嘎朗洛 (Li 2003).&lt;ref name="li2003bangru"&gt;Li Daqin [李大勤]. 2003. "A sketch of Bengru" [崩如语概况]. ''Minzu Yuwen'' 2003(5), 64-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Bangru is also spoken by many of the nearby Sulung people, who live in San'an Qulin Township 三安曲林乡 of Longzi County. Names of Bangru include ''ləʔ31 wai55'' (autonym), ''pɤn31 ru55'' ([[Bangni language|Bangni]] exonym), and ''bu33 zuai55 bi33'' ([[Sulung language|Sulung]] exonym).&lt;ref name="li2003bangru"/&gt; There are also 6 people living in Douyu Village No. 1 (斗玉一村) on the Chinese side. Li (2003) reports that there are about 1,600 Bangru people as of 1980, and about 2,000 as of 2003.

As with more than 90% of the residents of [[Kurung Kumey District]], most Bangru speakers can also speak Nyasang, a [[Nyishi language]] variety.&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt; Bangru speakers make up about 40% of the population of Sarli circle, which also has small numbers of [[Puroik language|Puroik]] speakers.

The Bangru refer to themselves as the ''taːdə'' or ''taːdʑuː baŋruː'', and to the Eastern Miji and Western Miji as ''waːduː baŋruː''.&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt; The Bangru claim that they are the descendants of one of the sons of the Grandmother Sun (''ʔaseː lədʑuwjɛː''), while the Miji are the descendants of the other son who migrated to the Lada Circle area in [[East Kameng district]]. There are five Bangru clans:&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt; 
*Pisa (''pədʑoːdʑuː'')
*Melo (''məloːdʑuː'')
*Tagang (''təgaŋdʑuː'')
*Mili (''məlidʑuː'')
*Sape (''saːpə'')

Bangru traditional religion revolved around reverence of the sun and moon ("our Grandfather Moon" ''ʔaloː ləbãĩ'' and "our Grandmother Sun" ''ʔaseː lədʑuwjɛː''; ''see also'' [[Donyi-Polo]]), but it is now being replaced by Christianity.&lt;ref name="Bodt-Lieberherr"/&gt;

'''Military supply chain management''' is a cross-functional approach to [[procurement|procuring]], [[manufacturing|producing]] and [[delivery (commerce)|delivering]] [[product (business)|product]]s and [[Service (economics)|service]]s for military applications. The broad [[management]] scope includes sub-suppliers, suppliers, internal information and [[Funding|funds flow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/10905.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms – Supply Chain Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supply==
A supply is the procurement, [[distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Maintenance, Repair and Operations|maintenance]] while in [[warehouse|storage]] and salvage of supplies, including the determination of kind and [[quantity]] of supplies. The producer phase of a military supply extends from determination of procurement schedules to acceptance of finished supplies by the [[military service]]s. The consumer phase of a military supply extends from receipt of finished supplies by the military services, through issue for use or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/7360.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms – Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supply chain==
The [[supply chain]] is the linked activities associated with providing material from a [[raw material]] stage to an end user as a [[finished good]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/10904.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms – Supply Chain]&lt;/ref&gt; Supply control
is the process by which an item of supply is controlled within the supply system, including requisitioning, receipt, storage, [[Optimal control|stock control]], [[Shipping|shipment]], disposition, [[Identification (information)|identification]], and [[accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/7362.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms – Supply Control]&lt;/ref&gt; The supply point is a location where supplies, services and materials are located and issued. These locations are temporary and mobile, normally being occupied for up to 72 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/11410.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms – Supply Point]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logistics==
{{main|Military logistics}}
[[Military logistics]] is the science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of [[armed forces]]. In its most comprehensive sense, those aspects of [[military operation]]s that deal with: a. [[design]] and [[New product development|development]], [[Military acquisition|acquisition]], [[warehouse|storage]], [[motion (physics)|movement]], [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]], [[Maintenance, Repair and Operations|maintenance]], [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]], and [[disposition]] of materiel; b. movement, evacuation, and [[hospital]]ization of personnel; c. acquisition or [[construction]], maintenance, operation and disposition of facilities; and d. acquisition or furnishing of services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/l/5222.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms – Logistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logistics versus supply chain management==
{{main|Military logistics}}
The major difference between the concept of logistic management and supply chain management is the level of information gathered, processes, analysed and used for decision making. An SCM-based organization not only having concerns with its immediate clients but also handles and forecasts the factors affecting directly or indirectly their supplier or suppliers or on their client or clients. If we exclude this information part out of supply chain model then we can see the logistic management part of the business.

[[Image:Sup chain org.jpg|thumb| The up / down stream flow of information, showing the flow of information in supply chain management vs. logistics management systems.]]

==Limitations of military supply chain==
{{main|Military logistics}}
Unlike standard [[supply chain management]] practices world-wide, some major concepts are not supported in the military domain.  For example, the "[[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]]" (JIT) model emphasizes holding less (or no) inventory, whereas in [[military]] supply chains, due to the high costs of a stock-out (potentially placing lives in danger), keeping huge inventory is a more acceptable practice.  Some examples of these are the [[ammunition dump]] and [[oil depot]].

Likewise, the military [[procurement]] process has much different criteria than the normal business procurement process. Military needs call for reliability of supply during peace and war, as compared to price and technology factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22072">The '''Olympic Oath''' (distinct from the [[Olympic creed]]) is a solemn promise made by one [[sportsperson|athlete]], judge or official, and one coach at the [[Olympic Games ceremony#Opening|Opening Ceremony]] of each [[Olympic Games]]. Each oath taker is from the host nation and takes the oath on behalf of all athletes, officials, or coaches at the currently celebrated games. While reciting the oath, the oath taker holds a corner of the [[Olympic Flag]].

With effect from the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the three oaths will be combined into one, led by an athlete, although representatives of judges and coaches will still be involved in the taking of the oath.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/athletes-to-take-the-lead-as-oaths-at-future-olympic-games-openings-are-unified|title=Athletes to take the lead as oaths at future Olympic Games openings are unified|date=12 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Olympic Oaths==
The oath taker is usually from the host country.  He or she holds a corner of the flag and recites the appropriate oath.

===Unified Oath===
Beginning in [[PyeongChang]] at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], there will be just one oath.

A representative for the athletes, judges, and coaches each recites the following lines respectively:
:''In the name of the athletes.''
:''In the name of all judges.''
:''In the name of all the coaches and officials.''

The athletes' representative then completes the oath:
:''We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play. We all commit ourselves to sport without doping and cheating. We do this, for the glory of sport, for the honour of our teams and in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism.''&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

===Previous oaths===
====Athletes' Oath====
The chosen athlete, a representative of all the participating Olympic competitors, recited the following:

:''In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them, committing ourselves to a sport without doping and without drugs, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/traditions/oath.htm|title=The Olympic Oath|website=www.topendsports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Officials' Oath====
The judge/official, also from the host nation, likewise held a corner of the flag but took a different oath:

:''In the name of all the judges and officials, I promise that we shall officiate in these Olympic Games with complete impartiality, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them in the true spirit of sportsmanship.''&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv3n1/JOHv3n1c.pdf |title=Wendl, Karel. "The Olympic Oath - A Brief History" '&amp;#39;Citius, Altius, Fortius'&amp;#39; ('&amp;#39;Journal of Olympic History'&amp;#39; since 1997). Winter 1995. pp. 4,5. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Coaches' Oath====
Beginning with the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]], an additional oath was taken by a coach from the host country:

:''In the name of all the coaches and other members of the athletes' entourage, I promise that we shall commit ourselves to ensuring that the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play is fully adhered to and upheld in accordance with the fundamental principles of Olympism.''&lt;ref name=OlyOpenFact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Games_of_the_Olympiad.pdf|title=Factsheet: Opening Ceremony of the Games of the Olympiad|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=June 2012|accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A call for an oath was announced as early as 1906 by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president and founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in the ''Revue Olympique'' (''Olympic Review'' in French).&lt;ref name=history /&gt; This was done in an effort to ensure fairness impartiality.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The Olympic Oath was first taken at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]] by the [[Fencing (sport)|fencer]]/[[water polo]] player [[Victor Boin]]. The first judge's oath was taken at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo]] by [[Fumio Asaki]].

[[Victor Boin]]'s oath in 1920 was 

:''We swear. We will take part in the Olympic Games in a spirit of chivalry, for the honour of our country and for the glory of sport.''&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

In 1961, "swear" was replaced by "promise" and "the honour of our countries" by "the honour of our teams" in an obvious effort to eliminate nationalism at the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Therefore the oath was as follows:

:''In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

This oath lasted until the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano.

In 1999, the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] created the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in an effort to form a more organized battle against doping.  Thus, the Athletes Oath was amended to include references to doping and drugs as noted in the above section.

== The Oath in other languages ==

Below are the current (as of 2018) versions of the oath in other languages. The languages are in alphabetical order by English name. The languages that are included are those of the Olympic host countries.

===Catalan (''Jurament Olímpic'')===
:''En nom de tots els competidors, prometo que participarem en aquests Jocs Olímpics, respectant i atenint-nos a les regles que els governen, comprometent-nos a un esport sense dopatge i sense drogues, amb l'esperit veritable de l'esportivitat, per la glòria de l'esport i l'honor dels nostres equips.''

===Chinese mandarin (奧林匹克誓詞, ''Àolínpǐkè shìcí'')===
:我以全体运动员的名义保证：为了体育的光荣和团队的荣誉，以真正的体育道德精神参加本届奥林匹克运动会，尊重并遵守运动会各项比赛规则，致力于一个没有兴奋剂和药品的运动会。
:''Wǒ yǐ quántǐyùndòngyuán de míngyì bǎozhèng: Wèile tǐyù de guāngróng hé tuánduì de róngyù, yǐ zhēnzhèng de tǐ yù dàodé jīngshén cānjiā běn jiè àolínpǐkè yùndònghuì, zūnzhòng bìng zūnshǒu yùndònghuì gè xiàng bǐsài guīzé, zhìlì yú yīgè méiyǒu xīngfèn jì hé yàopǐn de yùndònghuì.''

===Finnish (''olympiavala'')===
:''Kaikkien kilpailijoiden nimissä lupaan, että osallistumme näihin olympiakisoihin niiden sääntöjä kunnioittaen ja noudattaen, sitoudumme urheilemaan ilman dopingia ja huumeita, oikeassa urheiluhengessä, urheilun ja omien joukkueidemme kunniaksi.''

===French (''Serment olympique'')===
:''Au nom de tous les concurrents, je promets que nous prendrons part à ces Jeux olympiques en respectant et suivant les règles qui les régissent, en nous engageant pour un sport sans dopage et sans drogue, dans un esprit de sportivité, pour la gloire du sport et l'honneur de nos équipes.''

===German (''Olympischer Eid'')===
:''Im Namen aller Athleten verspreche ich, dass wir an den Olympischen Spielen teilnehmen und dabei die gültigen Regeln respektieren und befolgen und uns dabei einem Sport ohne Doping und ohne Drogen verpflichten, im wahren Geist der Sportlichkeit, für den Ruhm des Sports und die Ehre unserer Mannschaft.''

===Greek (Ολυμπιακός Όρκος, ''Olympiakós Órkos'')===
:"Στο όνομα όλων των αθλητών, υπόσχομαι να πάρουμε μέρος σ' αυτούς τους Ολυμπιακούς Αγώνες, σεβόμενοι τους κανονισμούς που τους διέπουν, προσηλωμένοι σε έναν αθλητισμό χωρίς ντόπινγκ και χωρίς φάρμακα, σύμφωνα με το αληθινό πνεύμα της ευγενούς άμιλλας για τη δόξα του αθλητισμού και την τιμή των ομάδων μας."
:''"Sto ónoma ólon ton athlitón, ypóschomai na páro méros s' aftoús tous Olympiakoús Agónes, sevómenos tous kanonismoús pou tous diépoun, prosilomenoi se enan athlitismo choris doping ke farmaka sýmfona me to alithinó pnévma tis evgenoús ámillas gia ti dóxa tou athlitismoú kai tin timí ton omádon mas."''

===Hindi (''ओलंपिक अनुबंध'')===
:''मैं ओलंपिक में भाग लेने वाले सभी खिलाड़ियों द्वारा प्रतिज्ञा करता हूं कि हम पूरे खेल में आत्माओं को प्रदर्शित करेंगे, ओलंपिक खेलों को सभी कानूनों को बनाए रखते हैं ताकि ये खेल और हमारी टीम बने रहें।''

===Italian (''Giuramento olimpico'')===
:''A nome di tutti i concorrenti, prometto che prenderò parte a questi Giochi Olimpici rispettando e osservando le regole che li governano, impegnandoci nel vero spirito della sportività per uno sport senza doping e senza droghe, per la gloria dello sport e l'onore della mia squadra.''

[[File:Edwardsig.svg|thumb|The signature of King [[Edward VIII]] as King-Emperor]]

The '''royal sign-manual''' is the [[signature]] of the sovereign, by the affixing of which the monarch expresses his or her pleasure either by order, commission, or warrant. A sign-manual warrant may be either an executive act (for example, an appointment to an office), or an authority for affixing the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] of the pertinent realm. The sign-manual is also used to give power to make and ratify treaties.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sign-Manual, Royal |volume=25 |page=81 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sign manual'', with or without hyphen, is an old term for a hand-written signature in general. It is also referred to as ''sign manual and signet''.

==Composition==
The royal sign-manual usually consists of the sovereign's [[regnal name]] (without number, if otherwise used), followed by the letter ''R'' for ''Rex'' (king) or ''Regina'' (queen). Thus, the signs-manual of both [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[Elizabeth II]] read ''Elizabeth R''. When the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] was also [[Emperor of India|Emperor or Empress of India]], the sign manual ended with ''R I'', for ''Rex [[Imperator]] or Regina Imperatrix'' ([[king-emperor|king-emperor/queen-empress]]). 

When the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], then the Prince of Wales, [[Regency era|became regent]] on behalf of his incapacitated father, [[George III]], the [[Regency Act 1811]] expressly directed that the prince should sign "George P R", the initials standing for ''Princeps Regens'' meaning ''prince ruling''.

==Uses==
Some [[letters patent]] are not signed by the monarch in person. Instead, the monarch signs a warrant authorizing the preparation of the letters patent (traditionally written in ceremonial calligraphy on vellum) and approving the draft text of the letters patent. Then, once the letters patent are prepared, they are sealed with the Great Seal without the need for the signature of the monarch, because royal authority for issuing the letters patent had already been given by means of the warrant. Those letters patent finish with the words "By warrant under the King/Queen's Sign Manual," to signify that they do not bear the sign-manual themselves, having already been approved by warrant signed by the sovereign.

Other letters patent, due to the nature of their contents (such as those that authorise the expenditure of money, or those that signify [[Royal Assent]] to [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]), require the royal sign-manual to be affixed directly to them. Such letters patent contain, at the bottom, the words: "By the King/Queen Him/Herself, Signed with His/Her own hand." The royal sign-manual is usually placed by the sovereign at the top of the document. These papers usually must be countersigned by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|principal secretary of state]] or other responsible minister.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In some cases, the use of the sign-manual has been dispensed with and a stamp affixed ''in lieu'' thereof, as in the case of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], whose bodily infirmity made the act of signing difficult and painful during the last weeks of his life. The [[Royal Signature by Commission Act 1830]] ([[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1820–39#11 Geo. 4 &amp; 1 Will. 4|11 Geo. IV &amp; 1 Will. IV c. 23]]) was passed providing that a stamp might be affixed ''in lieu'' of the sign-manual, but the sovereign had to express his consent to each separate use of the stamp, the stamped document being attested by a confidential servant and several officers of State.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Anson| first=William Reynell| title=Law and Custom of the Constitution| place=| publisher=General Books| date=1907| volume=II| edition=i| page=59| isbn=978-0-217-08715-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seth Govind Das''' (16 October 1896&amp;nbsp;– 18 June 1974) was an Indian independence activist and a distinguished parliamentarian. He belonged to the [[Maheshwari]] merchant family of Raja Gokuldas of [[Jabalpur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft796nb4pk&amp;chunk.id=d0e25215&amp;toc.id=d0e24657&amp;brand=ucpress The Life of a Text, Performing the Ramcaritmanas of Tulsidas, Philip Lutgendorf, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, p. 423]&lt;/ref&gt; The family began as the banking firm of Sevaram Khushalchand, one of the "great firms" as termed by T.A. Timberg.&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, Thomas, (1971), A Study of a "Great" Marwari Firm: 1860-1914, The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review, 8, issue 3, p. 264-283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5cWUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=Sevaram+Khushalchand&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ay6MyMCwfc&amp;sig=0wq-RRcxp7DdzgCAJVCu5lKfrpQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gnhuVcGrB8TutQXkzYGwBQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sevaram%20Khushalchand&amp;f=false The Marwaris: From Jagat Seth to the Birlas, Thomas A Timberg, Gurcharan Das, Penguin UK, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Das was also a famous [[Hindi]] author. He was well known for his support of Hindi as the national language of India. He represented [[Jabalpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Jabalpur]] in the [[Indian Parliament]]  from 1947 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[Is J. P. the Answer?, Minocheher Rustom Masani, Macmillan Company of India, 1975  p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

Das was a close associate and follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He was jailed in [[Damoh]] for eight months by British, where he wrote four plays ‘Prakash’ (social), ‘Kartavya’ (mythological), ‘Navras’ (philosophical) and a ‘Spardha’(one act play).&lt;ref&gt;सेठ गोविन्ददास अभिनन्दन ग्रन्थ, नगेन्द्र,  चतुर्वेदीमहेन्द्र, सम्पा.  सेठ गोविन्ददास हीरक जयन्ती समारोह समिति, नई दिल्ली, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''straw owner''' is a person who owns [[property]] legally or has the legal appearance of owning something but does so on behalf of another, sometimes for a fee, and typically solely to hide the identity of the effective [[owner]].  Most instances of straw ownership are legal, but the arrangement is sometimes made for nefarious, illegal purposes.

In the realm of [[real estate]], a "straw owner" would be the person who holds [[title]] to the [[property]], and for all legal purposes and outwardly the owner, but who acts on behalf of a hidden person who installed them as the legal owner.  Though the practice itself is legal, widespread, and sometimes beneficial to the parties involved, it is sometimes used to hide assets from the courts and creditors or used to purchase real estate for [[money laundering]] or to hide illegal gains.

'''Tai Yo''', also known as '''Tai Mene''' and '''Nyaw''', is a [[Tai languages|Tai language]] of Southeast Asia. It is closely related to [[Tai Pao language|Tai Pao]] of Vietnam, where it may have originated. It was once written in a unique script, the [[Tai Yo script]], but that is no longer in use.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; The language is known regionally in Laos and Thailand as ''Tai Mène'' and ''Tai Nyaw'' and, in Vietnam as ''Tai Do'' and ''Tai Quy Chau''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-019.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Superficially, Tai Yo appears to be a [[Southwestern Tai language]] but this is only because of centuries of [[language contact]] and it is properly classified with the [[Northern Tai languages]].&lt;ref name=Chamb91 /&gt; The [[Lao Nyo language|''Nyaw''/''Nyo'']] spoken in central Thailand and western Cambodia is a dialect of Lao and not the same as Tai Yo.&lt;ref&gt;Thananan (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tai Mène==
The Mène people of Laos claim to be from Xieng Mène (also Xieng My) in Vietnam. These two names correspond to the following two towns in [[Nghệ An Province]], Vietnam, located near [[Quỳ Châu District|Quỳ Châu]] (Chamberlain 1998).

*'''Xiếng Líp''': located at the Nam Lip and Nam Chou (Houay Cha Ha) confluence, near the Cha Ha and Nam Ngoen (Ngân) confluence (which converge to form the Nam Souang or Houay Nguyên).
*'''Bản Pốt''': located further east on the Nam Ngân.

Tai Mène appears to be related to Tai Pao (''paaw 4'' &lt; *''baaw A''), whose speakers claim to have originated from [[Tương Dương District]], Nghệ An province, Vietnam (Chamberlain 1991). Tai Mène or related languages may have also been spoken in [[Thường Xuân District]], Thanh Hóa, Vietnam by the Yo (Do) people (Robequain 1929).

===Distribution===
Tai Mène is spoken in [[Borikhamxay Province]], in many villages of Khamkeut District and several villages in [[Viengthong District, Bolikhamsai|Vieng Thong District]] (Chamberlain 1998). The [[Vietic languages]] Liha, Phong, Toum, Ayoy, Maleng, and Thaveung are spoken nearby.

'''Thermal desorption''' is an [[environmental remediation]] technology that utilizes heat to increase the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of contaminants such that they can be removed (separated) from the solid matrix (typically soil, sludge or filter cake). The volatilized contaminants are then either collected or thermally destroyed. A thermal desorption system therefore has two major components; the desorber itself and the offgas treatment system.
Thermal desorption is not [[incineration]].

==History== 

Thermal desorption first appeared as an environmental treatment technology in 1985 when it was specified in the [[Record of Decision]] for the McKin Company [[Superfund]] site within the [[Royal River]] watershed in Maine.&lt;ref name="McKin"&gt;{{cite web

It is frequently referred to as "low temp" thermal desorption to differentiate it from high temperature incineration. An early direct fired thermal desorption project was the treatment of 8000 tons of toxaphene (a chlorinated pesticide) contaminated sandy soil at the S&amp;S Flying Services site in Marianna Florida in 1990, with later projects exceeding 170,000 tons at the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear]] coal tar site in 1999. A status report from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] shows that thermal desorption has been used at 69 [[Superfund]] sites through FY2000. In addition, hundreds of remediation projects have been completed using thermal desorption at non-Superfund sites.

For [[In situ thermal desorption|in-situ on-site treatment]] options, only [[incinerator|incineration]] and stabilization have been used at more Superfund sites. Incineration suffers from poor public acceptance. Stabilization does not provide a permanent remedy, since the contaminants are still on site. Thermal desorption is a widely accepted technology that provides a permanent solution at an economically competitive cost.

The world’s first large-scale thermal desorption for treatment of mercury containing wastes was erected in Wölsau, for the remediation of the Chemical Factory Marktredwitz (founded in 1788) was considered to be the oldest in Germany. Operation commenced in October 1993 including the first optimising phase. 50,000 tons of mercury-contaminated solid wastes were treated successfully between August 1993 and June 1996. 25 metric tons of mercury had been recovered from soil and rubble. Unfortunately the Marktredwitz plant is often misunderstood in the literature as a pilot-scale plant only.

==Desorbers==
Numerous desorber types are available today. Some of the more common types are listed below.

* Indirect gired rotary
* Direct fired rotary
* Heated screw (hot oil, molten salt, electric)
* Infrared
* Microwave

Most indirect fired rotary systems use an inclined rotating metallic cylinder to heat the feed material. The heat transfer mechanism is usually conduction through the cylinder wall. In this type of system neither the flame nor the products of combustion can contact the feed solids or the offgas. Think of it as a rotating pipe inside a furnace with both ends sticking outside of the furnace. The cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically five to eight feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. With a carbon steel shell, the maximum solids temperature is around 1,000 °F, while temperatures of 1,800 °F with special alloy cylinders are attainable. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 2 to 30 tons per hour for transportable units.

Direct-fired rotary desorbers have been used extensively over the years for petroleum contaminated soils and soils contaminated with [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] [[hazardous wastes]] as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A 1992 paper on treating petroleum contaminated soils estimated that between 20 and 30 contractors have 40 to 60 rotary dryer systems available. Today, it is probably closer to 6 to 10 contractors with 15 to 20 portable systems commercially available. The majority of these systems utilize a secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) or catalytic oxidizer to thermally destroy the volatilized organics. A few of these systems also have a quench and scrubber after the oxidizer which allows them to treat soils containing chlorinated organics such as [[solvents]] and [[pesticides]]. The desorbing cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically four to ten feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. The maximum practical solids temperature for these systems is around 750 to 900 °F depending on the material of construction of the cylinder. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 6 to over 100 tons per hour for transportable units.

Heated screw systems are also an indirect heated system. Typically they use a jacketed trough with a double auger that intermeshes. The augers themselves frequently contain passages for the heating medium to increase the heat transfer surface area. Some systems use electric resistance heaters instead of a heat transfer media and may employ a single auger in each housing. The augers can range from 12 to 36&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter for full-scale systems, with lengths up to 20 feet. The auger/trough assemblies can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.

In the early days, there was a continuous infrared system that is no longer in common use. In theory, microwaves would be an excellent technical choice since uniform and accurately controlled heating can be achieved with no heat transfer surface fouling problems. One can only guess that capital and/or energy costs have prevented the development of a microwave thermal desorber at the commercial scale.

==Offgas treatment==
There are only three basic options for offgas treatment available. The volatilized contaminants in the offgas can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed. In some cases, both a collection and destruction system are employed. In addition to managing the volatilized components, the particulate solids (dust) that exit the desorber must also be removed from the offgas.

When a collection system is used, the offgas must be cooled to condense the bulk of the volatilized components into a liquid. The offgas will exit most desorbers in the 350–900 °F range. The offgas is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense the bulk of the volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the offgas is usually required. The cooled offgas may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the offgas to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.

The condensed liquid from cooling the offgas is separated into organic and aqueous fractions.  The water is either disposed of or used to cool the treated solids and prevent dusting. The condensed liquid organic is removed from the site.  Depending on its composition, the liquid is either recycled as a supplemental fuel or destroyed in a fixed base incinerator.  A thermal desorber removing 500&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of organic contaminants from 20,000 tons of soil will produce less than {{Convert|3000|usgal|L}} of liquid organic.  In essence 20,000 tons of contaminated soil could be reduced to less than one tank truck of extracted liquid residue for off-site disposal.

Desorbers using offgas destruction systems use combustion to thermally destroy the volatilized organics components forming [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[NOx]], SOx and [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]. The destruction unit may be called an afterburner, secondary combustion chamber, or thermal oxidizer. Catalytic oxidizers may also be used if the organic halide content of the contaminated media is low enough. Regardless of the name, the destruction unit is used to thermally destroy the hazardous organic constituents that were removed (volatilized) from the soil or waste.
