'''''0music''''' is the second album produced with [[Melomics]] technology. While the first one ([[Iamus (album)|Iamus' album]]) is a compilation of contemporary pieces fully composed by [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]], ''0music'' compiles pieces of [[Popular music|popular genres]], composed and interpreted without any human intervention by [[Melomics109]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Artificial music: The computers that create melodies| |publisher= BBC Future| |last= Ball |first= Philip| publication-date =8 August 2014| url =http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140808-music-like-never-heard-before/}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[computer cluster]] hosted at the [[University of Málaga|University of Malaga]]. The pieces in this album, and all the production of [[Melomics109]], is distributed under [[CC0#Zero .2F Public domain|CC0]] [[licensing]], and it is available in [[Audio file format|audible]] and editable ([[MIDI]]) formats.

The album was launched during a one-day [[symposium]] held in [[Málaga|Malaga]] on July 21, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geb.uma.es/0music/ |title=0music: music after the advent of the computer-composer |access-date=2014-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331060254/http://geb.uma.es/0music |archive-date=2016-03-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los límites de la música creada por ordenadores|url=http://www.abc.es/tecnologia/20140721/rc-limites-musica-creada-ordenadores-201407211959.html|accessdate=4 August 2014|newspaper=ABC|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Un ordenador que compone música, protagonista de simposio internacional|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/sevilla/20140718/54411247040/un-ordenador-que-compone-musica-protagonista-de-simposio-internacional.html|accessdate=4 August 2014|newspaper=La Vanguardia|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Presentación de 0music| journal= ''University of Malaga press''| date =19 July 2014| url =http://www.uma.es/sala-de-prensa/noticias/presentacion-de-0music-segundo-disco-compuesto-y-grabajo-con-la-tecnologia-melonics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''extended mediumwave broadcast band''', commonly known as the ['''AM'''] '''expanded band''', is a [[broadcast]] [[frequency allocation]]. It moves the upper limit of the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[bandplan]] from 1605 to 1705 kHz.&amp;nbsp;

== History ==
The band became officially available around 1993, but only in [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] region 2 (the [[Americas]]). It is popular with micro-broadcasting for having less interference due to fewer signals than the standard/legacy AM band.

Though supported on most modern AM radio receivers sold in the Americas, this band is usually unavailable to older receivers except for those with substantial extended coverage. In the U.S., coverage on newer radios is mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), invoking the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]].

===Police Frequencies===
The band 1600-1700 kHz was originally designated as a [[police radio]] band.  While police radio transmissions are no longer made on this band, a number of county and city ordinances forbid receivers capable of picking up transmissions on this band &lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=County of Los Angeles Code Chapter 13.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  While this ordinance is not normally enforced it can be and has been used to cite motorists in possession of amateur radio gear, or in extreme cases an AM radio installed in the vehicle as original equipment.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

== Regional use ==

=== Americas ===
In the [[United States of America]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] voted to support an expanded band on April 12, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FCC Votes To Proceed With AM-Band Improvement Plans|last=Holland|first=Bill|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 28, 1990|volume=102|issue=17|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC granted "stereo preferences" to commercial broadcasters intending to use [[AM stereo]] when issuing licenses for the band.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, such stations have never been required to broadcast in stereo. With the content of the AM band evolving more toward [[talk radio]] than music, it is unlikely that the FCC would take any action against an extended-band station only broadcasting in [[Monaural|monophonic]] sound.{{or|date=January 2013}}

The standard for FCC licensed expanded band stations has been to broadcast omnidirectionally with ten kilowatts of power in the daytime and one kilowatt at night—except for stations that use antennas with higher than normal efficiency or those multiplexed with an existing station on a different frequency. In those cases, they are, by FCC Part 73 rules, authorized for less than one kilowatt at night, generally limiting such stations to 281 millivolts per meter per kilowatt at one kilometer, the minimum efficiency for a Class B station. One station ([[KVNS]] 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz, licensed to Brownsville, Texas) operates at 12% less than the standard (8.8kW Day and 880 watts at night) due to treaty obligations with Mexico.

Because 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz (the top or right-most channel on analog radios) had previously been used for [[Travelers' Information Station]]s (TIS) as 530&amp;nbsp;kHz — the bottom or left-most channel — still is (though 530 is NOT an FCC U.S. AM Broadcast channel, some TIS stations were displaced for new expanded-band stations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} There are no AM stations in the United States licensed to 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz &lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio-locator.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz appears on many radios, it is unused even by TIS stations, except for a [[single-frequency network|group]] ([http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/licenseLocSum.jsp?licKey=2826342 WQFG689]) licensed with a [[waiver]] to the [[Hudson County, New Jersey|County of Hudson]] in [[New Jersey]]. This is because TIS stations are authorized under Part 90 of the FCC rules which deal with all two-way radio [except marine (Part 80) and ham/amateur radio (Part 97)] and not Part 73 or 74 which are the broadcast rules.

Mexico has a total of four radio stations licensed for the expanded band: [[XEUT-AM]] 1630, [[XEARZ-AM]] 1650, [[XEANAH-AM]] 1670, and [[XEPE-AM]] 1700. XEARZ (5&amp;nbsp;kW) and XEPE (10&amp;nbsp;kW) operate with nighttime power greater than 1&amp;nbsp;kW.{{mexico-inf|AM|accessdate=2017-03-07}} These stations were authorized before changes in 2014 set aside the AM expanded band, along with 106-108 MHz on FM, for social community and social indigenous radio stations.

=== Greater Europe ===
Although the extended band is not officially allocated in Europe, it is used by a number of "hobby" [[pirate radio]] stations, particularly in the [[Netherlands]], [[Greece]], and [[Serbia]], and it was used in the past by [[Vatican Radio]] (on 1611kHz).

=== Australia ===
In [[Australian Broadcasting Authority|Australia]], many {{vague|date=January 2013}} [[commercial radio]] [[broadcast licence]]s have been authorised for the extended band.

The vast majority of licences have never been used.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Due to a number of factors{{vague|date=January 2013}}, few Australian stations in this band have many listeners.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Japan ===
AM expanded band in Japan is up to 1629 kHz. 1620 kHz or 1629 kHz is normally used on [[Highway advisory radio]] and/or [[Roadside Station]] along stretches on major expressways in their country. Many Japanese AM radios can tune up to 1629 kHz, it can be found on Japanese car stereos and many radios, walkman, etc. 1611 kHz is rarely used in Japan, and it appeared on many Japanese radios.

=== The Philippines ===

In the [[Philippines]], the first AM expanded band radio station in low power format broadcasting in [[Marikina City]] is [[DZBF]] DEL Radio - Radyo Marikina 1674 [[kHz]] started in July 25, 1996.

[[File:Cole Thomas The dream of the architect 210 Sun Unedited.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Architect's Dream]]'' by Thomas Cole (1840) shows a vision of buildings in the historical styles of the Western tradition, from Ancient Egypt through to Classical Revival]]
An '''architectural style''' is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable or historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as [[wikt:form|form]], method of [[construction]], [[building materials]], and regional character. Most [[architecture]] can be classified within a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society. They are documented in the subject of [[architectural history]]. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. The new style is sometimes only a rebellion against an existing style, such as [[post-modernism]] (meaning "after modernism"), which has in recent years{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} found its own language and split into a number of styles which have acquired other names.

Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. For instance, [[Renaissance]] ideas emerged in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 200 years, with the French, Belgian, German, English, and Spanish Renaissances showing recognisably the same style, but with unique characteristics. A style may also spread through [[colonialism]], either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. One example is the [[Spanish missions in California]], brought by Spanish priests in the late 18th century and built in [[Architecture of the California missions|a unique style]].

After a style has gone out of fashion, revivals and re-interpretations may occur. For instance, [[classicism]] has been revived many times and found new life as [[neoclassicism]]. Each time it is revived, it is different. The Spanish mission style was revived 100 years later as the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]], and that soon evolved into the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]].

[[Vernacular architecture]] works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes mini account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded due to new technology and to national building standards.

== History of the concept of architectural style ==
Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]]. Important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continued the debate into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe architectural styles, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting. Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction. A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131-136; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; and a reaction against the emphasis on style developing; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entrance of Colditz Castle chapel.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The rhyolitic [[tuff]] portal of the "church house" at [[Colditz Castle]], [[Saxony]], designed by Andreas Walther II (1584), is an example of the exuberance of "Antwerp Mannerism".]]

While many architectural styles explore harmonious ideals, Mannerism wants to take style a step further and explores the [[aesthetics]] of hyperbole and exaggeration.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich, E H. The Story of Art London:Phaidon Press Ltd, {{ISBN|0-7148-3247-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mannerism is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerism favours compositional tension and instability rather than balance and clarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of Mannerism, and the phases within it, continues to be the subject of debate among art historians.

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]]&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281-5&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles. A center of Mannerist design was [[Antwerp]] during its 16th-century boom. Through Antwerp, [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance and Mannerist style]]s were widely introduced in England, Germany, and northern and eastern Europe in general. Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.
During the Mannerist Renaissance period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564), who is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Filippo Baldinucci]]'s '''''Notizie de' Professori del Disegno, Da Cimabue in qua, Secolo V. dal 1610. al 1670. Distinto in Decennali''''' (or ''Notice of the Professors of Design, from Cimabue to now, from 1610–1670'') was a major art biography of Baroque painters. Written by the erudite [[Florence|Florentine]] professor of the ''[[Accademia della Crusca]]'', it is often verbose and rife with factual errors; however, it is a broad compendium of stories about generally contemporaneous [[Baroque]] painters.

Dozens of Flemish and Dutch painters, including [[Rembrandt]], were judged to merit inclusion. Though Baldinucci may have met some of these Northern painters on their travels to Italy, the majority of the Dutch and Flemish names he included had biographical notes under portraits engraved by [[Jan Meyssens]], whose work was popular, and whose engravings were reused by [[Cornelis de Bie]] for his 1682 book 
''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]''. Baldinucci included both De Bie (in his father "Adriano de Bie"'s entry) and Meyssens in his book. The posthumous edition (1681) includes (in order of appearance in the text) and expanding list of artists:

'''Capillary electrochromatography''' ('''CEC''') is a [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] technique in which the mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by [[electroosmosis]].&lt;ref name="DittmannRozing1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dittmann|first1=Monika M.|last2=Rozing|first2=Gerard P.|title=Capillary electrochromatography — a high-efficiency micro-separation technique|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=744|issue=1–2|year=1996|pages=63–74|issn=00219673|doi=10.1016/0021-9673(96)00382-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CikaloBartle1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cikalo|first1=Maria G.|last2=Bartle|first2=Keith D.|last3=Robson|first3=Mark M.|last4=Myers|first4=Peter|last5=Euerby|first5=Melvin R.|title=Capillary electrochromatography|journal=The Analyst|volume=123|issue=7|year=1998|pages=87–102|issn=00032654|doi=10.1039/a801148f|bibcode=1998Ana...123...87C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capillary electrochromatography is a combination of two analytical techniques, [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] and [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes on the basis of their [[mass-to-charge ratio]] by passing a high voltage across ends of a [[capillary tube]], which is filled with the analyte. High-performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with [[stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]]. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and [[mobile phase]] lead to the separation of the analytes. In capillary electrochromatography capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.

==Principle==
Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) combines the principles used in HPLC and CE. The mobile phase is driven across the chromatographic bed using electroosmosis instead of pressure (as in HPLC). Electroosmosis is the motion of liquid induced by an applied potential across a porous material, capillary tube, membrane or any other fluid conduit. Electroosmotic flow is caused by the [[Coulomb force]] induced by an electric field on net mobile electric charge in a solution. Under [[alkaline]] conditions, the surface [[silanol]] groups of the fused silica will become ionised leading to a negatively charged surface. This surface will have a layer of positively charged ions in close proximity which are relatively immobilised. This layer of ions is called the [[Stern layer]]. The thickness of the double layer is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_r\epsilon_0RT}{2cF^2 }} &lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative permittivity]] of the medium, ε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the permittivity of vacuum, R is the [[universal gas constant]], T is the [[absolute temperature]], c is the [[molar concentration]], and F is the [[Faraday constant]]

When an electric field is applied to the fluid (usually via electrodes placed at inlets and outlets), the net charge in the electrical double layer is induced to move by the resulting Coulomb force. The resulting flow is termed electroosmotic flow. In CEC positive ions of the electrolyte added along with the analyte accumulate in the electrical double layer of the particles of the column packing on application of an electric field they move towards the cathode and drag the liquid mobile phase with them.

The relationship between the linear velocity u of the liquid in the capillary and the applied electric field is given by the [[Smoluchowski equation]] as 

:&lt;math&gt; u = \epsilon_r\epsilon_0 \zeta E \eta&lt;/math&gt; 

where ζ is the potential across the Stern layer ([[zeta potential]]), E is the [[electric field strength]], and η is the [[viscosity]] of the solvent.

Separation of components in CEC is based on interactions between the stationary phase and differential electrophoretic migration of solutes.

==Instrumentation==
The components of a capillary electrochromatograph are a sample [[vial]], source and destination vials, a packed capillary, electrodes, a [[high voltage power supply]], a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. The capillary is packed with stationary phase. To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample and then returned to the source vial (sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, or siphoning). The migration of the analytes is then initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an [[integrator]] or computer. The data is then displayed as an [[electropherogram]], which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different migration times in an [[electropherogram]].

==Advantages==
Avoiding the use of pressure to introduce the mobile phase into the column, results in a number of important advantages. Firstly, the pressure driven flow rate across a column depends directly on the square of the particle diameter and inversely on the length of the column. This restricts the length of the column and size of the particle, particle size is seldom less than 3 micrometer and the length of the column is restricted to 25&amp;nbsp;cm. Electrically driven flow rate is independent of length of column and size. A second advantage of using electroosmosis to pass the mobile phase into the column is the plug-like flow velocity profile of EOF, which reduces the solute dispersion in the column, increasing column efficiency.

[[File:Career Edge Organization logo.gif|thumb|200px|Logo of the Canadian not-for-profit organisation Career Edge Organization]]
'''Career Edge Organization''' (also known as Career Edge or CareerEdge.ca) Career Edge Organization (CEO) is Canada's largest provider of paid internships, engaging in connecting companies with qualified talent; while giving job seekers the chance to break into the workforce and launch their career.   CEO focuses its efforts on helping four distinct candidate segments (new graduates, new graduates with self-declared disabilities, internationally qualified professionals coming to or who have recently immigrated to Canada along with Canadian Armed Force Reservists overcome barriers to meaningful employment.

CEO tackles the "no experience, no job cycle" by offering work experience opportunities with a paid internship model that includes coaching/mentoring, on-the-job training, industry knowledge transfer, and networking as four key pillars.  Together these components offer interns the opportunity to gain the knowledge, experience and connections they will need to launch a successful career.

CEO was the first online [[Employment website|job board]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, A: ''PM appeals to business to join youth jobs plan 3,000 to be hired as $90 million project kicks off'', page A.2. Toronto Star, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Career Edge Organization is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. www.careeredge.ca

==History and activities==
In 1996, a group of business leaders from some of Canada's largest organizations committed to make a significant contribution to youth employability by developing the Career Edge Organization and Career Edge, a unique and innovative internship program. This initiative was created in response to a finding in the mid-1990s that more than 600,000 Canadian graduates were unemployed or under-employed.

In 1999, a paid internship program specifically for graduates with disabilities was added to the organization and was called "Ability Edge." Further demographic changes and skills shortages led to the creation of the Career Bridge paid internship program for "internationally qualified professionals" in 2003.

In 2009, Career Edge Organization was the first to conduct a nationwide study of diverse [[Generation Y]] Canadians, in partnership with Angus Reid Strategies (formerly Ipsos Reid).&lt;ref&gt;Marketwire (September 30, 2009). [http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Gen-Y-Speaks-Up-to-Reject-Entitlement-Label-1052415.htm ''Gen Y Speaks Up to Reject Entitlement Label'']. Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their inception, over 1,000 employers have worked closely with Career Edge Organization. In September 2010, Career Edge Organization reached a notable milestone and celebrated the placement of over 10,000 interns.

In December 2011, Career Edge Organization relaunched their online presence with a new website that takes advantage of social media and their recent rebranding exercise to unify and focus their three core programs under one web portal.

Career Edge Organization partnered with the HRPA to deliver a new specialized program for Canadian employers which allows them to achieve their organizational objectives by accessing CHRP candidates for short-term HR projects. In February 2012, Career Edge Organization also celebrated with GE Canada when they placed their 500th intern.&lt;ref&gt;Newswire Canada (February 2012).

The '''Center for International Forestry Research''' ('''CIFOR''') is a non-profit scientific research organization that conducts research on the use and management of [[forests]] with a focus on tropical forests in developing countries. CIFOR is the forestry research center of the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on agricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with governments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to problems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.  

CIFOR’s research contributes to the three CGIAR System-Level Outcomes: reduced poverty, improved food and nutrition security, and improved natural resource systems and [[ecosystem services]]. It also contributes to the new United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and commitments made by countries in the [[Paris Agreement|Paris agreement]] and other accords related to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. 

== Overview ==
[[Image:Heaquarters bogor.jpg|thumb|left|CIFOR's headquarters in [[Bogor, Indonesia]]]]
CIFOR's research and expert analysis help policy makers and practitioners shape policy, improve the management of tropical forests and address the needs of people who depend on [[forests]] for their livelihoods. CIFOR's multidisciplinary approach considers the underlying drivers of [[deforestation]] and degradation, which often lie outside the forestry sector: forces such as [[agriculture]], infrastructure development, trade and [[Investment policy|investment policies]], and law enforcement.

CIFOR has its headquarters in [[Bogor, Indonesia]]. The current Director General is Robert Nasi. It has three regional offices: in [[Burkina Faso]] (West Africa), [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) and [[Kenya]] (East and South Africa). It has project offices in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Zambia]] (Africa), [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] (Asia), and [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] (Latin America). CIFOR is one of 15 centers within the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR).

In implementing its research, CIFOR collaborates with other centers within the CGIAR — the [[World Agroforestry Centre]], the [https://ciat.cgiar.org/ International Center for Tropical Agriculture] (CIAT) and [[Bioversity International]] — to conduct the CGIAR Consortium Research Programme ''Forests, Trees and Agroforestry'' (also known as CRP6). CRP6 objective is to enhance the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape, from forests to farms.

== History ==
Although many link CIFOR’s creation to the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] because it came into existence the following year, the discussions that led to founding CIFOR predated the Earth Summit by several years. In 1991, the CGIAR appointed the [[Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research]] (ACIAR) as the implementing agency responsible for establishing CIFOR and setting up a Board of Trustees. CIFOR’s Establishment Agreement was signed by [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment Agreement for the Center for International Forestry Research|url=https://www.ecolex.org/details/establishment-agreement-for-the-center-for-international-forestry-research-tre-001301/participants/?|website=www.ecolex.org|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Agreement was lodged with the [[United Nations]] and CIFOR's legal identity as an international organisation was consolidated with a Host Country Agreement between the new Board and the [[Government of Indonesia]] in May 1993.

Over time, CIFOR increased the focus of its research on forest policy rather than on technical forestry or [[tree breeding]], in order to complement the efforts of national and private-sector institutes. Instead of having laboratories, CIFOR would be a ‘center without walls’, marshaling interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with partners to tackle forest policy changes.

== Partners ==

CIFOR works with government agencies and non-governmental organization in the countries where its scientists conduct research. Top partners include the CGIAR, European Union, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation ([[NORAD]]), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ([[Australian Aid]]), US Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]), BMZ/[[BMUB]], Global Environment Facility ([[Global_Environment_Facility|GEF]]), International Fund for Agricultural Development ([[IFAD]]), [[Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs]], [[Austrian Development Agency]], British Department for International Development ([[DFID]]), [[French Global Environment Facility]], and [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]].

== Strategy ==
CIFOR’s first strategy, set out in 1996, provided the foundations and direction for research that affected the understanding and practice of forest management throughout the tropics. But the world’s forests and the way they are perceived have changed dramatically since CIFOR was established.

Foremost among many changes is that forests are today centre-stage in the global debate on how to tackle climate change. Almost 20 per cent of global carbon emissions are caused by deforestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kanninen, M |author2=Murdiyarso, D |author3=Seymour, F |author4=Angelsen, A |author5=Wunder, S  |author6=German, L|title=Do Trees Grow on Money? The implications of deforestation research for policies to promote REDD|journal=Infobrief|date=November 2008|issue=14|url=http://unfccc.int/files/methods_science/redd/application/pdf/do_trees_grow_on_money_infobrief.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so curbing forest loss is a way to reduce global warming. Also the promotion of biofuels by governments concerned about global warming is driving forest clearance in some areas.

To respond to these and other challenges, CIFOR devised a new strategy for a new era.&lt;ref name=strat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/CIFORStrategy0801.pdf |title=CIFOR strategy 2010-2018 |publisher= CIFOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved by the Board of Trustees in May 2008, the strategy will guide CIFOR’s work until 2018. 

== CGIAR Research Programme on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CIFOR Webmaster |url=http://foreststreesagroforestry.org/ |title=Home - Forests, Trees and Agroforestry |publisher=Cifor.org |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
CIFOR is the leading center for the CGIAR Research Programme 'Forests, Trees and Agroforestry' (also known as CRP6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests, Trees and Agroforestry|url=http://www.cifor.org/crp6/|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative brings together four Centers who specialise in their respective subjects — the [[World Agroforestry Centre]] (ICRAF), CIFOR, the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) and [[Bioversity International]]. The programme will convene expertise across the CGIAR system, and will partner with research and practitioner organisations around the world.
 
Within the consortium research program, the research focus is organised into five components with the clear objective of enhancing the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape from forests to farms.

===Component 1: Smallholder production systems and markets===
[[File:Theme3-smallholder.jpg|thumb|CRP6 Component 1 focuses on the needs of smallholder producers]]

== Other major projects ==

=== Global Comparative Study on REDD+&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/global-comparative-study-on-redd.html |title=Global Comparative Study on REDD |publisher=Forestsclimatechange.org |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Over four years, CIFOR and its partner organisations are undertaking a major global comparative study on the implementation of pilot REDD+ ([[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation]]) projects.

The aim of the study is to compare how pilot REDD+ projects are working at national and subnational levels, and share lessons learned from these comparisons for the benefit of everyone involved in designing and implementing REDD+ projects. Essentially, by providing policy makers and communities with this information, the project aims to ensure implementation of REDD+ is as effective, cost-efficient and equitable as possible — and ultimately reduces carbon emissions, deforestation and forest degradation across the world, while producing benefits like poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning from REDD: a global comparative study|url=http://www.cifor.org/nc/online-library/browse/view-publication/publication/2953.html|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2009/08/25/17491830/website.redd-i.diluncurkan|title=Website REDD-I Diluncurkan|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research for the global comparative study is being undertaken in 11 countries — Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam.

===Poverty and Environment Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CIFOR|url=http://www.cifor.org/pen |title=Poverty Environment Network |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) is an international research project and network launched by CIFOR in September 2004 and completed in 2010. PEN still exists as a database containing survey data on more than 8,000 households in more than 40 study sites in 25 developing countries.

It was the largest and most comprehensive global analysis of tropical forests and poverty, and aimed to put a systematic framework of knowledge around the role tropical forests play in poverty alleviation. The project aimed to provide data on the ways that poor people depend on forest resources, in order to both inform mainstream forest policy design and to contribute to the design of policies and projects to alleviate poverty, and thereby contribute to meeting the Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction by 2015.

In order for the socioeconomic data to be uniform and therefore comparable across countries and project sites, research partners (mainly PhD students) from a number of universities and research institutes collected quarterly data at the household and village level using standardised definitions, questionnaires and methods. The study sites were chosen to obtain representative coverage of geographical regions, forest types, forest tenure regimes, levels of poverty, infrastructure and market access, and population density.

Preliminary results from the study’s global database showed that among those surveyed, forest income – on average – constituted more than one fifth of total household income, while environmental income (forest and non-forest) made up more than one fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New global study shows high reliance on forests among rural poor|url=http://www.forestcarbonportal.com/news/new-global-study-shows-high-reliance-forests-among-rural-poor|publisher=Forest Carbon Portal|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicating research ==
According to past Director General Frances Seymour, CIFOR considers bridging the gap between research, policy and practice through effective communications is one of its challenges as a research organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from the Director General|url=http://www.cifor.org/about-us/message-from-the-director-general.html|publisher=cifor.org|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is committed to sharing its research and other information with others in the research community, and also with policymakers, indigenous and community groups, donor agencies, the media and the general public.

=== Major events ===

==== Forests Asia Summit ====

The [http://www.cifor.org/forestsasia/about/summit/ Forests Asia Summit] in Jakarta saw ministers from across Southeast Asia join CEOs, civil society leaders, development experts and the world’s top scientists joining to share knowledge on how the region can accelerate the shift toward a green economy by better managing its forests and landscapes.

The Summit – organized by the Center for International Forestry Research and co-hosted by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry – was the largest in Asia in recent years and attracted more than 1,000 leading stakeholders from Southeast Asia and across the world. Thousands more participated online or through nationwide broadcasts. There were special learning events with leading global experts on the Green Economy, the Southeast Asian haze crisis, climate change negotiations and the Sustainable Development Goals.

==== Forest Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/events/forest-day/forest-day-5.html |title=Forest Day 6 - Forest Day 6 |publisher=Forestsclimatechange.org |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Main|Forest Day}}
[[File:Forest day 3 logo.JPG|thumb|Forest Day 3 logo]]

Forest Day is a platform for those with an interest in forests and climate change to come together with others and exchange views. Forest Day is organised by CIFOR on behalf of the [[Collaborative Partnership on Forests]]. It is held alongside the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] Conference of Parties (COP).

More than 1,100 people from 82 countries, including 214 official climate-change negotiators and 65 media representatives, attended Forest Day 5 on 4 December 2011 in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Day 5|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/events/forest-day/forest-day-5.html|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous Forest Days have been held in [[Bali]], Indonesia (2007), [[Poznań]], Poland (2008), [[Copenhagen]], Denmark (2009) and [[Cancun]], Mexico (2010). The 2012 Forest Day (Forest Day 6) coincided with COP 18 in Doha, Qatar, in December 2012.

==== Forests Indonesia Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooney |first=Daniel |url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/Forests-indonesia-feature/#.T1CDPq7j5fY |title=CIFOR Forests News Blog » Forests Indonesia conference |publisher=Forests News |accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
As part of the United Nations declaration of 2011 as the ‘International Year of Forests’, CIFOR convened the Forests Indonesia (Hutan Indonesia) conference on 27 September 2011 at Shangri-La Hotel in Jakarta. About 1,000 participants representing government, business/private sector, civil society and donor organisations attended the conference to discuss the future of Indonesia’s forests, which comprise the world’s third largest tropical forest area.

The President of Indonesia, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], opened the conference and vowed to dedicate the last three years of his administration to safeguarding his nation's rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests Indonesia Conference - President Yudhoyono's Opening Speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wwD-nrdpBU|publisher=CIFORVideo|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Global Landscapes Forum ====

{{Main article|Global Landscapes Forum}}

The [[Global Landscapes Forum]] is an annual conference held alongside the UN climate negotiations, to create a platform for positioning landscapes in the new international agreements on climate and sustainable development.

The events bring thousands of negotiators, world leaders, researchers, civil society leaders, business leaders, practitioners and policymakers in agriculture, forestry and development, funding organizations, and media, making it the largest, most influential event outside the UNFCCC COP. Forum participants will benefit from joining the interactive process of seeking combined solutions to the complex challenges common to everyone on the planet.

The '''chameleon''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] that couples to matter more weakly than gravity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2015/08/tiny-fountain-atoms-sparks-big-insights-dark-energy  Tiny fountain of atoms sparks big insights into dark energy] by Adrian Cho on August 20, 2015. Published at the "American Association for the Advancement of Science"&lt;/ref&gt; postulated as a [[dark energy]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;J Khoury and A. Weltman, Phys. Rev. D '''69''', 044026 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a non-linear self-interaction, it has a variable effective mass which is an increasing function of the ambient energy density—as a result, the range of the force mediated by the particle is predicted to be very small in regions of high density (for example on Earth, where it is less than 1mm) but much larger in low-density intergalactic regions: out in the cosmos chameleon models permit a range of up to several thousand [[parsecs]]. As a result of this variable mass, the hypothetical [[fifth force]] mediated by the chameleon is able to evade current constraints on [[equivalence principle]] violation derived from terrestrial experiments even if it couples to matter with a strength equal or greater than that of gravity. Although this property would allow the chameleon to drive the currently observed acceleration of the [[cosmic inflation|universe's expansion]], it also makes it very difficult to test for experimentally.

==Hypothetical properties==
Chameleon particles were proposed in 2003 by Khoury and Weltman.

In most theories, chameleons have a mass that scales as some power of the local energy density: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{eff} \sim \rho^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Chameleons also couple to photons, allowing photons and chameleons to oscillate between each other in the presence of an external [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Chameleons can be confined in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, causing them to reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for chameleons is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the chameleons produced, and then to switch off the light source. Chameleons would be indicated by the presence of an afterglow as they decay back into photons.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Steffen et al., "Constraints on chameleons and axion-like particles from the GammeV experiment" [https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5070]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GammeV experiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://gammev.fnal.gov/ GammeV experiment at Fermilab]&lt;/ref&gt; is a search for axions, but has been used to look for chameleons too. It consists of a cylindrical chamber inserted in a 5 [[Tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The ends of the chamber are glass windows, allowing light from a laser to enter and afterglow to exit.  GammeV set the limited coupling to photons in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Search for Chameleon Particles Using a Photon-Regeneration Technique|date = 22 Jan 2009|journal =  Physical Review Letters|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.030402|pmid = 19257328|arxiv = 0806.2438 |bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102c0402C |volume=102|issue = 3|pages = 030402|last1 = Chou|first1 = A.

[[File:Dialysis tubing size comparison.jpg|thumb|right|Dialysis tubing]]
'''Dialysis tubing''', also known as '''Visking tubing''', is an artificial [[Semipermeable membrane|semi-permeable membrane]] [[Tubing (material)|tubing]]&lt;ref name=York&gt;[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/york/dialysis.html Dialysis Tubing], York High School&lt;/ref&gt; used in separation techniques, that facilitates the flow of tiny molecules in solution based on differential diffusion. 
In the context of life science research, dialysis tubing is typically used in the sample clean-up and processing of [[protein]]s and [[DNA]] samples or complex biological samples such as blood or serums.  Dialysis tubing is also frequently used as a teaching aid to demonstrate the principles of [[diffusion]], [[osmosis]], [[Brownian motion]] and the movement of molecules across a restrictive membrane. 
For the principles and usage of dialysis in a research setting, see [[Dialysis (biochemistry)]].

==History, properties and composition==
[[File:Dialysis_Figure.png|right|Small-molecule dialysis using dialysis tubing]]
Dialysis occurs throughout nature and the principles of dialysis have been exploited by humans for thousands of years using natural animal or plant-based membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Separation characteristics of dialysis membranes|url=http://www.piercenet.com/previews/2013-articles/separation-characteristics-dialysis-membranes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of membrane Dialysis|url=http://www.spectrumlabs.com/dialysis/Fund.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ing|first=Todd S.|title=Dialysis: History, Development and Promise|year=2012|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd.|isbn=9789814289757}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term dialysis was first routinely used for scientific or medical purposes in the late 1800s and early 1900s, pioneered by the work of [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]]. The first mass-produced man-made membranes suitable for dialysis were not available until the 1930s based on materials used in the food packaging industry such as [[Cellophane]].  In the 1940s, [[Willem Kolff]] constructed the first dialyzer (artificial kidney), and successfully treated patients with renal failure using dialysis across semi-permeable membranes. Today, dialysis tubing for laboratory applications comes in a variety of dimensions and [[Molecular weight cut-off|molecular-weight cutoffs (MWCO)]]. In addition to tubing, dialysis membranes are also found in a wide range of different preformatted devices, significantly improving the performance and ease of use of dialysis.

Different dialysis tubing or flat membranes are produced and characterized as differing molecular-weight cutoffs (MWCO) ranging from 1-1,000,000 kDa. The MWCO determination is the result of the number and average size of the pores created during the production of the dialysis membrane.  The MWCO typically refers to the smallest average molecular mass of a standard molecule that will not effectively diffuse across the membrane upon extended dialysis. Thus, a dialysis membrane with a 10K MWCO will generally retain &gt;90% of a protein having a molecular mass of at least 10 kDa. Pore sizes typically range from ~10-100 Angstroms for 1K to 50K MWCO membranes.

It is important to note that the MWCO of a membrane is not a sharply defined value. Molecules with mass near the MWCO of the membrane will diffuse across the membrane slower than molecules significantly smaller than the MWCO. In order for a molecule to rapidly diffuse across a membrane it typically needs to be at least 20-50 times smaller than the membranes MWCO rating. Therefore, it is not practical to try separating a 30kDa protein from a 10kDa protein using dialysis across a 20K rated dialysis membrane.
Dialysis tubing for laboratory use is typically made of a film of regenerated cellulose or cellulose ester. However; dialysis membranes made of [[polysulfone]], polyethersulfone (PES), etched polycarbonate, or collagen are also extensively used for specific medical, food, or water treatment applications.

==Manufacturing==
Membranes, composed of either regenerated cellulose or cellulose esters, are manufactured through distinct processes of modifying and cross-linking cellulose fibers (derived from wood pulp or cotton fibers) to form films with differing properties and pore sizes. Variations in the manufacturing process significantly change the properties and pore sizes of the films; depending on the cross-linkages introduced in cellulose, the size of pores can be modulated. While similar in composition, most of the cellulose-based membranes currently manufactured are not necessarily useful for dialysis. Cellulose-based membranes are also widely used for applications ranging from food wrapping, film stock, or “plastic” wrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klemm|first=Dieter |author2=Brigitte Heublein |author3=Hans-Peter Fink |author4=Andreas Bohn|title=Cellulose: Fascinating Biopolymer and Sustainable Raw Material|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|year=2005|volume=44|issue=22|pages=3358–3393|doi=10.1002/anie.200460587 |pmid=15861454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For dialysis applications, regenerated cellulose-based membranes are extruded as tubing or sheets and then dried. Glycerol is frequently added as a [[humectant]] to prevent cracking during drying and to help maintain the desired pore structure. Regenerated cellulose membranes are very hydrophilic and hydrate rapidly when introduced to water. Due to their additional crosslinking, regenerated cellulose membranes have better chemical compatibility and heat stability than membranes made from cellulose esters. Regenerated cellulose membranes are more resistant to organic solvents and to the weak or dilute acids and bases that are commonly used in protein and molecular biology applications. Membranes based on cellulose esters are typically supplied wet and come in a greater range of MWCOs. Pore sizes are typically more consistent across cellulose acetate membranes.

'''Elder abuse''' (also called "'''elder mistreatment'''", "'''senior abuse'''", "'''abuse in later life'''", "'''abuse of older adults'''", "'''abuse of older women'''", and "'''abuse of older men'''") is "a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elderabuse.org.uk elderabuse.org.uk], accessed October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to, laws protecting [[dependent adult]]s from abuse.

It includes harms by people the older person knows, or has a relationship with, such as a spouse, partner, or family member; a friend or neighbor; or people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of [[domestic violence]] or family violence since they are committed by family members. Paid caregivers have also been known to prey on their elderly patients.

While a variety of circumstances are considered elder abuse, it does not include general criminal activity against older persons, such as home break-ins, "muggings" in the street, or "distraction burglary", where a stranger distracts an older person at the doorstep while another person enters the property to steal.

The abuse of elders by caregivers is a worldwide issue. In 2002, WHO brought international attention to the issue of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Daniels, L., (2003b, January/February). "2003 is the year elder abuse hits the international state." Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled. 5, 65-66, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, government agencies and community professional groups, worldwide, have specified elder abuse as a social problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rinkler A.G. | year = 2009 | title = Recognition and perception of elder abuse by prehospital and hospital-based care providers | url = | journal = Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 110–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the International Network for Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) designated June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD), and an increasing number of events are held across the globe on this day to raise awareness of elder abuse and highlight ways to challenge such abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inpea.net/ International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse], accessed June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although elders who have dementia or mental illness commonly make false accusations of theft and other forms of abuse by caregivers or family members, all reports of abuse must be investigated.

==Types==

Although there are common themes of elder abuse across nations, there are also unique manifestations based upon history, culture, economic strength, and societal perceptions of older people within nations themselves. The fundamental common denominator is the use of power and control by one individual to affect the well-being and status of another, older, individual.

There are several types of [[abuse]] of older people that are generally recognized as being elder abuse, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson, De Benedictis, Segal|title=Elder Abuse and Neglect|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|publisher=Help Guide|accessdate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Elder Abuse?|url=http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|publisher=Administration on Aging|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220071251/http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Physical abuse|Physical]]''': e.g. hitting, punching, slapping, burning, pushing, kicking, restraining, false imprisonment/confinement, or giving excessive or improper medication as well as withholding treatment and medication.
*'''[[Psychological abuse|Psychological/Emotional]]''': e.g. [[humiliating]] a person. A common theme is a perpetrator who identifies something that matters to an older person and then uses it to coerce an older person into a particular action. It may take verbal forms such as yelling,  name-calling, [[ridiculing]], [[hypercriticism|constantly criticizing]], accusations, [[blaming]], or nonverbal forms such as ignoring, silence, shunning or withdrawing affection.
* '''[[Elder financial abuse]]''': also known as financial exploitation, involving misappropriation of financial resources by family members, caregivers, or strangers, or the use of financial means to control the person or facilitate other types of abuse.
* '''[[Sexual abuse|Sexual]]''': e.g. forcing a person to take part in any sexual activity without his or her consent, including forcing them to participate in conversations of a sexual nature against their will; may also include situations where person is no longer able to give consent ([[dementia]]).
* '''[[Neglect]]''': e.g. depriving a person of proper medical treatment, food, heat, clothing or comfort or essential medication and depriving a person of needed services to force certain kinds of actions, financial and otherwise. Neglect can include leaving an at-risk (i.e. fall risk) elder person unattended. The deprivation may be intentional (active neglect) or happen out of lack of knowledge or resources (passive neglect).
 
In addition, some U.S. state laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ Nursing Home Abuse Laws (NHAL)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310015901/http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also recognize the following as elder abuse:
* '''[[Abandonment (legal)#Failure to fulfill a responsibility|Abandonment]]''': deserting a dependent person with the intent to abandon them or leave them unattended at a place for such a time period as may be likely to endanger their health or welfare.&lt;ref name="Oregon Revised Statutes"&gt;Oregon Revised Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rights abuse''': denying the civil and constitutional rights of a person who is old, but not declared by court to be mentally incapacitated. This is an aspect of elder abuse that is increasingly being recognized and adopted by nations.
* '''[[Self-neglect]]''': any persons neglecting themselves by not caring about their own health, well-being or safety. Self-neglect (harm by self) is treated as conceptually different than abuse (harm by others). Elder self-neglect can lead to illness, injury, or even death. Common needs that older adults may deny themselves, or ignore are the following: Sustenance (food or water); cleanliness (bathing and personal hygiene); adequate clothing for climate protection; proper shelter; adequate safety; clean and healthy surroundings; medical attention for serious illness; essential medications.&lt;ref&gt;Tina de Benedictis, Ph.D., Jaelline Jaffe, Ph.D., and Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., (2007) Elder Abuse Types, Signs, Symptoms, Causes, and Help. Helpguide, helpguide.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-neglect is often created by an individual's declining mental awareness or capability. Some older adults may choose to deny themselves some health or safety benefits, which may not be self-neglect. This may simply be their personal choice. Caregivers and other responsible individuals must honor these choices if the older adult is sound of mind. In other instances, the older adult may lack the needed resources, as a result of poverty, or other social condition. This is also not considered as "self-neglect".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Christopher, JD. [http://www.christopherbjohnson.com/2015/02/19/elder-abuse-neglect-self-abuse/ "Elder Abuse: Neglect and Self Abuse"], California, 19 February 2015. Retrieved on 25 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Institutional abuse]]''' refers to physical or psychological harms, as well as rights violations in settings where care and assistance is provided to dependent older adults or others, such as nursing homes. Recent studies of approximately 2,000 nursing home facility residents in the United States reported a growing abuse rate of 44% and neglect up to 95%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nursinghomeabusecenter.com/elder-abuse/statistics/|title=Elder Abuse Statistics - Statistics on Elderly Abuse Over Time|work=Nursing Home Abuse Center|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; making elder abuse in nursing homes a growing danger. Exact statistics are rare due to elder abuse in general and specifically in nursing homes being a silent condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nursinghomeabuseguide.org/nursing-home-abuse-statistics/|title=Nursing Home Abuse Statistics - Elderly Care|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caregiver.org/selected-long-term-care-statistics|title=Selected Long-Term Care Statistics {{!}} Family Caregiver Alliance|website=www.caregiver.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning signs==

The key to prevention and intervention of elder abuse is the ability to recognize the warning signs of its occurrence. Signs of elder abuse differ depending on the type of abuse the victim is suffering. Each type of abuse has distinct signs associated with it.
* '''Physical abuse''' can be detected by visible signs on the body, including bruises, scars, sprains, or broken bones. More subtle indications of physical abuse include signs of restraint, such as rope marks on the  wrist, or broken eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Lawrence|title=Elder abuse and neglect: Warning signs, risk factors, prevention, and help|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|accessdate=16 December 2012|author2=Tina De Benedictis|author3=Jeanne Segal|date=November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Emotional abuse''' often accompanies the other types of abuse and can usually be detected by changes in the personality or behavior. The elder may also exhibit behavior mimicking dementia, such as rocking or mumbling.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; Emotional abuse is the most underreported abuse of elder abuse. Elder abuse occurs when a person fails to treat an elder with respect and includes verbal abuse, the elder experiences social isolation, or lack of acknowledgement. Some indicators of the emotional effects of elder abuse is the elder adult being unresponsive or uncommunicative. Also they can be unreasonably suspicious or fearful, more isolated, and not wanting to be as social as they may have been before. Emotional abuse is under reported, but can have the most damaging effects because it leads to more physical and mental health problems.
* '''Financial exploitation''' is a more subtle form of abuse, in comparison to other types, and may be more challenging to notice. Signs of financial exploitation include significant withdrawals from accounts, belongings or money missing from the home, unpaid bills, and unnecessary goods or services.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Sexual abuse,''' like physical abuse, can be detected by visible signs on the body, especially around the breasts or genital area. Other signs include inexplicable infections, bleeding, and torn underclothing.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Neglect''' is a type of abuse in that it can be inflicted either by the caregiver or oneself. Signs of neglect include malnutrition and dehydration, poor hygiene, noncompliance to a prescription medication, and unsafe living conditions.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

In addition to observing signs in the elderly individual,  abuse can also be detected by monitoring changes in the caregiver's behavior. For example, the caregiver may not allow them to speak to or receive visitors, exhibit indifference or a lack of affection towards the elder, or refer to the elder as "a burden." Caregivers who have a history of substance abuse or mental illness are more likely to commit elder abuse than other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs and symptoms of elder abuse and neglect in care|url=http://www.advocare.org.au/help-with-aged-care-complaints/signs-and-symptoms-of-eld/|publisher=Advocare Incorporated|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abuse can sometimes be subtle, and therefore difficult, to detect. Regardless, awareness organizations and research advise to take any suspicion seriously and to address concerns adequately and immediately.

=== Signs of elder abuse ===

* Broken bones or fractures
* Poor physical appearance
* Changes in mental status
* Frequent infections
* Bruising, welts or cuts
* Unexplained weight loss
* Refusal to speak
* Signs of dehydration
* Lack of cleanliness

==Health consequences==

The health consequences of elder abuse are serious. Elder abuse can destroy an elderly person's quality of life in the forms of:&lt;ref name="Dong"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dong X | year = 2005 | title = Medical Implications of Elder Abuse and Neglect | url = | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 293–313 | doi=10.1016/j.cger.2004.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Declining functional abilities
* Increased dependency, sense of helplessness and stress
* Worsening psychological decline
* Premature mortality and morbidity
* Depression and dementia
* Malnutrition
* Bed sores
* Death

The risk of death for elder abuse victims are three times higher than for non-victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Medical Association White Paper on Elderly Health | year = 1990 | title = report on the Council on Scientific Affairs | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 2459–72 | doi=10.1001/archinte.1990.00390230019004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common abusers==

An abuser can be a spouse, partner, relative, a friend or neighbor, a volunteer worker, a paid worker, practitioner, solicitor, or any other individual with the intent to deprive a vulnerable person of their resources. Relatives include adult children and their spouses or partners, their offspring and other extended family members. Children and living relatives who have a history of substance abuse or have had other life troubles are of particular concern. For example, [[Elder financial abuse#Hybrid financial exploitation|Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04350-001|title=Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons|last=Jackson|first=Shelly L.|authorlink=|last2=Hafemeister|first2=Thomas L.|date=|website=|publisher="Psychology of Violence"|orig-year=|publication-date=2012|access-date=August 15, 2018}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; abusive individuals are more likely to be a relative, chronically unemployed, and dependent on the elderly person.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, past studies have estimated that between 16% and 38% of all elder abusers have a history of mental illness. Elder abuse perpetrated by individuals with mental illnesses can be decreased by lessening the level of dependency that persons with serious mental illness have on family members. This can be done by funneling more resourced into housing assistance programs, intensive care management services, and better welfare benefits for individuals with serious mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Physical elder abuse perpetrated by relatives with serious mental illness: A preliminary conceptual social–ecological model. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; People with substance abuse and mental health disorders typically have very small social networks, and this confinement contributes to the overall occurrence of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Elder mistreatment perpetrators with substance abuse and/or mental health conditions: Results from the National Elder Mistreatment Study. Psychiatric Quarterly, 2017 May 23. doi: 10.1007/s11126-017-9513-z. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetrators of elder abuse can include anyone in a [[position of trust]], control or authority over the individual. Family relationships, neighbors and friends, are all socially considered as relationships of trust, whether or not the older adult actually thinks of the people as "trustworthy". Some perpetrators may "groom" an older person (befriend or build a relationship with them) in order to establish a relationship of trust. Older people living alone who have no adult children living nearby are particularly vulnerable to "grooming" by neighbors and friends who would hope to gain control of their estates.

The majority of abusers are relatives, typically the older adult's spouse/partner or sons and daughters, although the type of abuse differs according to the relationship. In some situations the abuse is "domestic violence grown old", a situation in which the abusive behavior of a spouse or partner continues into old age. In some situations, an older couple may be attempting to care and support each other and failing, in the absence of external support. With sons and daughters it tends to be financial abuse, justified by a belief that it is nothing more than the "advance inheritance" of property, valuables and money.

Within paid care environments, abuse can occur for a variety of reasons. Some abuse is the willful act of cruelty inflicted by a single individual upon an older person. In fact, a case study in Canada suggests that the high elder abuse statistics are from repeat offenders who, like in other forms of abuse, practice elder abuse for the [[schadenfreude]] associated with the act. More commonly, institutional abuses or neglect may reflect lack of knowledge, lack of training, lack of support, or insufficient resourcing. Institutional abuse may be the consequence of common practices or processes that are part of the running of a care institution or service. Sometimes this type of abuse is referred to as "poor practice", although this term reflects the motive of the perpetrator (the causation) rather than the impact upon the older person.

With the aging of today's population, there is the potential that elder abuse will increase unless it is more comprehensively recognized and addressed.

Elder abuse is not a direct parallel to child maltreatment, as perpetrators of elder abuse do not have the same legal protection of rights as parents of children do. For example, a court order is needed to remove a child from their home but not to remove a victim of elder abuse from theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Beach SR, Carpenter CR, Rosen T, Sharps P, Gelles R. Screening and detection of elder abuse: Research opportunities and lessons learned from emergency geriatric care, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Journal of Elder Abuse and Neglect. 2016; 28(4-5): 185-216. 10.1080/08946566.2016.1229241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors for elder abuse==

Various [[risk factors]] increase the likelihood that an elderly person will become a victim of elder abuse, including an elderly person who:&lt;ref name=" Hildreth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hildreth C.J. | year = 2011 | title = Elder Abuse | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 306 | issue = 5| page = 568 | doi =  10.1001/jama.306.5.568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has memory problems (such as dementia)
* Has a mental illness, either long-standing or recent
* Has physical disabilities
* Has depression, loneliness, or lack of social support
* Abuses alcohol or other substances
* Takes prescribed medications that impair judgment
* Is verbally or physically combative with the caregiver
* Has a shared living situation

Several other risk factors increase the likelihood that a caregiver will participate in elder abuse, including a caregiver who:&lt;ref name="Hildreth" /&gt;
* Feels overwhelmed or resentful
* Has a history of substance abuse or a history of abusing others
* Is dependent on the older person for housing, finances, or other needs
* Has mental health problems
* Is unemployed
* Has a criminal history
* Has a shared living situation

In addition:
* Lower income or poverty has been found to be associated with elder abuse. Low economic resources have been conceptualized as a contextual or situational stressor contributing to elder abuse.
* Living with a large number of household members other than a spouse is associated with an increased risk of abuse, especially financial abuse.

Risk factors can also be categorized into individual, relationship, community, and sociocultural levels. At the individual level, elders who have poor physical and mental health are at higher risk. At the relationship level, a shared living situation is a huge risk factor for the elderly, and living in the same area as the abuser is more likely to result in abuse. At the community level, caregivers may knowingly or inadvertently cause social isolation of the elderly. At the sociocultural level, a representation of an older person as weak and dependent, lack of funds to pay for care, elderly people who need assistance but live alone, and destruction of bonds between the generation of a family are possible factors in elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/|title=Elder abuse|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and statistics==

There has been a general lack of reliable data in this area and it is often argued that the absence of data is a reflection of the low priority given to work associated with older people. However, over the past decade there has been a growing amount of research into the nature and extent of elder abuse. The research still varies considerably in the definitions being used, who is being asked, and what is being asked. As a result, the statistics used in this area vary considerably.

One study suggests that around 25% of vulnerable older adults will report abuse in the previous month, totaling up to 6% of the general elderly population.&lt;ref name="pmid18349012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G |title=The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review |journal=Age Ageing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=151–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18349012 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 |url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some consistent themes are beginning to emerge from interaction with abused elders, and through limited and small scale research projects. Work undertaken in Canada suggests that approximately 70% of elder abuse is perpetrated against women and this is supported by evidence from the AEA helpline in the UK, which identifies women as victims in 67% of calls. Also domestic violence in later life may be a continuation of long term partner abuse and in some cases, abuse may begin with retirement or the onset of a health condition.&lt;ref&gt;Silent and Invisible: A Report on Abuse and Violence in the Lives of Older Women in British Columbia and Yukon, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, abuse increases with age, with 78% of victims being over 70 years of age.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices"&gt;Hidden Voices, Action on Elder Abuse, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher proportion of spousal homicides supports the suggestion that abuse of older women is often a continuation of long term spousal abuse against women. In contrast, the risk of homicide for older men was far greater outside the family than within.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important point because the domestic violence of older people is often not recognized and consequently strategies, which have proved effective within the domestic violence arena, have not been routinely transferred into circumstances involving the family abuse of older people.

According to the AEA helpline in the UK, abuse occurs primarily in the family home (64%), followed by residential care (23%), and then hospitals (5%), although a helpline does not necessarily provide a true reflection of such situations as it is based upon the physical and mental ability of people to utilize such a resource.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices" /&gt;

Research conducted in [[New Zealand]] broadly supports the above findings, with some variations. Of 1288 cases in 2002–2004, 1201 individuals, 42 couples, and 45 groups were found to have been abused. Of these, 70 percent were female. Psychological abuse (59%), followed by material/financial (42%), and physical abuse (12%) were the most frequently identified types of abuse. Sexual abuse occurred in 2% of reported cases.&lt;ref name="ACNZ" /&gt;
Age Concern New Zealand found that most abusers are family members (70%), most commonly sons or daughters (40%). Older abusers (those over 65 years) are more likely to be husbands.&lt;ref name="ACNZ"&gt;Age Concern Elder Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services: An Analysis of Referrals for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2004. Age Concern New Zealand, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 4,766 cases of suspected abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation involving older adults were reported, an increase of 9 percent over 2006. 19 incidents were related to a death, and a total of 303 incidents were considered life-threatening. About one in 11 incidents involved a life-threatening or fatal situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Types of Nursing Home Abuse|url=http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|accessdate=13 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916212825/http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|archive-date=16 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the study called Pure Financial Exploitation vs. Hybrid Exploitation Co-Occurring With Physical Abuse and/or Neglect of Elderly Persons by Shelly L. Jackson and Thomas L. Hafemeister brought attention to the hybrid abuse that elderly persons can experience. This study revealed that victims of hybrid financial exploitation or HFE lost an average of $185,574, a range of $20–$750,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Barriers to obtaining statistics===

Several conditions make it hard for researchers to obtain accurate statistics on elder abuse. Researchers may have difficulty obtaining accurate elder abuse statistics for the following reasons:

* Elder abuse is largely a hidden problem and tends to be committed in the privacy of the elderly person's home, mostly by his or her family members.&lt;ref&gt;Administration on Aging. (1998). The national elder abuse incidence study: Final report. [Online], Available:www.aoa.gov/abuse/report/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Elder abuse victims are often unwilling to report their abuse for fear of others' disbelief, fear of loss of independence, fear of being institutionalized, fear of losing their only social support (especially if the perpetrator is a relative), and fear of being subject to future retaliation by the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;Acierno, R., Hernandex-Tejada, M., Muzzy, W., and Steve, K. (2009). The national elder mistreatment study (NCJ Publication No. 2264560.

* Another reason why there is a lack of accurate statistics is the debate of whether to include self-neglect or not. Many are unsure if it should be included since it does not involve another person as an abuser. Those opposed to the inclusion of self-neglect make the claim that it is a different form of abuse and thus, should not be included in the statistics. Due to this discrepancy and the others mentioned above, it is difficult to get accurate data concerning the abuse of the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell, P., &amp; Rosich, G. (2007). Elder abuse. In J. Blackburn &amp; C. Dulmus (Eds.), Handbook of gerontologyUnited States of America: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Measures Used to Help Protect Older Adults with Guardians from Abuse (31560997996) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=2|Graphic depicting protective measures taken to prevent elder abuse, from the [[Government Accountability Office]]]]
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel can play a vital role in assisting elder abuse victims. Studies have shown that elderly individuals, on average, make 13.9 visits per year to a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. Older Americans 2008: Key indicators of well-being. Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in awareness of elder abuse over the years, physicians tend to only report 2% of elder abuse cases.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Reasons for lack of reporting by physicians include a lack of current knowledge concerning state laws on elder abuse, concern about angering the abuser and ruining the relationship with the elderly patient, possible court appearances, lack of cooperation from elderly patients or families, and lack of time and reimbursement.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Through education and training on elder abuse, health care professionals can better assist elder abuse victims.

Educating and training those in the criminal justice system, such as police, prosecutors, and the judiciary, on elder abuse, as well as increased legislation to protect elders, will also help to minimize elder abuse and will also provide improved assistance to victims of elder abuse.

In addition, community involvement in responding to elder abuse can contribute to elderly persons' safety. In general, preventing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse helps not only the elder but it may also improve the anxiety and depression of their caregivers too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=PR|last2=Francis|first2=DP|last3=Hairi|first3=NN|last4=Othman|first4=S|last5=Choo|first5=WY|title=Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 August 2016|issue=8|pages=CD010321|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010321.pub2|pmid=27528431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities can develop programs that are structured around meeting the needs of elderly persons. For example, several communities throughout the United States have created Financial Abuse Specialist Teams,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  which are multidisciplinary groups that consist of public and private professionals who volunteer their time to advise Adult Protective Services (APS), law enforcement, and private attorneys on matters of vulnerable adult financial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Council on Aging Orange County, http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==False accusations of elder abuse==

It is important to recognize that false accusations of elder abuse are very common. An elderly person who has dementia or a mental illness may falsely claim to be a victim of abuse. By one estimate, 70% of elderly people with mental impairments such as dementia, delusions, or paranoia falsely accuse caregivers of stealing. Mentally impaired elders may claim that a caregiver is feeding them poisoned food or holding them prisoner. Websites such as Alzlive.com and DailyCaring.com offer advice for caregivers who are falsely accused of elder abuse or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alzlive.com/tips/caregiving/false-accusations-theft/|title=False Accusations--Theft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/8-ways-to-deal-with-false-dementia-accusations/|title=8 Ways to Deal with False Dementia Accusations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/responding-to-4-common-dementia-accusations-stealing-poisoning-being-held-prisoner/|title=Responding to 4 Common Dementia Accusations: Stealing, Poisoning, Being Held Prisoner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gamma-ray and X-ray source '''GRS 1124-683''', discovered by the [[Granat]] mission and [[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]],  is a system containing a [[black hole]] candidate. The system also goes by the name X-ray Nova Muscae 1991 or '''GU Muscae'''. These two orbiting X-ray telescopes discovered the system when the system produced an outburst of X-rays on January 9, 1991.

==Black hole system==

It is one of several likely black hole systems that are classified as X-ray novae. Such a nova periodically produces bright outbursts of X-rays, along with visible light and other forms of energy.

In such a system, a black hole pulls gas from the surface of a companion star. The gas forms a thin disk around the black hole, known as an accretion disk. In an X-ray nova, the flow of gas is fairly thin and slow, so the accretion disk remains relatively cool, and little gas falls into the black hole.

In the case of GU Muscae, the black hole is about seven times as massive as the Sun, while the companion is three-quarters as massive as the Sun. The companion is also cooler than the Sun, so its surface is redder, and the star's total luminosity is only one-third that of the Sun's. Its outer layers probably were blown away by the supernova explosion that gave birth to the black hole. The two stars orbit each other every 10.4 hours at a distance of roughly 2 million miles (3.2 million km).

==Spectral radiance==

During the January 20–21, 1991, outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced by positron annihilation.&lt;ref name=Sunyaev&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Sunyaev R, Churazov E, Gilfanov M, Dyachkov A, Khavenson N, Grebenev S, Kremnev R, Sukhanov K, Goldwurm A, Ballet J, Cordier B, Paul J, Denis M, Vedrenne G, Niel M, Jourdain E |title=X-ray nova in Musca (GRS 1124+68): hard X-ray source with narrow annihilation line |journal=Astrophys.

'''Grand rounds''' are methodology of [[medical education]] and inpatient care, consisting of presenting the medical problems and treatment of a particular patient to an audience consisting of doctors, [[Residency (medicine)|residents]], and medical students. It was first conceived by clinicians as a way for junior colleagues to round on patients.{{sfn|Stites|Warholic|2014|p=262}} The patient was traditionally present for the round and would answer questions;{{fact|date=April 2018}} grand rounds have evolved with most sessions rarely having a patient present and being more like lectures. An actor portrays the patient in some instances.{{sfn|Stites|Warholic|2014|p=262}}

{{quote box|width=350px|quote=Originally a patient-centered experience aimed at increasing clinician knowledge for treating unique cases, today Grand Rounds is more commonly used to educate students, showcase faculty role models, and promote collegiality in clinical settings{{sfn|Stites|Warholic|2014|p=262}}|source=Shana Stites and Christina Warholic, Chestnut Hill College}}
Grand rounds help doctors and other healthcare professionals keep up to date in important evolving areas which may be outside of their core practice. Most departments at major teaching hospitals will have their own specialized, often weekly, grand rounds. Attending grand rounds is also an important supplement to [[medical school]] and on-the-job [[Medical residency|resident]] training. Grand rounds can also be distinguished from rounds which is the (typically) daily visit by the attending physician and team to all that physician's patients on the ward. Rounding with an attending physician is an important part of medical on-the-job training and education, but its primary focus is immediate care for the patients on the ward. Grand rounds tends to present the bigger picture, including experience with patients over many years, and the newest research and treatments in an area. Grand rounds tend to be open to the entire medical professional community, whereas rounds are specific to individual attending physicians and their teams.

A 1966 report in the Australian journal ''[[Clinical Pediatrics]]'' called into question the sometimes inconsiderate behavior of practitioners who treated patients who were featured cases of grand rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dugdale|first1=A. E.|title=The Grand Round|journal=Clinical Pediatrics|date=July 1966|volume=5|issue=7|pages=453-455 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eue&amp;AN=17192646&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=9 April 2018|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video archives ==
Many teaching and research hospitals have started providing [[streaming video]] of their grand rounds presentations for free over the Internet.{{fact|date=September 2015}}  This is an opportunity for medical professionals and students to improve their knowledge, and builds on one of the core values of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] – that medical education should be provided for free, and that doctors should actively and openly share their knowledge without compensation in order to improve patient care.

Many of these organizations provide an archive of several years of recent grand rounds presentations and as such offer a tremendous resource for increasing medical knowledge and improving patient care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">'''Gruppo dei Sei''' (Group of Six) or '''Sei di Torino''' (Six from Turin) was a group of painters who emerged under the mentorship of [[Felice Casorati]] in [[Turin]] in the late 1920s. They exhibited together for three years starting in 1929. Although each artist had an individual style, they were linked together by the influence of Parisian [[post-impressionism]] and [[fauvism]], including the work of [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and their anti-fascist ideology – a position that set them apart from other movements like [[Novecento Italiano]] and [[Futurism]]. 

The six artists in the group were:

* [[Jessie Boswell]] ([[Leeds]], 1881 - [[Moncrivello]], 1956),
* [[Gigi Chessa]] (Turin, 1898 - Turin, 1935),
* [[Nicola Galante]], ([[Vasto]], 1883 - [[Turin]], 1969),
* [[Carlo Levi]] (Turin, 1902 - [[Rome]], 1975), 
* [[Francesco Menzio]] (Turin, 1899 - Turin, 1979),
* [[Enrico Paulucci Delle Roncole]] (Genoa, 1901 - Turin, 1999).

Their association was championed by art critics like [[Edoardo Persico]] and [[Lionello Venturi]] and contemporary art collector [[Riccardo Gualino]] who, together with his wife, had purchased a theater in Turin where he was endorsing avante garde music concerts, dances, art events and plays.

The six artists first exhibited together in the spring of 1929 at Galleria Guglielmi in Turin. In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in [[Genoa]] and at Galleria Bardi in [[Milan]] (later to be known as Galleria Il Milione). A combination of personal and political disagreements eventually contributed to split the group apart, along with Gualino's decision to withdraw his financial support following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and his being put under [[house arrest]] by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government. Levi, Menzio, and Paulucci delle Roncole continued to exhibit together until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Article assembled from Italian wikipedia entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Harold Herman Buls (1920-1997)], accessed 22 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a missionary in [[Nigeria]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-bul.html The Sermon Notes of Dr. Harold Buls], accessed 22 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; His collected notes include "homiletical maxims" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pericope.org/buls-notes/buls_notes_extras/some_homiletical_maxims.htm Some Homiletical Maxims], accessed 22 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and "exegetical guidelines for bible study and preaching".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pericope.org/buls-notes/buls_notes_extras/exegetical_guidelines.htm Exegetical Guidelines], accessed 22 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As an apologist for [[Martin Luther]] and the Lutheran tradition, Buls set out his view that:
:"Luther's understanding of [[Scripture]] was superb, and this made him a superb translator of Scripture. Who but Lutherans rightly understand the nature of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]]? Who but Lutherans understand faith in the manner portrayed by Luther's explanation of the third article of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]] in the [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]]? Who but Lutherans rightly understand [[Jesus]] at {{bibleverse||Luke|8:11|KJV}}: 'The seed is the Word of God'?"&lt;ref&gt;Buls, H.

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of painting''' reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ColeGealt1991"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bruce Cole|author2=Adelheid M.

Initially serving utilitarian purpose, followed by imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Eastern and Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the Modern era, the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance].

==Pre-history==
{{Main|Prehistoric art|Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Art of the Middle Paleolithic|List of Stone Age art}}

The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the [[University of Córdoba (Spain)|University of Cordoba]], Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by [[Neanderthals]] than early modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html|title=First Neanderthal cave paintings discovered in Spain |author=Fergal MacErlean|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18449711 Jonathan Amos, ''Red dot becomes oldest cave art'', BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5883082/this-is-the-first-painting-humanity-ever-made Gizmodo, ''These Are the Earliest Human Paintings Ever'']&lt;/ref&gt; Images at the [[Chauvet cave]] in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc.

Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the people that made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]]. They may be the result of a basic need of expression that is [[innate]] to human beings, or they could have been for the transmission of practical information.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Paleolithic]] times, the representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ardèche]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

If there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hoover, "Art of the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eras", from ''Art History Survey 1'', San Antonio College (July 2001; accessed 11 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important work of the [[Mesolithic]] era were the ''marching warriors'', a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], Spain dated to about 7000 to 4000 BC. The technique used was probably spitting or blowing the pigments onto the rock. The paintings are quite naturalistic, though stylized. The figures are not three-dimensional, even though they overlap

The earliest known Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings. The colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

The history of Eastern painting includes a vast range of influences from various cultures and religions.

[[Chinese painting]] is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

China, Japan and Korea have a strong tradition in painting which is also highly attached to the art of [[calligraphy]] and [[printmaking]] (so much that it is commonly seen as painting). Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, "elegant" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).

The ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art. Medieval [[Song dynasty]] painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]] and his ''Luohan Laundering''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|title=Open F-S: Sketch after Cecil Lawson's Swan and Iris|website=Freer - Sackler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100744/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (housed in the [[Smithsonian]] [[Freer Gallery of Art]]) of the 12th century are excellent examples of Buddhist ideas fused into classical Chinese artwork. In the latter painting on silk (image and description provided in the link), bald-headed Buddhist [[Arhat|Luohan]] are depicted in a practical setting of washing clothes by a river. However, the painting itself is visually stunning, with the Luohan portrayed in rich detail and bright, opaque colors in contrast to a hazy, brown, and bland wooded environment. Also, the tree tops are shrouded in swirling fog, providing the common "negative space" mentioned above in East Asian Art.

[[Image:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|left|thumb|''Spring Morning in the Han Palace'', by Ming-era artist [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552 AD)]]

The earliest surviving examples of Chinese painted artwork date to the [[Warring States]] Period (481 – 221 BC), with paintings on silk or tomb murals on rock, brick, or stone. They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 – 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 – 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.

The establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 – 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse numbers of objects, persons, or amount of activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 – 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.
[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127–1279).]]

During the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 – 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&amp;c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dachunyang Longevity Palace", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:

{{quote|
...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in [[shan shui]] style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].

Classical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.

====Japanese ====
{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}

Japanese painting (絵画) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or "[[woodcut]]s") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.

====Korean ====
{{main|Korean painting}}

Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.

The history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in "Min-Hwa", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.

===Indian ===
{{main|Indian painting|Mughal painting}}
Indian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]–[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].

====History====
[[Image:Bhimbetka.JPG|thumb|[[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], [[rock painting]], [[Stone Age]], India]]

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

[[Ajanta Caves]] in Maharashtra, India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the 2nd century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=====Rajput =====
[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.

The colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

=====Mughal =====
[[File:Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India (Mughal school), ca. 1640–1650]]
[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th −19th centuries.

=====Tanjore =====
[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.

=====Madras School=====
During British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.

Unlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.

=====Bengal School=====
{{main|Bengal school of art}}

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.

The Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

Filipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.

Early Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] Dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during the 17th-century Spanish period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2007/09/best-of-filipino-art-part-1.html |title=Filipino Cultured: The Best of Filipino Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th, and 20th century produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light. Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement. Artist such as [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature, and harmony. While other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used realities and [[abstract art|abstract]] on his work.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colours) also had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language – called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] centered on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. [[Mycenaean Greece]], beginning around 1600 BC, produced similar art to that of Minoan Crete. [[Ancient Greek art]] during the [[Greek Dark Age]] became far less complex, but the renewal of Greek civilization [[Colonies in antiquity|throughout the Mediterranean]] during [[Archaic Greece]] brought about new forms of Greek art with the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalizing style]].

[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5–6{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book of Hours]]]]
In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Flémalle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].

In Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.
Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].
This movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.

By the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea "art for art's sake" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].

[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eugène Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].
[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Pissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul Cézanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like
compositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.
The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La poésie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century modern and contemporary===
{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}
The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]].

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

[[Image:De Chirico's Love Song.jpg|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]] 1914, pre-[[Surrealism]]]]

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]],

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] — friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research &amp; Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. During the first half of the 20th century in Europe masters like [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], and [[Giorgio De Chirico]] continued painting independent of any movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after [[Cubism]], several other important movements emerged; [[futurism (art)|futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]]), [[Bauhaus]], ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) and ([[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]]) and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio De Chirico|De Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.

Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.

[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917. The term ''[[De Stijl]]'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=82|title=De Stijl|accessdate=31 July 2006|work=Tate Glossary|publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Curl| first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture| type = Paperback| edition = Second| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-860678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] propagating the group's theories. Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' — the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "...&amp;nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "ism" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

[[Marcel Duchamp]], came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for [[chess]]). After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Miró's ''The Tilled Field'' also contains several parallels to Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Miró saw as a young painter in [[The Prado]]. The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.
Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[René Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."
[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]
Max Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891–1976). Men Shall Know Nothing of This 1923 / Les Hommes n'en sauront rien |publisher=tate.org.uk |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the newly arrived in Paris and young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new [[Surrealist]] painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Brücke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. The group was one of the seminal ones, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="bruckemuseumbrucke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm |title=The Artists' Association Brücke |publisher=Brücke Museum |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'', 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.
[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.

In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his gallery ''[[the 291]].''

[[File:Grant Wood - American Gothic - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Grant Wood]], 1930, [[social realism]]]]
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, German Expressionism, Expressionism, and [[modernist]] and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] characterized the European art scene. In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian – she was, after all, an avowed communist – they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

Political activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.

The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

The Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.

''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

====Towards mid-century====
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward Hopper]] 1942, [[American Scene painting]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

====Abstract expressionism====
{{main|Abstract expressionism|Action painting|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction}}
[[File:Blue Poles (Jackson Pollock painting).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[Blue Poles]],'' 1952, [[National Gallery of Australia]]]]
Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952–53 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an "action painter" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  

During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{main|Pop art}}
Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W. W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-04401-0| pages = 119–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement.

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.

American pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London&lt;ref name="Tate_Whaam"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"[[Whaam!]]"'' and the boxed caption ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.

While in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

While throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &amp;ndash; Onrushing Waves'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmied| first = Wieland| title = Francis Bacon: commitment and conflict| year = 1996| publisher = Prestel Pub| isbn = 3-7913-1664-8| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peppiatt| first = Michael| title = เรื่องเก่าเล่าใหม่: รวมข้อคิดจากพงศาวดารและตํานานเก่า| year = 1998| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3520-9| page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p148&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
Italian painter [[Giorgio Morandi]] was an important 20th-century early pioneer of Minimalism. Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[outsider art|art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L'Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] (in English: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[fluxus]], [[neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I, (Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.

[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Fenton |title=Online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint |url=http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials |accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]] and some others like [[Mino Argento]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel, Frackman "Mino Argento create. These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.

Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Conn. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[fluxus]] movement and [[postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[conceptual art]], [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], video, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], along with the continuation of fluxus, [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[op art]], [[pop art]], [[photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[contemporary art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with color field painting and abstract expressionism, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1968 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''For William Blake'', (above) especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s artists such as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], Agnes Martin, [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like Brice Marden, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960–1979 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced a wide variety of paintings.

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against abstract painting. Some critics viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the 'death of painting'. Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]], [[body art]], [[fluxus]], [[happening]], [[mail art]], the [[situationists]] and [[conceptual art]] among others.

However still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

====Neo Expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.

--&gt;
At the beginning of the 21st century Contemporary painting and Contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas, including North America, Central America, South America and the Islands of the Caribbean, the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced creative works including architecture, [[pottery]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[weaving]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], sculpture, painting and [[murals]] as well as other religious and utilitarian objects. Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic

The depiction of humans, animals or any other figurative subjects is forbidden within Islam to prevent believers from [[idolatry]] so there is no religiously motivated painting (or sculpture) tradition within Muslim culture. Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaudí]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.

Note that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.

In present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.

===Iran===
{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}
Oriental historian Basil Gray believes "Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.

Paintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when "Coffee House painting" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

African traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kĩkũyũ]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.
Contemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects. At the Sudanese site of [[Kerma]], center of the [[Kerma culture]] that predated the [[History of Sudan|Kingdom of Kush]], a circa 1700 BC fragmentary painting from a royal tomb depicts a [[sailing ship]] and houses with ladders that are similar to scenes in reliefs from the reign of [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian queen]] [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479-1458 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hatke, George (2013).

===Influence on Western art===
{{see also|Picasso's African Period|Contemporary African art}}
At the start of the 20th century, artists like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] became aware of, and were inspired by, [[African art]].&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise.

Retrieved on 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a situation where the established [[avant garde]] was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African Art demonstrated the power of supremely well organised forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight, but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African art a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.

The '''Institute of Mathematical Sciences''' (Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas – ICMAT) is a mixed institute belonging to the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones, [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) together with three [[Madrid]] universities: the Autonomous University of Madrid ([[Universidad Autónoma de Madrid]], UAM), the Carlos III University of Madrid ([[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]], UC3M) and the Complutense University of Madrid ([[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]], UCM). The ICMAT headquarters is located in a new building on the UAM [[Cantoblanco]] campus ([[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).

The ICMAT is composed of the mathematicians belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] and researchers from the three Madrid universities. The structure and composition of the center was based on an initial selection carried out with the assistance of the National Agency for Public Education ([[Agencia Nacional de Evaluación y Prospectiva]] – ANEP) after a public call issued to all interested parties.
 
[[File:ICMAT building.JPG|thumbnail|The ICMAT building is located in Madrid, Spain]]

==Research at the ICMAT==
The ICMAT is an institute where work on a broad range of mathematics is conducted, including the transfer of knowledge and results. Initially the main fields of research are as follows: [[Mathematical Analysis]], [[Differential Geometry]], [[Algebraic Geometry]], [[Partial Differential Equations]], [[Fluid Mechanics]], [[Dynamical Systems]], [[Geometric Mechanics]] and [[Mathematical Physics]]. In addition to the inclusion of research lines in [[Number Theory]], [[Group Theory]] and [[Combinatorics]] in 2011.

Among the research results obtained by researchers from the Institute that have so far had the greatest impact, it is worth mentioning the [solution to the Nash problem in Singularity Theory http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/176-3/p11] by Javier Fernández de Bobadilla and María Pe; the [solution to the Sidon problem in Number Theory by Javier Cilleruelo and Carlos Vinuesa https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5024.pdf]; the [solution to the Arnold conjecture in Hydrodynamics http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/175-1/p09] by Daniel Peralta Salas and Alberto Enciso; the [construction of the mathematical model for explaining how water waves break http://www.pnas.org/content/109/3/733.short] by the research team led by Diego Córdoba, and the recent results on [Lagrangian transport and their applications to the study of the ozone layer http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-12-0274.1] by the team led by Ana María Mancho.

== History of the ICMAT ==

=== Background to the ICMAT ===

The ICMAT emerged from the Department of Mathematics at the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] [[Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Physics]], to which mathematicians belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] were assigned. The agreement for the creation of the center was signed in November, 2007, after assessment through the 2006–2009 Strategic Plan, to which all the centers connected with the CSIC are subject and in which the international commission recommended the establishment of a separate institute.

A look back over the long history of the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] reveals what may be regarded as forerunners of the ICMAT: the Laboratorio Seminario Matemático of the [[Junta de Ampliación de Estudios]] (JAE) created in 1915, and the [[Instituto Jorge Juan de Matemáticas]], created in 1939 by the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]].

=== The ICMAT, Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence ===

In 2011 the ICMAT was chosen as one of the eight centers of excellence in the [[Severo Ochoa Program]] call for submissions issued by the then [[Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology]] (MICYT).

Among other distinctions, six ICMAT researchers have obtained [[European Research Council]] (ERC) [[Starting Grants]], which places the Institute in the foremost position in Europe in mathematics.

== Outreach at the ICMAT ==

Every year the ICMAT participates in the [[Science and Technology Week]], the [[Science in Action (competition)|Science in Action]] competition (the ICMAT being one of the organizing institutions) and since 2012 has participated in [[Researchers’ Night]] (in collaboration with the UAM).

Furthermore, the ICMAT has launched the Matemáticas en la Residencia program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmat.es/press%20outreach/outreach/MathResidence |title=Mathematics at the Residencia &amp;#124; Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas |publisher=Icmat.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in collaboration with the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] and the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) in which international figures for the public understanding of science such as [[Marcus du Sautoy]], [[Jesús María Sanz-Serna]], [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martínez]], [[Edward Frenkel]], [[Christiane Rousseau]], [[Antonio Durán]] and [[John Allen Paulos]] have taken part, as well as the Graffiti and Maths competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmat.es/press%20outreach/outreach/GraffitiMaths |title=Grafiti y Matemáticas &amp;#124; Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas |publisher=Icmat.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at secondary school students. The blog Mathematics and its Frontiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrimasd.org/blogs/matematicas/ |title=Matemáticas y sus fronteras |publisher=Madrimasd.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an annual readership of 150,000, in addition to the presence of the Institute in social networks: Facebook &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Instituto-de-Ciencias-Matem%C3%A1ticas-ICMAT/317339304969896 |title=Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas (ICMAT) |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Twitter. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_ICMAT |title=Inst Cc. Matemáticas (_ICMAT) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2013, the ICMAT officially became a Scientific Culture Unit recognized by the [[FECYT]] (Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology), and is the only mathematical institution to enjoy this distinction.

== Location and facilities ==

=== ICMAT facilities ===

The ICMAT is located in a new building on the UAM campus and has one auditorium with a capacity for 270 people, a lecture hall that holds 140 and another that holds 80, as well as three more with a capacity of 50, 40 and 30 people, respectively. It also has a library of 1,100 square meters, a large computation area and offices for some 200 researchers. 
These facilities are ideal for the celebration of thematic programs, congresses, schools and seminars.

'''JUICE''' is a widely used{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} non-commercial [[software]] package for editing and analysing [[phytosociology|phytosociological]] data.

It was developed at the [[Masaryk University in Brno]], [[Czech Republic]] in 1998, and is fully described in English manual. It makes use of the previously-developed  [[TURBOVEG]]  software for entering and storing such data) and it offers a quite powerful tool for vegetation data analysis, including:
*creation of synoptic tables
*determination of diagnostic species according to their fidelity
*calculation of [[Indicator value|Ellenberg indicator values]] for relevés, various indices of [[Alpha diversity|alpha]] and [[beta diversity]]
*classification of relevés using TWINSPAN or [[Data clustering|cluster analysis]]
*expert system for vegetation classification based on [[COCKTAIL]] method etc.

[[File:Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Logo.jpg|thumb]]
The '''Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft''' was established in 2004 at the Department of [[nanotechnology|NanoScience]], Faculty of Applied Sciences, [[Delft University of Technology]] through a grant by the US-based [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]].&lt;ref name="kavli"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home - Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft|url=http://kavli.tudelft.nl/|website=Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kavli Institute of Nanoscience has a staff of 35 professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People - Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft|url=http://kavli.tudelft.nl/people/|website=kavli.tudelft.nl|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in [[de Volkskrant]], a Dutch national newspaper in 2012, claimed that four of the ten most cited scientists in the Netherlands belong to the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Calmthout|first=Martijn|date=October 27, 2012|title=Topwetenschapper is natuurkundige of arts|journal=[[de Volkskrant]]|page=9|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lingual luring''' is a form of [[aggressive mimicry]] in which a predator (typically a snake or turtle) uses its tongue to fool potential prey into approaching close to what appears to be a small wriggling worm.

Lingual lures are very well developed in young [[alligator snapping turtle]]s which wait underwater with their mouths open. The tongue is wriggled like a worm and fishes attracted to it are captured by a rapid snapping of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Feeding Behavior of Captive-Reared Juvenile Alligator Snapping Turtles (''Macrochelys temminckii'')|first1=Mitchell B.|last1=East| first2=Brian M. |last2=Fillmore| first3=Day B. |last3=Ligon| journal=Southeastern naturalist| year=2013| volume=12| issue=4| pages=692–702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb01022.x|title=Luring in the Neonate Alligator Snapping Turtle (Macroclemys temminckii): Description and Experimental Analysis|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|volume=50|issue=2|pages=136|year=2010|last1=Drummond|first1=Hugh|last2=Gordon|first2=Elizabeth R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lingual luring has also been noted in some species of snakes including the garter snake ''[[Thamnophis atratus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Evidence of Lingual-Luring by an Aquatic Snake| first1=Hartwell H. |last1=Welsh, Jr. |first2= Amy J. |last2=Lind|jstor=565240| journal=Journal of Herpetology| volume=34| issue=1| year=2000| pages=67–74|doi=10.2307/1565240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1643/CE-08-106|title=Spatial Ecology of the Oregon Gartersnake, Thamnophis atratus hydrophilus, in a Free-Flowing Stream Environment|journal=Copeia|volume=2010|pages=75|year=2010|last1=Welsh|first1=Hartwell H.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Clara A.|last3=Lind|first3=Amy J.|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/welsh/psw_2010_welsh003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species of ''[[Nerodia]]'' (including ''N. sipedon'', ''N. clarkii'' and ''N. rhombifer'') - here the luring is initiated by flicking the surface of water with their tongue to attract fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lingual luring by mangrove saltmarsh snakes (''Nerodia clarkii compressicauda'')| journal=Journal of Herpetology| volume=42| issue=1| pages=9–15| year=2008| author=Hansknecht, Kerry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar behaviour has been reported in the [[snowy egret]] (''Egretta thula'') which uses tongue flicking when foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of tongue-flicking behaviour by the snowy egret| author=Master, Terry L. | journal=Journal of Field Ornithology| volume=62| issue=3| pages=399–402|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v062n03/p0399-p0402.pdf|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=P.A.| last2=Buckley| first2=F.G.| year=1968| title=Tongue-flicking by a feeding snowy-egret| journal=Auk| volume=85| page=678|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v085n04/p0678-p0678.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puff adder ''[[Bitis arietans]]'' uses its tongue which is loosely wriggled like a worm to attract amphibian prey. The puff adder also uses its tail as a lure ([[caudal luring]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A lure at both ends: aggressive visual mimicry signals and prey-specific luring behaviour in an ambush-foraging snake|last1=Glaudas|first1= X. |last2= Alexander |first2=G.

In [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], '''mathematical optimization''' or '''mathematical programming''', alternatively spelled ''optimisation'', is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/index.php?page=nature.html The Nature of Mathematical Programming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305080324/http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/index.php?page=nature.html |date=2014-03-05 }}," ''Mathematical Programming Glossary'', INFORMS Computing Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest case, an [[optimization problem]] consists of [[maxima and minima|maximizing or minimizing]] a [[Function of a real variable|real function]] by systematically choosing [[Argument of a function|input]] values from within an allowed set and computing the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of [[applied mathematics]]. More generally, optimization includes finding "best available" values of some objective function given a defined [[domain of a function|domain]] (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.

== Optimization problems ==
{{main article|Optimization problem}}
An optimization problem can be represented in the following way:
:''Given:'' a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the [[real number]]s
:''Sought:'' an element &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{0}\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{x}_{0}\right)\leq f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in A&lt;/math&gt; ("minimization") or such that &lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{x}_{0}\right)\geq f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in A&lt;/math&gt; ("maximization").

Such a formulation is called an '''[[optimization problem]]''' or a '''mathematical programming problem''' (a term not directly related to [[computer programming]], but still in use for example in [[linear programming]] – see [[#History|History]] below). Many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in this general framework. Problems formulated using this technique in the fields of [[physics]] and [[computer vision]] may refer to the technique as '''[[energy]] minimization''', speaking of the value of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as representing the energy of the [[system]] being [[Mathematical model|modeled]].

Typically, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is some [[subset]] of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, often specified by a set of ''[[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s'', equalities or inequalities that the members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have to satisfy.  The [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''search space'' or the ''choice set'',
while the elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are called ''[[candidate solution]]s'' or ''feasible solutions''.

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called, variously, an '''objective function''', a '''[[loss function]]''' or '''cost function''' (minimization),&lt;ref&gt;W. Erwin Diewert  (2008).  "cost functions," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000390&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Contents].&lt;/ref&gt;  a '''utility function''' or '''fitness function''' (maximization), or, in certain fields, an '''energy function''' or '''energy [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'''. A feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes, if that is the goal) the objective function is called an ''optimal solution''.

In mathematics, conventional optimization problems are usually stated in terms of minimization. 

A ''local minimum'' 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;
is defined as an element for which there exists some &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\ast}\right\Vert\leq\delta,\,&lt;/math&gt; the expression &lt;math&gt;f\left(\mathbf{x}^{\ast}\right)\leq f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; holds; 

that is to say, on some region around 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;
all of the function values are greater than or equal to the value at that element.  
Local maxima are defined similarly.

While a local minimum is at least as good as any nearby elements, a [[global minimum]] is at least as good as every feasible element. 
Generally, unless both the objective function and the [[feasible region]] are [[Convex function|convex]] in a minimization problem, there may be several local minima. 
In a [[convex optimization|convex problem]], if there is a local minimum that is interior (not on the edge of the set of feasible elements), it is also the global minimum, but a nonconvex problem may have more than one local minimum not all of which need be global minima.

A large number of algorithms proposed for solving nonconvex problems – including the majority of commercially available solvers – are  not capable of making a distinction between locally optimal solutions and globally optimal solutions, and will treat the former as actual solutions to the original problem. [[Global optimization]] is the branch of [[applied mathematics]] and [[numerical analysis]] that is concerned with the development of deterministic algorithms that are capable of guaranteeing convergence in finite time to the actual optimal solution of a nonconvex problem.

== Notation ==
Optimization problems are often expressed with special notation. Here are some examples:

=== Minimum and maximum value of a function ===
Consider the following notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in\mathbb R}\; (x^2 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

This denotes the minimum [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of the objective function &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, when choosing ''x'' from the set of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. The minimum value in this case is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, occurring at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in\mathbb R}\; 2x&lt;/math&gt;

asks for the maximum value of the objective function 2''x'', where ''x'' may be any real number. In this case, there is no such maximum as the objective function is unbounded, so the answer is "[[infinity]]" or "undefined".

=== Optimal input arguments ===
{{Main article|Arg max}}
Consider the following notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in(-\infty,-1]}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \; x^2 + 1,&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \; x^2 + 1, \; \text{subject to:} \; x\in(-\infty,-1].&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the value (or values) of the [[Argument of a function|argument]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,-1]&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes (or minimize) the objective function &lt;math&gt;x^2+1&lt;/math&gt; (the actual minimum value of that function is not what the problem asks for). In this case, the answer is &lt;math&gt;x = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; is infeasible, i.e. does not belong to the [[feasible set]].

Similarly, 
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in[-5,5], \; y\in\mathbb R}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; x\cos(y),&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x, \; y}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; x\cos(y), \; \text{subject to:} \; x\in[-5,5], \; y\in\mathbb R,&lt;/math&gt;

represents the &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; pair (or pairs) that maximizes (or maximize) the value of the objective function &lt;math&gt;x\cos(y)&lt;/math&gt;, with the added constraint that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-5,5]&lt;/math&gt; (again, the actual maximum value of the expression does not matter). In this case, the solutions are the pairs of the form &lt;math&gt;(5,\,2k\pi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-5,\,(2k+1)\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ranges over all [[integer]]s.

Operators &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,min} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max} &lt;/math&gt; are sometimes also written as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{argmin} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{argmax} &lt;/math&gt;, and stand for '''argument of the minimum''' and '''argument of the maximum'''.

== History ==
[[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] found calculus-based formulae for identifying optima, while [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] proposed iterative methods for moving towards an optimum.

The term "[[linear programming]]" for certain optimization cases was due to [[George Dantzig|George&amp;nbsp;B. Dantzig]], although much of the theory had been introduced by [[Leonid Kantorovich]] in 1939. (''Programming'' in this context does not refer to [[computer programming]], but from the use of ''program'' by the United States military to refer to proposed training and [[logistics]] schedules, which were the problems Dantzig studied at that time.) Dantzig published the [[Simplex algorithm]] in 1947, and [[John von Neumann]] developed the theory of [[Linear programming#Duality|duality]] in the same year.

== Major subfields ==
* [[Convex programming]] studies the case when the objective function is [[convex function|convex]] (minimization) or [[Concave function|concave]] (maximization) and the constraint set is [[convex set|convex]]. This can be viewed as a particular case of nonlinear programming or as generalization of linear or convex quadratic programming.
** [[Linear programming]] (LP), a type of convex programming, studies the case in which the objective function ''f'' is linear and the constraints are specified using only linear equalities and inequalities. Such a constraint set is called a [[polyhedron]] or a [[polytope]] if it is [[Bounded set|bounded]].
** [[Second order cone programming]] (SOCP) is a convex program, and includes certain types of quadratic programs.
** [[Semidefinite programming]] (SDP) is a subfield of convex optimization where the underlying variables are [[semidefinite]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. It is a generalization of linear and convex quadratic programming.
** [[Conic programming]] is a general form of convex programming.  LP, SOCP and SDP can all be viewed as conic programs with the appropriate type of cone.
** [[Geometric programming]] is a technique whereby objective and inequality constraints expressed as [[posynomials]] and equality constraints as [[monomials]] can be transformed into a convex program.
* [[Integer programming]] studies linear programs in which some or all variables are constrained to take on [[integer]] values.  This is not convex, and in general much more difficult than regular linear programming.
* [[Quadratic programming]] allows the objective function to have quadratic terms, while the feasible set must be specified with linear equalities and inequalities.  For specific forms of the quadratic term, this is a type of convex programming.
* [[Fractional programming]] studies optimization of ratios of two nonlinear functions. The special class of concave fractional programs can be transformed to a convex optimization problem.
* [[Nonlinear programming]] studies the general case in which the objective function or the constraints or both contain nonlinear parts.  This may or may not be a convex program. In general, whether the program is convex affects the difficulty of solving it.
* [[Stochastic programming]] studies the case in which some of the constraints or parameters depend on [[random variable]]s.
* [[Robust optimization|Robust programming]] is, like stochastic programming, an attempt to capture uncertainty in the data underlying the optimization problem. Robust optimization targets to find solutions that are valid under all possible realizations of the uncertainties. 
* [[Combinatorial optimization]] is concerned with problems where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] one.
* [[Stochastic optimization]] is used with random (noisy) function measurements or random inputs in the search process.
* [[Infinite-dimensional optimization]] studies the case when the set of feasible solutions is a subset of an infinite-[[dimension]]al space, such as a space of functions.
* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristics]] and [[metaheuristic]]s make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized. Usually, heuristics do not guarantee that any optimal solution need be found. On the other hand, heuristics are used to find approximate solutions for many complicated optimization problems.
* [[Constraint satisfaction]] studies the case in which the objective function ''f'' is constant (this is used in [[artificial intelligence]], particularly in [[automated reasoning]]).
** [[Constraint programming]] is a programming paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints. 
* Disjunctive programming is used where at least one constraint must be satisfied but not all. It is of particular use in scheduling.
* [[Space mapping]] is a concept for modeling and optimization of an engineering system to high-fidelity (fine) model accuracy exploiting a suitable physically meaningful coarse or [[surrogate model]].

In a number of subfields, the techniques are designed primarily for optimization in dynamic contexts (that is, decision making over time):
* [[Calculus of variations]] seeks to optimize an action integral over some space to an extremum by varying a function of the coordinates.
* [[Optimal control]] theory is a generalization of the calculus of variations which introduces control policies.
* [[Dynamic programming]] studies the case in which the optimization strategy is based on splitting the problem into smaller subproblems. The equation that describes the relationship between these subproblems is called the [[Bellman equation]].
* [[Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints]] is where the constraints include [[variational inequalities]] or  [[complementarity theory|complementarities]].

=== Multi-objective optimization ===
{{Main article|Multi-objective optimization}}
Adding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity. For example, to optimize a structural design, one would desire a design that is both light and rigid. When two objectives conflict, a trade-off must be created. There may be one lightest design, one stiffest design, and an infinite number of designs that are some compromise of weight and rigidity. The set of trade-off designs that cannot be improved upon according to one criterion without hurting another criterion is known as the [[Pareto set]]. The curve created plotting weight against stiffness of the best designs is known as the [[Pareto frontier]].

A design is judged to be "Pareto optimal" (equivalently, "Pareto efficient" or in the Pareto set) if it is not dominated by any other design: If it is worse than another design in some respects and no better in any respect, then it is dominated and is not Pareto optimal.

The choice among "Pareto optimal" solutions to determine the "favorite solution" is delegated to the decision maker. In other words, defining the problem as multi-objective optimization signals that some information is missing: desirable objectives are given but combinations of them are not rated relative to each other. In some cases, the missing information can be derived by interactive sessions with the decision maker.

Multi-objective optimization problems have been generalized further into [[vector optimization]] problems where the (partial) ordering is no longer given by the Pareto ordering.

=== Multi-modal optimization ===
Optimization problems are often multi-modal; that is, they possess multiple good solutions. They could all be globally good (same cost function value) or there could be a mix of globally good and locally good solutions. Obtaining all (or at least some of) the multiple solutions is the goal of a multi-modal optimizer.

Classical optimization techniques due to their iterative approach do not perform satisfactorily when they are used to obtain multiple solutions, since it is not guaranteed that different solutions will be obtained even with different starting points in multiple runs of the algorithm. [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s, however, are a very popular approach to obtain multiple solutions in a multi-modal optimization task.

== Classification of critical points and extrema ==

=== Feasibility problem ===
The '''[[satisfiability problem]]''', also called the '''feasibility problem''', is just the problem of finding any [[feasible solution]] at all without regard to objective value. This can be regarded as the special case of mathematical optimization where the objective value is the same for every solution, and thus any solution is optimal.

Many optimization algorithms need to start from a feasible point. One way to obtain such a point is to [[Relaxation (approximation)|relax]] the feasibility conditions using a [[slack variable]]; with enough slack, any starting point is feasible. Then, minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative.

=== Existence ===
The [[extreme value theorem]] of [[Karl Weierstrass]] states that a continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum value. More generally, a lower semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its minimum; an upper semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its maximum.

=== Necessary conditions for optimality ===
[[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|One of Fermat's theorems]] states that optima of unconstrained problems are found at [[stationary point]]s, where the first derivative or the gradient of the objective function is zero (see [[first derivative test]]). More generally, they may be found at [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]], where the first derivative or gradient of the objective function is zero or is undefined, or on the boundary of the choice set. An equation (or set of equations) stating that the first derivative(s) equal(s) zero at an interior optimum is called a 'first-order condition' or a set of first-order conditions.

Optima of equality-constrained problems can be found by the [[Lagrange multiplier]] method. The optima of problems with equality and/or inequality constraints can be found using the '[[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]]'.

=== Sufficient conditions for optimality ===
While the first derivative test identifies points that might be extrema, this test does not distinguish a point that is a minimum from one that is a maximum or one that is neither. When the objective function is twice differentiable, these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second derivatives (called the [[Hessian matrix]]) in unconstrained problems, or the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function and the constraints called the [[Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian|bordered Hessian]] in constrained problems. The conditions that distinguish maxima, or minima, from other stationary points are called 'second-order conditions' (see '[[Second derivative test]]'). If a candidate solution satisfies the first-order conditions, then satisfaction of the second-order conditions as well is sufficient to establish at least local optimality.

=== Sensitivity and continuity of optima ===
The [[envelope theorem]] describes how the value of an optimal solution changes when an underlying [[parameter]] changes. The process of computing this change is called [[comparative statics]].

The [[maximum theorem]] of [[Claude Berge]] (1963) describes the continuity of an optimal solution as a function of underlying parameters.

===Calculus of optimization===
{{Main article|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions}}
{{See also|Critical point (mathematics)|Differential calculus|Gradient|Hessian matrix|Positive definite matrix|Lipschitz continuity|Rademacher's theorem|Convex function|Convex analysis}}

For unconstrained problems with twice-differentiable functions, some [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s can be found by finding the points where the [[gradient]] of the objective function is zero (that is, the stationary points). More generally, a zero [[subgradient]] certifies that a local minimum has been found for [[convex optimization|minimization problems with convex]] [[convex function|function]]s and other [[Rademacher's theorem|locally]] [[Lipschitz function]]s.

Further, critical points can be classified  using the [[positive definite matrix|definiteness]] of the [[Hessian matrix]]: If the Hessian is ''positive'' definite at a critical point, then the point is a local minimum; if the Hessian matrix is negative definite, then the point is a local maximum; finally, if indefinite, then the point is some kind of [[saddle point]].

Constrained problems can often be transformed into unconstrained problems with the help of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s. [[Lagrangian relaxation]] can also provide approximate solutions to difficult constrained problems.

When the objective function is [[Convex function|convex]], then any local minimum will also be a global minimum. There exist efficient numerical techniques for minimizing convex functions, such as [[interior-point method]]s.

== Computational optimization techniques ==

To solve problems, researchers may use [[algorithm]]s that terminate in a finite number of steps, or [[iterative method]]s that converge to a solution (on some specified class of problems), or [[heuristic algorithm|heuristics]] that may provide approximate solutions to some problems (although their iterates need not converge).

'''Introduction'''



An optimization algorithm is a procedure which is executed iteratively by comparing various solutions till an optimum or a satisfactory solution will be found. Optimization algorithms help us to minimize or maximize an objective function  E(x) which is simply a mathematical function dependent on the Model’s internal parameters which are used in computing the target values(Y) from the set of predictors(X) used in the model. There are two types of optimization algorithms which are widely used such as Zero-order algorithms, First Order Optimization Algorithms and Second Order Optimization Algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Optimization Methods. Department of Mechanical Engineering. India Institute of Technology Madras. Retrieved from https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-optimization-algorithms-used-in-neural-networks-and-ways-to-optimize-gradient-95ae5d39529f&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero-order algorithms&lt;ref&gt;Walia,A(2017). Types of Optimization Algorithms used in Neural Networks and Ways to Optimize Gradient Descent. Retrieved from towardsdatascience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero-order (or derivative-free) algorithms use only the criterion value at some positions. It is popular when the gradient and Hessian information are difficult to obtain, e.g., no explicit function forms are given.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ruffio , D. Saury, D. Petit, M.Girault. Zero-Order optimization algorithms. Retrieved from http://www.sft.asso.fr/Local/sft/dir/user-3775/documents/actes/Metti5_School/Lectures&amp;Tutorials-Texts/Text-T2-Ruffio.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


'''First Order Optimization Algorithms'''&lt;ref&gt;Walia,A(2017). Types of Optimization Algorithms used in Neural Networks and Ways to Optimize Gradient Descent. Retrieved from towardsdatascience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

These algorithms minimize or maximize a Loss function E(x) using its Gradient values with respect to the parameters. Most widely used First order optimization algorithm is Gradient Descent.  The First order derivative displays whether the function is decreasing or increasing at a particular point. First order Derivative basically will provide us a line which is tangential to a point on its Error Surface.&lt;ref&gt;Ye.Y. Zero-Order and First-Order Optimization Algorithms I.

''Example''

''Gradient descent''

It is a first order optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. 

θ=θ−η⋅∇J(θ) — it is the formula of the parameter updates, where ‘η’ is the learning rate ,’∇J(θ)’ is the Gradient of Loss function-J(θ) w.r.t parameters-‘θ’.

It is the most popular Optimization algorithms used in optimizing a Neural Network. Now gradient descent is majorly used to do Weights updates in a Neural Network Model , i.e update and tune the Model’s parameters in a direction so that we can minimize the Loss function. Now we all know a Neural Network trains via a famous technique called Back-propagation , in which propagating forward calculating the dot product of Inputs signals and their corresponding Weights and then applying a activation function to those sum of products, which transforms the input signal to an output signal and also is important to model complex Non-linear functions and introduces Non-linearity to the Model which enables the Model to learn almost any arbitrary functional mapping.&lt;ref&gt;Evans.J (1992). Optimization algorithms for networks and graphs. CRC Press 2nd edition. &lt;/ref&gt;



'''Second Order Optimization Algorithms'''&lt;ref&gt;Walia,A(2017). Types of Optimization Algorithms used in Neural Networks and Ways to Optimize Gradient Descent. Retrieved from towardsdatascience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-order methods use the second order derivative which is also called Hessian to minimize or maximize the loss function.The Hessian is a Matrix of Second Order Partial Derivatives. Since the second derivative is costly to compute, the second order is not used much. The second order derivative informs us whether the first derivative is increasing or decreasing which hints at the function’s curvature.It also provides us with a quadratic surface which touches the curvature of the Error Surface.&lt;ref&gt;Manson.L, Baxter,J, Bartlett.P, &amp; Fream.M. Boosting algorithms as gradient descent. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Iterative methods===
{{Main article|Iterative method}}
{{See also|Newton's method in optimization|Quasi-Newton method|Finite difference|Approximation theory|Numerical analysis}}

The [[iterative methods]] used to solve problems of [[nonlinear programming]] differ according to whether they [[subroutine|evaluate]] [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]], gradients, or only function values. While evaluating Hessians (H) and gradients (G) improves the rate of convergence, for functions for which these quantities exist and vary sufficiently smoothly, such evaluations increase the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] (or computational cost) of each iteration. In some cases, the computational complexity may be excessively high.

One major criterion for optimizers is just the number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort, usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself, which mainly has to operate over the N variables.
The derivatives provide detailed information for such optimizers, but are even harder to calculate, e.g. approximating the gradient takes at least N+1 function evaluations. For approximations of the 2nd derivatives (collected in the Hessian matrix) the number of function evaluations is in the order of N². Newton's method requires the 2nd order derivates, so for each iteration the number of function calls is in the order of N², but for a simpler pure gradient optimizer it is only N. However, gradient optimizers need usually more iterations than Newton's algorithm. Which one is best with respect to the number of function calls depends on the problem itself.

* Methods that evaluate Hessians (or approximate Hessians, using [[finite difference]]s):
** [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton's method]]
** [[Sequential quadratic programming]]: A Newton-based method for small-medium scale ''constrained'' problems. Some versions can handle large-dimensional problems.
** [[Interior point methods]]: This is a large class of methods for constrained optimization. Some interior-point  methods use only (sub)gradient information, and others of which require the evaluation of Hessians.
* Methods that evaluate gradients, or approximate gradients in some way (or even subgradients):
** [[Coordinate descent]] methods: Algorithms which update a single coordinate in each iteration
** [[Conjugate gradient method]]s: [[Iterative method]]s for large problems. (In theory, these methods terminate in a finite number of steps with quadratic objective functions, but this finite termination is not observed in practice on finite–precision computers.)
** [[Gradient descent]] (alternatively, "steepest descent" or "steepest ascent"): A (slow) method of historical and theoretical interest, which has had renewed interest for finding approximate solutions of enormous problems.
** [[Subgradient method]]s - An iterative method for large [[Rademacher's theorem|locally]] [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz function]]s using [[subgradient|generalized gradient]]s. Following Boris T. Polyak, subgradient–projection methods are similar to conjugate–gradient methods.
** Bundle method of descent: An iterative method for small–medium-sized problems with locally Lipschitz functions, particularly for [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] problems.  (Similar to conjugate gradient methods)
** [[Ellipsoid method]]: An iterative method for small problems with [[quasiconvex function|quasiconvex]] objective functions and of great theoretical interest, particularly in establishing the polynomial time complexity of some combinatorial optimization problems. It has similarities with Quasi-Newton methods.
** [[Frank–Wolfe algorithm|Conditional gradient method (Frank–Wolfe)]] for approximate minimization of specially structured problems with [[linear constraints]], especially with traffic networks. For general unconstrained problems, this method reduces to the gradient method, which is regarded as obsolete (for almost all problems).
** [[Quasi-Newton method]]s: Iterative methods for medium-large problems (e.g. N&lt;1000).
** [[Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation]] (SPSA) method for stochastic optimization; uses random (efficient) gradient approximation.
* Methods that evaluate only function values: If a problem is continuously differentiable, then gradients can be approximated using finite differences, in which case a gradient-based method can be used.
** [[Interpolation]] methods
** [[Pattern search (optimization)|Pattern search]] methods, which have better convergence properties than the [[Nelder–Mead method|Nelder–Mead heuristic (with simplices)]], which is listed below.

===Global convergence===
More generally, if the objective function is not a quadratic function, then many optimization methods use other methods to ensure that some subsequence of iterations converges to an optimal solution. The first and still popular method for ensuring convergence relies on [[line search]]es, which optimize a function along one dimension. A second and increasingly popular method for ensuring convergence uses [[trust region]]s. Both line searches and trust regions are used in modern methods of [[subgradient method|non-differentiable optimization]]. Usually a global optimizer is much slower than advanced local optimizers (such as [[BFGS method|BFGS]]), so often an efficient global optimizer can be constructed by starting the local optimizer from different starting points.

===Heuristics===
{{Main article|Heuristic algorithm}}

Besides (finitely terminating) [[algorithm]]s and (convergent) [[iterative method]]s, there are [[heuristic algorithm|heuristics]]. A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations. List of some well-known heuristics:

== Applications ==

===Mechanics===
Problems in [[rigid body dynamics]] (in particular articulated rigid body dynamics) often require mathematical programming techniques, since you can view rigid body dynamics as attempting to solve an [[ordinary differential equation]] on a constraint manifold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.F. |last=Vereshchagin |title=Modelling and control of motion of manipulation robots |journal=Soviet Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=29–38 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the constraints are various nonlinear geometric constraints such as "these two points must always coincide", "this surface must not penetrate any other", or "this point must always lie somewhere on this curve". Also, the problem of computing contact forces can be done by solving a [[linear complementarity problem]], which can also be viewed as a QP (quadratic programming) problem.

Many design problems can also be expressed as optimization programs. This application is called design optimization. One subset is the [[engineering optimization]], and another recent and growing subset of this field is [[multidisciplinary design optimization]], which, while useful in many problems, has in particular been applied to [[aerospace engineering]] problems.

This approach may be applied in cosmology and astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Haggag|first2=F. |last2=Desokey|first3=M., |last3=Ramadan   |title=A cosmological inflationary model using optimal control |journal= Gravitation and Cosmology|location= |publisher=Pleiades Publishing|volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=236–239 |year=2017 |ISSN=1995-0721 | doi=10.1134/S0202289317030069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics and finance===
[[Economics]] is closely enough linked to optimization of [[agent (economics)|agents]] that an influential definition relatedly describes economics ''qua'' science as the "study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and [[scarce]] means" with alternative uses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Robbins]] (1935, 2nd ed.) ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science#Major propositions|An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', Macmillan, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern optimization theory includes traditional optimization theory but also overlaps with [[game theory]] and the study of economic [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibria]]. The ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|codes]] classify mathematical programming, optimization techniques, and related topics under [[JEL classification codes#Mathematical and quantitative methods JEL: C Subcategories|JEL:C61-C63]].

In microeconomics, the [[utility maximization problem]] and its [[dual problem]], the [[expenditure minimization problem]], are economic optimization problems. Insofar as they behave consistently, [[consumer]]s are assumed to maximize their [[utility]], while [[firm]]s are usually assumed to maximize their [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Also, agents are often modeled as being [[Risk aversion|risk-averse]], thereby preferring to avoid risk. [[Asset pricing|Asset prices]] are also modeled using optimization theory, though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing [[stochastic process]]es rather than on static optimization. [[International trade theory]] also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations. The optimization of [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]] is an example of multi-objective optimization in economics.

Since the 1970s, economists have modeled dynamic decisions over time using [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Dorfman |authorlink=Robert Dorfman |title=An Economic Interpretation of Optimal Control Theory |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |year=1969 |pages=817–831 |jstor=1810679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dynamic [[search theory|search model]]s are used to study [[labor economics|labor-market behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas J. |last=Sargent |authorlink=Thomas J.

Optimization has been widely used in civil engineering. The most common civil engineering problems that are solved by optimization are cut and fill of roads, life-cycle analysis of structures and infrastructures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12205-017-0531-z Piryonesi, S. M., &amp; Tavakolan, M. (2017). A mathematical programming model for solving cost-safety optimization (CSO) problems in the maintenance of structures. KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 1-10.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource leveling]]&lt;ref&gt;Hegazy, T., (1999) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tarek_Hegazy/publication/245283201_Optimization_of_Resource_Allocation_and_Leveling_Using_Genetic_Algorithms/links/576afb7008aefcf135bd51a8.pdf Optimization of Resource Allocation and Leveling Using Genetic Algorithms], Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, ASCE, Vol. 125, No. 3, pp 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt; and schedule optimization.

===Operations research===
Another field that uses optimization techniques extensively is [[operations research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New force on the political scene: the Seophonisten |url=http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |publisher=http://www.seophonist-wahl.de |accessdate=14 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218090504/http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations research also uses stochastic modeling and simulation to support improved decision-making. Increasingly, operations research uses [[stochastic programming]] to model dynamic decisions that adapt to events; such problems can be solved with large-scale optimization and [[stochastic optimization]] methods.

===Control engineering===
Mathematical optimization is used in much modern controller design. High-level controllers such as [[model predictive control]] (MPC) or real-time optimization (RTO) employ mathematical optimization. These algorithms run online and repeatedly determine values for decision variables, such as choke openings in a process plant, by iteratively solving a mathematical optimization problem including constraints and a model of the system to be controlled.

===Geophysics===
Optimization techniques are regularly used in [[geophysics|geophysical]] parameter estimation problems. Given a set of geophysical measurements, e.g. [[seismology|seismic recordings]], it is common to solve for the [[mineral physics|physical properties]] and [[structure of the earth|geometrical shapes]] of the underlying rocks and fluids.

===Molecular modeling===
{{main article|Molecular modeling}}
Nonlinear optimization methods are widely used in [[conformational analysis]].

===Computational systems biology===

===Relaxation (extension method)===
Methods to obtain suitable (in some sense) natural extensions of optimization problems that otherwise lack of existence or stability of solutions to obtain problems with guaranteed existence of solutions and their stability in some sense (typically under various perturbation of data) are in general called relaxation. Solutions of such extended (=relaxed) problems in some sense characterizes (at least certain features) of the original problems, e.g. as far as their optimizing sequences concerns. Relaxed problems may also possesses their own natural linear structure that may yield specific optimality conditions different from optimality conditions for the original problems.

'''Muscle atrophy''' is defined as a decrease in the mass of the [[muscle]]; it can be a partial or complete [[wasting]] away of muscle, and is most commonly experienced when persons suffer temporary disabling circumstances such as being restricted in movement and/or confined to bed as when hospitalized. When a muscle atrophies, this leads to [[muscle weakness]], since the ability to exert force is related to mass. Modern medicine's understanding of the quick onset of muscle atrophy is a major factor behind the practice of getting hospitalized patients out of bed and moving about as active as possible as soon as is feasible, despite sutures, wounds, broken bones and pain.

Muscle atrophy results from a co-morbidity of several common diseases, including [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), [[renal failure]], and severe [[burn]]s; patients who have "[[cachexia]]" in these disease settings have a poor [[prognosis]]. Moreover, starvation eventually leads to muscle atrophy.

Disuse of the muscles, such as when muscle tissue is immobilized for even a few days of unuse – when the patient has a primary injury such as an immobilized broken [[bone]] (set in a cast or immobilized in traction), for example – will also lead rapidly to disuse atrophy.  Minimizing such occurrences as soon as possible is a primary mission of [[occupational therapist|occupational]] and [[physical therapist]]s employed within hospitals working in co-ordination with orthopedic surgeons.

Neurogenic atrophy, which has a similar effect, is muscle atrophy resulting from damage to the nerve which stimulates the muscle, causing a shriveling around otherwise healthy limbs. Also, time in a circa [[zero g]] environment without exercise [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body#Loss of bone and muscle mass|will lead to atrophy]]. This is partially due to the smaller amount of exertion needed to move about, and the fact that muscles are not used to maintain posture. In a similar effect, patients with a broken leg joint undergoing as little as three weeks of traction can lose enough back and buttocks muscle mass and strength as to have difficulty sitting without assistance, and experience pain, stress and burning even after a very short ten-minute exposure, when such positioning is contrived during recovery.

==Signs and symptoms==
Muscular atrophy decreases qualities of life as the sufferer becomes unable to perform certain tasks or worsen the risks of accidents while performing those (like walking). Muscular atrophy increases the risks of falling in conditions such as IBM (inclusion body myositis).  Muscular atrophy affects a high number of the elderly.

There are many diseases and conditions which cause a decrease in [[muscle]] mass, known as [[atrophy]], including: inactivity, as seen when a cast is put on a limb, or upon extended bedrest (which can occur during a prolonged illness); [[cachexia]] - which is a syndrome that is a co-morbidity of [[cancer]] and [[congestive heart failure]];  [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]; burns, liver failure, etc., and the wasting [[Dejerine-Sottas syndrome]] ([[hereditary motor and sensory  neuropathies|HMSN Type III]]). [[Glucocorticoid|Glucocorticoids]], a class of medications used to treat allergic and other inflammatory conditions  can induce muscle atrophy by increasing break-down of muscle proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid8049126"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seene T |title=Turnover of skeletal muscle contractile proteins in glucocorticoid myopathy |journal=J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. |volume=50 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–4 |date=July 1994 |pmid=8049126 |doi= 10.1016/0960-0760(94)90165-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other syndromes or conditions which can induce skeletal muscle atrophy are liver disease, and starvation.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:1025 Atrophy.png|thumb|right|Muscle mass is reduced as muscles atrophy with disuse.]]
Muscle atrophy occurs by a change in the normal balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation.  During atrophy, there is a down-regulation of protein synthesis pathways, and an activation of protein degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Sandri M. 2008. Signaling in Muscle Atrophy and Hypertrophy. [http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/short/23/3/160 Physiology 23: 160-170.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The particular protein degradation pathway which seems to be responsible for much of the muscle loss seen in a muscle undergoing atrophy is the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent [[ubiquitin]]/[[proteasome]] pathway.  In this system, particular proteins are targeted for destruction by the ligation of at least four copies of a small peptide called [[ubiquitin]] onto a substrate protein.  When a substrate is thus "poly-ubiquitinated", it is targeted for destruction by the [[proteasome]].  Particular enzymes in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway allow ubiquitination to be directed to some proteins but not others - specificity is gained by coupling targeted proteins to an "E3 [[ubiquitin ligase]]".  Each E3 [[ubiquitin ligase]] binds to a particular set of substrates, causing their ubiquitination.

==Diagnosis==

===Quantification===
A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] can distinguish muscle tissue from other tissues and thereby estimate the amount of muscle tissue in the body.

Fast loss of muscle tissue (relative to normal turnover), can be approximated by the amount of [[urea]] in the urine. The equivalent nitrogen content (in [[gram]]) of urea (in [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]) can be estimated by the conversion factor 0.028 g/mmol.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.9.2 (page 76) in: {{cite book |author=Jacki Bishop; Thomas, Briony |title=Manual of Dietetic Practice |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-3525-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 1 gram of nitrogen is roughly equivalent to 6 gram of protein, and 1 gram of protein is roughly equivalent to 4 gram of muscle tissue. Subsequently, in situations such as muscle wasting, 1&amp;nbsp;mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume in litres multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/l) roughly corresponds to a muscle loss of 0.67 gram.

===Differential diagnosis===
During aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass.  This condition is called "[[sarcopenia]]".  The exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, but it may be due to a combination of the gradual failure in the "[[satellite cells]]" which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted [[growth factors]] which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival.

In addition to the simple loss of muscle mass ([[atrophy]]), or the age-related decrease in muscle function (sarcopenia), there are other diseases which may be caused by structural defects in the muscle ([[muscular dystrophy]]), or by inflammatory reactions in the body directed against muscle (the myopathies).

==Treatment==
Muscle atrophy can be opposed by the signaling pathways which induce [[muscle hypertrophy]], or an increase in muscle size.  Therefore, one way in which [[exercise]] induces an increase in muscle mass is to downregulate the pathways which have the opposite effect.

[[β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate]] (HMB), a metabolite of [[leucine]] which is sold as a [[dietary supplement]], has demonstrated efficacy in preventing the loss of muscle mass in several muscle wasting conditions in humans, particularly [[sarcopenia]].&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Nutritional supplements in support of resistance exercise to counter age-related sarcopenia | journal = Adv.

Since the absence of muscle-building amino acids can contribute to muscle wasting (that which is torn down must be rebuilt with like material), amino acid therapy may be helpful for regenerating damaged or atrophied muscle tissue. The branched-chain amino acids or [[Branched-chain amino acids|BCAA]]s ([[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[valine]]) are critical to this process, in addition to [[lysine]] and other amino acids.

In severe cases of muscular atrophy, the use of an anabolic steroid such as methandrostenolone may be administered to patients as a potential treatment.{{mcn|date=May 2016}} A novel class of drugs, called SARM ([[selective androgen receptor modulator]]s) are being investigated with promising results. They would have fewer [[side-effects]], while still promoting muscle and bone tissue growth and regeneration. These claims are, however, yet to be confirmed in larger clinical trials.

One important rehabilitation tool for muscle atrophy includes the use of [[functional electrical stimulation]] to stimulate the muscles. This has seen a large amount of success in the rehabilitation of paraplegic patients.&lt;ref&gt;D.Zhang et al., Functional Electrical Stimulation in Rehabilitation Engineering: A survey, Nenyang technological University, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hibernation==

Inactivity and starvation in mammals lead to atrophy of skeletal muscle, accompanied by a smaller number and size of the muscle cells as well as lower protein content.&lt;ref name="pmid17904252"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fuster G, Busquets S, Almendro V, López-Soriano FJ, Argilés JM |title=Antiproteolytic effects of plasma from hibernating bears: a new approach for muscle wasting therapy? |journal=[[Clin Nutr]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=658–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17904252 |doi=10.1016/j.clnu.2007.07.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0261-5614(07)00124-0|last2=Busquets |last3=Almendro |last4=López-Soriano |last5=Argilés }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, prolonged periods of immobilization, as in the cases of bed rest or astronauts flying in space, are known to result in muscle weakening and atrophy. Such consequences are also noted in small hibernating mammals like the golden-mantled ground squirrels and brown bats.&lt;ref name="pmid17307375"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lohuis TD, Harlow HJ, Beck TD |title=Hibernating black bears (Ursus americanus) experience skeletal muscle protein balance during winter anorexia |journal=[[Comp.

[[Bear]]s are an exception to this rule; species in the family Ursidae are famous for their ability to survive unfavorable environmental conditions of low temperatures and limited nutrition availability during winter by means of [[hibernation]]. During that time, bears go through a series of physiological, morphological and behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="pmid14506303"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carey HV, Andrews MT, Martin SL |title=Mammalian hibernation: cellular and molecular responses to depressed metabolism and low temperature |journal=[[Physiol.

During hibernation, bears spend four to seven months of inactivity and anorexia without undergoing muscle atrophy and protein loss.&lt;ref name="pmid17307375"/&gt; There are a few known factors that contribute to the sustaining of muscle tissue. During the summer period, bears take advantage of the nutrition availability and accumulate muscle protein. The protein balance at time of dormancy is also maintained by lower levels of protein breakdown during the winter time.&lt;ref name="pmid17307375"/&gt;  At times of immobility, muscle wasting in bears is also suppressed by a proteolytic inhibitor that is released in circulation.&lt;ref name="pmid17904252"/&gt;  Another factor that contributes to the sustaining of muscle strength in hibernating bears is the occurrence of periodic voluntary contractions and involuntary contractions from shivering during [[torpor]].&lt;ref name=Harlow&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2004 | title = Body Surface Temperature Of Hibernating Black Bears May Be Related To Periodic Muscle Activity | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 414–419 | doi =10.1644/1545-1542(2004)085&lt;0414:BSTOHB&gt;2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Harlow | first1 = H.

[https://www.bu.edu/av/core/journal/xxiii/Aruffo.pdf "Problems with the Noble Lie."] ''Boston University''.  Accessed 4 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[politics]], a '''noble lie''' is a [[myth]] or [[Lie|untruth]], often, but not invariably, of a religious nature, knowingly propagated by an [[elite]] to maintain social harmony or to advance an agenda. The noble lie is a concept originated by [[Plato]] as described in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

In [[religion]], a '''pious fiction''' is a narrative that is presented as true by the author, but is considered by others to be fictional albeit produced with an altruistic motivation. The term is sometimes used [[pejorative]]ly to suggest that the author of the narrative was deliberately misleading readers for selfish or deceitful reasons. The term is often used in religious contexts, sometimes referring to passages in religious texts.

==Plato's ''Republic''==
[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
{{main|The Republic (Plato)}}
Plato presented the Noble Lie (γενναῖον ψεῦδος, ''gennaion pseudos'' – literally, "a lie or wrong opinion about origin") in the fictional tale known as the myth or parable of the metals. In it, Socrates provides the origin of the three [[social class]]es who compose the republic proposed by Plato; Socrates speaks of a [[Social stratification|socially stratified society]], wherein the populace are told "a sort of Phoenician tale":

{{Quotation|...the earth, as being their mother, delivered them, and now, as if their land were their mother and their nurse, they ought to take thought for her and defend her against any attack, and regard the other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same earth...While all of you, in the city, are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet god, in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule, mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious—but in the helpers, silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And, as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds, it may sometimes happen that a golden father would beget a silver son, and that a golden offspring would come from a silver sire, and that the rest would, in like manner, be born of one another. So that the first and chief injunction that the god lays upon the rulers is that of nothing else are they to be such careful guardians, and so intently observant as of the intermixture of these metals in the souls of their offspring, and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the city shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 414e–15c&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Socrates proposes and claims that if the people believed "this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another."&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 415c–d&lt;/ref&gt; This is his ''noble lie'': "a contrivance for one of those falsehoods that come into being in case of need, of which we were just now talking, some noble one..."&lt;ref&gt;414b–c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Karl Popper===
[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Karl Popper in 1990]]
{{main article|Karl Popper}}
Karl Popper accused Plato of trying to base religion on a noble lie as well. In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper remarks, "It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion." Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically. Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought.&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209060939/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2007/07/open-society-vi-on-religion-as-a-noble-lie.html Positive Liberty » Open Society VI: On Religion as a Noble Lie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leo Strauss===

{{main article|Leo Strauss}}
Strauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the [[polis]]. Are myths needed to give people meaning and purpose and to ensure a stable society? Or can men dedicated to relentlessly examining, in [[Nietzsche]]'s language, those "deadly truths," flourish freely? Thus, is there a limit to the political, and what can be known absolutely? In ''The City and Man,'' Strauss discusses the myths outlined in [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']] that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. Seymour Hersh also claims that Strauss endorsed noble lies: myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', May 12, 2003, accessed June 1, 2007.{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''[[Reason Online]]'', July 1997, accessed February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', documentary filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]] opines that "Strauss believed it was for politicians to assert powerful and inspiring myths that everyone could believe in. They might not be true, but they were necessary illusions. One of these was religion; the other was the myth of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Politics of Fear''; Episode 1: "Baby It's Cold Outside"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desmond Lee===

{{main article|Desmond Lee}}
"Plato has been criticized for his Foundation Myth as if it were a calculated lie. That is partly because the phrase here translated 'magnificent myth' (p.414b) has been conventionally mistranslated 'noble lie'; and this has been used to support the charge that Plato countenances manipulation by propaganda. But the myth is accepted by all three classes, Guardians included. It is meant to replace the national traditions which any community has, which are intended to express the kind of community it is, or wishes to be, its ideals, rather than to state matters of fact."&lt;ref name="Plato p177"&gt;Plato: The Republic, Penguin Classics, translated by Desmond Lee, p177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea of Faith===

{{main article|Sea of Faith}}
The Sea of Faith Network (SoF) aims are "Exploring and promoting religious faith as a human creation..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arguably not an organisation ''based'' on the noble lie, many of their members no longer believe, but continue to espouse religious beliefs for positive social control and continue to hold positions in many religious organizations and various church groups.

* [[historical method|Mainstream historical interpretations]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (i.e. the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Protestant]] [[Old Testament]]) often consider much of the Tanakh/Jewish Bible to be a pious fiction, such as the conquests of Joshua,&lt;ref&gt;Borras, Judit, ''Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century'', BRILL, 1999, p 117: ".. the overwhelming consensus of modern scholarship is that the conquest tradition of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] is a pious fiction composed by the deuteronomistic school …"&lt;/ref&gt; and the histories of the [[Pentateuch]].&lt;ref&gt;https://peteenns.com/briefly-3-edgy-things-old-testament-works/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://peteenns.com/3-things-i-would-like-to-see-evangelical-leaders-stop-saying-about-biblical-scholarship/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Christopher, The Hebrew Bible: A Comparative Approach'', Fortress Press, 2009, p 123: "Minimalists begin with the fact that the [[Hebrew Bible]] did not reach its present form until well after the [[Babylonian exile]] … most the that the story was formulated by a group of elites who wanted to justify their claims to dominate … In other words, the narrative [of the Hebrew Bible] is a pious fiction that bears little relation to the actual history of Palestine during the period it purports to narrate."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Daniel]] has also been described as a pious fiction, with the purpose of providing encouragement to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, D. A. For the Love of God: A Daily Companion for Discovering the Riches of God's Word'', Good News Publishers, 2006, p 19: "Many critics doubt that the account of [[The Book of Daniel|Daniel 4]] is anything more than pious fiction to encourage the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mainstream historical-critical approaches often views stories in the New Testament such as [[Nativity of Jesus|the Virgin Birth]], [[the Visit of the Magi to Jesus]], and others, as pious fictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Testament in the Twentieth Century|last=Jones|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Book of Mormon]], one of the [[Standard Works]] of the [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], has been described as a [[hoax]] or pious fiction, and it is not accepted as containing [[divine revelation]] by those outside the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;Skousen, Royal, ''The Book of Mormon: the earliest text'', Yale University Press, 2009, p x: "Outsiders generally consider this book [the Book of Mormon] a nineteenth-century hoax or pious fiction …"&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dale Eickelman writes that [[Muslim]] [[fuqaha|jurists]] employ a pious fiction when they assert that [[Shariah|Islamic law]] is invariant, when in fact it is subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;Eickelman, Dale, ''Muslim politics'', Princeton University Press, 2004, p 26: "Emendations and additions to purportedly invariant and complete Islamic law (sharia) have occurred throughout Islamic history…. Muslim jurists have rigorously maintained the pious fiction that there can be no change in divinely revealed law, even as they have exercised their independent judgment (ijtihad) to create a kind of de facto legislation."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The relationship between the modern celebration of [[Christmas]] and the [[historical Jesus|historical]] [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]] has also been described as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJIhXqNwIIUC&amp;lpg=PA476&amp;dq=christmas%20pious%20fiction&amp;pg=PA476#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20pious%20fiction&amp;f=false |title=Scripting Jesus: The Gospels in Rewrite - L.

'''Noise, vibration, and harshness''' ('''NVH'''), also known as '''noise and vibration''' ('''N&amp;V'''), is the study and modification of the noise and vibration characteristics of vehicles, particularly cars and trucks. While noise and vibration can be readily measured, '''harshness''' is a subjective quality, and is measured either via "jury" evaluations, or with analytical tools that can provide results reflecting human subjective impressions. These latter tools belong to the field known as "[[psychoacoustics]]."

Interior NVH deals with noise and vibration experienced by the occupants of the cabin, while exterior NVH is largely concerned with the noise radiated by the vehicle, and includes drive-by noise testing.

NVH is mostly engineering, but often objective measurements fail to predict or correlate well with the subjective impression on human observers. For example, although the ear's response at moderate noise levels is approximated by [[A-weighting]], two different noises with the same A-weighted level are not necessarily equally disturbing. The field of psychoacoustics is partly concerned with this correlation.

In some cases the NVH engineer is asked to change the sound quality, by adding or subtracting particular harmonics, rather than making the vehicle quieter.

== Sources of NVH ==

The sources of noise in a vehicle can be classified as 
* aerodynamic (e.g. wind, cooling fans of [[HVAC]])
* mechanical (e.g. engine, driveline, tire [[contact patch]] and road surface, brakes)
* electrical (e.g. [[electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise and vibration]] coming from electrical actuators, alternator or traction motor in electrical cars). 

Many problems are generated as either [[Vibration|vibration]] or noise, transmitted via a variety of paths, and then radiated [[Acoustics|acoustically]] into the cabin.&lt;ref name="Vehicle Noise and Vibration Refinement"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Xu|title=Vehicle noise and vibration refinement|date=2010|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd.|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-1-84569-497-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJFwAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are classified as "structure-borne" noise. Others are generated acoustically and propagated by airborne paths. Structure-borne noise is attenuated by isolation, while airborne noise is reduced by absorption or through the use of barrier materials.  Vibrations are sensed at the steering wheel, the seat, armrests, or the floor and pedals. Some problems are sensed visually - such as the vibration of the rear-view mirror or header rail on open-topped cars

== Tonal versus broadband ==

NVH can be tonal such as engine noise, or broadband, such as road noise or wind noise, normally. Some resonant systems respond at characteristic frequencies, but in response to random excitation. Therefore, although they look like tonal problems on any one spectrum, their amplitude varies considerably. Other problems are [[Self oscillation|self resonant]], such as whistles from antennas.

Tonal noises often have [[harmonic]]s. Here is the noise spectrum of Michael Schumacher's Ferrari at 16680 rpm, showing the various harmonics. The x axis is given in terms of multiples of engine speed. The y axis is logarithmic, and uncalibrated.

[[Image:Singleorder.jpg]]

== Instrumentation ==

Typical instrumentation used to measure NVH include [[microphone]]s, [[accelerometer]]s and force gauges, or load cells. Many NVH facilities will have semi-[[anechoic chamber]]s, and rolling road [[dynamometer]]s. Typically signals are recorded direct to hard disk via an [[analog-to-digital converter]]. In the past magnetic or DAT tape recorders were used. The integrity of the signal chain is very important, typically each of the instruments used are fully calibrated in a lab once per year, and any given setup is calibrated as a whole once per day.

[[Laser scanning vibrometry]] is an essential tool for effective NVH optimization. The vibrational characteristics of a sample is acquired full field under operational or excited conditions. The results represent the actual vibrations. No added mass is influencing the measurement, as the sensor is light itself.

== Investigative techniques ==

Techniques used to help identify NVH include part substitution, [[modal analysis]], rig squeak and rattle tests (complete vehicle or component/system tests), lead cladding, [[acoustic intensity]], transfer path analysis, and partial coherence. Most NVH work is done in the frequency domain, using [[fast Fourier transform]]s to convert the time domain signals into the frequency domain. [[Wavelet]] analysis, order analysis, [[statistical energy analysis]], and subjective evaluation of signals modified in real time are also used.

== Computer-based modeling ==

NVH needs good representative prototypes of the production vehicle for testing. These are needed early in the design process as the solutions often need substantial modification to the design, forcing in engineering changes which are much cheaper when made early. These early prototypes are very expensive, so there has been great interest in computer aided predictive techniques for NVH. Sometimes these work. Back-of-envelope calculations are very useful.

One example is the modelling works for structure borne noise and vibration analysis. When the phenomenon being considered occurs below, say, 25–30&amp;nbsp;Hz, for example the idle shaking of the powertrain, a multi-body model can be used. In contrast, when the phenomenon being considered occurs at relatively high frequency, for example above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, a [[Statistical Energy Analysis]] (SEA) model may be a better approach.

For the mid-frequency band, various methodologies exist, such as vibro-acoustic [[finite element analysis]], and [[Boundary element method|boundary element analysis]]. The structure can be coupled to the interior cavity and form a fully coupled equation system. Also other techniques exist that can mix measured data with finite element or boundary element data.

== Typical solutions ==

There are three principal means of improving NVH:l

# reducing the source strength, as in making a noise source quieter with a muffler, or improving the balance of a rotating mechanism;
# interrupting the noise or vibration path, with barriers (for noise) or isolators (for vibration);  or
# absorption of the noise or vibration energy, as for example with foam noise absorbers, or tuned vibration dampers.

Deciding which of these (or what combination) to use in solving a particular problem is one of the challenges facing the NVH engineer.

Specific methods for improving NVH include the use of [[tuned mass damper]]s, [[subframe]]s, [[engine balance|balancing]], modifying the stiffness or mass of structures, retuning [[exhaust system|exhausts]] and [[intake]]s, modifying the characteristics of elastomeric isolators, adding sound deadening or absorbing materials, or using [[active noise control]]. In some circumstances, substantial changes in vehicle architecture may be the only way to cure some problems cost effectively.

'''Nwya Devu''' is a high-altitude archaeological site on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] located in the eastern [[Changtang]] region of Tibet. At around {{convert|4600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, Nwya Devu is the highest known archaeological site from the [[Paleolithic]] and provides evidence for the earliest known presence of humans at a high-altitude site, at around 40,000-30,000 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1049}}

==Background==
The site was discovered in 2013 during [[Systematic survey|systematic archaeological surveying]] performed by the Tibetan Cultural Relics Conservation Institute and the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]].{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=3 (Supplementary)}} Nywa Devu lies on the former [[Terrace (geology)#Lacustrine_terraces|lacrustrine terrace]] of Co Ngoin, a nearby freshwater lake to the site's north.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=4 (Supplementary)}}

==Stratigraphy==
Archaeologists identified three [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphic]] layers at the site and excavated around {{convert|170|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} worth of deposits in depth.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1049}} Layer 1 is [[Luminescence dating|OSL dated]] from around 13,000 to 4,000 [[Before Present|BP]]. Mollusc shells taken from the lowest part of Layer 1 yielded [[Radiocarbon dating#Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS date]] ranges from around 12,700 to 12,400 BP, which shows concurrence with the OSL dating. Layer 2 is OSL dated from around 25,000 to 18,000 BP and corresponds with the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. The earliest layer, Layer 3, is OSL dated to around 45,000 to 30,000 BP.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1050}} While artefacts were found outside of Layer 3, the archaeologists who worked the site believe that all of the artefacts come from the assemblage associated with Layer 3.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|pp=1049-1050}}{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} Paleo-environmental evidence suggests that the local climate was milder during the time of Layer 3 when compared against the present.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}}

==Artefacts==
3,683 lithic artefacts were excavated from the site. The lithic assemblage at Nwya Devu consists primarily of blade cores, flake cores, blades, flakes, chunks, and tools. All of the lithic artefacts at Newa Devu were sourced from black [[slate]] that was locally derived, from nearby Nwya Devu Hill, which lies around {{convert|800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} east of the site. Blades found at the site were made using a non-[[Levallois technique]], through the use of prismatic cores.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1050}} Archaeologists believe that Nwya Devu, with access to a good source of raw materials nearby, was likely the site of a lithic tool-making workshop, with a primary focus on creating long knives and scrapers that could be [[Hafting|hafted]].{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} Some of the excavated blades were over {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} The lithic assemblage at Newa Dwvu appears to be unique and not obviously related to any other sites in East Asia.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} It shows some similarities to sites from the Early [[Upper Paleolithic]] in Siberia (Kara Bom) and Mongolia (Tolbor-21).{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1051}}{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=4 (Supplementary)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">The '''Oracle Unified Method''' ('''OUM'''), first released by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2006, is a [[standards-based method]] with roots in the [[Unified Process]] (UP). OUM is business-process and [[use case | use-case]] driven and includes support for the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), though the use of UML is not required. OUM combines these standards with aspects of Oracle's legacy methods and Oracle implementation best-practices.

OUM is applicable to any size or type of information technology project. While OUM is a plan-based method – that includes extensive overview material, task and artifact descriptions, and associated templates – the method is intended to be tailored to support the appropriate level of ceremony required for each project. Guidance is provided for identifying the minimum subset of tasks, tailoring the project approach, executing iterative and incremental project planning, and applying [[Agile technique]]s. Supplemental guidance provides specific support for [[Oracle product]]s, tools, and technologies.

OUM v6.4.0 provides support for:
* Application Implementation
* Cloud Application Services Implementation
* Software Upgrade projects

as well as the complete range of technology projects including:
* [[Business intelligence]] (BI)
* Enterprise Security
* WebCenter
* [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA)
* Application Integration Architecture (AIA)
* Business Process Management (BPM)
* [[Enterprise integration]]
* Custom Software

Detailed techniques and tool guidance are provided, including a supplemental guide related to [[Oracle Tutor]] and UPK.

OUM is available for use by Oracle employees; for Oracle PartnerNetwork Diamond, Platinum, and Gold Partners; and for customers who participate in the OUM Customer Program.

An '''overview''' in [[policy debate]] is part of a [[structure of policy debate|speech]] which is flagged as not responding to the line-by-line arguments on the [[flow (policy debate)|flow]]. An overview may be "global" if presented at the beginning of a speech or "local" if presented at the beginning of a position.

Overviews typically list the order a debater's speech will be given in. For instance, On-Case, Co-op Disadvantage, Spending Disadvantage, Weapon Disadvantage would be an expected overview.

Debaters will usually inform the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] where they will be giving an overview before they start a speech because it can make it harder to flow the speech. A small minority of judges dislike this practice and will start speech time when a debater starts giving this order.

Many judges dislike overviews because, since many are scripted before the round begins, they tend to be non-responsive or repetitive and are often long. However, most judges and coaches support the practice for arguments which cannot be placed anywhere on the line-by-line or that need to be flagged for their importance.

The above is also informally known as a "road map"

Another form of an overview is of specifically in the section of the speech(i.e. [[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]], [[Kritik]], Disadvantage, Counter-Plan, etc). This is commonly announced before the debater's speech and will signpost an overview.

The overview usually consists of star/main arguments being made and more than likely tend to contain extended evidence or authors. This practice is used to elaborate an argument and/or bring it back up in order for the judge to be aware of the main arguments being made by a team.

'''Ping-pong recording''' (also called '''ping-ponging''', '''bouncing tracks''', or '''reduction mixing''') is a method of [[sound recording]]. It involves combining multiple [[stem mixing and mastering|track stems]] into one, allowing more room for [[overdubbing]] when using [[tape recorder]]s with a limited set of tracks. It is also used to simplify [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]]s.

The two most common methods consist of 
* Dubbing tracks between two tape recorders (or tracks on a multitrack recorder) connected through a [[mixing console]]
* Dubbing tracks internally, through the onboard mixer of many machines, including [[Portastudio]]s and similar multitrackers. 

In both cases, a new [[musical instrument|instrument]], voice, or other material may be added with each bounce, depending on the setup's mixing capabilities.

In [[analog recording]], the audio quality normally decreases with each generation, while in [[digital recording]], the quality is usually preserved. In either case, the most leeway comes with having the best possible source material.

==Early examples==
The method was employed by [[Beach Boys]] co-founder [[Brian Wilson]] during the 1960s. For the recording of ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), Wilson created the instrumentals of songs using a 4-track recorder. He then bounced the material onto one track of an 8-track recorder, using the remaining tracks for vocal overdubs. This meant that the album could not be suitably mixed in stereo, because the instrumental parts were locked in [[monaural]]. In 1997, advances in recording technology allowed engineer [[Mark Linett]] to resync the original first-generation instrumental stems with the second-generation overdubbed vocals for the compilation ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]''.&lt;ref name="Linett1997"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|first=Mark|last=Linett|authorlink=Mark Linett|chapter=Notes on Recording and Mixing|title=The Pet Sounds Sessions|others=[[The Beach Boys]]|year=1997|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Recording_Mixing_Notes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Other terms==
'''Ping pong''' is also a term of derision, in particular applied to early commercial stereo recordings of the late 1950s to mid-1960s which do not have a convincing stereo image or sound-stage. Such recordings were often made in two-track form for mixing in mono, but released as authentic stereo recordings.

==Location==
Porton Down is situated just northeast of the village of [[Porton (village)|Porton]] near [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]], in [[Wiltshire]], England. To the northwest lies the [[MoD Boscombe Down]] airfield operated by [[QinetiQ]]. On some maps, the land surrounding the complex is identified as a "Danger Area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey map number '184' of the 'Landranger' series of maps|url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |website=Online Ordnance Survey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of government use==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:2inchMortarsPortonDown.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[2 inch Medium Mortar|2-inch mortar]] trials, 1917&lt;/center&gt;]]
Porton Down opened in 1916 as the War Department Experimental Station, shortly renamed to the Royal Engineers Experimental Station, for testing chemical weapons in response to German use of this means of war in 1915.  The laboratory's remit was to conduct research and development regarding chemical weapons agents used by the British armed forces in the [[First World War]], such as [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]], and [[phosgene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C14396|title=War Office, Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Defence : Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment, later Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton: Reports and Technical Papers|format=5136 files and volumes |publisher=The National Archives|date=1918-1993|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Work at Porton started in March 1916. At the time, only a few cottages and farm buildings were scattered on the downs at Porton and [[Idmiston]]. By May 1917, the focus for anti-gas defence and respirator development had moved from London to Porton Down, and by 1918, the original two huts had become a large hutted camp with 50 officers and 1,100 other ranks. After the [[Armistice]] in 1918, Porton Down was reduced to a skeleton staff.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical and Biological Defence at Porton Down 1916-2000|last=Carter|first=G B|date=2000|location=London|publisher=The Stationery Office|pages=126–127|isbn=0-11-772933-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post First World War ===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:PortonOfficialHistory.JPG|thumb|200px|'[[Chemical and Biological Defence at Porton Down, 1916-2000]]' by [[G.B. Carter]], Porton Down's official historian.]] --&gt;
In 1919, the War Office set up the Holland Committee to consider the future of chemical warfare and defence. By 1920, the Cabinet agreed to the Committee's recommendation that work should continue at Porton Down. From that date a slow permanent building programme began, coupled with the gradual recruitment of civilian scientists. By 1922, there were 380 servicemen, 23 scientific and technical civil servants, and 25 "civilian subordinates". By 1925, the civilian staff had doubled.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

By 1926, the chemical defence aspects of Air Raid Precautions (ARP) for the civilian population was added to the Station's responsibilities. In 1929 the Royal Engineers Experimental Station became the Chemical Warfare Experimental Station (CWES) (1929–1930), and in 1930 the Chemical Defence Experimental Station (CDES) (1930–1948).&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;
In 1930 Britain ratified the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] with reservations, which permitted the use of chemical warfare agents only in retaliation. By 1938, the international situation was such that the Cabinet authorised offensive chemical warfare research and development and the production of war reserve stocks of chemical warfare agents by the chemical industry.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

=== Second World War ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:PortonDownOrdnanceSurveyMap.JPG|thumb|200px|An Ordnance Survey map of 'Dstl, Porton Down' and its surrounding 'Danger Areas' as of 12 April 2007. Note that 'Danger Areas' are spotted all over [[Salisbury Plain]] from Porton Down outwards.

A smaller view of this is available online&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk Online Ordnance Survey small map&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], research at CDES concentrated on chemical weapons such as [[nitrogen mustard]]. As [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies penetrated Germany, they discovered operational stockpiles of munitions and weapons that contained new chemical warfare agents, including highly toxic organophosphorous [[nerve agent]]s such as [[sarin]], unknown to Britain and the Allies at the time.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

To examine biological weapons, a highly secret separate department, called the Biology Department, Porton (BDP), was established within CDES in 1940, under veteran microbiologist [[Paul Fildes]]. Its focus included [[anthrax]] and [[botulinum toxin]], and in 1942 it famously carried out tests of an anthrax bio-weapon at [[Gruinard Island]]. In 1946, it was renamed the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) and, in 1957, the Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE). 

The [[Common Cold Unit]] (CCU) was sometimes confused with the MRE, with which it occasionally collaborated but was not officially connected. The CCU was located at Harvard Hospital, Harnham Down, on the west side of [[Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

=== Post-war period ===

When the Second World War ended, the advanced state of German technology regarding the organophosphorous nerve agents, such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[sarin]] and [[soman]], had surprised the Allies, who were eager to capitalise on it. Subsequent research took the newly discovered German nerve agents as a starting point, and eventually [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] nerve agent was developed at Porton Down in 1952.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, research and development at Porton Down was aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve agent-based capability and to develop specific means of defence against these agents. In the end these aims came to nothing on the offensive side because of the decision to abandon any sort of British chemical warfare capability in favour of nuclear weapons. On the defensive side there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination, and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;
[[File:Scientist Looking at Containers of Liquid at Porton Down MOD 45154411.jpg|thumb|upright|Scientist looking at containers of liquid at Porton Down]]
Tests were carried out on servicemen to determine the effects of nerve agents on human subjects, with one recorded death due to a nerve gas experiment. There have been persistent allegations of unethical [[human experimentation]] at Porton Down, such as those relating to the death of Leading Aircraftman [[Ronald Maddison]], aged 20, in 1953. Maddison was taking part in sarin nerve agent toxicity tests; sarin was dripped onto his arm and he died shortly afterwards. 

In the 1950s, the station, now renamed the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment (CDEE), became involved with the development of [[CS gas|CS]], a riot-control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and [[wound ballistics]] work. Both these facets of Porton Down's work had become more important because of the unrest and increasing violence in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt; 

On 1 August 1962, Geoffrey Bacon, a scientist at the Microbiological Research Establishment, died from an accidental infection of the plague bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. In the same month an [[autoclave]] exploded, shattering two windows. Both incidents generated considerable media coverage at the time.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

In 1970, the senior establishment at Porton Down was renamed the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) for the next 21 years. Preoccupation with defence against nerve agents continued, but in the 1970s and 1980s, the Establishment was also concerned with studying reported chemical warfare by Iraq against Iran and against its own [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt; 

Porton Down was the laboratory where initial samples of the [[Ebola]] virus were sent in 1976 during the first confirmed outbreak of the disease in Africa. The laboratory now contains samples of some of the world's most aggressive pathogens, including Ebola, anthrax and the plague, and is leading the UK's current research into viral inoculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The front line of the UK's Ebola prevention efforts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28773174|website=BBC News|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

Until 2001 the military installation of Porton Down was part of the UK government's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA) when it was split into [[QinetiQ]], initially a fully government-owned company, and the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] (Dstl). Dstl incorporates all of DERA's activities deemed unsuitable for the privatisation planned for QinetiQ, particularly Porton Down.

In 2013 Dstl scientists tested samples from Syria for Sarin, which is still manufactured there, to test soldiers' equipment.&lt;ref name=mosley/&gt;

Public Health England have planned since September 2015&lt;ref name=itv&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/story/2015-09-17/public-health-england-to-move-from-porton-down-in-wiltshire/ Public Health England to move from Porton Down in Wiltshire] itv.com. 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to transfer their Porton Down staff to [[Harlow]], and in July 2017 it had bought a vacant site from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), aiming to consolidate operations there in 2024&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-40547531 Harlow site to be home to government's public health arm] BBC News,9 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Site names ===

The location's government use has been split into two separately controlled locations since 1979: the original military establishment under the Ministry of Defence, and the site to the south under the Department of Health, which had been opened in 1951 for the Microbiological Research Establishment, then in 1979 transferred to the Ministry of Health to focus on public health research, with the Defence aspects returning to the then-titled Chemical Defence Establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=P|last2=Carter|first2=G|title=From Biological Warfare to Healthcare: Porton Down, 1940-2000|date=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK| isbn=9780333753835| pages=280| edition=1st| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Biological_Warfare_to_Healthcare.html?id=7rx7QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associated locations ===

==== Sutton Oak, Merseyside ====
A factory in Sutton Oak, [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] was requisitioned in 1917 by the War Department, renamed HM Factory, Sutton Oak and started producing the chemical warfare agent [[Diphenylchlorarsine|diphenyl chloroarsine]]. The site switched to producing [[Adamsite]] in 1922. In 1923 the War Office halted the requisition and purchased the site, renaming it the War Office Research Establishment, a.k.a. Chemical Warfare Research Establishment, and later the Chemical Defence Research Establishment Sutton Oak. During the 1920s, the site switched to producing [[Mustard Gas|mustard gas]] products, starting with the HS variant and adding the HT variant in the 1930s, and also filling armaments. After WW2, the site also produced the [[nerve agent]] [[sarin]] for experimental purposes. The site closed in 1957, with much of the work transferring to Chemical Defence Establishment Nancekuke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.suttonbeauty.org.uk/suttonhistory/poisongas/|website=suttonbeauty.org| title=Magnum Poison Gas Works|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RRH Portreath, Cornwall ====
This Royal Air Force site, built in 1940, was renamed [[CDE Nancekuke|Chemical Defence Establishment Nancekuke]] in July 1949. Manufacture of sarin in a pilot production facility commenced there in the early 1950s, producing about 20 tons from 1954 until 1956.  It was intended as a stockpile and production facility for the UK's chemical defences during the [[Cold War]], focussed on nerve agents, including small amounts of [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] intended mainly for laboratory test purposes and to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass-production; full-scale production of VX agent never took place. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production could easily re-commence if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|title=Nancekuke Remediation Project|publisher=Ministry of Defence (Archived by The National Archives)|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101208174527/http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|archive-date=8 December 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of concern==

=== Trials ===

==== Open air ====
In 1942, [[Gruinard Island]] was dangerously contaminated with [[anthrax]] after a cloud of anthrax spores was released over the island during a trial. In 1981, a team of activists landed on the island and collected soil samples, a bag of which was left at the door at Porton Down. Testing showed that it still contained anthrax spores and in 1986 the Government felt obliged to take the necessary steps to successfully decontaminate the island.

Between 1963 and 1975 the MRE carried out [[Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments|trials in Lyme Bay]] in which live bacteria were sprayed from a ship to be carried ashore by the wind to simulate an anthrax attack. The bacteria sprayed were the less dangerous ''[[Bacillus globigii]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', but it was later admitted that the bacteria could adversely affect some vulnerable people. The town of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] lay downwind of the spraying. When the trials became public knowledge in the late 1990s, Dorset County Council, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Purbeck District Council demanded a Public Inquiry to investigate the experiments. The Government refused a Public Inquiry but instead commissioned Professor Brian Spratt, to conduct an Independent Review of the possible adverse health effects. He concluded that individuals with certain chronic conditions may have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr23.net/govt/spray_dorset.htm|title=The Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments 1963-75|accessdate= 17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human trials ====
[[File:Rmaddison.jpg|thumb|Leading Aircraftman Ronald Maddison who died an unlawful death at Porton Down in 1953, as determined by a jury in 2004]] Porton Down has been involved in human testing at various points throughout the Ministry of Defence's use of the site. Up to 20,000 people took part in various trials from 1949 up to 1989:&lt;ref name=lsd/&gt; 
From 1999 until 2006, it was investigated under [[Operation Antler (Porton Down investigation)|Operation Antler]]. In 2002 a first inquest and&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2488473.stm Nerve gas inquest to be re-opened] BBC News report, 18 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2004, a second inquest into the death of [[Ronald Maddison]] during testing of the nerve agent [[sarin]] commenced after his relatives and their supporters had lobbied for many years, which found his death to have been unlawful.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4013767.stm|title=Nerve gas death was 'unlawful' |date=15 November 2004|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Defence challenged the verdict&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/4459217.stm|title=MoD 'can challenge Porton case'|date=19 April 2005|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld and the government settled the case in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4709526.stm|title=MoD agrees sarin case settlement|date=13 February 2006|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 500 veterans claimed they suffered from the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;David Shukman [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/5018084.stm MOD pays out over nerve gas death] BBC News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the MoD paid 360 veterans of the tests £3m without admitting liability.&lt;ref name=mosley/&gt;

=== Secrecy ===
Most of the work carried out at Porton Down has to date remained secret. [[Bruce George]], Member of Parliament and Chairman of the [[Defence Select Committee]], told [[BBC News]] on 20 August 1999 that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I would not say that the Defence Committee is micro-managing either DERA or Porton Down. We visit it, but, with eleven members of Parliament and five staff covering a labyrinthine department like the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces, it would be quite erroneous of me and misleading for me to say that we know everything that's going on in Porton Down. It's too big for us to know, and secondly, there are many things happening there that I'm not even certain Ministers are fully aware of, let alone Parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/425689.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Chemical base 'too big', says MP |date=20 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "three Rs" of "reduce" (the number of animals used), "refine" (animal procedures) and "replace" (animal tests with non-animal tests) are used as the basic code of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100914/text/100914w0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 14 Sep 2010  (pt 0001)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a decrease in animal experimentation in recent years.&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100323/text/100323w0002.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 23 Mar 2010  (pt 0002)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dstl complies with all UK legislation relating to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/text/100324w0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 24 Mar 2010  (pt 0001)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals used include [[mouse|mice]], [[guinea pig]]s, [[rat]]s, pigs, [[ferret]]s, sheep, and non-human [[primate]]s (believed to be marmosets and [[rhesus macaque]]).

Different departments at Porton Down use animal experiments in different ways. Dstl's Biomedical Sciences department is involved with drug evaluation and efficacy testing (toxicology, pharmacology, physiology, behavioural science, human science), trauma and surgery studies, and animal breeding. The Physical Sciences department also uses animals in its "Armour Physics" research.

Like other aspects of research at Porton Down, precise details of animal experiments are generally kept secret. Media reports have suggested they include exposing monkeys to [[anthrax]], draining the blood of pigs and injecting them with ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria, and exposing animals to a variety of lethal, toxic nerve agents. Different animals are used for very different purposes. According to a 2002 report from the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Defence, mice are used mainly to research "the development of vaccines and treatments for microbial and viral infections", while pigs are used to "develop personal protective equipment to protect against blast injury to the thorax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F4AAE7BE-9D64-4FB5-A41F-481807F4DB21/0/awac6threport.pdf |title=Sixth Report of the Animal Welfare Advistory Committee|date=February 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503133310/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F4AAE7BE-9D64-4FB5-A41F-481807F4DB21/0/awac6threport.pdf |archivedate=3 May 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFO claims===
In 2008, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' published a story which said "UFO believers" claimed that alien bodies were taken to Porton Down from the site of an alleged UFO crash on the [[Berwyn range]] in North Wales, an event referred to as the [[Berwyn Mountain UFO incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1030805/New-UFO-witness-reopens-1970s-mystery-Welsh-Roswell.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=New UFO witness reopens 1970s mystery of the 'Welsh Roswell'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dstl states that: "No aliens, either alive or dead have ever been taken to Porton Down or any other Dstl site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Porton Down|URL=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-truth-about-porton-down|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13355">'''Precision medicine''' ('''PM''') is a [[medical]] model that proposes the customization of [[healthcare]], with medical decisions, treatments, practices, or products being tailored to the individual patient. In this model, diagnostic testing is often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies based on the context of a patient’s genetic content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Y.-F.|last2=Goldstein|first2=D. B.|last3=Angrist|first3=M.|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G.|title=Personalized Medicine and Human Genetic Diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581–a008581|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581|pmid=25059740|pmc=4143101}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other molecular or cellular analysis. Tools employed in precision medicine can include [[molecular diagnostics]], imaging, and analytics.&lt;ref name="timmerman2013" /&gt;

==Relationship to personalized medicine==
In explaining the distinction from a similar common term of [[personalized medicine]], the National Research Council explains: {{quote|Precision Medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. It does not literally mean the creation of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventions can then be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not. Although the term 'personalized medicine' is also used to convey this meaning, that term is sometimes misinterpreted as implying that unique treatments can be designed for each individual.&lt;ref name="timmerman2013" /&gt;}}

On the other hand, use of the term "precision medicine" as well can extend beyond treatment selection to also cover creating unique medical products for particular individuals—for example, "...patient-specific tissue or organs to tailor treatments for different people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/brandpublishing/localplus/ucsandiego/la-ss-ucsd2015-3dbioprinting-dto-story.html|title=Changing medicine with 3-D bioprinting, where organs can be synthesized by technology|author=LAT Brand Publishing|date=23 February 2015|work=LATimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the term in practice has so much overlap with "personalized medicine" that they are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-of-one.com/about/what-is-precision-medicine.php|title=N-of-One: Tailored Clinical Molecular Test Interpretation|work=n-of-one.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific basis==
Precision medicine often involves the application of [[Panomics|panomic analysis]] and [[systems biology]] to analyze the cause of an individual patient's disease at the molecular level and then to utilize [[Targeted therapy|targeted treatments]] (possibly in combination) to address that individual patient's disease process. The patient's response is then tracked as closely as possible, often using surrogate measures such as tumor load (v. true outcomes, such as 5 year survival rate), and the treatment finely adapted to the patient's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blau, CA, Liakopoulou, E |title=Can we deconstruct cancer, one patient at a time? |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=6–10 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2012.09.004 |pmid=23102584 |pmc=4221262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of precision medicine that addresses cancer is referred to as "precision oncology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Levi A. |last1=Garraway |first2=Jaap |last2=Verweij |first3=Karla V. |last3=Ballman |title=Precision Oncology: An Overview |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=31 |issue=15 |pages=1803–1805 |year=2013 |doi=10.1200/jco.2013.49.4799}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jeff |last1=Shrager |first2=Marty |last2=Tenenbaum |author2link=Marty Tenenbaum|title=Rapid Learning for Precision Oncology | year=2014 |journal=Nat Rev Clin Oncol |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=109–118 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2013.244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-personal difference of [[molecular pathology]] is diverse, so as inter-personal difference in the [[exposome]], which influence disease processes through the [[interactome]] within the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]], differentially from person to person. As the theoretical basis of precision medicine, the "unique disease principle"&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged to embrace the ubiquitous [[phenomenon]] of [[heterogeneity]] of [[disease]] [[etiology]] and [[pathogenesis]]. The unique disease principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as the unique tumor principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. How many molecular subtypes? Implications of the unique tumor principle in personalized medicine. Expert Rev Mol Diagn 2012; 12: 621-628.&lt;/ref&gt; As the exposome is a common [[concept]] of [[epidemiology]], precision medicine is intertwined with [[molecular pathological epidemiology]], which is capable of identifying potential [[biomarkers]] for precision medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Giovannucci E, Meyerhardt JA, Fuchs CS, Chan AT. Discovery of colorectal cancer PIK3CA mutation as potential predictive biomarker: power and promise of molecular pathological epidemiology. Oncogene advance online publication 24 June 2013; {{DOI|10.1038/onc.2013.244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
The ability to provide precision medicine to patients in routine clinical settings depends on the availability of molecular profiling tests, e.g. individual [[germline]] [[DNA]] sequencing. While precision medicine currently individualizes treatment mainly on the basis of genomic tests (e.g. Oncotype DX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/oncotype_dx|title=Oncotype DX: Genomic Test to Inform Breast Cancer Treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), several promising technology modalities are being developed, from techniques combining spectrometry and computational power to real-time imaging of drug effects in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Precision Medicine: Harnessing the Extraordinary Growth in Medical Data for Personalized Diagnosis and Treatment  http://claudiacopeland.com/uploads/3/6/1/4/3614974/hjno_novdec_2016_precision_medicine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many different aspects of precision medicine are tested in research settings (e.g., proteome, microbiome), but in routine practice not all available inputs are used. The ability to practice precision medicine is also dependent on the knowledge bases available to assist clinicians in taking action based on test results.&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25276091| pmc = 4175027 | year = 2014| author1 = Huser| first1 = V.| title = Developing genomic knowledge bases and databases to support clinical management: Current perspectives| journal = Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine| volume = 7| pages = 275–83| last2 = Sincan | first2 = M.| last3 = Cimino| first3 = J.

On the treatment side, PM can involve the use of customized medical products such drug cocktails produced by pharmacy [[compounding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/divining_your_future_in_healthcare_511068|title=Divining your future in healthcare|work=pmlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or customized devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/39339-how-fda-regulates-3d-printed-devices.html|title=3D-Printed Medical Devices Spark FDA Evaluation|work=LiveScience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also prevent harmful drug interactions, increase overall efficiency when prescribing medications, and reduce costs associated with healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genetichealth.jax.org/personalized-medicine/what-is/benefits.html|title=Personalized Medicine Benefits - The Jackson Laboratory|work=jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">In [[population ecology]], a '''regulating factor''' is something that keeps a [[population]] at [[Punctuated equilibrium|equilibrium]] (neither increasing nor decreasing in size over time).

An example of a regulating factor would be [[food supply]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Significance of Limiting and Regulating Factors on the Demography of Moose and White-Tailed Deer
|author=Francois Messier
|journal=The Journal of Animal Ecology

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the population increases to a certain size, there will be less food for each organism. This will lead to fewer [[births]] (a decrease in [[fecundity]]) and more [[deaths]], making a negative [[population growth rate|growth rate]]. As there are now fewer [[animal]]s, the amount of food for each organism will increase, meaning the growth rate will become positive. This would lead to a large population size again, and the cycle would start over. Therefore, food is a regulating factor in this scenario, as food supply keeps the population at relative equilibrium.

All regulating factors are [[Population density|density]]-dependent, meaning they keep populations at equilibrium by counteracting fluctuations in population size per unit area (or per unit volume for species living within three dimensional environments, such as water).  Other regulating factors of the human population at present are [[drinking water]] supply, amount of arable land (obviously a more fundamental term for food), [[air pollution]] and prevalence of communicable disease.  The major regulating factor for the human population in current times is inadequacy of safe [[drinking water]], since waterborne disease is the principal environmental cause of mortality.

'''Robert Leopold Spitzer'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysed.gov/coms/op001/opsc2a?profcd=60&amp;plicno=080978&amp;namechk=SPI Professional License Verification], New York State Education Department&lt;/ref&gt; (May 22, 1932 – December 25, 2015) was a psychiatrist and professor of [[psychiatry]] at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. He was a major force in the development of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM).

==Education and early years==
Spitzer was born in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1932.

He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[psychology]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1953 and his [[M.D.]] from [[New York University School of Medicine]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite book|last= Drescher|first= Jack|title=Ex-Gay Research: Analyzing the Spitzer Study and Its Relation to Science, Religion, Politics, and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkMBxnEQ1IMC|chapter=An Interview with Robert L.

Spitzer wrote an article on [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s theories in 1953 which the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' declined to publish.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert L. [http://www.srmhp.org/0401/spitzer.html "The Story of Robert L. Spitzer's Paper, 'An Examination of Wilhelm Reich's Demonstration of Orgone Energy'"], ''The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice'', Vol. 4, No. 1, Spring–Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Spitzer spent most of his career at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] as a Professor of Psychiatry until he retired in 2003.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; He was on the research faculty of the [[Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research]] where he retired after 49 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute to Robert L.

A colleague at Columbia has described him as an "iconoclast" who "looked for injustice".&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

=== Screening and Diagnostic Tools ===
Spitzer was a major architect of the modern [[classification of mental disorders]]. 
In 1968, he co-developed a computer program, ''Diagno I'', based on a logical [[decision tree]], that could derive a diagnosis from the scores on a Psychiatric Status Schedule which he co-published in 1970 and that the ''United States Steering Committee for the United States–United Kingdom Diagnostic Project'' used to check the consistency of its results.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooper, J. E.|title=Psychiatric Diagnosis in New York and London |year=1972 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0-19-712142-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

Spitzer was a member on the four-person ''United States Steering Committee for the United States–United Kingdom Diagnostic Project'', which published their results in 1972. They found the most important difference between countries was that the concept of [[schizophrenia]] used in New York was much broader than the one used in London, and included patients who would have been termed [[manic-depressive]] or [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]].&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;{{rp|vii}}

He developed psychiatric methods that focused on asking specific interview questions to get at a diagnosis as opposed to the [[open-ended question]]ing of psychoanalysis, which was the predominant technique of mental health.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; He codeveloped the [[Mood Disorders Questionnaire|Mood Disorder Questionnaire]] (MDQ), a screening technique used for diagnosing bipolar disorder. He also co-developed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME-MD) which can be self-administered to find out if one has a mental illness.&lt;ref name=NYSPI /&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. Patient Health Questionnaire Primary Care Study Group. Validation and utility of a self-report version of the PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. JAMA. 1999;282:1737–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of PRIME-MD directed at depression (PHQ2 and PHQ9) have since become accepted in primary care medicine for screening and diagnosis of major depression as well as for monitoring response to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Am Fam Physician. 2012;85(2):139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manea, Laura L (01/2015). "A diagnostic meta-analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ([[PHQ-9]]) algorithm scoring method as a screen for depression.". General hospital psychiatry (0163-8343), 37 (1), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Position on the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ===
In 1974, Spitzer became the chair of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s task force of the third edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' the so-called, ''[[DSM-III]]'' which was released in 1980. Spitzer is a major architect of the modern classification of mental disorders which involves classifying mental disorders in discrete categories with specified diagnostic criteria but later criticized what he saw as errors and excesses in the DSM's later versions, although he maintained his position that the ''DSM'' is still better than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=psychtimes/&gt;

In 2003, Spitzer co-authored a position paper with ''[[DSM-IV]]'' editor [[Michael First]], stating that the "''DSM'' is generally viewed as clinically useful" based on surveys from practicing professionals and feedback from medical students and residents, but that [[primary care]] physicians find the ''DSM'' too complicated for their use.  The authors emphasized that given then-current limitations in understanding psychiatric disorders, a multitude of ''DSM'' codes/diagnoses might apply to some patients, but that it would be a "total speculation" to assign a single diagnosis to a patient. The authors rejected calls to adopt the [[ICD-9]] because it lacked diagnostic criteria and would "[set] psychiatry back 30 years," while the [[ICD-10]], closely resembled the DSM-III-R classification.&lt;ref name=psychtimes&gt;{{cite web| last1= First | first1= Michael | first2= Robert L. | last2= Spitzer| url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/48541 | title= The ''DSM'': Not Perfect, but Better Than the Alternative| date= 1 April 2003 | work=[[Psychiatric Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a definitive autobiography of Spitzer, "The Making of DSM-III®: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry", was published by author and historian Hannah S. Decker.

Spitzer was briefly featured in the 2007 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[The Trap (television documentary series)|The Trap]]'', in which he stated that the ''DSM'', by [[operational definition|operationalizing the definitions]] of mental disorders while paying little attention to the context in which the symptoms occur, may have [[Medicalization|medicalized]] the normal human experiences of a significant number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Spitzer, Robert |title=The Trap|publisher=BBC via The Internet Archive|time=Part 2 at 34:10|date=March 2007|url=https://archive.org/details/AdamCurtis_TheTrap|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Spitzer had criticized the revision process of the ''[[DSM-5]]'' for lacking [[transparency (social)|transparency]].&lt;ref name=nyt081218&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/health/18psych.html?pagewanted=all|title=Psychiatrists Revise the Book of Human Troubles|first=Benedict|last=Carey|date=December 17, 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticized specific proposals, like the proposed introduction of the [[psychosis risk syndrome]] for people who have mild symptoms found in psychotic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Stein | first=Rob|title=Revision to the bible of psychiatry, ''DSM'', could introduce new mental disorders| work= The Washington Post|date=10 February 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/10/AR2010021000009.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On homosexuality===

Spitzer led a successful effort, in 1973, to stop treating homosexuality as a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/27/461175226/psychiatrist-who-played-major-role-in-destigmatizing-homosexuality-has-died Psychiatrist Who Played Major Role In Destigmatizing Homosexuality Dies : The Two-Way : NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/us/robert-spitzer-psychiatrist-who-set-rigorous-standards-for-diagnosis-dies-at-83.html Robert Spitzer, 83, Dies; Psychiatrist Set Rigorous Standards for Diagnosis - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was partly due to Spitzer's efforts that homosexuality was "removed" (i.e. renamed as Sexual Orientation Disturbance) in 1974 [[DSM-II]]: "By withdrawing it from the manual, homosexuality was legitimized as a normal difference rather than a psychiatric behavior. This early powerful statement by institutional psychiatry that this is normal sped up the confidence of people in the movement."
&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Alison Snyder. Robert L Spitzer. Obituary. The Lancet. Volume 387, Issue 10017, 30 January–5 February 2016, Page 428.
doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00182-3.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Spitzer delivered a controversial paper, "[[Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation?]]" at the 2001 annual APA meeting; he argued that it is possible that some highly motivated individuals could successfully [[sexual orientation change efforts|change their sexual orientation]] from homosexual to heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130S2012/LabDocuments/Spitzer.pdf Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation? 200 Participants Reporting a Change from Homosexual to Heterosexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Washington Post'' article indicated that Spitzer held 45 min telephonic interviews with 200 people who claimed that their respective sexual orientations had changed from homosexual to heterosexual. Spitzer said he "began his study as a skeptic," but the study revealed that "66 percent of the men and 44 percent of the women had arrived at what [Spitzer] called good heterosexual functioning," defined as "being in a sustained, loving heterosexual relationship within the past year, getting enough satisfaction from the emotional relationship with their partner to rate at least seven on a 10-point scale, having satisfying heterosexual sex at least monthly and never or rarely thinking of somebody of the same sex during heterosexual sex."

Spitzer also found that "89 percent of men and 95 percent of women said they were bothered only slightly, or not at all, by unwanted homosexual feelings" but that "only 11 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women reported a complete absence of homosexual indicators, including same-sex attraction.... Some 43 percent of the sample had been referred to Spitzer by 'ex-gay ministries.... An additional 23 percent were referred by the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality." Spitzer has stated that his research "shows some people can change from gay to straight, and we ought to acknowledge that."&lt;ref name="Some Gays Can"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010509/aponline013921_000.htm | title=Study: Some Gays Can Go Straight | first= Malcolm | last = Ritter | work=The Washington Post | date=9 May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering how difficult it had been to find 100 participants, and that they were considered the best cases of [[conversion therapy]], Spitzer concluded that although change could occur, it was probably very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZwE6_dLweYo|Interview with Dr Spitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthwinsout.org/in-dr-robert-spitzers-own-words/ In Dr. Robert Spitzer's Own Words], TruthWinsOut.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The APA issued an official disavowal of Spitzer's paper, noting that it had not been peer reviewed and stating, "There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of [[reparative therapy]] as a treatment to change one's sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/1153405334669988619162/common/feature.html?record=552&amp;trycookie=1?record=552 Article]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091622/http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/1153405334669988619162/common/feature.html?record=552&amp;trycookie=1%3Frecord%3D552 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, was published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior.

Two thirds of the reviews were critical, and the publication decision sparked controversy, with one member of the publication's supporting organization resigning in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=180133 |title=Storm over gay 'cure' |date=October 3, 2003 |first=Steve |last=Farrar |work=[[Times Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper has been criticized for its sampling methods and criteria for success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_spit.htm Analysis of Dr. Spitzer's study of reparative therapy], ReligiousTolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, Spitzer stated, "Many colleagues were outraged" following the publication of the study. Spitzer added, "Within the gay community, there was initially tremendous anger and feeling that I had betrayed them." When asked whether he would consider a follow-up study, Spitzer said no and added that he felt "a little battle fatigue."&lt;ref name=TherIncor&gt;Leblanc, Douglas. Interview of Robert Spitzer. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/20.94.html "Therapeutically Incorrect: Atheist psychiatrist argues that gays can change"], ''Christianity Today'', 29 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While Spitzer has said that he has no way of knowing whether the study participants were being honest,&lt;ref name="Some Gays Can" /&gt; he has also indicated that he believed that the interviewees were being candid with him.&lt;ref name=TherIncor /&gt;

In a 2012 interview, Spitzer said he asked to retract the study and stated that he agreed with its critics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | url=http://prospect.org/article/my-so-called-ex-gay-life/
  | work=The American Prospect 
  | title=My So-Called Ex-Gay Life
  | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "In retrospect, I have to admit I think the critiques are largely correct," he said. "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more." He said he spoke with the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior about writing a retraction, but the editor declined. (Repeated attempts to contact the journal went unanswered.)

In a letter to [[Kenneth J Zucker]], editor of ''Journal of Sexual Behavior'', Spitzer wrote:
{{quote|"Several months ago I told you that because of my revised view of my 2001 study of reparative therapy changing sexual orientation, I was considering writing something that would acknowledge that I now judged the major critiques of the study as largely correct. After discussing my revised view of the study with Gabriel Arana, a reporter for ''American Prospect', and with Malcolm Ritter, an [[Associated Press]] science writer, I decided that I had to make public my current thinking about the study. Here it is.
&lt;br&gt;"'''Basic Research Question.''' From the beginning it was: “can some version of reparative therapy enable individuals to change their sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual?” Realizing that the study design made it impossible to answer this question, I suggested that the study could be viewed as answering the question, “how do individuals undergoing reparative therapy describe changes in sexual orientation?” – a not very interesting question.
&lt;br&gt;"'''The Fatal Flaw in the Study – There was no way to judge the credibility of subject reports of change in sexual orientation.''' I offered several (unconvincing) reasons why it was reasonable to assume that the subject’s reports of change were credible and not self-deception or outright lying. But the simple fact is that there was no way to determine if the subject’s accounts of change were valid.&lt;br&gt;I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">In [[theoretical computer science]] a '''simulation preorder''' is a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] between [[state transition system]]s associating systems which behave in the same way in the sense that one system ''simulates'' the other.

Intuitively, a system simulates another system if it can match all of its moves.

The basic definition relates states within one transition system, but this is easily adapted to relate two separate transition systems by building a system consisting of the [[disjoint union]] of the corresponding components.

==Formal definition==
Given a [[state transition system|labelled state transition system]] (S, Λ, →), a ''simulation'' relation is a [[binary relation]] R over S (i.e. R ⊆ S &amp;times; S) such that for every pair of elements (p,q) ∈ R, for all α ∈ Λ, and for all p' ∈ S, 

:&lt;math&gt; p  \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}   p' &lt;/math&gt;

implies that there is a q' ∈ S such that

:&lt;math&gt; q   \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}  q' &lt;/math&gt;

and (p',q') ∈ R.

Equivalently, in terms of [[Composition of relations|relational composition]]:
:&lt;math&gt;R^{-1}\,; \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}\quad {\subseteq}\quad \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}\,; R^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Given two states p and q in S, q ''simulates'' p, written p ≤ q if there is a simulation R such that (p, q) ∈ R. The relation ≤ is a [[preorder]], and is usually called the ''simulation preorder''. It is the largest simulation relation over a given transition system.

Two states ''p'' and ''q'' are said to be ''similar'', written p ≤≥ q, if ''p'' simulates ''q'' and ''q'' simulates ''p''. Similarity is an [[equivalence relation]], but it is coarser than [[bisimilarity]].

==Similarity of separate transition systems==
When comparing two different transition systems (S', Λ', →') and (S", Λ", →"), the basic notions of simulation and similarity can be used by forming the disjoint composition of the two machines, (S, Λ, →) with S = S' ∐ S", Λ = Λ' ∪ Λ" and → = →' ∪ →", where ∐ is the [[disjoint union]] operator between sets.

'''Sketchpad''' (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) was a revolutionary computer program written by [[Ivan Sutherland]] in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the [[Turing Award]] in 1988, and the [[Kyoto Prize]] in 2012.  It pioneered the way for [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI).&lt;ref name="SearsJacko2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Andrew|last2=Jacko|first2=Julie A.|title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies and Emerging Applications, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8TPF_O385AC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=19 September 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4106-1586-2|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of [[computer graphics]] in general. For example, the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) was derived from the Sketchpad as well as modern [[object oriented programming]]. Ivan Sutherland demonstrated with it that computer graphics could be used for both [[computer art|artistic]] and [[Computer-aided design|technical]] purposes in addition to showing a novel method of [[human-computer interaction]].

== History ==
Sutherland was inspired by the [[Memex]] from "[[As We May Think]]" by [[Vannevar Bush]]. Sketchpad inspired [[Douglas Engelbart]] to design and develop [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] at the [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC) at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) during the 1960s.

== Software ==

Sketchpad was the first program ever to utilize a complete [[graphical user interface]].

The clever way the program organized its [[Geometry|geometric]] data pioneered the use of "master" ("objects") and "occurrences" ("instances") in computing and pointed forward to [[object oriented programming]]. The main idea was to have master drawings which one could instantiate into many duplicates. If the user changed the master drawing, all the instances would change as well.

Geometric '''constraints''' is another major invention in Sketchpad was that it let the user easily constrain geometric properties in the drawing&amp;mdash;for instance, the length of a line or the angle between two lines could be fixed.

As a trade magazine said, clearly Sutherland "broke new ground in 3D computer modeling and visual simulation, the basis for computer graphics and CAD/CAM".&lt;ref name=Penton&gt;{{cite news|url=http://americanmachinist.com/cadcam-software/cadcam-hall-fame|title=The CAD/CAM Hall of Fame|work=American Machinist|publisher=Penton Media|date=November 1, 1998|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few programs can be called precedents for his achievements. [[Patrick J. Hanratty]] is sometimes called the "father of CAD/CAM"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patrick Hanratty spotlight|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/spotlight/spotlight_hanratty.php|date=October 18, 2012|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote PRONTO, a [[numerical control]] language at [[General Electric]] in 1957, and wrote CAD software while working for [[General Motors]] beginning in 1961. Sutherland wrote in his thesis that [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] had a "similar program"&lt;ref name=IES-thesis&gt;{{cite web | last=Sutherland | first=Ivan Edward | title=Sketchpad: A man-machine graphical communication system (courtesy Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge UCAM-CL-TR-574 September 2003) | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date=January 1963 | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.html | accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[T-Square (software)|T-Square]] was developed by [[Peter Samson]] and one or more fellow MIT students in 1962, both for the [[PDP-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Computer History Museum | title=The Mouse that Roared: PDP-1 Celebration Event (Running Time: 01:53:46)| date= 15 May 2006| url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/moving-image/DEC/PDP-1_Online/dec.the_mouse_that_roared_pdp_1_celebration_event.lecture.2006.102654189.wmv | accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
Sketchpad ran on the [[Lincoln TX-2]] (1958) computer at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], which had 64k of 36-bit words. The user drew on the screen with the recently invented [[light pen]]. Of the 36 bits available to store each display spot in the display file, 20 gave the coordinates of that spot for the display system and the remaining 16 gave the address of the n-component element responsible for adding that spot to display.

In 1963 most computers ran jobs in [[batch job]] mode only, using [[punched card]]s or [[magnetic tape]] reels submitted by professional programmers or [[engineering]] students.  A considerable amount of work was required to make the TX-2 operate in interactive mode with a large [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen.  When Sutherland had finished with it, it had to be reconverted to run in batch mode again.

== Publications ==
The Sketchpad program was part and parcel of Sutherland's [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis at [[MIT]] and peripherally related to the [http://images.designworldonline.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CADhistory/8436-TM-4.pdf Computer-Aided Design project] at that time.

'''Splenogonadal fusion''' is a rare [[congenital]] malformation that results from an abnormal connection between the primitive [[spleen]] and [[gonad]] during gestation. A portion of the splenic tissue then descends with the gonad.  Splenogonadal fusion has been classified into two types: continuous, where there remains a connection between the main spleen and gonad; and discontinuous, where [[ectopia (medicine)|ectopic]] splenic tissue is attached to the gonad, but there is no connection to the orthotopic spleen.  Patients with continuous splenogonadal fusion frequently have additional congenital abnormalities, most commonly [[cryptorchidism]].&lt;ref name=Uro2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kocher|first=NJ|author2=Tomaszewski, JJ |author3=Parsons, RB |author4=Cronson, BR |author5=Altman, H |author6= Kutikov, A |title=Splenogonadal fusion: a rare etiology of solid testicular mass |journal=Urology|date=Jan 2014|volume=83|issue=1|pages=e1-2|pmid=24200197|doi=10.1016/j.urology.2013.09.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''star catalogue''' ([[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]]) or '''star catalog''' ([[American English]]), is an [[astronomical catalog]]ue that lists [[star]]s. In [[astronomy]], many stars are referred to simply by catalogue numbers. There are a great many different star catalogues which have been produced for different purposes over the years, and this article covers only some of the more frequently quoted ones. Star catalogues were compiled by many different ancient people, including the [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[History of China|Chinese]], [[History of Iran|Persians]], and [[Arab]]s. They were sometimes accompanied by a [[star chart]] for illustration. Most modern catalogues are available in electronic format and can be freely downloaded from space agencies [[Data Centre|data centres]].

Completeness and accuracy is described by the weakest [[apparent magnitude]] V (largest number) and the accuracy of the positions.

==Historical catalogues==

===Ancient Near East===
From their existing records, it is known that the [[Egyptian astronomy|ancient Egyptians]] recorded the names of only a few identifiable [[constellation]]s and a list of thirty-six [[decans]] that were used as a [[star clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chadwick|2005|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians called the [[circumpolar star]] 'the star that cannot perish' and, although they made no known formal star catalogues, they nonetheless created extensive [[star chart]]s of the night sky which adorn the coffins and ceilings of tomb chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Forman|Quirke|1996|pp=60–61, 116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ancient [[Sumer]]ians were the first to record the names of constellations on [[clay tablet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kanas|2007|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Babylonian star catalogues|earliest known star catalogues]] were compiled by [[Babylonian astronomy|the ancient Babylonians]] of [[Mesopotamia]] in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the [[Kassites|Kassite Period]] (''c''. 1531 BC to ''c''. 1155 BC). They are better known by their [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian-era name]] 'Three Stars Each'. These star catalogues, written on [[Enuma anu enlil|clay tablets]], listed thirty-six stars: twelve for '[[Anu]]' along the [[celestial equator]], twelve for '[[Enki|Ea]]' south of that, and twelve for '[[Enlil]]' to the north.&lt;ref name="north 1995 30 31"&gt;{{harvp|North|1995|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mul.Apin]] lists, dated to sometime before the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (626–539 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Horowitz|1998|pp=168–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; are direct textual descendants of the 'Three Stars Each' lists and their constellation patterns show similarities to those of later [[Ancient Greek science|Greek civilization]].&lt;ref name="north 1995 32"&gt;{{harvp|North|1995|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic world and Roman Empire===
In [[Ancient Greece]], the astronomer and mathematician [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] laid down a full set of the classical [[constellation]]s around 370 BC.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998: 81"/&gt; His catalogue ''[[Aratus|Phaenomena]]'', rewritten by [[Aratus of Soli]] between 275 and 250 BC as a didactic poem, became one of the most consulted astronomical texts in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and beyond.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998: 81"/&gt; It contains descriptions of the positions of the stars, the shapes of the constellations and provided information on their relative times of rising and setting.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998: 81"&gt;{{harvp|Rogers|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately in the 3rd century BC, the [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] [[Timocharis of Alexandria]] and [[Aristillus]] created another star catalogue. [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190 – c. 120 BC) completed his star catalogue in 129 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Liverington|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he compared to [[Timocharis]]' and discovered that the [[longitude]] of the stars had changed over time. This led him to determine the first value of the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Liverington|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century, [[Ptolemy]] (c. 90 – c. 186 AD) of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] published a star catalogue as part of his ''[[Almagest]]'', which listed 1,022 stars visible from [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;

The Islamic astronomer [[al-Sufi]] updated it in 964, and the star positions were redetermined by [[Ulugh Beg]] in 1437,&lt;ref&gt;

Although the ancient [[Vedas]] of [[Indian astronomy|India]] specified how the [[ecliptic]] was to be divided into twenty-eight ''[[nakshatra]]'', Indian constellation patterns were ultimately borrowed from Greek ones sometime after [[Wars of Alexander the Great|Alexander's conquests in Asia]] in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kanas|2007|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient China===
{{further|Chinese star maps}}
The earliest known inscriptions for [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese star names]] were written on [[oracle bone]]s and date to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 – c. 1050 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources dating from the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1050 – 256 BC) which provide star names include the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', the ''[[Shi Jing]]'', and the "[[Canon of Yao]]" (堯典) in the ''[[Book of Documents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' written by the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] statesman [[Lü Buwei]] (d. 235 BC) provides most of the names for the [[twenty-eight mansions]] (i.e. [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] across the [[ecliptic]] belt of the [[celestial sphere]] used for constructing the [[Chinese calendar|calendar]]). An earlier [[lacquerware]] chest found in the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] (interred in 433 BC) contains a complete list of the names of [[Chinese constellation#The Twenty-Eight Mansions|the twenty-eight mansions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star catalogues are traditionally attributed to [[Shi Shen]] and [[Gan De]], two rather obscure [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomer]]s who may have been active in the 4th century BC of the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC).&lt;ref name="Cullen 1980: 46f."&gt;{{harvp|Cullen|1980|pp=46ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shi Shen astronomy'' (石申天文, Shi Shen tienwen) is attributed to Shi Shen, and the ''Astronomic star observation'' (天文星占, Tianwen xingzhan) to Gan De.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peng|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) that astronomers started to observe and record names for all the stars that were apparent (to the [[naked eye]]) in the night sky, not just those around the ecliptic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A star catalogue is featured in one of the chapters of the late 2nd-century-BC history work ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]] (145–86 BC) and contains the "schools" of Shi Shen and Gan De's work (i.e. the different constellations they allegedly focused on for astrological purposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sima's catalogue—the ''Book of Celestial Offices'' (天官書 Tianguan shu)—includes some 90 constellations, the stars therein named after [[Temple (Chinese)|temples]], ideas in [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], locations such as markets and shops, and different people such as [[Society and culture of the Han Dynasty#Social class|farmers and soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kanas|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his ''Spiritual Constitution of the Universe'' (靈憲, Ling Xian) of 120 AD, the astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) compiled a star catalogue comprising 124 constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese constellation]] names were later adopted by the [[Korea]]ns and [[Japan]]ese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kanas|2007|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic world===
A large number of star catalogues were published by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]]. These were mainly ''[[Zij]]'' treatises, including [[Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī|Arzachel]]'s ''[[Tables of Toledo]]'' (1087), the [[Maragheh observatory]]'s ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]'' (1272) and [[Ulugh Beg]]'s ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'' (1437). Other famous [[Arabic language|Arabic]] star catalogues include [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Alfraganus]]' ''A compendium of the science of stars'' (850) which corrected Ptolemy's ''Almagest'';&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dallal|1999|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi|Azophi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'' (964) which described observations of the [[star]]s, their positions, [[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]], brightness and [[colour]], drawings for each [[constellation]], and the first descriptions of [[Andromeda Galaxy]]&lt;ref name="NSOG"&gt;{{harvp|Kepple|Sanner|1998|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].&lt;ref name="obspm"&gt;

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
The ''Motul Dictionary'', compiled in the 16th century by an anonymous author (although attributed to Fray Antonio de Ciudad Real), contains a list of stars originally observed by the [[Maya civilization|ancient Mayas]]. The Maya [[Paris Codex]] also contain symbols for different constellations which were represented by mythological beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Severen|1981|pp=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayer and Flamsteed catalogues===
{{Main|Bayer designation|Flamsteed designation}}

Two systems introduced in historical catalogues remain in use to the present day. The first system comes from the [[Germans|German]] astronomer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'', published in 1603 and regarding bright stars. These are given a [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] followed by the [[genitive case]] of the [[constellation]] in which they are located; examples are [[Alpha Centauri]] or [[Gamma Cygni]]. The major problem with Bayer's naming system was the number of letters in the [[Greek alphabet]] (24). It was easy to run out of letters before running out of stars needing names, particularly for large constellations such as [[Argo Navis]]. Bayer extended his lists up to 67 stars by using lower-case Roman letters ("a" through "z") then upper-case ones ("A" through "Q"). Few of those designations have survived. It is worth mentioning, however, as it served as the starting point for [[variable star designations]], which start with "R" through "Z", then "RR", "RS", "RT"..."RZ", "SS", "ST"..."ZZ" and beyond.

The second system comes from the English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]]'s ''[[Historia coelestis Britannica]]'' (1725). It kept the genitive-of-the-constellation rule for the back end of his catalogue names, but used numbers instead of the Greek alphabet for the front half. Examples include [[61 Cygni]] and [[47 Ursae Majoris]].

==Full-sky catalogues (in chronological order)==
Bayer and Flamsteed covered only a few thousand stars between them. In theory, full-sky catalogues try to list every star in the sky. There are, however, billions of stars resolvable by [[telescope]]s, so this is an impossible goal; with this kind of catalog, an attempt is generally made to get every star brighter than a given [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]].

===LAL===
{{Main|Histoire Céleste Française}}
[[Jérôme Lalande]] published the ''[[Histoire Céleste Française]]'' in 1801, which contained an extensive star catalog, among other things. The observations made were made from the [[Paris Observatory]] and so it describes mostly northern stars. This catalogue contained the positions and magnitudes of 47,390 stars, out to magnitude 9, and was the most complete catalogue up to that time. A significant reworking of this catalogue in 1846 added reference numbers to the stars that are used to refer to some of these stars to this day. The decent accuracy of this catalogue kept it in common use as a reference by observatories around the world throughout the 19th century.

===BD/CD/CPD===
{{Main|Durchmusterung}}

The ''[[Bonner Durchmusterung]]'' (''German'': [[Bonn]] sampling) and follow-ups were the most complete of the pre-photographic star catalogues.

The ''Bonner Durchmusterung'' itself was published by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander]], [[Adalbert Krueger|Adalbert Krüger]], and [[Eduard Schoenfeld|Eduard Schönfeld]] between 1852 and 1859. It covered 320,000 stars in epoch 1855.0.

As it covered only the northern sky and some of the south (being compiled from the [[Bonn]] observatory), this was then supplemented by the ''Südliche Durchmusterung '' (SD), which covers stars between declinations −1 and −23 degrees
(1886, 120,000 stars). It was further supplemented by the ''[[Cordoba Durchmusterung]]'' (580,000 stars), which began to be compiled at [[Córdoba, Argentina]] in 1892 under the initiative of [[John M. Thome]] and covers declinations −22 to −90. Lastly, the ''Cape Photographic Durchmusterung'' (450,000 stars, 1896), compiled at the Cape, South Africa, covers declinations −18 to&amp;nbsp;−90.

Astronomers preferentially use the HD designation (see next entry) of a star, as that catalogue also gives [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] information, but as the Durchmusterungs cover more stars they occasionally fall back on the older designations when dealing with one not found in Draper. Unfortunately, a lot of catalogues cross-reference the Durchmusterungs without specifying which one is used in the zones of overlap, so some confusion often remains.

Star names from these catalogues include the initials of which of the four catalogues they are from (though the ''Southern'' follows the example of the ''Bonner'' and uses BD; CPD is often shortened to CP), followed by the angle of [[declination]] of the star (rounded towards zero, and thus ranging from +00 to +89 and −00 to −89), followed by an arbitrary number as there are always thousands of stars at each angle. Examples include BD+50°1725 or CD−45°13677.

===HD/HDE===
{{Main|Henry Draper Catalogue}}

The Henry Draper Catalogue was published in the period 1918–1924. It covers the whole sky down to about ninth or tenth magnitude, and is notable as the first large-scale attempt to catalogue [[spectral type]]s of stars.
The catalogue was compiled by [[Annie Jump Cannon]] and her co-workers at [[Harvard College Observatory]] under the supervision of [[Edward Charles Pickering]], and was named in honour of [[Henry Draper]], whose widow donated the money required to finance it.

HD numbers are widely used today for stars which have no Bayer or Flamsteed designation. Stars numbered 1–225300 are from the original catalogue and are numbered in order of [[right ascension]] for the 1900.0 [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. Stars in the range 225301–359083 are from the 1949 extension of the catalogue. The notation HDE can be used for stars in this extension, but they are usually denoted HD as the numbering ensures that there can be no ambiguity.

===AC===
The ''Catalogue astrographique'' (Astrographic Catalogue) was part of the international ''[[Carte du Ciel]]'' programme designed to photograph and measure the positions of all stars brighter than magnitude 11.0. In total, over 4.6 million stars were observed, many as faint as 13th magnitude. This project was started in the late 19th century. The observations were made between 1891 and 1950. To observe the entire celestial sphere without burdening too many institutions, the sky was divided among 20 observatories, by declination zones. Each observatory exposed and measured the plates of its zone, using a standardized telescope (a "normal [[astrograph]]") so each plate photographed had a similar scale of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm. The [[U.S. Naval Observatory]] took over custody of the catalogue, now in its 2000.2 edition.

===BS, BSC, HR===
{{Main|Bright Star Catalogue}}

First published in 1930 as the ''[[Yale University|Yale]] Catalog of Bright Stars'', this catalogue contained information on all stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] 6.5 in the ''Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue''. The list was revised in 1983 with the publication of a supplement that listed additional stars down to magnitude 7.1. The catalogue detailed each star's coordinates, [[proper motion]]s, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] data, [[spectral type]]s, and other useful information.

The last printed version of the Bright Star Catalogue was the 4th revised edition, released in 1982. The 5th edition is in electronic form and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;

===SAO===
{{Main|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog}}

The [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] catalogue was compiled in 1966 from various previous [[astrometry|astrometric]] catalogues, and contains only the stars to about ninth magnitude for which accurate proper motions were known. There is considerable overlap with the Henry Draper catalogue, but any star lacking motion data is omitted. The [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] for the position measurements in the latest edition is [[J2000.0]]. The SAO catalogue contains this major piece of information not in Draper, the [[proper motion]] of the stars, so it is often used when that fact is of importance. The cross-references with the Draper and Durchmusterung catalogue numbers in the latest edition are also useful.

Names in the SAO catalogue start with the letters SAO, followed by a number. The numbers are assigned following 18 ten-degree bands in the sky, with stars sorted by [[right ascension]] within each band.

The data was obtained from scans of 7,435 [[Schmidt camera|Schmidt]] plates taken for the various sky surveys during the last 50 years. USNO-B1.0 is believed to provide all-sky coverage, completeness down to V = 21, 0.2 arcsecond astrometric accuracy at [[J2000.0]], 0.3 magnitude photometric accuracy in up to five colors, and 85% accuracy for distinguishing stars from non-stellar objects.

===GSC===
{{Main|Guide Star Catalog}}
The ''Guide Star Catalog'' is an online catalogue of stars produced for the purpose of accurately positioning and identifying stars satisfactory for use as guide  stars by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] program. The first version of the catalogue was produced in the late 1980s by digitizing photographic plates and contained about 20 million stars, out to about magnitude 15. The latest version of this catalogue contains information for 945,592,683 stars, out to magnitude 21. The latest version continues to be used to accurately position the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

===PPM===
The [[PPM Star Catalogue]] (1991) is one of the best,{{According to whom|date=August 2011}} both in the proper motion and star position till 1999. Not as precise as the [[Hipparcos]] catalogue but with many more stars. The PPM was built from BD, SAO, HD and more, with sophisticated algorithm and is an extension for the Fifth Fundamental Catalogue, "[[Catalogues of Fundamental Stars]]".

===HIP===
The [[Hipparcos catalogue]] was compiled from the data gathered by the [[European Space Agency]]'s astrometric satellite ''[[Hipparcos]]'', which was operational from 1989 to 1993. The catalogue was published in June 1997 and contains 118,218 stars; an updated version with re-processed data was published in 2007. It is particularly notable for its [[Stellar parallax|parallax]] measurements, which are considerably more accurate than those produced by ground-based observations. A revised version was published in 2007.

===Gl, GJ, Wo===
{{Main|Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars}}
The [[Wilhelm Gliese|Gliese]] (later Gliese-[[Hartmut Jahreiß|Jahreiß]]) catalogue attempts to list all star systems within {{convert|20|pc|ly}} of [[Earth]] ordered by [[right ascension]] (see the [[List of nearest stars]]). Later editions expanded the coverage to {{convert|25|pc|ly}}. Numbers in the range 1.0–915.0 ('''Gl''' numbers) are from the second edition, which was

:''Catalogue of Nearby Stars'' (1969, W. Gliese).
The integers up to 915 represent systems which were in the first edition. Numbers with a decimal point were used to insert new star systems for the second edition without destroying the desired order (by [[right ascension]]). This catalogue is referred to as CNS2, although this name is never used in catalogue numbers.

Numbers in the range 9001–9850 ('''Wo''' numbers) are from the supplement

:''Extension of the Gliese catalogue'' (1970, [[Richard van der Riet Woolley|R. Woolley]], E. A. Epps, M. J. Penston and S. B. Pocock).

Numbers in the ranges 1000–1294 and 2001–2159 ('''GJ''' numbers) are from the supplement

:''Nearby Star Data Published 1969–1978'' (1979, W. Gliese and H. Jahreiß).

The range 1000–1294 represents nearby stars, while 2001–2159 represents suspected nearby stars. In the literature, the GJ numbers are sometimes retroactively extended to the Gl numbers (since there is no overlap). For example, [[Gliese 436]] can be interchangeably referred to as either Gl 436 or GJ 436.

Numbers in the range 3001–4388 are from

:''Preliminary Version of the Third Catalogue of Nearby Stars'' (1991, W. Gliese and H. Jahreiß).

Although this version of the catalogue was termed "preliminary", it is still the current one {{As of|2006|alt=as of March 2006}}, and is referred to as CNS3. It lists a total of 3,803 stars. Most of these stars already had GJ numbers, but there were also 1,388 which were not numbered. The need to give these 1,388 ''some'' name has resulted in them being numbered 3001–4388 ('''NN''' numbers, for "no name"), and data files of this catalogue now usually include these numbers. An example of a star which is often referred to by one of these unofficial GJ numbers is [[GJ 3021]].

===GCTP===
The General Catalogue of Trigonometric Parallaxes, first published in 1952 and later superseded by the New GCTP (now in its fourth edition), covers nearly 9,000 stars. Unlike the Gliese, it does not cut off at a given distance from the Sun; rather it attempts to catalogue all known measured parallaxes. It gives the co-ordinates in 1900 epoch, the secular variation, the proper motion, the weighted average absolute parallax and its standard error, the number of parallax observations, quality of interagreement of the different values, the visual magnitude and various cross-identifications with other catalogues. Auxiliary information, including UBV photometry, MK spectral types, data on the variability and binary nature of the stars, orbits when available, and miscellaneous information to aid in determining the reliability of the data are also listed.

===Proper motion catalogues===
A common way of detecting nearby stars is to look for relatively high proper motions. Several catalogues exist, of which we'll mention a few. The [[Frank Elmore Ross|Ross]] and [[Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf|Wolf]] catalogues pioneered the domain:

:[[Frank Elmore Ross|Ross, Frank Elmore]], ''New Proper Motion Stars'', eight successive lists, ''[[The Astronomical Journal]]'', Vol. 36 to 48, 1925–1939&lt;ref&gt;

:[[Max Wolf|Wolf, Max]], "Katalog von 1053 stärker bewegten Fixsternen", Veröff. d. Badischen Sternwarte zu Heidelberg (Königstuhl), Bd. 7, No. 10, 1919; and numerous lists in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'', 209 to 236, 1919–1929&lt;ref&gt;

[[Willem Jacob Luyten]] later produced a series of catalogues:

L - Luyten, Proper motion stars and White dwarfs
:Luyten, W. J., ''Proper Motion Survey with the forty-eight inch Schmidt Telescope'', University of Minnesota, 1941 ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1941QB811.L852..... ''General Catalogue of the Bruce Proper-Motion Survey''])
&lt;!--- Title taken from http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1941ApJ....94..549L ---&gt;

LPM – Luyten Proper-Motion catalogue
: Luyten, W. J., ''Proper Motion Survey with the 48 inch Schmidt Telescope'', University of Minnesota, 1963–1981
::LP numbers: L in zones −45 to −89 deg.; LP in zones +89 to −44 deg.

Around the same time period, [[Henry Lee Giclas]] worked on a similar series of catalogues:

:Giclas, H. L., et al., ''Lowell Proper Motion Survey'', ''Lowell Observatory Bulletin'', 1971–1979 ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971lpms.book.....G])

===uvby98===&lt;!-- redirect target for [[uvby98]] --&gt;
The ''ubvyβ Photoelectric Photometric Catalogue'' is a compilation of previously published photometric data. Published in 1998, the catalogue includes 63,316 stars surveyed through 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hauk|Mermilliod|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successors to USNO-A, USNO-B, NOMAD, UCAC and Others===&lt;!-- redirect target for [[USNO-B]] --&gt;
Stars evolve and move over time, making catalogues evolving, impermanent databases at even the most rigorous levels of production. The USNO catalogues are the most current and widely used astrometric catalogues available at present, and include USNO products such as [[Star catalogue#USNO-B1.0|USNO-B]] (the successor to USNO-A), NOMAD, UCAC and others in production or narrowly released. Some users may see specialized catalogues (more recent versions of the above), tailored catalogues, interferometrically-produced cataloges, dynamic catalogues, and those with updated positions, motions, colors, and improved errors. Catalogue data is continually collected at the Naval Observatory dark-sky facility, [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|NOFS]]; and the latest refined, updated catalogues are reduced and produced by NOFS and the [[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]. See the [[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]] Catalog and Image Servers for more information and access.&lt;ref name="usno.navy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Description==
'''Taqbil''' in Arabic literally means '''Kissing'''.  In [[Hadhramaut]], the Sayyid people receive gestures of respect from the rest of population in recognition of their descent from [[Muhammad]]. These gestures include the method of greeting, in which their hand (usually right hand) is kissed and/or sniffed.  This hand-kissing is performed even when the recipient is still a child or a person without any special distinction in terms of religious knowledge or piety, in recognition of the [[nobility]] of the bloodline rather than the merits of the particular individual.&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;  This tradition of Taqbil was called ''Shamma'' in Hadhramaut.&lt;ref name="mapilla"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlb5BrabQd8C| title=Mappila Muslims: A Study on Society and Anti Colonial Struggles| first=Husain |last=Raṇṭattāṇi| publisher=Other Books| year=2007| isbn=978-8-190388788| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, some members of the [[Sayyid|Sada]] continued to put forth justifications for their special treatment.  One of the prominent jurisprudents at the time, Abdurrahman bin Muhammad al-Mashhoor addressed the matter of the special status of the [[Ba'Alawi sada|Sada]] in Hadhramaut.  He asserted that "the descendants of the Prophet were the most favored of people, and the descendants of [[Ba 'Alawi sada|'Alawi]] the most favored of them all" because of religious learning and practice, their high moral standing, their blessedness and their piety.  In response to a question as to the correctness of the practice of kissing the hands of ''Sada'', he asserted that it was correct according to [[Shafi'i]] authorities.&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;

The tradition currently is no longer common among [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]], except when a person greets a respected Sayyid out of paying respect to his knowledge-ability or piety  (such as to a [[Habib]] or a [[Shaikh]]) .

'''Université Laval''' ({{lang-en|'''Laval University'''}}) is a [[French-language]], public [[research university]] in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The University was founded by [[royal charter]] issued by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852, with roots in the founding of the [[Séminaire de Québec]] in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], making it the oldest centre of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French. The university, whose campus was erected from the 1950s onward in the suburban borough of [[Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge]], is ranked among the top ten Canadian universities in terms of research funding&lt;ref&gt;Université Laval. [http://www.scom.ulaval.ca/Presentation/anglais/background.html "Université Laval at a Glance"]. (accessed 17 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and holds four Canada Excellence Research Chairs.

==History==
[[File:François de Laval - Project Gutenberg eText 17174.jpg|thumb|left|200px|François de Laval]] 
[[File:Grand-Séminaire-Québec.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Old Séminaire de Québec today]]
The university began as the [[Séminaire de Québec]], which was founded in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], a member of the [[House of Laval]] and the first [[Bishop of New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, Edited by Lawrence Johnstone Burpee and Arthur G. Doughty.|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Regime the institution mainly trained priests to serve in [[New France]]. After the [[Conquest of 1760]], the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and [[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested expanding the Séminaire de Québec into Université Laval. [[Louis-Jacques Casault|Louis Casault]], a priest who taught physics at the Séminaire de Québec, went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.

The Séminaire de Québec was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], at the request of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] (Governor-General of the Province of Canada), creating Université Laval with "the rights and privileges of a university".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/Université Laval&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816195903/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was signed in 1852. [[Pope Benedict XV]] approved the plan and authorized the institution to establish chairs of theology and confer degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6466.mobile The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the university opened a second campus in [[Montreal]], which became the [[Université de Montréal]] on May 8, 1919, by a writ of [[Pope Benedict XV]]. In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the Université Laval council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

By 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux Séminaire'') in 1989.

Université Laval is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.&lt;ref name=langton1906&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA306|title=The University of Toronto and its colleges, 1827-1906|last=Langton|first=Hugh Hornby|last2=Macallum|first2=Archibald Byron|publisher=The University Library, pub. by the librarian|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}

In the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science.&lt;ref name=langton1906 /&gt;{{rp|1904}} In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

"Laval", a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer, [[Wilfrid Beaudry]], was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal. The music for piano was published in Québec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2016-07-01T18%3A38%3A44Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=16182129&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Aamicus&amp;lang=eng |title= Laval |newspaper=Amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1906  |author=Wilfrid Beaudry |accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university opened its department of social, political, and economic sciences in 1938, signalling a change of approach that continued into the 1960s, based on an idea of higher education as the key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and society.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels, Michael, "Le père Georges-Henri Lévesque et l'établissement des sciences sociales à Laval: 1938–1955", Revue de l'Université d'Ottawa 52, no. 3 (juil.-sept. 1982). Appears in English translation in "Youth, University, and Canadian Society", edited by Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid. Kingston and Montreal: McGill-Queen's University of Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal charter that founded Université Laval in 1852 was designated a National Historic Event in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=1378&amp;oqeName=Laval+University&amp;oqfName=Universit%E9+Laval National Historic Event] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and features==
After it was granted a university charter, several buildings were built in Old Quebec, including the School of Chemistry (1923), the addition on Ste. Famille Street (1931), the Mining School (1938), and the cafeteria building (1945), all by architect Joseph Simeon Bergeron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1103|title=Bergeron, Joseph Simeon|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the neighborhood was already crowded and activities later moved in nearby Sainte-Foy, which was more spacious. 

===Campus building===
Today's campus covers {{cvt|1.2|km2}} and has over 30 buildings (also called ''pavillons''), including many iconic exemplars of [[modern architecture]]. Its earliest buildings and landscapes were designed by [[Edouard Fiset]] ([[:fr:Édouard Fiset|fr]]) from the 1950s, and of its lands, 56 percent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} .

===Other infrastructures===
Pratically all buildings are linked by {{cvt|10|km}} of underground walkways, which are particularly useful in the winter and whose walls are mostly covered by murals painted by student associations and student visitors over the years, as well as graffiti. The campus is also home to the ''Roger-Van den Hende'' botanical garden ([[:fr:Jardin universitaire Roger-Van den Hende|fr]]) which contains some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds. The Louis-Jacques-Casault building also hosts the regional branch of the [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec|National Archives of Quebec]]. The sport building is called [[PEPS]] and is said to be the largest sport complex in eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en-ca/listing/things-to-do/sports-and-nature/skating-rinks/pavillon-de-leducation-physique-et-des-sports-peps-universite-laval-230331533 |title=Pavillon de l'Éducation physique et des sports (PEPS) (Université Laval) |website=Québec Original |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is adjacent to the covered TELUS stadium ([[:fr:Stade TELUS-Université Laval|fr]]).

==Programs==
As of 2002, Université Laval offered over 350 programs to more than 38,000 students. The university also attracts more than 2,500 foreign students annually, and has almost 1,000 students drawn from Canadian provinces outside of Quebec. Many students come to the university for the ''Français pour non-francophones'' program that offers instruction in French as a second language to students from Canada and around the world. It is also the only university in Quebec which trains forestry engineers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Since the mid-1980s, Université Laval has offered distance learning; over 30 programs and 400 courses are offered by distance learning, of which 80% are accessible from the internet.
