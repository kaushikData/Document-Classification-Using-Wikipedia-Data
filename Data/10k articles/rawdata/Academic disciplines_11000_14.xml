'''ACROSS''' is a Singular Strategic R&amp;D Project led by Treelogic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treelogic.com Treelogic]&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mityc.es Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207090817/http://www7.mityc.es/ |date=2009-12-07 }} through the Plan Avanza I+D initiative. ACROSS carries out [[research and development]]&lt;/ref&gt; activities in the field of [[Robotics]] and [[Cognitive informatics|Cognitive Computing]] over an execution time-frame from 2009 to 2011. ACROSS project involves a number higher than 100 researchers from 13 Spanish entities.

== ACROSS project objectives ==
ACROSS modifies the design of [[social robot]]ics, blocked in providing predefined services, going further by means of [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]]. These systems are able to self-reconfigure and modify their behavior autonomously through the capacity for understanding, learning and software [[Virtual private network|remote access]].

In order to provide an open framework for collaboration between universities, [[research center]]s and the Administration, ACROSS develops Open Source Services available to everybody.

== Three application domains ==
ACROSS works in three [[application domain]]s:

* Autonomous living: robots are used as technological tools to help handicapped person into daily tasks.
* Psycho-Affective Disorders ([[autism]]): robots are used to mitigate [[cognitive disorder]]s.
* Marketing: robots are used to interact with humans in a [[recreation]]al approach.

== Consortium ==
* Treelogic
* Alimerka
* Bizintek
* Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya
* [[University of Deusto]]
* European Centre for Soft Computing

'''Arne Dekke Eide Næss''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|n|ə|_|ˈ|n|ɛ|s}} {{respell|AR|nə|_|NESS}}; {{IPA-no|ˈnɛsː|lang}}; 27 January 1912 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2009) was a Norwegian philosopher who coined the term "[[deep ecology]]" and was an important intellectual and inspirational figure within the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C. |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–30 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/775562345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Næss cited [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' as being a key influence in his vision of deep ecology.  Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian [[nonviolence]] and on several occasions participated in [[direct action]].

Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early [[post-war]] period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time, they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems. Naess believed that the [[environmental crisis]] of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged.&lt;ref name="luke"/&gt;

He thereby distinguished between what he called ''deep'' and ''shallow'' ecological thinking. In contrast to the prevailing utilitarian pragmatism of western businesses and governments, he advocated that a true understanding of nature would give rise to a point of view that appreciates the value of [[biological diversity]], understanding that each living thing is dependent on the existence of other creatures in the complex web of interrelationships that is the natural world.&lt;ref name="luke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy W. |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization &amp; Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Næss was born in Slemdal, Oslo, Norway, the son of Christine (Dekke) and Ragnar Eide Næss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boslekt.com/html/fam291xx/fam29101.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Næss was the youngest person to be appointed full professor at the [[University of Oslo]] and the only professor of philosophy in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C.|title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/775562345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a noted mountaineer, who in 1950 led the expedition that made the first ascent of [[Tirich Mir]] (7,708&amp;nbsp;m). The Tvergastein hut in the [[Hallingskarvet]] massif played an important role in Ecosophy T, as "T" is said to represent his mountain hut Tvergastein.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Naess 1989, ''Ecology Community and Lifestyle'', (trans) David Rothenberg, CUP, Cambridge, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he founded the interdisciplinary journal of philosophy ''[[Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy|Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C.|title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arnenass28aug2003.jpg|thumb|Professor Arne Næss campaigning for the Norwegian Green party in 2003]]
In 1970, together with a large number of protesters, he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], and refused to descend until plans to build a dam were dropped. Though the demonstrators were carried away by police and the dam was eventually built, the demonstration launched a  more activist phase of Norwegian environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seed, J. Macy, P. Flemming, A. Naess, ''Thinking like a mountain: towards a council of all beings'', Heritic Books (1988), {{ISBN|0-946097-26-7}}, {{ISBN|0-86571-133-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he won the [[Swedish Academy Nordic Prize]], known as the 'little Nobel'. In 2005 he was decorated as a Commander with Star of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] for socially useful work. Næss was a minor political candidate for the [[Miljøpartiet De Grønne|Norwegian Green Party]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/01/10/stortingsvalg/tab-2005-10-27-18.html |title=Storting Election 2005.

==Philosophy==
Næss' ''[[Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten]]'' (1936) anticipated many themes familiar in post-war analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hannay, Alastair |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=627 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Næss' main philosophical work from the 1950s was entitled "Interpretation and Preciseness". This was an application of [[set theory]] to the problems of language interpretation, extending the work of semanticists such as [[Charles Kay Ogden]] in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]''. A simple way of explaining it is that any given utterance (word, phrase, or sentence) can be considered as having different potential interpretations, depending on prevailing language norms, the characteristics of particular persons or groups of users, and the language situation in which the utterance occurred. These differing interpretations are to be formulated in more precise language represented as subsets of the original utterance. Each subset can, in its turn, have further subsets (theoretically ad infinitum). The advantages of this conceptualisation of interpretation are various. It enables systematic demonstration of possible interpretation, making possible evaluation of which are the more and less "reasonable interpretations". It is a logical instrument for demonstrating language vagueness, undue generalisation, conflation, pseudo-agreement and effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eriksson |first=Darek |title=Phenomeno-semantic complexity: A proposal for an alternative notion of complexity as a foundation for the management of complexity in human affairs |journal=Complexity and Organization |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Næss developed a simplified, practical textbook embodying these advantages, entitled ''Communication and Argument'', which became a valued introduction to this pragmatics or "language logic", and was used over many decades as a ''[[sine qua non]]'' for the preparatory examination at the [[University of Oslo]], later known as "Examen Philosophicum" ("Exphil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C W |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal= Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=528 |doi=10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendations for public debate===
''Communication and Argument'' included his recommendations for objective public debate.  Næss argued for adhering to the following rules to make discussions as fruitful and pleasant as possible:
# '''Avoid tendentious irrelevance'''&lt;br&gt;Examples: Personal attacks, claims of opponents' motivation, explaining reasons for an argument.
# '''Avoid tendentious quoting'''&lt;br&gt;Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate.
# '''Avoid tendentious ambiguity'''&lt;br&gt;Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism.
# '''Avoid tendentious use of [[Straw man|straw men]]'''&lt;br&gt;Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold.
# '''Avoid tendentious statements of fact'''&lt;br&gt;Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete, and one should not withhold relevant information.
# '''Avoid tendentious tone of presentation'''&lt;br&gt;Examples: irony, sarcasm, pejoratives, exaggeration, subtle (or open) threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C W |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=529 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For many years these points were part of two compulsory courses in [[philosophy]] taught in Norwegian universities ("Examen philosophicum" and "Examen facultatum").

===Ecosophy T===
'''Ecosophy T''', as distinct from deep ecology, was originally the name of his personal philosophy. Others such as [[Warwick Fox]] have interpreted deep ecology as a commitment to [[ecosophy]] T, Næss's personal beliefs. The T referred to Tvergastein, a mountain hut where he wrote many of his books, and reflected Næss's view that everyone should develop his own philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, Graham Purchase, Brian Morris, Rodney Aitchtey, Robert Hart, Chris Wilbert, ''Deep Ecology and Anarchism'', Freedom Press (1993) {{ISBN|0-900384-67-0}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a very rich and complex philosophy, Næss's [[ecosophy]] can be summed up as having Self-realization as its core. According to Næss, every being, whether [[human]], [[animal]], or [[vegetable]] has an equal right to live and to blossom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Næss |first=Arne |title=Ecology, community and lifestyle |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1989}} pp. 164-65&lt;/ref&gt; Through this capitalized Self, Næss emphasizes, in distinction to realization of man’s narrow selves, the realization of our selves as part of an [[Earth's spheres|ecospheric]] whole. It is in this whole that our true ecological Self can be realized. Practically Self-realization for Næss means that, if one does not know how the outcomes of one's actions will affect other beings, one should not act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization and Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15|issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[harm principle]].

==Family==
Næss' father, Ragnar Næss, was a successful banker and Næss was the younger brother of shipowner [[Erling Dekke Næss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Philosopher and Mountaineer |newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, QC) |date=Jan 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss himself was a married father of two and was the uncle of mountaineer and businessman [[Arne Næss Jr.]] (1937–2004), who was once married to [[Diana Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Thinker behind 'deep ecology' dies |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen (Ottawa, ON) |date=Jan 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arne Næss Centre of Ecology and Philosophy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''ANCEP'''), located in [[Norway]], is an organization focused on the philosophical heritage of Arne Næss. It was founded in 1998 as an educational organisation aimed at Norwegian students. ANCEP then worked to spread knowledge and understanding of [[ecology]], [[philosophy]] and [[non-violence]]. In 2003 ANCEP changed its name to Gateway College.

ANCEP was reestablished in June 2011 as a non-profit organization by Sjur Paulsen, Geir Grønflaten and Reidar Goffeng. With support from [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]], [[Arts Council Norway]], Center for Development and Environment / [[Centre for Development and the Environment|SUM]] and the Norwegian School of Sport Science / [[Norges Idrettshøgskole]], ANCEP is now working on its first project called (Electronic Library). This project will gather all written, unpublished material by Næss to be scanned and preserved, then to be made  available for the general public as an online based digital library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Autassassinophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] in which a person is [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by the risk of being killed. The [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] may overlap with some other fetishes that risk one's life, such as those involving drowning or choking. This does not necessarily mean the person must actually be in a life-threatening situation, for many are aroused from dreams and fantasies of such.
[[File:Joe Weiss 1957 Gang Girl.jpg|thumb]]

The term was introduced by [[John Money]] who also defined [[erotophonophilia]] as the "reciprocal condition" in which one is aroused by "stage-managing and carrying out the murder of an unsuspecting sexual partner". Money classified both these paraphilias as "of the sacrificial/expiatory type". These concepts, especially their imperfect reciprocity, were criticized by [[Lisa Downing]] who wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The autassassinophiliac, for Money, is more interested in his orgasm than in his death, resulting in a compulsion to 'stage manage the ''possibility'' rather than the ''actuality'' of his end at the hands of another person. The erotophonophiliac, on the other hand, is driven by the actualization of the other's death and &amp;ndash; crucially &amp;ndash; this other must be unaware of the would-be killer's intentions. These definitions, then, effectively preclude reciprocity and are constructed here in such a way as to prevent the possibility of consent. The sexologist, it seems, is incapable of imagining mutuality in this context. [...] The imagined pact is used here as an incentive to the would-be libertarian to support the suppression of paraphilia and the conversion of a death-related desire to a life-giving form."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Downing, "Eros and Thanatos in European and American Sexology" in Kate Fisher, Sarah Toulalan (eds.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16535">'''The Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics Project''' ('''CORE Project''') is an organisation that creates and distributes teaching material for [[economics]] curriculum reform. Its textbook is taught as an introductory course at more than 100 universities. It provides its materials online, at no cost to users. It is registered as a charity&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=CORE Economics Education|url=https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1175143&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|website=The Charity Commission|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CORE Economics Education) in England and Wales.

==Origins==

CORE was conceived in late 2012, by Professors [[Wendy Carlin]] of University college London and [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] of the Santa Fe Institute, and [[:es:Óscar_Landerretche_Moreno|Oscar Landerretche]], who at that time was Director of the School of Economics and Business of the University of Chile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/olanderretche|title=Oscar Landerretche|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, Professor Carlin wrote to colleagues to suggest they collaborate to revise the curriculum, noting that "altering the course of the undergraduate curriculum is like turning around a half a million ton super tanker. But I think that the time may be right for the initiative I am inviting you to join me in proposing."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-core-project.html?spref=tw|title=The CORE Project|website=rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Global economic crisis of 2008-09|global economic crisis of 2008]], students had formed groups, such as the [[International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics]] (ISIPE) and [[Rethinking Economics]], to demand improvements to the mainstream economics curriculum. ISIPE, for example, argued that "teaching in economics departments is too narrowly focused and more effort should be made to broaden the curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Philip|title=Economics students call for shakeup of the way their subject is taught|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/04/economics-students-overhaul-subject-teaching|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Professor Carlin has written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The textbook model is definitely broken. In it, economic actors are amoral and self-interested, [[perfectly competitive]] market prices equate supply to demand implementing “optimal” outcomes, while [[environmental degradation]], [[instability]], and [[Inequality in economics|inequality]] are afterthoughts at best … Yet it continues as the backbone of much undergraduate teaching. However remote from what economists really do and the way we think, this is the “economics” imprinted on the public’s mind."&lt;ref name="CarlinProspect"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlin|first1=Wendy|title=How a new economics syllabus is preparing students for the real-world economy|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/new-economics-model-teaching-syllabus|publisher=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Launched in October 2013 at [[HM Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Rob|title=Institute for New Economic Thinking Launches Project to Reform Undergraduate Syllabus|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/institute-for-new-economic-thinking-launches-project-to-reform-undergraduate-syllabus|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, CORE said its mission was to address these issues by creating a textbook incorporating contributions from many academics with different points of view that was "humbler, more empirical and more topical".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f015a3ac-4aed-11e3-ac3d-00144feabdc0|title=‘Dismal science’ seeks fresh thinking after failure in crisis|date=2013-11-11|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Carlin wrote that students "are embarrassed when they are no more able to explain the eurozone crisis or persistent unemployment than their fellow students in engineering or archaeology", and that CORE would ensure that "digital technology and interactive teaching methods will introduce students to an [[Empirical research|empirical]] discipline. They will learn to use evidence from history, experiments and other data sources to test competing explanations and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/74cd0b94-4de6-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0#axzz2kwVkkxys|title=Economics explains our world – but economics degrees don’t|last=Carlin|first=Wendy|date=17 November 2013|work=Financial Times|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course material==

CORE's courses are offered through [[open access]] online [[E-book|ebooks]] published on [http://core-econ.org its web site]. Its ebooks use a [[Creative Commons]] license&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so that "any user can customize, translate, or improve it for their own use or the use of their students."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===''The Economy''===

''[http://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/ The Economy]'' was designed as the source material for taught courses in the first year of an undergraduate degree, although it has also been used in schools, and for advanced courses in public policy. In 2017, a print version of ''The Economy'' was published by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="Economy book" /&gt;

===''Economy, Society and Public Policy (ESPP)''===

In 2018, CORE posted the first units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/espp/ ESPP]'', an ebook designed to introduce the economics to non-specialists, particularly students from outside economics courses who were taking economics as a minor. Like ''The Economy'', it focuses on topics such as inequality, power, and environmental economics. ESPP is funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/economy-society-and-public-policy-quantitative-economics-course-non-specialists-core-project|title=Economy, Society and Public Policy - new course from coreecon {{!}} Nuffield Foundation|website=www.nuffieldfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Doing Economics''===

Also in 2018, CORE posted the first beta units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/ Doing Economics]'', a collection of empirical projects designed to teach [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] in economics using real-world data, also funded by the Nuffield Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Structure and contributors==

CORE Economics Education is registered as a charity in England and Wales, with a board of trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The day-to-day running of the project is based at [[University College London]]. The course and support materials have been created by academic economists who volunteer their time, including [[Yann Algan]] ([[Sciences Po]], Paris), [[Timothy Besley]] ([[London School of Economics]]), [[Diane Coyle]] ([[University of Manchester]]), [[Cameron Hepburn]] ([[University of Oxford]]), and [[Kevin O'Rourke|Kevin O’Rourke]] ([[University of Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/?filter%5B0%5D=2&amp;search=|title=Contributors - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steering group is [[Wendy Carlin]] ([[University College London]]), [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] ([[Santa Fe Institute]]), [https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/faculty/margaret-stevens Margaret Stevens] (head of the Department of Economics, [[University of Oxford]]), and [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Landerretche_Moreno Oscar Landerretche], the president of [[Codelco]]. In 2017, [http://www.core-econ.org/project/core-usa/ CORE USA], based at [[Barnard College]], was set up to improve outreach in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/project/core-usa/|title=CORE USA - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent economists have contributed to the published material&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/?filter%5B0%5D=contributors&amp;search=|title=Contributors - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including Nobel laureates [[James Heckman]], [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], who recorded videos for it on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X83gk4PvIRc inequality in education], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7vzgexzXOk matching markets] and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_W9SsstO9Y&amp;t=2s financial crisis].

===Funding===
CORE funds its projects through grants. Startup funding was provided by the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]]. Current Funders include the [[Nuffield Foundation]], [[HM Treasury]], [http://www.friendsprovidentfoundation.org/ Friends Provident Foundation], [[Bank of England|The Bank of England]], and the [[International Economic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/funders/|title=Funders - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from existing economics teaching==

CORE's authors claim that popular textbooks such as ''Principles of Economics'' by [[Greg Mankiw]] are little different in content to the first modern text book, ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'' by [[Paul Samuelson]], which was published in 1948.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/new-paradigm-introductory-course-economics|title=A new paradigm for the introductory course in economics|last=Bowles|first=Samuel|last2=Carlin|first2=Wendy|date=2017-09-07|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning that these textbooks have ignored many of the innovations in economics since then:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What we teach [students] in our intro classes bears little resemblance to how we do economics ourselves. The great mid-20th century thinkers – [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] – initiated a process that eventually transformed how we now understand the economy, in three ways. Only one of these [Keynes] made it into today's principles course."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;CORE argues that concepts developed in the second half of the 20th century, such as [[asymmetric information]], strategic [[social interactions]] and [[incomplete contracts]] should be given greater prominence in undergraduate teaching. It claims that in most universities these ideas are "mentioned, if at all, at the end of the introductory course, or as special topics."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
''The Economy'' has been received favourably. ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that "[e]arly results are promising":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Economy'' does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful but are skimmed over in most introductory courses.&lt;ref name="CORE Economist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=The teaching of economics gets an overdue overhaul|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729443-students-are-forced-grapple-real-world-very-beginning-their|website=Free Exchange|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In [[The New Yorker]], [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] wrote that "The members of the core team deserve credit for responding to the critics of economics without pandering to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-new-way-to-learn-economics|title=A New Way to Learn Economics|last=Cassidy|first=John|date=2017-09-11|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Times Higher Education Supplement]] called the course "a bold revamp" and wrote that taking CORE in year 1 had improved results in year 2 for students at [[University College London]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The proportion of students gaining a first in the second-year [[microeconomics]] module rose from 22 per cent in 2014-15 to 32 per cent in 2015-16, while the proportion awarded third-class honours fell from 28 per cent to 11 per cent. ... In [[macroeconomics]], the proportion gaining firsts was unchanged, but the number who attained a 2:1 rose from 21 per cent in 2014-15 to 36 per cent in 2015-16."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-thrive-thanks-freakonomics-revamp-economics|title=Students thrive thanks to ‘Freakonomics revamp’ of economics|date=2017-01-05|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of approach===

Some curriculum reform campaigners have criticised CORE for being too narrow and prescriptive, and not acknowledging competing schools of thought. Daniel Lapedus, the [[Rethinking Economics]] welcomed CORE’s "incorporation of a variety of thinkers in their curriculum, as well as their efforts to make economics more real and engaging for economics students ... But real critical [[Pluralism in economics|pluralism]] that reflects the true diversity of real-world perspectives is still a long way off. There is plenty more rethinking yet to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/will-real-rethinkers-please-stand/|title=Will the real rethinkers please stand up? - New thinking for the British economy|website=www.opendemocracy.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Yang, one of the founders of [[Rethinking Economics]], told [[Financial Times|The Financial Times]] that: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Core is not a pluralist curriculum ... It presents one paradigm, while students should be able to choose among different schools of thought.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/fc2eb464-d93d-11e4-b907-00144feab7de|title=Students weigh the value of new economics course|last=Guigliano|first=Ferdinando|date=10 April 2015|work=The Financial Times|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'''''|鳥獣人物戯画||literally "Animal-person Caricatures"}}, commonly shortened to {{Nihongo|'''''Chōjū-giga'''''|鳥獣戯画||literally "Animal Caricatures"}}, is a famous set of four [[Emakimono|picture scroll]]s, or ''emakimono'', belonging to [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. The ''Chōjū-giga'' scrolls are also referred to as '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals''''' and '''''Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans''''' in English. Some think that [[Toba Sōjō]] created the scrolls; however, it seems clear from the style that more than one artist is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The right-to-left reading direction of ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is  traditional in East Asia, and is still common in Japan. ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga '' is also credited as the oldest work of [[manga]]. The scrolls are now entrusted to the [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Tokyo National Museum]].

The scrolls are the earliest in a linear monochrome drawing style that was to continue in use in [[Japanese painting]] (as they are all done with the usual writing and painting brush, they count as painting).&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  

As opened, the first scroll illustrates [[anthropomorphic]] rabbits and monkeys bathing and getting ready for a ceremony, a monkey thief runs from animals with sticks and knocks over a frog from the lively ceremony. Further on, the rabbits and monkeys are playing and wrestling while another group of animals participate in a funeral and frog prays to Buddha as the scroll closes.

The scrolls were also adapted into several novels published by Geijutsuhiroba, the first book simply compiled the scrolls into one publication, now out of print. One of the books participated as part of the company's ''Fine Arts Log'' series as well as some were exclusive to certain exhibitions. Other companies like Misuzu Shobo and Shibundō also published books based on the ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' emakimono.

Although ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' is sometimes credited as the first manga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ivanov| first=Boris| title=Vvedenie v iaponskuiu animatsiiu| publisher=Фонд развития кинематографии; РОФ «Эйзенштейновский центр исследований кинокультуры» |edition=2| location=Moscow| year=2001 |pages=11| isbn=5-901631-01-3|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some disputes with the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper. Seiki Hosokibara pointed to the ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' scrolls as the first manga, and [[Kanta Ishida]] explained that the scrolls should be treated as masterpieces in their own right.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== History ==
The ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' [[emakimono]], belonging to the [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in Kyoto, Japan as an ancient cultural property,&lt;ref name="Kyoto Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/eng/tokubetsu/060422/shoukai/index.htm |title=''Emaki'' Unrolled: Master Works of Illustrated Narrative Handscrolls |publisher=[[Kyoto National Museum]] |accessdate=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.kyoto.jp/visitkyoto/en/theme/sites/shrines/w_heritage/10/ |title=Kozan - ji Temple |publisher=Welcome to Kyoto |accessdate=2009-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are usually thought to have been painted in the mid-[[Heian period|12th century]], whereas the third and fourth scrolls may well date from the [[Kamakura period|13th century]].&lt;ref name="Society Japan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://int.physiology.jp/en/choju-giga/ |title=Choju-Giga |publisher=The Physiological Society of Japan |accessdate=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The work belongs to the decline of the Fujiwara period, but it expresses in one of its best aspects the artistic spirit of their age. The artist is a delightful draughtsman. His pictures of animals disporting [themselves] in the garb of monks are alive with satirical fun. They are a true fruit of the native wit; they owe nothing to China beyond a vague debt to her older artistic tradition; and they bear witness to that reaction against the solemnities of Buddhist art which we have noticed.|[[George Bailey Sansom]]|quoted from ''Japan, A Short Cultural History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=George Bailey |authorlink=George Bailey Sansom |title=Japan, A Short Cultural History  |edition=1st |year=1931 |publisher=C.E.

Most think [[Toba Sōjō]] created ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'', who created a painting a lot like ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'';&lt;ref name="Society Japan" /&gt; however, it is hard to verify this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Encyclopedia Nipponica]] | publisher=[[Shogakukan]] | location=Tokyo-to, Chiyoda-ku | isbn=4-09-526022-X |oclc=47377011 | pages=??? }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shinmura | first=Izura | title=[[Kōjien]] | publisher=[[Iwanami Shoten Publishing]] | location=Tokyo-to, Chiyoda-ku | isbn=4-00-080111-2 | oclc=40787153 | pages=??? }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Matsumura | first=Akira | title=[[Daijirin]] | publisher=Sanseidō Shoten | location=Tokyo | isbn=4-385-14001-4 | oclc=19685451 | pages=??? }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings of ''Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga'' are making fun of Japanese priests in the creator's time period, characterising them as toads, rabbits and monkeys.

== Emakimono ==

Nearby, a celebration has started with two frogs dancing, and a group of animals having a conversation. Not too far from the celebration are animals wrestling and fighting and two monkeys holding a box. Far from the celebration are a group of animals at a funeral and a frog praying in front of a frog shaped [[Budai]] as the scroll closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kokingumi.com/ChojuGiga/ChojuGigaScroll_left-half.html |title=The Choju Giga by Masakazu Yoshizawa |publisher=[[Kokin Gumi]] |accessdate=2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputes ==
The ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' newspaper with Kanta Ishida discussed different theories of what really is the "first manga". [[Mangaka|Manga artist]], Seiki Hosokibara pointed to ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' as the first manga in history. Ishida said that the scrolls be treated as masterpieces in their own right, and not be cubby-holed as just the origin of manga and they have no connection with contemporary manga and the domestic works we are familiar with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Yomiuri'' Newspaper Discusses History's First Manga |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-01-03 |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-01-03/yomiuri-first-manga |accessdate=2009-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Webcomic xkcd - Wikipedian protester.png|thumb|right|250px|[[xkcd]] webcomic titled "Wikipedian Protester"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://xkcd.com/285/ |title= Wikipedian Protestor|author= Randall Munroe |accessdate= 20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

== Styles ==

{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science. A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1123–1127 |publisher= |location= |year=2006 |url= |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl189 |id= |pmid=16987841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J.

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fister Jr. | first1 = I. | last2 = Fister | first2 = I. | last3 = Perc | first3 = M.| doi = 10.3389/fphy.2016.00049 | title = Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels in Citation Networks | journal = Frontiers in Physics | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classicism}}
'''Classicism''', in the [[The Arts|arts]], refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, [[classical antiquity]] in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained: of the ''[[Discobolus]]'' [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] observed, "if we object to his restraint and compression we are simply objecting to the classicism of [[classic]] art. A violent emphasis or a sudden acceleration of rhythmic movement would have destroyed those qualities of balance and completeness through which it retained until the present century its position of authority in the restricted repertoire of visual images."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:242&lt;/ref&gt; Classicism, as Clark noted, implies a canon of widely accepted ideal forms, whether in the [[Western canon]] that he was examining in ''The Nude'' (1956), or the literary [[Chinese classics]] or [[Chinese art]], where the revival of classic styles is also a recurring feature.

Classicism is a force which is often present in post-medieval European and European influenced traditions; however, some periods felt themselves more connected to the classical ideals than others, particularly the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Kerry|date=September 2011|title=JOURNAL ARTICLE Review|jstor=41240671|journal=Church History|volume=80|pages=691–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Neoclassicism]] was an important movement in the visual arts.

Classicism is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on [[society]]. It was particularly expressed in the [[Neoclassicism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=James William|date=1969|title=What Was Neo-Classicism?|jstor=175167|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=9|pages=49–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Classicism is a recurrent tendency in the [[Late Antique]] period, and had a major revival in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]]. There was another, more durable revival in the [[Italian renaissance]] when the fall of [[Byzantium]] and rising trade with the Islamic cultures brought a flood of knowledge about, and from, the antiquity of [[Europe]]. Until that time, the identification with antiquity had been seen as a continuous history of [[Christendom]] from the conversion of Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]]. [[Renaissance]] classicism introduced a host of elements into European culture, including the application of mathematics and [[empiricism]] into art, [[humanism]], literary and depictive [[realism (arts)|realism]], and [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]]. Importantly it also introduced [[Polytheism]], or "[[paganism]]", and the juxtaposition of ancient and modern.

The classicism of the Renaissance led to, and gave way to, a different sense of what was "classical" in the 16th and 17th centuries. In this period, classicism took on more overtly structural overtones of orderliness, predictability, the use of geometry and grids, the importance of rigorous discipline and pedagogy, as well as the formation of schools of art and music. The court of Louis XIV was seen as the center of this form of classicism, with its references to the gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] as a symbolic prop for absolutism, its adherence to axiomatic and deductive reasoning, and its love of order and predictability.

This period sought the revival of classical art forms, including Greek drama and music. [[Opera]], in its modern European form, had its roots in attempts to recreate the combination of singing and dancing with theatre thought to be the Greek norm. Examples of this appeal to classicism included [[Dante]], Petrarch, and Shakespeare in [[poetry]] and [[theatre]]. Tudor drama, in particular, modeled itself after classical ideals and divided works into [[Tragedy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakogianni|first=Anastasia|date=2012|title=Theatre of the Condemned. Classical Tragedy on Greek Prison Islands by [[Gonda Van Steen|G. VAN STEEN]]|jstor=41722362|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=132|pages=294–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comedy]]. Studying [[Ancient Greek]] became regarded as essential for a well-rounded education in the [[liberal arts]].

The Renaissance also explicitly returned to architectural models and techniques associated with Greek and Roman antiquity, including the [[golden rectangle]] as a key proportion for buildings, the classical orders of [[columns]], as well as a host of ornament and detail associated with Greek and Roman architecture. They also began reviving plastic arts such as [[bronze casting]] for sculpture, and used the classical naturalism as the foundation of [[drawing]], [[painting]] and sculpture.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] identified itself with a vision of antiquity which, while continuous with the classicism of the previous century, was shaken by the [[physics]] of Sir [[Isaac Newton]], the improvements in machinery and measurement, and a sense of liberation which they saw as being present in the Greek civilization, particularly in its struggles against the Persian Empire. The ornate, organic, and complexly integrated forms of the [[baroque]] were to give way to a series of movements that regarded themselves expressly as "classical" or "[[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]]", or would rapidly be labelled as such. For example, the painting of [[Jacques-Louis David]] was seen as an attempt to return to formal balance, clarity, manliness, and vigor in art.

The 19th century saw the classical age as being the precursor of academicism, including such movements as [[uniformitarianism]] in the sciences, and the creation of rigorous categories in artistic fields. Various movements of the romantic period saw themselves as classical revolts against a prevailing trend of emotionalism and irregularity, for example the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1943|title=JOURNAL ARTICLE The Pre-Raphaelites|jstor=4301128|journal=Bulletin of the Fogg Art Museum|volume=10|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, classicism was old enough that previous classical movements received revivals; for example, the Renaissance was seen as a means to combine the organic medieval with the orderly classical. The 19th century continued or extended many classical programs in the sciences, most notably the Newtonian program to account for the movement of energy between bodies by means of exchange of mechanical and thermal energy.

The 20th century saw a number of changes in the arts and sciences. Classicism was used both by those who rejected, or saw as temporary, transfigurations in the political, scientific, and social world and by those who embraced the changes as a means to overthrow the perceived weight of the 19th century. Thus, both pre-20th century disciplines were labelled "classical" and modern movements in art which saw themselves as aligned with light, space, sparseness of texture, and formal coherence.

In the present day [[philosophy]] classicism is used as a term particularly in relation to [[Apollonian]] over [[Dionysian]] impulses in society and art; that is a preference for rationality, or at least rationally guided catharsis, over [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]].

==In the theatre==
[[File:Molière - Nicolas Mignard (1658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Molière]] in classical dress, by [[Nicolas Mignard]], 1658.]]
'''Classicism''' in the [[theatre]] was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theatre]], including the "[[Classical unities]]" of time, place and action, found in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' of [[Aristotle]].

* Unity of time referred to the need for the entire action of the play to take place in a fictional 24-hour period
* Unity of place meant that the action should unfold in a single location
* Unity of action meant that the play should be constructed around a single 'plot-line', such as a tragic love affair or a conflict between [[honour]] and [[duty]].

Examples of classicist playwrights are [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Molière]].  In the period of [[Romanticism]], [[Shakespeare]], who conformed to none of the classical rules, became the focus of French argument over them, in which the Romantics eventually triumphed; [[Victor Hugo]] was among the first French playwrights to break these conventions.

The influence of these French rules on playwrights in other nations is debatable.  In the English theatre, Restoration playwrights such as [[William Wycherly]] and [[William Congreve]] would have been familiar with them.  [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries did not follow this Classicist philosophy, in particular since they were not French and also because they wrote several decades prior to their establishment.  Those of Shakespeare's plays that seem to display the unities, such as ''[[The Tempest]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Robert B.|date=Spring 1999|title=Understanding "The Tempest"|jstor=20057542|journal=New Literary History|volume=30|pages=373–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably indicate a familiarity with actual models from [[classical antiquity]].

==In architecture==
{{Main|Classical architecture|Outline of classical architecture}}
[[File:Villa Rotonda front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villa Rotonda]], [[Palladio]], 1591]]
Classicism in architecture developed during the [[Italian Renaissance]], notably in the writings and designs of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. It places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the  architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of [[Roman Architecture|Ancient Rome]], of which many examples remained.

Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[lintel]]s, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s and [[aedicule]]s replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and then to France, Germany, England, Russia and elsewhere.

In the 16th century, [[Sebastiano Serlio]] helped codify the [[classical order]]s and [[Palladio]]'s legacy evolved into the long tradition of [[Palladian architecture]]. Building off of these influences, the 17th-century architects [[Inigo Jones]] and [[Christopher Wren]] firmly established classicism in England.

For the development of classicism from the mid-18th-century onwards, see [[Neoclassical architecture]].

==In the fine arts==
* ''For Greek art of the 5th century B.C.E., see [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|Classical art in ancient Greece]] and the [[Severe style]]''

[[Italian Renaissance painting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Michael|date=March 1978|title=Italian Renaissance Painting by John Hale|jstor=41372753|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|volume=126|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sculpture]] are marked by their renewal of classical forms, motifs and subjects. In the 15th century [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was important in theorizing many of the ideas for painting that came to a fully realised product with [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' during the [[High Renaissance]]. The themes continued largely unbroken into the 17th century, when artists such as [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Charles Le Brun]] represented of the more rigid classicism. Like Italian classicizing ideas in the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread through Europe in the mid to late 17th century.

Later classicism in painting and sculpture from the mid-18th and 19th centuries is generally referred to as [[Neoclassicism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Algorithmic topology''', or '''computational topology''', is a subfield of [[topology]] with an overlap with areas of [[computer science]], in particular, [[computational geometry]] and [[computational complexity theory]].

A primary concern of algorithmic topology, as its name suggests, is to develop efficient [[algorithm]]s for solving problems that arise naturally in fields such as [[computational geometry]], [[graphics]], [[robotics]], [[structural biology]] and [[chemistry]], using methods from [[computable topology]].&lt;ref&gt;Afra J. Zomorodian, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oKEGGMgnWKcC Topology for Computing], Cambridge, 2005, xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major algorithms by subject area==

===Algorithmic 3-manifold theory===

A large family of algorithms concerning [[3-manifold]]s revolve around [[normal surface]] theory, which is a phrase that encompasses several techniques to turn problems in 3-manifold theory into integer linear programming problems.

* ''Rubinstein and Thompson's 3-sphere recognition algorithm''.  This is an algorithm that takes as input a [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulated]] [[3-manifold]] and determines whether or not the manifold is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]].  It has exponential run-time in the number of tetrahedral simplexes in the initial 3-manifold, and also an exponential memory profile. Moreover, it is implemented in the software package [[Regina (program)|Regina]].&lt;ref&gt;B.~Burton. Introducing Regina, the 3-manifold topology software,    Experimental Mathematics 13 (2004), 267–272.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul Schleimer went on to show the problem lies in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgar/Maths/np.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, Raphael Zentner showed that the problem lies in the complexity class coNP&lt;ref&gt;R. Zentner. Integer homology 3-spheres admit irreducible representations in SL(2,C), https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08530&lt;/ref&gt;, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds. He uses instanton gauge theory, the geometrization theorem of 3-manifolds, and subsequent work of Greg Kuperberg &lt;ref&gt;G. Kuperberg. Knottedness is in NP, modulo GRH. Adv. Math., 256:493–506, (2014), https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0845&lt;/ref&gt; on the complexity of knottedness detection.
* The [[connected sum|connect-sum]] decomposition of 3-manifolds is also implemented in [[Regina (program)|Regina]], has exponential run-time and is based on a similar algorithm to the 3-sphere recognition algorithm.
* Determining that the Seifert-Weber 3-manifold contains no incompressible surface has been algorithmically implemented by Burton, Rubinstein and Tillmann &lt;ref&gt;B. A. Burton, J. H. Rubinstein and S. Tillmann, The Weber–Seifert dodecahedral space is non-Haken, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 364 (2012), 911–932, https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4625&lt;/ref&gt; and based on normal surface theory.
* The ''Manning algorithm'' is an algorithm to find hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds whose [[fundamental group]] have a solution to the [[Word problem for groups|word problem]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Manning, Algorithmic detection and description of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds with solvable word problem, Geometry and Topology 6 (2002) 1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the [[JSJ decomposition]] has not been implemented algorithmically in computer software.  Neither has the compression-body decomposition.  There are some very popular and successful heuristics, such as [[SnapPea]] which has much success computing approximate hyperbolic structures on triangulated 3-manifolds.  It is known that the full classification of 3-manifolds can be done algorithmically.&lt;ref&gt;S.Matveev, Algorithmic topology and the classification of 3-manifolds, Springer-Verlag 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conversion algorithms ====

* [[SnapPea]] implements an algorithm to convert a planar [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] or [[Knot (mathematics)#knot diagram|link diagram]] into a cusped triangulation.  This algorithm has a roughly linear run-time in the number of crossings in the diagram, and low memory profile.  The algorithm is similar to the Wirthinger algorithm for constructing presentations of the [[fundamental group]] of link complements given by planar diagrams. Similarly, SnapPea can convert [[surgery theory|surgery]] presentations of 3-manifolds into triangulations of the presented 3-manifold.
* D.Thurston and F.Costantino have a procedure to construct a triangulated 4-manifold from a triangulated 3-manifold.  Similarly, it can be used to construct surgery presentations of triangulated 3-manifolds, although the procedure is not explicitly written as an algorithm in principle it should have polynomial run-time in the number of tetrahedra of the given 3-manifold triangulation.&lt;ref&gt;F.

===Computational homology===

Computation of [[homology group]]s of [[CW complex|cell complexes]] reduces to bringing the boundary matrices into [[Smith normal form]]. Although this is a completely solved problem algorithmically, there are various technical obstacles to efficient computation for large complexes. There are two central obstacles. Firstly, the basic Smith form algorithm has cubic complexity in the size of the matrix involved since it uses row and column operations which makes it unsuitable for large cell complexes. Secondly, the intermediate matrices which result from the application of the Smith form algorithm get filled-in even if one starts and ends with sparse matrices.

A '''genetic predisposition''' is a [[genetics|genetic]] characteristic which influences the possible [[phenotypic]] development of an individual organism within a species or population under the influence of [[natural environment|environmental]] conditions. In medicine, '''[[genetic susceptibility]]''' to a [[disease]] refers to a genetic predisposition to a health problem,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/predisposition What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?], US Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt; which may eventually be triggered by particular environmental or lifestyle factors, such as [[tobacco smoking]] or [[Dieting|diet]].  [[Genetic test]]ing is able to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases.

==Behavior==

[[Instinct|Predisposition]] is the capacity we are born with to learn things such as language and concept of self.  Negative environmental influences may block the predisposition (ability) we have to do some things.  [[ethology|Behaviors]] displayed by animals can be influenced by genetic predispositions. Genetic predisposition towards certain human behaviors is [[Ethology|scientifically investigated]] by attempts to identify patterns of human behavior that seem to be invariant over long periods of time and in very different cultures.

For example, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has proposed that humans are genetically predisposed to have a [[theory of mind]] because there has been [[evolution]]ary selection for the human ability to adopt the [[intentional stance]].{{Ref|stance}} The ''intentional stance'' is a useful behavioral strategy by which humans assume that others have [[mind]]s like their own. This assumption allows you to predict the behavior of others based on personal knowledge of what you would do.

In 1951, [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Donald Prell]] published an experiment in which [[twins|identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins]], ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism.  It is described in detail in an article published in the ''[[Journal of Mental Science]]''. in which Eysenck and Prell concluded that, "The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic Genetic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Mental Health'', July 1951, Vol. XCVII, "The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Osborne Wilson|E. O. Wilson's]] [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis|book on sociobiology]] and his book [[Consilience (book)|Consilience]] discuss the idea of genetic predisposition to behaviors

The field of [[evolutionary psychology]] explores the idea that certain behaviors have been selected for during the course of evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6414">The '''Gibsonian ecological theory of development''' is a theory of development that was created by American psychologist [[Eleanor J. Gibson]] during the 1960s and 1970s. Gibson emphasized the importance of environment and context in learning and, together with husband and fellow psychologist [[James J. Gibson]], argued that perception was crucial as it allowed humans to adapt to their environments. Gibson stated that "children learn to detect information that specifies objects, events, and layouts in the world that they can use for their daily activities".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P. (2002). Theories of Developmental Psychology (4th ed.). New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, humans learn out of necessity. Children are information "hunter-gatherers",&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; gathering information in order to survive and navigate in the world.

==Key concepts==
Gibson asserted that development was driven by a complex interaction between environmental [[affordance]]s and the motivated humans who perceive them. For example, to an infant, different surfaces "afford" opportunities for walking, crawling, grasping, etc. As children gain motor skills, they discover new opportunities for movement and thus new affordances.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The more chances they are given to perceive and interact with their environment, the more affordances they discover, and the more accurate their perceptions become.

Gibson identified four important aspects of human behavior that develop:&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, E. J. &amp; Pick, A. D. (2000). An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Agency''' - Self-control, intentionality in behavior
**Agency is learning to control both one's own activity and external events
**Babies learn at an early age that their actions have an effect on the environment
**For example: Babies were observed kicking their legs at a mobile hanging above them. They had discovered their kicking made the mobile move.
*'''Prospectivity''' - Intentional, anticipatory, planful, future-oriented behaviors
**For example: A baby will reach out to try and catch an object moving toward them because the baby can anticipate that the object will continue to move close enough to catch. In other words, the baby perceives that reaching out his/her hand will afford him/her to catch the object.
*'''Search for Order''' - Tendency to see order, regularity, and pattern to make sense of the world
**For example: Before 9 months, infants begin to recognize the strong-weak stress patterns in their native language
*'''Flexibility''' - Perception can adjust to new situations and bodily conditions (such as growth, improved motor skills, or a sprained ankle)
**Examples: Three-month-old infants lying under a mobile had a string attached to their right leg and then to the mobile so that when they moved their leg the mobile would move. When the string was switched to the left legs, the infants would easily shift to moving that leg to activate the mobile.
**Perception is an ongoing, active process.

==Methodology==
Gibson used experimental procedures while also attempting to retain ecological validity by simulating important features of the child's natural environment. In keeping with the idea of affordances, Gibson tried to provide multimodal stimulation for infants in these experiments (multiple kinds of objects, faces, or surfaces, for example) and ways of obtaining feedback through movement and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Gibson's well-known perceptual experiments involved the construction of a "[[visual cliff]]," simulating a real cliff. Gibson and Walk&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, E.J.; Walk, R.D. (April 1960). "Visual Cliff". Scientific American.&lt;/ref&gt; placed infants near the cliff and placed mothers on the other side of the cliff. They found that infants perceived depth and were unwilling to crawl over the cliff at approximately 6–7 months. Later experiments showed that 12-month-old infants had learned to use their mothers' facial expressions as signals of potential affordances. If mothers smiled, infants were more likely to crawl over the "dangerous" cliff, but if mothers made a frightened face, infants avoided the cliff.&lt;ref&gt;Sorce, J. F., Emde, R. N., Campos, J., &amp; Klinnert, M. D. (1985). Maternal emotional signalling: Its effect on the visual cliff behavior of 1-year-olds. Developmental Psychology, 21, 195-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Gibson's theory has been criticized for its "unclear account of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;p. 363, Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's theory pertains to direct perception and does not take into account that behaviors may involve indirect, interpretive cognition. Gibson's methodology involves an expensive and complicated experimental set up, which may prove cost- and time-prohibitive for many researchers. Finally, Gibson's research was almost exclusively confined to infants and very young children, so it is difficult to make generalizations throughout the lifespan.

==Current State of Gibsonian Theory==
Aside from her own writings, Gibson's work is rarely described as a theory of development. When Gibson's primary area of research, affordances, is referenced, the citations typically refer only to James Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, C. F. (2003). Affordances: Four points of debate. Ecological Psychology, 15, 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson is credited with popularizing affordances in perceptual research. However, unlike Gibson, researchers have studied affordances in all age groups, including adults. Affordances have been applied to a range of innovative topics, from automobile driving&lt;ref&gt;Schwebel, D. C., &amp; Yocom, J. S. (2007). How personality and reward relate to automobile drivers' judgments of affordances using their own vehicles. Ecological Psychology, 19, 49-68.&lt;/ref&gt; to text messaging.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, F. J. M., &amp; Reid, D. J. (2010). The expressive and conversational affordances of mobile messaging. Behaviour and Information Technology, 29, 3-22.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of affordances is usually used in isolation rather than being integrated into Gibson's ecological framework. Some researchers are even attempting to create their own theories of affordances instead of revising Gibson's theory to accommodate new findings.&lt;ref&gt;Chemero, A. (2003). An outline of a theory of affordances. Ecological Psychology, 15, 181-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GLITS''' is an acronym for '''Graham's Line Identification Tone System''', a test signal for stereo systems devised by [[BBC TV]] Sound Supervisor and Fellow of the [https://ips.org.uk/?post_type=fellow&amp;p=5887 IPS] Graham Haines in the mid 1980s. It comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]]  tone at 0&amp;nbsp;[[dBu]] (-&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;[[dBFS]]) on both channels, with interruptions which identify the channels.

{| style="margin:auto;"
|-
|||valign="top"|The left channel is interrupted once for 250&amp;nbsp;ms every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds. 250&amp;nbsp;ms later the right channel has two interruptions of 250&amp;nbsp;ms spaced by 250&amp;nbsp;ms.
|}



This arrangement has an advantage over the EBU stereo ident tone in that each channel is explicitly identified as belonging to a stereo pair. The EBU Technical Document [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3304.pdf Multichannel Audio Line-up Tone] (Tech 3304) defines stereo lineup tone as having an interruption in the left channel only, lasting 250&amp;nbsp;ms every 3&amp;nbsp;s.

== Multichannel GLITS ==
There is now an official EBU standard for a multichannel BLITS 5.1 channel ident tone which is also described in the Tech 3304 paper, along with an alternative film-style multichannel ident tone system for systems larger than 5.1 arrays.

[[Black &amp; Lane's Ident Tones for Surround|Blits]] plays a sequence of tones (based on the musical notes A and E) at -18dBFS on each channel in the AES channel format order (L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs), followed by an EBU-style ident on just the front left and right channels, again at -18dBFS and with four interruptions on the left channel. The four interruptions provides a unique confirmation that the stereo or mono downmix came from a 5.1 source and avoids any possible confusion with stereo EBU or GLITS downmixes. The final BLITS tone sequence is a 2&amp;nbsp;kHz tone at -24dBFS on all six channels – the lower source signal level ensuring that any derived downmixes remain close to -18dBFS.

The alternative EBU multichannel ident tone follows a format more closely associated with the film industry. A sustained 80Hz runs on the LFE channel throughout the sequence. After a 3&amp;nbsp;second period of constant 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, -18dBFS tone on all main channels, each channel is identified in turn with a 0.5s pulse of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone, separated from its neighbours by 0.5s silence. The ident sequence starts at Front Left and continues clockwise through each available channel. The amount of time between the 3&amp;nbsp;second constant tone periods indicates the total number of channels in the system - e.g. a 7.1 system will have an ident sequence lasting 8&amp;nbsp;seconds.

Snell &amp; Wilcox have used the following on the embedded audio in their VALID8 (Video Audio Line-up &amp; IDentification) equipment:
* Ch1 (L) 980Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch2 (R) 980Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch3 (C) 432Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch4 (Lfe) 432Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds (probably not audible from a subwoofer)
* Ch5 (Ls) 990Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch6 (Rs) 990Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch7 (Lo) 436Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch8 (Ro) 436Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds

'''Hazard substitution''' is a hazard control strategy in which a material or process is replaced with another that is less hazardous.

Hazard substitutions can involve not only changing one chemical for another, but also using the same chemical in a less hazardous form.  Substitutions can also be made to processes and equipment.  In making a substitution, the hazards of the new material should be considered and monitored, so that a new hazard is not unwittingly introduced,&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt; causing "regrettable substitutions".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i50/Assessing-Alternatives-Toxic-Chemicals.html|title=Assessing Alternatives To Toxic Chemicals|last=Hogue|first=Cheryl|date=|website=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Substitution can also fail as a strategy if the hazardous process or material is reintroduced at a later stage in the design or production phases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if cost or quality concerns cause a substitution to not be adopted.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://simplifiedsafety.com/blog/the-hierarchy-of-controls-part-one-elimination-and-substitution/|title=The Hierarchy of Controls, Part One: Elimination and Substitution|last=Braun|first=John|date=|website=Simplified Safety Fall Protection Blog|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Chemicals ===
{{Main article|Substitution of dangerous chemicals}}A common substitution is to replace a toxic chemical with a less toxic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/substitution.html|title=Substitution of Chemicals: Considerations for Selection|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples include replacing the [[solvent]] [[benzene]], a [[carcinogen]], with [[toluene]]; switching from organic solvents to [[Aqueous solution|water-based]] [[detergent]]s; and replacing paints containing [[lead]] with those containing non-leaded pigments.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;  [[Dry cleaning]] can avoid the use of toxic [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] by using [[petroleum]]-based solvents, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]], or [[wet cleaning]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/hazardcontrol/hc17.html|title=Control of Exposure to Perchloroethylene in Commercial Drycleaning (Substitution)|last=|first=|date=1997|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical substitutions are an example of [[green chemistry]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Chemicals can also be substituted with a different form of the same chemical.  In general, inhalation exposure to [[dustiness|dusty]] powders can be reduced by using a [[slurry]] or [[Colloid|suspension]] of particles in a liquid solvent instead of a dry powder,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or substituting larger particles such as [[Pelletizing|pellets]] or [[ingot]]s.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;  Some chemicals, such as [[nanomaterials]], often cannot be eliminated or substituted with conventional materials because their unique properties are necessary to the desired product or process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/default.html|title=Current Strategies for Engineering Controls in Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=9–20, 28|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it may be possible to choose properties of the nanoparticle such as [[Particle size|size]], [[Nanoparticle#Morphology|shape]], [[Surface functionalisation|functionalization]], [[surface charge]], [[solubility]], [[Flocculation|agglomeration]], and [[Particle aggregation|aggregation state]] to improve their toxicological properties while retaining the desired functionality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-102/|title=Building a Safety Program to Protect the Nanotechnology Workforce: A Guide for Small to Medium-Sized Enterprises|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=6–14|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the U.S. [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies]] released a recommended decision-making framework for chemical substitutions.  The framework maintained health-related metrics used by previous frameworks, including [[carcinogen]]icity, [[mutagen]]icity, [[Reproductive toxicity|reproductive]] and [[developmental toxicity]], [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]], [[Acute toxicity|acute]] and [[chronic toxicity]], [[Dermatoxin|dermal]] and [[Eye injury|eye irritation]], and dermal and respiratory [[Sensitization (immunology)|sensitization]], and [[ecotoxicity]].  It added an emphasis on [[Exposure assessment|assessing actual exposure]] rather than only the inherent hazards of the chemical itself, decision rules for resolving trade-offs among hazards, and consideration of novel data sources on hazards such as [[In silico|simulations]].  The assessment framework has 13 steps, many of which are unique, such as dedicated steps for scoping and problem formulation, assessing [[physicochemical]] properties, broader [[life-cycle assessment]], and research and innovation.  The framework also provides guidance on tools and sources for scientific information.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Processes and equipment ===
[[File:Nanomaterials_aerosol.png|alt=A microscope image of a ball made of agglomerated stringlike particles|thumb|An [[aerosol]] droplet containing nanomaterials ejected from a vial during [[sonication]].  Eliminating or limiting sonication and other handling processes reduces inhalation hazards.]]
Hazards to workers can be reduced by limiting or replacing procedures that may [[Aerosolization|aerosolize]] toxic materials contained in the item.  Examples include limiting agitation procedures such as [[sonication]], or by using a lower-temperature process in [[chemical reactor]]s to minimize release of materials in exhaust.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=10–28|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Substituting a water-jet cutting process instead of mechanical sawing of a solid item also creates less dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipment can also be substituted, for example using a self-retracting lifeline instead of a fixed rope for [[fall protection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://progressivesafety.us/uncategorized/hierarchy-of-controls-prioritizes-action-on-workplace-hazards/|title=Hierarchy of Controls Prioritizes Action on Workplace Hazards|last=Mlynek|first=Joe|date=|work=Progressive Safety Services|access-date=2017-03-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or packaging materials in smaller containers to prevent lifting injuries.&lt;ref name="saunions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunions.org.au/ohs/hierachy_of_controls.htm|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=[[SA Unions]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Health effects from noise]] can be controlled by purchasing or renting less noisy equipment.  This topic has been the subject of several [[Buy Quiet]] campaigns, and the [[NIOSH Power Tools Database]] contains data on sound power, pressure, and vibration levels of many power tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol|title=Engineering Noise Control|last=|first=|date=2016-12-02|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet|title=Buy Quiet|last=|first=|date=2016-12-13|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regrettable substitutions ==
[[File:VFA Synthesis 01.png|thumb|left|300px|The synthesis of [[N-vinyl formamide|''N''-vinyl formamide]] requires use of the highly toxic [[hydrogen cyanide]] (H-CN).  Even though the end product is a less-toxic alternative to [[acrylamide]] for end users, the hazards to workers manufacturing the material should also be considered in an [[alternatives assessment]].|alt=A three-reaction chemical synthesis scheme leading to N-vinyl formamide]]

A regrettable substitution occurs when a material or process believed to be less hazardous turns out to have an unexpected hazard.  One well-known example occurred when [[dichloromethane]] was phased out as a [[brake]] cleaner due to its environmental effects, but its replacement [[N-Hexane|''n''-hexane]] was subsequently found to be [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Often the substances being replaced have well-studied hazards, but the alternatives may have little or no toxicity data, making alternatives assessments difficult.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another type of regrettable substitution involves shifting the burden of a hazard to another party.  One example is that the potent neurotoxin [[acrylamide]] can be replaced with the safer [[N-vinyl formamide|''N''-vinyl formamide]], but the synthesis of the latter requires use of the highly toxic [[hydrogen cyanide]], increasing the hazards to workers in the manufacturing firm.  In performing an [[alternatives assessment]], including the effects over the entire [[product lifecycle]] as part of a [[life-cycle assessment]] can mitigate this.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18872/a-framework-to-guide-selection-of-chemical-alternatives|title=A Framework to Guide Selection of Chemical Alternatives|last=|first=|date=2014-10-10|publisher=U.S. [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]]|year=|isbn=9780309310130|location=|pages=1&amp;ndash;4, 10, 140|language=en|doi=10.17226/18872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.&lt;ref name="hacc1" /&gt;  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].&lt;ref name="hacc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of "arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial" (Burton, 1884),&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+swords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20swords&amp;f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently as "the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity" (Draeger, 1982).&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"&gt;International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as "the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours."&lt;ref&gt;Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Hoplology Society==
Founded by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) (1922-1982), the International Hoplology Society ("IHS") exists to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, carries on the hoplological tradition as director of IHS. He is a leading authority on combative behavior and performance. He has trained in numerous Asian and Western martial arts from a young age. He has spent a lifetime studying hoplology and related areas, including functional conditioning for combat. He currently trains military and law enforcement around the world in these areas. He works closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP).

In recent years, with the advent of the [[Modern Army Combatives]] (MAC) Program in the [[US Army]] and the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP), there has been a rapid growth in both scientific and academic research. With [[Matt Larsen]], the father of the MAC program, as a catalyst, research departments are growing at universities across the United States. One of the first such programs was at [[Kansas State University]]; the program is currently defunct.&lt;ref&gt;The Collegian - [http://www.kstatecollegian.com/news/modern-combatives-program-cancelled-due-to-budget-concerns-1.2165227 Modern combatives program cancelled due to budget concerns] published by The Collegian Feb 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accouterments and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"/&gt;

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.&lt;ref name="Meron Langsner"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI7uLa-eaKxwIVSNEUCh0JCAfT#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false|author=Meron Langsner|title=Text &amp; Presentation, 2006|publisher=McFarland, 5 Feb 2007, 260 pages, (edited by Stratos E. Constantinidi), {{ISBN|0786455411}}, ''Volume 3 of The Comparative Drama Conference Series''|accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side "…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy." (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

An '''ideogram''' or '''ideograph''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἰδέα}} ''idéa'' "idea" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''gráphō'' "to write") is a [[graphic]] [[symbol]] that represents an [[idea]] or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as [[pictogram]]s.

==Terminology==
{{further|Character (symbol)|Logogram}}
[[Image:Perros No.svg|thumb|"No dogs allowed" sign in Spain. The dog illustration is a [[pictogram]]. The red circle and bar is an ideogram representing the idea of "no" or "not allowed".]]
[[Image:EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg|thumb|Ideograms in the [[Church of the Visitation]], Jerusalem]]
In [[proto-writing]], used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or [[pictogram]]s. For example, the pictorial [[Dongba symbols]] without [[Geba syllabary|Geba]] annotation cannot represent the [[Naxi language]], but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramsey | first = S. Robert | title = The Languages of China
|publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5| page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.

The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of [[writing system]]s such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and [[Chinese character]]s.  However, these symbols are [[logogram]]s, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols.
Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word ''ʾālep'' "ox".
Some words denoting abstract concepts may be represented iconically, but most other words are represented using the [[rebus]] principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for ''ʾālep'' "ox" as the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] [[aleph]] representing the initial sound of the word, a [[glottal stop]].

Many signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] as well as in [[cuneiform writing]] could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign [[dingir|AN]] ({{script|Xsux|[[Dingir|&amp;#x1202D;]]}}) could be an ideograph for "[[deity]]", an ideogram for the god [[An (mythology)|Anum]] in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem ''[[ilah|il-]]'' "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ''šamu'' "sky", or a [[syllabogram]] for either the syllable ''an'' or ''il''.

Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the [[Chinese character classification|traditional classification]] are ideographic in origin:
* Simple ideographs (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as 上 ''shàng'' "up" and 下 ''xià'' "down" or numerals such as 三 ''sān'' "three".
* Semantic compounds (会意字 ''huìyìzì'') are semantic combinations of characters, such as 明 ''míng'' "bright", composed of 日 ''rì'' "sun" and 月 ''yuè'' "moon", or 休 ''xiū'' "rest", composed of 人 ''rén'' "person" and 木 ''mù'' "tree".  In the light of the modern understanding of [[Old Chinese phonology]], researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Boltz | title = The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system | publisher = American Oriental Society | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-940490-78-9 | pp = 67–72, 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ideograms is the [[DOT pictograms|collection of 50 signs]] developed in the 1970s by the  [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] at the request of the [[US Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs Symbols and signs], AIGA.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially used to mark airports and gradually became more widespread.

==Mathematics==

Mathematical symbols are a type of ideogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics as Sign: Writing, Imagining, Counting |first=Brian |last=Rotman |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-3684-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed universal languages==

Inspired by inaccurate early descriptions of Chinese and Japanese characters as ideograms, many Western thinkers have sought to design universal written languages, in which symbols denote concepts rather than words. An early proposal was ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668) by [[John Wilkins]]. A recent example is the system of [[Blissymbols]], which was proposed by [[Charles K. Bliss]] in 1949 and currently includes over 2,000 symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (2003), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Immune reactions are tightly regulated and usually self-limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Janeway’s Immunobiology textbook|last=Murphy and Weaver|first=Kenneth and Casey|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8153-4551-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathan|first=Carl|title=Points of control in inflammation|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature01320|journal=Nature|volume=420|issue=6917|pages=846–852|doi=10.1038/nature01320|bibcode=2002Natur.420..846N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysregulation can result in chronic inflammatory diseases (immunochronicity).

'''Izidor (Iso) Kršnjavi''' ({{IPA-sh|krʃɲǎːʋi ǐzidor|hr}}, 22 April 1845 – 3 February 1927) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] painter, art historian, curator and politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Našice]], his first art lessons were obtained in [[Osijek]], where he studied with [[Hugo Conrad von Hötzendorf]].&lt;ref name="GLN"&gt;[http://www.galerija-lavalnugent.com/krsnjavi-izidor-1845-1924 Galerija Laval Nugent: Izidor Kršnjavi]&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to Vienna to study philosophy and [[art history]]. At this time, he was already providing aesthetic and philosophical articles to Croatian journals. He later studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]] and lived in Italy from 1872–77, where he copied the old masters.

With the help of [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]], who he had met in Rome, he became a professor of archaeology and art history at the [[University of Zagreb]]. The next year, he helped establish the Society of Arts, and was, for many years, it secretary and spokesman. He also served as the first Director of the [[Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]] and was one of the founders of the [[Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb|Museum of Arts and Crafts]].&lt;ref name="GLN" /&gt;

In 1884, he came into conflict with Strossmayer and his supporters in the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Croatia)|People's Party]], where he supported the pro-Hungarian faction, which allowed him to serve in the Croatian Parliament 1884-87. From 1887 to 1891, he studied law and became the Minister of Education and Religion in the [[Károly Khuen-Héderváry]] administration. While in that office, he established several schools, including one for the blind and deaf, introduced [[physical education]] classes and helped to form the foundation for a unified school system. He had to leave the ministry in 1897, after a protest in which he burned a Hungarian flag. He returned to the University and, in 1906, joined the [[Party of Rights]]. Shortly thereafter, he began painting again.

In addition to being a painter and critic, he also translated [[Dante's Divine Comedy]] into Croatian and was the author of poems, travelogues and two novels. He died in [[Zagreb]].

In Croatian film ''[[Countess Dora]]'' (1993) he is played by [[Relja Bašić]].

'''Jean-Marie Klinkenberg'''  (born 8 October 1944) is a Belgian linguist and semiotician, professor at the State University of [[Liège]], born in Verviers ([[Belgium]]) in 1944. Member of the interdisciplinary [[Groupe µ]]. President of the [[visual semiotics|International Association for visual Semiotics]].

== Biography ==

Jean-Marie Klinkenberg, born in 1944 in [[Verviers]] ([[Belgium]]), received his Masters (1967) and his Doctorate (1971) in Romance Philology at the State University of [[Liège]]. He teaches language studies at the [[University of Liège]], focusing on [[rhetoric]] and [[semiotics]]. He also teaches French-language literature (particularly Belgian and Québécois).

His scientific activities focus on two areas: linguistics/semiotics and French-speaking cultures. In the first area, he made his mark in the late 1960s by revitalizing the field of rhetoric as a member of the interdisciplinary team known as the [[Groupe µ|µ Group]]. More recently, he has helped to steer semiotics in a social, cognitivist direction. His writings on semiotics and rhetoric have been translated into 15 or more languages.

In the second field, he has modernized the study of the arts in Belgium by casting them in a social and institutional light, an approach that can be readily transferred to the other French-speaking cultures he has studied (such as [[Quebec]]'s) and by establishing inter-university research programs. He founded and chairs Belgium's Centre d’Études des Lettres Francophones.

He is president of the International Association for [[visual semiotics]].

He is a member of the "Ordre des francophones d'Amérique" ([[Quebec]]) and [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Commandeur des Arts et Lettres]] ([[France]]).

Member of the "[[Académie royale de Belgique]]" (Royal Academy of [[Belgium]]).

A '''legal debate''' is a discussion between [[lawyers]], [[legal academics]], [[jurists]], [[politicians]], and others who might have an interest or expertise in the [[law]], about a particular legal issue.

== Overview ==
Legal debates can take many forms, and do not necessarily need to be face-to-face debates.  Most legal debates take place on paper—judges within a court, for example, might debate each other most effectively when the court publishes a decision.  Legal debates include (but are not limited to) the following:

*'''Debates between judges.'''  These debates, as well, will often occur face to face during judicial conferences, but they find their most prominent voice in written opinions.  Splintered U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions present a prominent example.  [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissents with the majority epitomize the nature of judicial legal debate—a debate that often centers around the proper means of interpreting federal statutes or the Constitution.
*'''Debate between politicians.'''  An example of this debate is that between the [[President of the United States]] and the [[United States Congress]] over the ability of the executive power to issue clandestine wiretaps without seeking a warrant.  The legal debate at issue is the scope of executive power vis-a-vis the other branches of government.
*'''General debate within society.'''  Societies always debate the legal order.  The process of electing politicians and lobbying is a form of legal debate: the majority tends to become part of a coalition that agrees on the laws that will be implemented.

== Contemporary issues in legal debates ==
Debates in Western societies often follow broad themes, including

*The balance between state power and civil liberties
*The proper breadth of civil liberties relative to social norms and moral expectations

In the United States, legal debates over the past decade have concerned the following important topics:

*The [[right to privacy]], including the right to have an [[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Editors |title= The Abortion Debate: Finding a Forum |journal=Policy Today  |date=2006-06-01 |url=http://www.policytoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=2 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The balance between civil rights and the need for greater security after September 11, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Godoy |first=Maria |title=NSA Wiretapping: The Legal Debate |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2008-02-23 |url=https://www.npr.org/news/specials/nsawiretap/legality.html |accessdate= 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The proper method of interpreting the Constitution
*[[Affirmative Action]]
*[[Welfare reform]]#
*The right to a child

In general, the variety of debates—ranging from basic social policy to grander theory about constitutional design and democratic theory—suggests that legal debates overlap with several other social institutions and expectations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10333">[[Image:NorthSouth-Expressway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]] in [[Malaysia]]. A roadway can be a line source of [[air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]] and need not be a straight line.]]

A '''line source''', as opposed to a [[point source]], [[area source]], or  [[Volume source (pollution)|volume source]],  is a source of air, noise, water contamination or electromagnetic radiation that emanates from a linear (one-dimensional) geometry.  The most prominent linear sources are [[roadway air dispersion modeling|roadway air pollution]], [[aircraft]] air [[emission standard|emissions]], [[roadway noise]], certain types of water pollution sources that emanate over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point, elongated light tubes, certain dose models in [[medical physics]] and electromagnetic [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]. While [[Point source (pollution)|point sources]] of [[pollution]] were studied since the late nineteenth century, linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late 1960s, when environmental regulations for [[highway]]s and [[airport]]s began to emerge. At the same time, computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing needs of the [[computer model]]s required to tackle these one-dimensional sources became more available.

In addition, this era of the 1960s saw the first emergence of [[environmental scientist]]s who spanned the disciplines required to accomplish these studies. For example, meteorologists, chemists, and computer scientists in the air pollution field were required to build complex models to address [[roadway air dispersion modeling]].  Prior to the 1960s, these specialities tended to work within their own disciplines, but with the advent of [[NEPA]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Noise Control Act]] in the United States, and other seminal legislation, the era of multidisciplinary environmental science had begun.

For electromagnetic linear sources, the principal early advances in computer modeling arose in the [[Soviet Union]] and USA when the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]] were fought partially by progress in [[electronic warfare]], including the technologies of active antenna arrays.

==Linear air pollution source==

{{main article|Roadway air dispersion modeling}}

Air pollution levels near major highways and urban [[arterial]]s are in violation of U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards where millions of Americans live or work.  Even the interior of a building does not really protect inhabitants from adverse exterior air quality, since the exterior air is the intake supply, and it is well known that [[indoor air quality]] is typically worse than exterior air.

A roadway travelled by motor vehicles can be idealized by a line source emitting air pollutants.  This mathematical problem was first solved in 1970 by a collaboration of [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan, ''Theoretical basis for atmospheric diffusion from a linear source'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication IR-29, Sunnyvale, Ca.,  May 4, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Venti, ''Atmospheric diffusion models for roadway sources'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication ET-22, Sunnyvale, Ca., October 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original theory assumed steady-state traffic conditions and meteorology on a perfectly straight roadway.  Currently the models have evolved to treat variable meteorology, time-variant traffic operations and complex roadbed geometries. Current technology allows highway designers and city planners to analyze alternative roadway development plans and assess air quality impacts.  The same basic model theory can be applied to airport operations, since the linear source is merely an inclined line.  In the early 1970s these ESL models were refined into [[area source]] models to account for the finite width of the roadway.

==Linear noise source==

{{main article|Roadway noise}}

[[Image:Njturnpike.JPG|thumb|300px|left|The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] was one of the earliest line sources analyzed for [[roadway noise|noise]]]]

Roadway noise is the most important example of a linear noise source, since it comprises about 80 percent of the environmental noise exposure for humans worldwide.  In the 1960s, when computer modeling of this phenomenon was perfected, the first applications of linear source noise modeling became systematic.  After passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and Noise Control Act,&lt;ref&gt;''Public Law No. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234 (1972) Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972'',  codification amended at 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the demand for detailed analysis soared, and decision makers began to look to acoustical scientists for answers regarding the planning of new roadways and the design of [[noise mitigation]].  The intensity of roadway noise is governed by the following variables: [[traffic]] operations (speed, [[truck]] mix, age of [[vehicle]] fleet), roadway surface type, tire types, roadway geometrics, terrain, micrometeorology and the  geometry of area structures.

Due to  the complexity of the variables, a line source acoustic model must be a computer model that can analyze sound levels in the vicinity of roadways.  The first meaningful models arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Two of the leading research teams were [[BBN Technologies|BBN]] in [[Boston]] and [[ESL Inc.]] of Sunnyvale, California.  Both of these groups developed complex [[mathematical model]]s to allow the study of alternate roadway designs, traffic operations and [[noise mitigation]] strategies in an arbitrary setting.&lt;ref&gt;John Shadely, ''Acoustical analysis of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick'', Bolt Beranek and Newman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Later model alterations have come into widespread use among state [[Department of Transportation|Departments of Transportation]] and city planners, but the accuracy of early models has had little change in 40 years.

Generally line source acoustic models trace sound ray bundles and calculate spreading loss along with ray bundle divergence (or convergence} from refractive phenomena. [[Diffraction]] is usually addressed by establishing [[secondary emitters]] at any points of [[topographic]] or [[anthropomorphic]] “sharpness” (such as [[noise barrier]]s or building surfaces. [[Meteorology]] can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual [[wind rose]] and [[wind speed]] statistics (along with [[thermocline]] data).

==Water pollution line source==

[[Image:Canyon midday.jpg|thumb|right|230px| [[Colorado River]], receiving effectively a linear source of silt from the sides of the [[Grand Canyon]].]]

Less common are line source applications in the field of water pollutant dispersal.  This phenomenon generally arises when [[surface runoff]] scours [[soil contaminants]] from upper soil layers and transports these pollutants to a linear receiving water, such as a river.  The underlying land management practices which lead to such sources of water pollution are [[logging]], [[pesticide]] application, [[construction]] grading, [[slash-and-burn]] activity and urban [[stormwater]] runoff.

Again computer models are needed to address the complexity of such an extended linear discharge into a dynamic medium such as flowing water.  The resulting surface runoff water carrying pollutants may be considered a line source discharging into a river or stream.  The chemical composition of this surface runoff may be characterized by a surface runoff model such as the USGS runoff precipitation algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eco.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/prms.html United States Geological Survey runoff precipitation algorithm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610235807/http://eco.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/prms.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the instream transport may be analyzed by a dynamic river pollutant model such as [[DSSAM]].

==Light emission line source==

[[Image:FluorescentT8razorback.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Common T8 [[fluorescent]] [[lighting]] tubes used in office environments]]

In the study of illumination, a variety of sources are linear in nature, most commonly the [[fluorescent tube]], During the process of interior lighting design it is important to calculate the light intensity at work stations or other user areas, not only to ensure sufficient light is present, but more importantly to avoid [[over-illumination]] and its attendant [[energy conservation|energy wastage]] as well as adverse health effects.  Thus the scientists involved in light transmission calculations employ computer models that recognize linear sources when fluorescent fixtures are used.  In a typical setting there may be hundreds of finite length light sources that comprise the light output in an office environment. A related concept are the [[ultraviolet]] tubes used in [[phototherapy]], where output radiation from the tube can be accurately modeled by treating the tube as a line source.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Robert Grimes]], Chris Robbins, Neil John O'Hare. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21089759 ''Dose Modeling in Ultraviolet phototherapy'', Medical Physics,  '''37(10)''' October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; On a larger scale, an illuminated [[roadway]] may act as a line source of [[light pollution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''Metapragmatics''' is a term from the [[Semiotics|semiotically]]-informed [[linguistic anthropology]] of [[Michael Silverstein]] that describes how the effects and conditions of language use themselves become objects of discourse. Metapragmatic signalling allows participants to construe what is going on in an interaction. Examples include:
* describing the "correct way" of using language ("I before E except after C."),
* specifying under which conditions a specific kind of communication are, or should be, used ("You should never tell a dirty joke at a funeral."),
* signalling, explicitly or implicitly, the type of social event occurring (explicit: "I promise to be there at 3:00 p.m." implicit: "I will be there at 3:00 p.m.")
* linking speech to another event outside the moment of speaking ("Every day she goes jogging." ).

Discussions of linguistic [[pragmatics]]—that is, discussions of what speech ''does'' in a particular context—are meta-pragmatic, because they describe the meaning of speech as action. Although it is useful to distinguish semantic (i.e. denotative or referential) meaning (dictionary meaning) from pragmatic meaning, and thus metasemantic discourse (for example, "Mesa means 'table' in Spanish") from metapragmatic utterances (e.g. "Say 'thank you' to your grandmother," or "It is impolite to swear in mixed company"), meta-[[semantic]] characterizations of speech are a type of metapragmatic speech. This follows from the assertion that metapragmatic speech characterizes speech function, and denotation or reference are among the many functions of speech. Because metapragmatics describes relations between different discourses it relates crucially to the concepts of [[intertextuality]] or [[interdiscursivity]].

In [[linguistic anthropology|anthropology]], describing the rules of use for metapragmatic speech (in the same way that a grammar would describe the rules of use for 'ordinary' or semantic speech) is important because it can aid the understanding and analysis of a culture's [[language ideology]]. Silverstein has also described universal limits on metapragmatic awareness that help explain why some linguistic forms seem to be available to their users for conscious comment, while other forms seem to escape awareness despite efforts by a researcher to ask native speakers to repeat them or characterize their use.

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]], or reflexive, metapragmatic statements are [[Indexicality|indexical]]. That is, their meaning comes from their temporal contiguity with their referent: themselves. Example: "This is an example sentence."

Large-scale recording of neuronal ensembles. ''Nature Neuroscience 7'': 446-451.&lt;/ref&gt;|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 7 May 2009}}]] --&gt;
'''Microelectrode arrays (MEAs)''' (also referred to as multielectrode arrays) are devices that contain multiple (tens to thousands) [[microelectrode]]s through which neural [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are obtained or delivered, essentially serving as neural interfaces that connect [[neuron]]s to [[electric circuit|electronic circuitry]].  There are two general classes of MEAs: implantable MEAs, used ''[[in vivo]]'', and non-implantable MEAs, used ''[[in vitro]]''.

==Theory==
Neurons and [[muscle]] cells create [[ion]] currents through their [[Cell membrane|membranes]] when excited, causing a change in [[voltage]] between the inside and the outside of the cell. When recording, the [[electrode]]s on an MEA [[Transducer|transduce]] the change in [[voltage]] from the environment carried by [[ions]] into currents carried by [[electrons]] (electronic currents). When stimulating, [[electrodes]] transduce electronic currents into ionic currents through the media. This triggers the [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s on the [[cell membrane|membranes]] of the excitable cells, causing the cell to [[depolarization|depolarize]] and trigger an [[action potential]] if it is a neuron or a twitch if it is a muscle cell.{{Citation needed|reason=It is highly unlikely that a low-voltage extracellular current directly affects voltage-gated channels that are known to respond to large changes in the 70,000 V/m electric field of the cell membrane|date=December 2008}}

The size and shape of a recorded signal depend upon several factors: the nature of the medium in which the cell or cells are located (e.g. the medium's [[electrical conductivity]], [[capacitance]], and [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneity]]); the nature of contact between the cells and the MEA electrode (e.g. area of contact and tightness); the nature of the MEA electrode itself (e.g. its geometry, [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and noise); the [[analog signal processing]] (e.g. the system's [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and behavior outside of [[cutoff frequency|cutoff frequencies]]); and the data [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] properties (e.g. [[sampling rate]] and [[digital signal processing]]).&lt;ref name="Boven"&gt;Boven K-H, Fejtl M, Möller A, Nisch W, Stett A. On Micro-Electrode Array Revival. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays.'' New York: Springer Press; 2006: 24-37.&lt;/ref&gt; For the recording of a single cell that partially covers a planar electrode, the voltage at the [[contact pad]] is approximately equal to the voltage of the overlapping region of the cell and electrode multiplied by the ratio the [[surface area]] of the overlapping region to the area of the entire electrode, or:

&lt;math&gt;V_{pad}=V_{overlap}\times\frac{A_{overlap}}{A_{electrode}}&lt;/math&gt;

assuming the area around an electrode is [[insulator (electrical)|well-insulated]] and has a very small capacitance associated with it.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt; The equation above, however, relies on modeling the electrode, cells, and their surroundings as an equivalent [[circuit diagram]]. An alternative means of predicting cell-electrode behavior is by modeling the system using a geometry-based [[finite element analysis]] in an attempt to circumvent the limitations of oversimplifying the system in a lumped circuit element diagram.&lt;ref name="Buitenweg"&gt;Buitenweg JR, Rutten WL, and Marani E. 2003. Geometry-based finite element modeling of the electrical contact between a cultured neuron and a microelectrode. ''IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 50'': 501-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

An MEA can be used to perform [[electrophysiological]] experiments on tissue slices or [[dissociated cell cultures]]. With acute tissue slices, the connections between the cells within the tissue slices prior to extraction and plating are more or less preserved, while the intercellular connections in dissociated cultures are destroyed prior to plating. With dissociated neuronal cultures, the neurons spontaneously form [[biological neural network|networks]].&lt;ref name="Potter2001"&gt;Potter SM. 2001. Distributed processing in cultured neuronal networks. ''Prog Brain Res 130'': 49-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be seen that the voltage [[amplitude]] an electrode experiences is [[inversely related]] to the distance from which a cell depolarizes.&lt;ref name="PineBook"&gt;Pine J. A History of MEA Development. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays.'' New York: Springer Press; 2006:3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it may be necessary for the cells to be cultured or otherwise placed as close to the electrodes as possible. With tissue slices, a layer of electrically passive dead cells form around the site of incision due to [[edema]].&lt;ref name="Heuschkel"&gt;Heuschkel MO, Wirth C, Steidl EM, Buisson B. Development of 3-D Multi-Electrode Arrays for Use with Acute Tissue Slices. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays.'' New York: Springer Press; 2006:69-111.&lt;/ref&gt; A way to deal with this is by fabricating an MEA with three-dimensional electrodes fabricated by [[photomask|masking]] and [[etching (microfabrication)|chemical etching]]. These 3-D electrodes penetrate the dead cell layer of the slice tissue, decreasing the distance between live cells and the electrodes.&lt;ref name="Thiebaud"&gt;Thiebaud P, deRooij NF, Koudelka-Hep M, Stoppini L. 1997. Microelectrode arrays for electrophysiological monitoring of hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. ''IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 44'': 1159-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In dissociated cultures, proper adherence of the cells to the MEA substrate is important for getting robust signals.

==History==
The first implantable arrays were microwire arrays developed in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Cheung" /&gt; The first experiment involving the use of an array of planar electrodes to record from cultured cells was conducted in 1972 by C.A. Thomas, Jr. and his colleagues.&lt;ref name="PineBook" /&gt; The experimental setup used a 2 x 15 array of [[gold]] electrodes plated with [[platinum black]], each spaced 100&amp;nbsp;µm apart from each other. [[Myocytes]] harvested from [[embryo]]nic chicks were dissociated and cultured onto the MEAs, and signals up to 1 mV high in amplitude were recorded.&lt;ref name = "Thomas"&gt;Thomas CA, Springer PA, Loeb GE, Berwald-Netter Y, Okun LM. 1972. A miniature microelectrode array to monitor the bioelectric activity of cultured cells. ''Exp Cell Res. 74'': 61-66.&lt;/ref&gt; MEAs were constructed and used to explore the electrophysiology of snail [[ganglia]] independently by [[Guenter Gross]] and his colleagues at the Center for Network Neuroscience in 1977 without prior knowledge of Thomas and his colleagues' work.&lt;ref name="PineBook" /&gt; In 1982, Gross observed spontaneous electrophysiological activity from dissociated [[spinal cord]] neurons, and found that activity was very dependent on temperature. Below about 30˚C signal amplitudes decrease rapidly to relatively small value at [[room temperature]].&lt;ref name="PineBook" /&gt;

Before the 1990s, significant [[entry barrier]]s existed for new laboratories that sought to conduct MEA research due to the custom MEA fabrication and software they had to develop.&lt;ref name="Potter2001" /&gt; However, with the advent of affordable computing power&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt; and commercial MEA hardware and software,&lt;ref name="Potter2001" /&gt; many other laboratories were able to undertake research using MEAs. This non-invasive [[electrophysiology]] [[laboratory technique]] can be more efficient than the [[patch clamp]] method.

==Types==
Microelectrode arrays can be divided up into subcategories based on their potential use: ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' arrays.

The standard type of ''in vitro'' MEA comes in a pattern of 8 x 8 or 6 x 10 electrodes.  Electrodes are typically composed of [[indium tin oxide]] or [[titanium]] and have diameters between 10 and 30 μm.  These arrays are normally used for single-cell cultures or acute brain slices.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;

One challenge among ''in vitro'' MEAs has been imaging them with [[microscopes]] that use high power lenses, requiring low [[working distance]]s on the order of micrometers. In order to avoid this problem, "thin"-MEAs have been created using cover slip glass. These arrays are approximately 180 μm allowing them to be used with high-power lenses.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tenacity"&gt;Minerbi A, Kahana R, Goldfeld L, Kaufman M, Marom S, Ziv NE. 2009. Long-term relationships between synaptic tenacity, synaptic remodeling, and network activity. PLoS Biol. 7(6):e1000136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another special design, 60 electrodes are split into 6 x 5 arrays separated by 500 μm.  Electrodes within a group are separated by 30&amp;nbsp;um with diameters of 10 μm.  Arrays such as this are used to examine local responses of neurons while also studying functional connectivity of organotypic slices.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segev R, Berry II, MJ. 2003. Recording from all of the ganglion cells in the retina. ''Soc Neurosci Abstr. 264'': 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial resolution is one of the key advantages of MEAs and allows signals sent over a long distance to be taken with higher precision when a high-density MEA is used.  These arrays usually have a square grid pattern of 256 electrodes that cover an area of 2.8 by 2.8&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;

Increased spatial resolution is provided by CMOS-based high-density microelectrode arrays featuring thousands of electrodes along with integrated readout and stimulation circuits on compact chips of the size of a thumbnail.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;A. Hierlemann, U. Frey, S. Hafizovic, F. Heer (2011). Growing Cells atop Microelectronic Chips: Interfacing Electrogenic Cells in Vitro with CMOS-based Microelectrode Arrays. Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 99, No. 2, pp. 252-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the resolution of signals propagating along  single axons has been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;D. J. Bakkum, U. Frey, M. Radivojevic, T. L. Russell, J. Müller, M. Fiscella, H. Takahashi, A. Hierlemann (2013). Tracking axonal action potential propagation on a high-density microelectrode array across hundreds of sites. Nature Communications 2013, 4:2181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain quality signals electrodes and tissue must be in close contact with one another.  The perforated MEA design applies negative [[pressure]] to openings in the substrate so that tissue slices can be positioned on the electrodes to enhance contact and recorded signals.&lt;ref name="Boven" /&gt;

A different approach to lower the electrode impedance is by modification of the interface material, for example by using [[carbon nanotubes]],&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Z. et al. 2007.

Electro-chemical and biological properties of carbon nanotube based multi-electrode arrays  ''Nanotechnology. 18(3)'': 035201.&lt;/ref&gt; or by modification of the structure of the electrodes, with for example gold nanopillars&lt;ref&gt;Brüggemann, D. et al. 2011. Nanostructured gold microelectrodes for extracellular recording from electrogenic cells ''Nanotechnology 22(26)'': 265104.&lt;/ref&gt; or nanocavities.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, B. et al. 2011.

===''In vivo'' arrays===
[[Image:Utah array pat5215088.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Schematic of the "Utah" in vivo electrode array]]
The three major categories of implantable MEAs are microwire, [[silicon]]- based,&lt;ref&gt;R. Bhandari, S. Negi, F. Solzbacher, "Wafer Scale Fabrication of Penetrating Neural Electrode Arrays" Biomedical Microdevices, Vol. 12(5), pp. 797-807, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and flexible microelectrode arrays.  Microwire MEAs are largely made of stainless [[steel]] or [[tungsten]] and they can be used to estimate the position of individual recorded neurons by triangulation.  Silicon-based microelectrode arrays include two specific models: the Michigan and Utah arrays.  Michigan arrays allow a higher density of sensors for implantation as well as a higher spatial resolution than microwire MEAs.  They also allow signals to be obtained along the length of the shank, rather than just at the ends of the shanks.  In contrast to Michigan arrays, Utah arrays are 3-D, consisting of 100 conductive silicon needles.  However, in a Utah array signals are only received from the tips of each electrode, which limits the amount of information that can be obtained at one time.  Furthermore, Utah arrays are manufactured with set dimensions and parameters while the Michigan array allows for more design freedom. Flexible arrays, made with [[polyimide]], [[parylene]], or [[benzocyclobutene]], provide an advantage over rigid microelectrode arrays because they provide a closer mechanical match, as the [[Young's modulus]] of silicon is much larger than that of brain tissue, contributing to shear-induced [[inflammation]].&lt;ref name="Cheung"&gt;Cheung KC. 2007. Implantable microscale neural interfaces. ''Biomedical Microdevices 9'': 923-38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data processing methods==

The fundamental unit of communication of neurons is, electrically, at least, the action potential. This all-or-nothing phenomenon originates at the [[axon hillock]],&lt;ref name="Angelides"&gt;Angelides KJ, Elmer LW, Loftus D, Elson E. 1988. Distribution and lateral mobility of voltage-dependent sodium channels in neurons. ''J. Cell Biol. 106'': 1911-25.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a depolarization of the intracellular environment which propagates down the [[axon]]. This ion flux through the cellular membrane generates a sharp change in voltage in the extracellular environment, which is what the MEA electrodes ultimately detect. Thus, voltage spike counting and sorting is often used in research to characterize network activity.

==Capabilities==

===Advantages===
In general, the major strengths of ''in vitro'' arrays when compared to more traditional methods such as [[patch clamp]]ing include:&lt;ref&gt;Whitson J, Kubota D, Shimono K, Jia Y, Taketani M. Multi-Electrode Arrays: Enhancing Traditional Methods and Enabling Network Physiology. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays''. New York: Spring Press; 2006: 38-68&lt;/ref&gt;

*Allowing the placement of multiple electrodes at once rather than individually
*The ability to set up controls within the same experimental setup (by using one electrode as a control and others as experimental). This is of particular interest in stimulation experiments.
*The ability to select different recordings sites within the array
*The ability to simultaneously receive data from multiple sites
*Recordings from intact retinae are of great interest because of the possibility of delivering real-time optical stimulation and, for instance, the possibility of reconstructing receptive fields.

Furthermore, ''in vitro'' arrays are non-invasive when compared to patch clamping because they do not require breaching of the cell membrane.
 
With respect to ''in vivo'' arrays however, the major advantage over patch clamping is the high spatial resolution. Implantable arrays allow signals to be obtained from individual neurons enabling information such as position or [[velocity]] of motor movement that can be used to control a [[prosthetic]] device. Large-scale, parallel recordings with tens of implanted electrodes are possible, at least in rodents, during animal behavior. This makes such extracellular recordings the method of choice to identify of neural circuits and to study their functions. Unambiguous identification of the recorded neuron using multi-electrode extracellular arrays, however, remains a problem to date.

===Disadvantages===
''In vitro'' MEAs are less suited for recording and stimulating single cells due to their low spatial resolution compared to patch clamp and [[dynamic clamp]] systems.  The complexity of signals an MEA electrode could effectively transmit to other cells is limited compared to the capabilities of dynamic clamps.

There are also several biological responses to implantation of a microelectrode array, particularly in regards to chronic implantation.  Most notable among these effects are neuronal cell loss, [[glial scarring]], and a drop in the number of functioning electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;Biran R, Martin DC, Tresco PA. 2005. Neuronal cell loss accompanies the brain tissue response to chronically implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. ''Experimental Neurology 195'': 115-26&lt;/ref&gt; The tissue response to implantation is dependent among many factors including size of the MEA shanks, distance between the shanks, MEA material composition, and time period of insertion. The tissue response is typically divided into short term and long term response. The short term response occurs within hours of implantation and begins with an increased population of [[astrocytes]] and [[glial cells]] surrounding the device. The recruited [[microglia]] then initiate inflammation and a process of [[phagocytosis]] of the foreign material begins. Over time, the astrocytes and microglia recruited to the device begin to accumulate, forming a sheath surrounding the array that extends tens of micrometres around the device. This not only increases the space between electrode probes, but also insulates the electrodes and increases impedance measurements. Problems with chronic implantation of arrays have been a driving force in the research of these devices. One novel study examined the [[neurodegenerative]] effects of inflammation caused by chronic implantation.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell GC, Rees HD, Levey AI, Gross RG, Bellamkonda RV. 2008. Chronic electrodes induce a local, neurodegenerative state:  Implications for chronic recording reliability. ''Society for Neuroscience'', Washington, D.C&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunohistochemical]] markers showed a surprising presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, an indicator of [[Alzheimer's disease]], near the electrode recording site. The phagocytosis of electrode material also brings to question the issue of a biocompatibility response, which research suggests has been minor and becomes almost nonexistent after 12 weeks ''in vivo''. Research to minimize the negative effects of device insertion includes surface coating of the devices with proteins that encourage neuron attachment, such as [[laminin]], or drug [[elution|eluting]] substances.&lt;ref&gt;He W, McConnell GC, Bellamkonda RV. 2006. Nanoscale laminin coating modulates cortical scarring response around implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. ''Journal of Neural Engineering 3'': 316-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of dissociated [[neuronal network]]s does not seem to change or diminish the character of its [[pharmacological]] response when compared to ''in vivo'' models, suggesting that MEAs can be used to study pharmacological effects on dissociated neuronal cultures in a more simple, controlled environment.&lt;ref name="Gopal"&gt;Gopal KV, Gross GW. Emerging Histotypic Properties of Cultured Neuronal Networks. In: Baudry M, Taketani M, eds. ''Advances in Network Electrophysiology Using Multi-Electrode Arrays''.

Histotypic electrophysiological responses of cultured neuronal networks to ethanol. ''Alcohol 30'': 167-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a substantial body of work on various biophysical aspects of network function was carried out by reducing phenomena usually studied at the behavioral level to the dissociated cortical network level. For example, the capacity of such networks to extract spatial&lt;ref name="Order"&gt;Shahaf G, Eytan D, Gal A, Kermany E, Lyakhov V, Zrenner C, Marom S. 2008.

MEAs have been used to interface neuronal networks with non-biological systems as a controller. For example, a neural-computer interface can be created using MEAs. Dissociated rat [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] neurons were integrated into a closed stimulus-response feedback loop to control an animat in a virtual environment.&lt;ref name="Animat"&gt;DeMarse TB, Wagenaar DA, Blau AW, Potter SM. 2001.

About 300,000 dissociated rat neurons were plated on an MEA, which was connected to motors and [[ultrasound]] sensors on a robot, and was conditioned to avoid obstacles when sensed.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;Marks P. 2008. Rise of the rat-brained robots. ''New Scientist 2669''.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, Shimon Marom and colleagues in the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] hooked dissociated neuronal networks growing on MEAs to a  [[Lego Mindstorms]] robot; the visual field of the robot was classified by the network, and commands were delivered to the robot wheels such that it completely avoids bumping into obstacles .&lt;ref name="Order" /&gt; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2580731/bin/pcbi.1000228.s004.mov link to movie].

===''In vivo''===
There are several implantable interfaces that are currently available for consumer use including [[deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulators]], [[cochlear implants]], and [[artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been effective at treating movement disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;Breit S, Schulz JB, Benabid AL. 2004. Deep Brain Stimulation. ''Cell Tissue Research 318'': 275-288.&lt;/ref&gt; and cochlear implants have helped many to improve their hearing by assisting stimulation of the [[auditory nerve]]. Because of their remarkable potential, MEAs are a prominent area of neuroscience research. Research suggests that MEAs may provide insight into processes such as memory formation and perception and may also hold therapeutic value for conditions such as [[epilepsy]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. Clinical trials using interface devices for restoring motor control after spinal cord injury or as treatment for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] have been initiated in a project entitled BrainGate (see video demo: [http://www.cyberkineticsinc.com/video.htm BrainGate]). MEAs provide the high resolution necessary to record time varying signals, giving them the ability to be used to both control and obtain feedback from prosthetic devices, as was shown by [[Kevin Warwick]], [[Mark Gasson]] and [[Peter Kyberd]].&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:"The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems", ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz AB. 2004. Cortical Neural Prosthetics. ''Annual Review of Neuroscience 27'': 487-507.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that MEA use may be able to assist in the restoration of vision by stimulating the [[optic nerve|optic pathway]].&lt;ref name="Cheung" /&gt;

==MEA user meetings==
A biannual scientific user meeting is held in Reutlingen, organized by the [http://www.nmi.de Natural and Medical Sciences Institute] (NMI) at the University of Tuebingen. The meetings offer a comprehensive overview of all aspects related to new developments and current applications of Microelectrode Arrays in basic and applied neuroscience as well as in industrial drug discovery, safety pharmacology and neurotechnology. The biannual conference has developed into an international venue for scientists developing and using MEAs from both industry and academia, and is recognized as an information-packed scientific forum of high quality. The meeting contributions are available as open access proceeding books.

==Use in art==

In addition to being used for scientific purposes, MEAs have been used in [[contemporary art]] to investigate philosophical questions about the relationship between technology and biology. Traditionally within Western thought, biology and technology have been separated into two distinct categories: ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/βίος#Ancient_Greek bios]'' and ''[[Techne|technê.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Thacker, Eugene (2010) "What is Biomedia?" in "Critical Terms for Media Studies" University of Chicago Press.

'''Mock-heroic''', '''mock-epic''' or '''heroi-comic''' works are typically [[satire]]s or [[parodies]] that mock common Classical stereotypes of [[hero]]es and heroic literature.  Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

==History==
Historically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th century Italy, and in the post-[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] periods in Great Britain.

The earliest example of the form is the ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ascribed to [[Homer]] by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carmentablog.com/2016/12/27/batrachomyomachia-classical-parody/|title=Batrachomyomachia: A Classical Parody - Carmenta Language School Blog|date=2016-12-27|work=Carmenta Language School Blog|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the [[pastoral]] genres had become used up and exhausted,&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p135"&gt;Griffin,Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA135 p.135]&lt;/ref&gt; and so they got parodically [[reprise]]d. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt expressing the traditional values of the feudal society.
Among the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish [[picaresque novel]]s and the French [[burlesque]] novel, in Italy flourished the ''poema eroicomico''. &lt;br&gt;
In this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by [[Torquato Tasso]] in his work ''Discorsi del poema eroico'' (''Discussions about the Epic Poems'') and realized in his masterwork, the ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', were felt as antiquated.&lt;br&gt;
The new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.

''Lo scherno degli dèi'' (''The Mockery of Gods'') by [[Francesco Bracciolini]], printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian ''poema eroicomico''.

[[File:Houghton MS Typ 619 - Amelonghi.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Amelonghi, 1547]]
However, the best known of the form is ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (''The rape of the Bucket'') by [[Alessandro Tassoni]] (1622). &lt;br&gt;Other Italian mock-heroic poems were ''La Gigantea'' by [[Girolamo Amelonghi]] (1566), the ''Viaggio di Colonia'' (''Travel to Cologne'') by [[Antonio Abbondanti]] (1625), ''L'asino'' (''The donkey'') by [[Carlo de' Dottori]] (1652), ''La Troja rapita'' by [[Loreto Vittori]] (1662), ''Il malmantile racquistato'' by [[Lorenzo Lippi]] (1688), ''La presa di San Miniato'' by [[Ippolito Neri]] (1764).

Also in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in [[Neapolitan dialect]] the best known work of the form was ''La Vaiasseide'' by [[Giulio Cesare Cortese]] (1612).&lt;br&gt; While in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] [[Giovanni Camillo Peresio]] wrote ''Il maggio romanesco'' (1688), [[Giuseppe Berneri]] published ''[[Meo Patacca]]'' in 1695, and, finally, [[Benedetto Micheli]] printed ''La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa'' in 1765.

After the translation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]], English authors began to imitate the inflated language of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters.  The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the [[picaresque novel|picaresque]], [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]], and [[satire|satirical]] poem is the comic poem ''[[Hudibras]]'' (1662–1674), by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]].  Butler's poem describes a "trew blew" Puritan knight during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], in language that imitates Romance and [[epic poetry]].  After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays.  

''Hudibras'' gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the "[[Hudibrastic]]."  The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often [[feminine rhyme]]s or unexpected conjunctions.  For example, Butler describes the [[English Civil War]] as a time which "Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not one knew why or wherefore" ("punk" meaning a prostitute).  The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody.  This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others.  After Butler, [[Jonathan Swift]] is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.

[[Poet Laureate]] [[John Dryden]] is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era.  While Dryden's own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' is satirized in the mock-heroic ''[[The Author's Farce]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''), Dryden's ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' is perhaps the ''[[locus classicus]]'' of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come.  In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares [[Thomas Shadwell]] with [[Aeneas]] by using the language of ''[[Aeneid]]'' to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe.  The [[parody]] of Virgil satirizes Shadwell.  Dryden's prosody is identical to regular [[heroic verse]]:  iambic pentameter closed couplets.  The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see "the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century" by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.) 

After Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780.  Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel.  The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by [[Alexander Pope]].  Pope’s ''The Rape of the Lock'' is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking [[epic poetry]] such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' .   The overall form of the poem, written in [[canto]]s, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the [[Muse]]”; in this case, Pope's [[Muse]] is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]]: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3).  Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure{{fact|date=November 2013 }}, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda.  These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the ''Iliad'') that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle.  All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory.  Pope’s [http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/rapeofthelock/analysis.html mastery of the Mock-Heroic] is clear in every instance.  Even the typical [[apotheosis]] found in the epics is mimicked in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in ''[[The Dunciad]]'' which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects.    In this mock-epic the progress of [[Dulness]] over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (see also the metaphor of ''[[translatio studii]]'').  [[John Gay]]'s ''[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]'' and ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'' were mock-heroic (the latter in [[opera]]), and [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|London]]'' is a mock-heroic of a sort.

By the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative [[parody]], and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody.  The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes's novel.  After [[Romanticism]]'s flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were uncommon.

Finally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in [[France]], in [[Scotland]], in [[Poland]], in [[Bohemia]], in [[Russia]]. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were ''Le Vergile Travesti'' (''The disguised Vergil'') by [[Paul Scarron]] (1648–52) and ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1730). In [[macaronic Latin]] enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] wrote ''Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam'' in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was [[Ignacy Krasicki]], who wrote ''Myszeida'' (''Mouseiad'') in 1775 and ''Monacomachia'' (''The War of the Monks'') in 1778. In the same language [[Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski]] published ''Organy'' in 1775-77. The Bohemian poet [[Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský]] in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: ''Dĕvin'' in Czech and ''Der böhmische Mägderkrieg'' in German. In 1791 the Russian poet [[N. P. Osipov]] published {{Interlanguage link multi|Eneida travestied|ru|3=Вергилиева Энеида, вывороченная наизнанку|lt=''Eneida travestied''}} ({{lang-ru|Вирги́лиева Энеи́да, вы́вороченная наизна́нку|italic=yes}}). [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the [[modern Ukrainian language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">'''Morphallaxis''' is the regeneration of specific [[Biological tissue|tissue]] in a variety of [[organisms]] due to loss or death of the existing tissue.  The word comes from the [[greek language|Greek]] ''allazein,'' which means ''to exchange.''  

The classical example of morphallaxis is that of the [[Cnidaria]]n hydra, where when the animal is severed in two (by actively cutting it with, for example, a surgical knife) the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent [[hydra (genus)|hydra]].  The notable feature of morphallaxis is that a large majority of regenerated tissue comes from already-present tissue in the organism.  That is, the one severed section of the hydra forms into a smaller version of the original hydra, approximately the same size as the severed section.  Hence, there is an "exchange" of tissue.

Researchers Wilson and Child showed circa 1930 that if the hydra was pulped and the disassociated cells passed through a sieve, those cells then put into an aqueous solution would shortly reform into the original organism with all differentiated tissue correctly arranged.&lt;ref&gt; H. F. Dunbar: Emotions and Bodily Changes; New York; 1946 &lt;/ref&gt;

Morphallaxis is often contrasted with [[epimorphosis]], which is characterized by a much greater relative degree of cellular proliferation.  Although [[cellular differentiation]] is active in both processes, in morphallaxis the majority of the regeneration comes from reorganization or exchange, while in ''epimorphosis'' the majority of the regeneration comes from cellular differentiation.  Thus, the two may be distinguished as a measure of degree.
Epimorphosis is the regeneration of a part of an organism by proliferation at the cut surface. For example, in [[Planaria]] [[neoblast]]s help in regeneration.

[[File:Unknown Bat 2.jpg|thumb]]
In [[infectious disease]] [[ecology]] and [[epidemiology]], a '''natural reservoir''', also known as a '''disease reservoir''' or a '''reservoir of infection''', is the [[population]] of organisms or the specific environment in which an infectious [[pathogen]] naturally lives and reproduces, or upon which the pathogen primarily depends for its survival. A reservoir is usually a living [[Host (biology)|host]] of a certain species, such as an animal or a plant, inside of which a pathogen survives, often (though not always) without causing disease for the reservoir itself. By some definitions a reservoir may also be an environment external to an organism, such as a volume of contaminated air or water.&lt;ref name="CDC20122"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section10.html|title=Principles of Epidemiology {{!}} Lesson 1 - Section 10|date=2012|publisher=CDC|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haydon2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=December 2002|title=Identifying Reservoirs of Infection: A Conceptual and Practical Challenge|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/12/01-0317_article.htm|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1468–1473|doi=10.3201/eid0812.010317|pmid=12498665|pmc=2738515|last1=Haydon|first1=D. T.|last2=Cleaveland|first2=S.|last3=Taylor|first3=L. H.|last4=Laurenson|first4=M. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the enormous variety of infectious [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] capable of causing disease, precise definitions for what constitutes a natural reservoir are numerous, various, and often conflicting. The reservoir concept applies only for pathogens capable of infecting more than one host population and only with respect to a defined target population – the population of organisms in which the pathogen causes disease. The reservoir is any population of organisms (or any environment) which harbors the pathogen and [[Transmission (medicine)|transmits]] it to the target population. Reservoirs may comprise one or more different species, may be the same or a different species as the target, and, in the broadest sense, may include [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector species]],&lt;ref name="Haydon2" /&gt; which are otherwise distinct from natural reservoirs. Significantly, species considered reservoirs for a given pathogen [[Asymptomatic|may not experience symptoms]] of disease when infected by the pathogen.

Identifying the natural reservoirs of infectious pathogens has proven useful in treating and preventing large outbreaks of disease in humans and domestic animals, especially those diseases for which no [[vaccine]] exists. In principle, [[Zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]] can be controlled by isolating or destroying the pathogen's reservoirs of infection. The mass [[culling]] of animals confirmed or suspected as reservoirs for human pathogens, such as birds that harbor [[avian influenza]], has been effective at containing possible [[Epidemic|epidemics]] in many parts of the world; for other pathogens, such as the [[Ebolavirus|ebolaviruses]], the identity of the presumed natural reservoir remains obscure.

== Definition and terminology ==
The great diversity of infectious pathogens, their possible hosts, and the ways in which their hosts respond to infection has resulted in multiple definitions for "natural reservoir", many of which are conflicting or incomplete. In a 2002 conceptual exploration published in the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s ''[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]]'', the natural reservoir of a given pathogen is defined as "one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population."&lt;ref name="Haydon2" /&gt; The ''target population'' is the population or species in which the pathogen causes disease; it is the population of interest because it suffers from disease when infected by the pathogen (for example, humans are the target population in most medical epidemiological studies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-12-01|title=Identifying Reservoirs of Infection: A Conceptual and Practical Challenge|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738515/|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1468–1473|doi=10.3201/eid0812.010317|issn=1080-6040|pmc=2738515|pmid=12498665|last1=Haydon|first1=D. T.|last2=Cleaveland|first2=S.|last3=Taylor|first3=L. H.|last4=Laurenson|first4=M. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criterion in other definitions distinguishes reservoirs from non-reservoirs by the degree to which the infected host shows symptoms of disease. By these definitions, a reservoir is a host that does not experience the symptoms of  disease when infected by the pathogen, whereas non-reservoirs show symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Ryan M.|last2=Gilbert|first2=Amy|last3=Slate|first3=Dennis|last4=Chipman|first4=Richard|last5=Singh|first5=Amber|last6=Cassie Wedd|last7=Blanton|first7=Jesse D.|date=2014-10-08|title=Right Place, Wrong Species: A 20-Year Review of Rabies Virus Cross Species Transmission among Terrestrial Mammals in the United States|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=10|pages=e107539|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0107539|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4189788|pmid=25295750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathogen still feeds, grows, and reproduces inside a reservoir host, but otherwise does not significantly affect its health; the relationship between pathogen and reservoir is more or less [[Commensalism|commensal]], whereas in susceptible hosts that do suffer disease caused by the pathogen, the pathogen is considered [[Parasitism|parasitic]].

What further defines a reservoir for a specific pathogen is where it can be maintained and from where it can be transmitted. A "multi-host" organism is capable of having more than one natural reservoir.

== Types of reservoirs ==
Natural reservoirs can be divided into three main types: human, animal (non-human), and environmental.&lt;ref name="CDC20122" /&gt;

=== Human Reservoirs ===
''Human reservoirs'' are human beings infected by pathogens that exist on or within the human body.&lt;ref name="CDC20122" /&gt; [[Poliomyelitis]] and [[smallpox]] exist exclusively within a human reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble, Jr.|first=John|year=1970|title=A Study of New and Old World Monkeys to Determine the Likelihood of a Simian Reservoir|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=42|pages=509–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can act as reservoirs for sexually transmitted diseases, measles, mumps, streptococcal infection, various respiratory pathogens, and the smallpox virus.&lt;ref name="CDC20122" /&gt;
[[File:Bushmeat_-_Buschfleisch_Ghana.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bushmeat_-_Buschfleisch_Ghana.JPG|thumb|[[Bushmeat]] being prepared for cooking in [[Ghana]], 2013. Human consumption of animals as bushmeat in equatorial Africa has caused the transmission of diseases, including [[Ebola]], to people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/african-monkey-meat-that-could-be-behind-the-next-hiv-7786152.html 25 people in Bakaklion, Cameroon killed due to eating of ape]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Animal reservoirs ===
Animal (non-human) reservoirs consist of domesticated and wild animals infected by pathogens.&lt;ref name="CDC20122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haydon2" /&gt; For example, the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which causes [[cholera]] in humans, has natural reservoirs in [[Copepod|copepods]], [[zooplankton]], and [[shellfish]]. Parasitic blood-flukes of the genus ''[[Schistosoma]]'', responsible for [[schistosomiasis]], spend part of their lives inside freshwater [[Snail|snails]] before completing their life cycles in vertebrate hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Parasitic helminths and zoonoses in Africa|last1=Macpherson|first1=C.N.L.|last2=Craig|first2=P.S.|date=1991|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-010-5358-7|editor1-last=Macpherson|editor1-first=C.N.L.|location=Dordrecht|chapter=Chapter 8: Animal reservoirs of schistosomiasis|editor2-last=Craig|editor2-first=P.S.|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3054-7_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses of the taxon ''[[Ebolavirus]]'', which causes [[Ebola virus disease]], are thought to have a natural reservoir in bats or other animals exposed to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/about.html|title=About Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever{{!}} Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other zoonotic diseases that have been transmitted from animals to humans include: rabies, blastomycosis, psittacosis, trichinosis, cat scratch disease, histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis and  salmonella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/dtopics/zoo/|title=Zoonotic Diseases: Disease Transmitted from Animals to Humans - Minnesota Dept. of Health|website=www.health.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed theory is that there exist so many bat-borne illnesses because there exist a large amount of bat species and individuals. The second possibility is that something about bats' physiology make them especially good reservoir hosts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Perhaps bats' "food choices, population structure, ability to fly, seasonal migration and daily movement patterns, torpor and hibernation, life span, and roosting behaviors" are responsible for making them especially suitable reservoir hosts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calisher|first=Charles H.|last2=Childs|first2=James E.|last3=Field|first3=Hume E.|last4=Holmes|first4=Kathryn V.|last5=Schountz|first5=Tony|date=2006-07-01|title=Bats: Important Reservoir Hosts of Emerging Viruses|url=https://cmr.asm.org/content/19/3/531|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=531–545|doi=10.1128/CMR.00017-06|issn=0893-8512|pmid=16847084|pmc=1539106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyssaviruses (including the Rabies virus), Henipaviruses, Menangle and Tioman viruses, SARS-CoV-Like Viruses, and Ebola viruses have all been traced back to different species of bats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fruit bats in particular serve as the reservoir host for Nipah virus (NiV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK114486/|title=TRANSMISSION OF HUMAN INFECTION WITH NIPAH VIRUS|last=Luby|first=Stephen P.|last2=Gurley|first2=Emily S.|last3=Hossain|first3=M.

Genome sequencing  has revealed the virus to be very similar to the type that infects humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agencia.fapesp.br/discovery-of-zika-virus-in-monkeys-suggests-disease-may-also-have-wild-cycle-/29081/|title=Discovery of Zika virus in monkeys suggests disease may also have wild cycle|website=AGÊNCIA FAPESP|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental Reservoirs ===
Environmental reservoirs include living and non-living reservoirs that harbor infectious pathogens outside the bodies of animals. These reservoirs may exist on land (plants and soil), in water, or in the air. Pathogens found in these reservoirs are sometimes free-living. The bacteria ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', a [[facultative intracellular parasite]] which causes [[Legionnaires' disease]], and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which causes [[cholera]], can both exist as free-living parasites in certain water sources as well as in invertebrate animal hosts.

== Disease transmission ==
A disease reservoir acts as a transmission point between a pathogen and a susceptible host.&lt;ref name="CDC20122" /&gt; Transmission can occur directly or indirectly.

=== Direct transmission ===
Direct transmission can occur from direct contact or direct droplet spread. Direct contact transmission between two people can happen through skin contact, kissing, and sexual contact. Humans serving as disease reservoirs can be symptomatic (showing illness) or asymptomatic (not showing illness), act as disease carriers, and often spread illness unknowingly. Human carriers commonly transmit disease because they do not realize they are infected, and consequently take no special precautions to prevent transmission. Symptomatic persons who are aware of their illness are not as likely to transmit infection because they take precautions to reduce possible transmission of the disease and/or seek out treatment to prevent the spread of the disease.&lt;ref name="CDC20122" /&gt; Direct droplet spread is due to solid particles or liquid droplet suspended in air for some time. Droplet spread is considered the transmission of the pathogen to susceptible host within a meter of distance, they can spread from coughing, sneezing, and talking.

* ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' ([[Gonorrhea]]) is transmitted by sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, and anus through direct contact transmission.
* ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'' ([[Pertussis]]) is transmitted by cough from human reservoir to susceptible host through direct droplet spread.
*

=== Indirect transmission ===
Indirect transmission can occur by airborne transmission, by vehicles (including fomites), and by vectors.

Airborne transmission is different from direct droplet spread as it is defined as disease transmission that takes place over a distance larger than a meter. Pathogens that can be transmitted through airborne sources are carried by particles such as dust or dried residue (referred to as droplet nuclei).

Vehicles such as food, water, blood and fomites can act as passive transmission points between pathogens and susceptible hosts.  Fomites are inanimate objects (doorknobs, medical equipment, etc.) that become contaminated by a reservoir source or someone/something that is a carrier. A vehicle, like a reservoir, may also be a favorable environment for the growth of an infectious agent, as coming into contact with a vehicle leads to its transmission.

Vector transmission occurs most often from insect bites from mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and ticks. There are two sub-categories of vectors: ''mechanical'' (an insect transmits the pathogen to a host without the insect itself being affected) and ''biological'' (reproduction of the pathogen occurs within the vector before the pathogen is transmitted to a host). To give a few examples, ''[[Morbillivirus]]'' ([[measles]]) is transmitted from an infected human host to a susceptible host as they are transmitted by respiration through airborne transmission. ''[[Campylobacter]]'' ([[campylobacteriosis]]) is a common bacterial infection that is spread from human or non-human reservoirs by vehicles such as contaminated food and water. ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' ([[malaria]]) can be transmitted from an infected mosquito, an animal (non-human) reservoir, to human host by biological vector transmission.

== Implications for Public Health ==

LH Taylor found that 61% of all human pathogens are classified as zoonoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=L H|last2=Latham|first2=S M|last3=Woolhouse|first3=M E|date=2001-07-29|title=Risk factors for human disease emergence.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088493/|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=356|issue=1411|pages=983–989|doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.0888|issn=0962-8436|pmc=1088493|pmid=11516376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the identification of the natural reservoirs of pathogens prior to zoonosis would be incredibly useful from a public health standpoint. Preventive measures can be taken to lessen the frequency of outbreaks, such as vaccinating the animal sources of disease or preventing contact with reservoir host animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-11-machine-tool-viral-reservoirs-animal.html|title=Machine learning tool can predict viral reservoirs in the animal kingdom|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an effort to predict and prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, the U.S. Agency for International Development started the Emerging Pandemic Threats initiative in 2009. In alliance with University of California-Davis, EcoHealth Alliance, Metabiota Inc., Smithsonian Institution, and Wildlife Conservation Society with support from Columbia and Harvard universities, the members of the PREDICT project are focusing on the "detection and discovery of zoonotic diseases at the wildlife-human interface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/fact-sheets/emerging-pandemic-threats-program|title=Emerging Pandemic Threats {{!}} Fact Sheet {{!}} U.S. Agency for International Development|website=www.usaid.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other organizations around the world experimenting with different methods to predict and identify reservoir hosts. Researchers at the University of Glasgow created a machine learning algorithm that is designed to use "viral genome sequences to predict the likely natural host for a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, the viral group that most often jumps from animals to humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-11-machine-tool-viral-reservoirs-animal.html|title=Machine learning tool can predict viral reservoirs in the animal kingdom|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orchestra Control Engine''' is a suite of software components (based on [[Linux]]/[[RTAI]]) used for the planning, development and deployment of [[Real-time computing|real-time]] control applications for industrial machines and robots.

Orchestra Control Engine has been developed by [http://www.sintesi-am.eu Sintesi SpA] in partnership with the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|Italian National Research Council]] and in collaboration with international industrial companies in the field of robotics and production systems.

Sintesi SpA is a company that develops mechatronic components and solutions. It has specialized in measurement, control and design technologies for robotics and production systems.

== Main features ==

Orchestra Control Engine is flexible because it can be customized. This is done visually. The solutions created are open (based on an open source framework) and are extendible. Modular components of the software allow a user to develop, debug and test control applications. For example, previously developed algorithms can be divided into functional units and reused indefinitely. All the units work together. The software can be distributed among various remote hardware devices which may be hundreds of meters apart. It also scalable in that it selects hardware which provides the best cost and performance for a particular operation. The system's parameters can be quickly reconfigured both on line and also at the time of a run.

== Suite components ==
[[Linux]]/[[RTAI]] creates Orchestra Control Engine's hard real time behaviour. Its "open source" characteristics allow changes to fit the users' requirements. Non hard real time components of orchestra Control Engine can be used with non-Linux platforms such as [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Macintosh]].

;Orchestra Core
A hard real time multithreaded engine operates in multicore/multiprocessor architectures. Within the scheme, modules can be filled in with more or less complex algorithms  which control the process. The run time engine loads the modules. The user can adapt the modules to the topology. For complex topology, multiple modules can be used or parallel loops can be implemented.

;Orchestra Run Time Manager
The run time manager controls the formalities of execution of the program; decides priorities within the operation; and manages the multi-thread and multiprocessor operations. It is made up of templates that define [[thread (yarn)|thread]] typologies according to the formalities of execution and from a part that manages the POU (Program Organization Unit).

;Orchestra Logic Programming
The logic programming of Orchestra Control Engine assists in the use of the five contemplated languages of the [[IEC 61131]] norm. It also assists in the use of the C/C++ language.

;Orchestra Path Programming
The path programming of Orchestra Control Engine assists in the writing of movement and workmanship mechanics. Piece manufacturing programs (part programs) can be edited according to the international [[ISO-DIN 60025]] standard and the American EIA [[RS274 D]] standard. It is also important for the interpretation of modules and in turn for the input which allows a [[Motion Control Loop]].

;Orchestra Designer
The designer is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] IDE. It assists development of motion control applications for different environments. This involves completing new modules, using code templates, allowing the adding and shaping of new blocks and testing the modules both independently and in a control scheme. It also automatically provides [[XML configuration files]] for each module and for the control loop.

;Orchestra Builder
The builder is a software tool that allows [[Simulink]] models to be automatically generated into Orchestra core compatible modules. It does this by making a definition for every parameter of the Simulink model. It can generate a function which initializes the loading of a newly developed control system and, it can generate the step function which holds the code for the logic of each module.

;Orchestra HMI
HMI is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application (therefore a cross-platform one), that looks for and interacts with different parts of a control system. Orchestra HMI has a graphic interface (including a touch screen) which can run on any common PC. It can be customised to suit the user and provides user authentication. Orchestra HMI allows the user to CN configure and plan the production island and command processes such as the starting  a motion program. The user can screen and edit processes. Orchestra HMI provides the visualization of signals coming from an OrchestraCore or an Orchestra Run Time Manager by means of graphic controls (indicators, 2D plots, LCD displays) and the 3D visualization of  machines and anthropomorphous manipulators.

;Orchestra Library
The library contains sets of modules, information from sensors, interfaces with external entities such as machines, robots, sensors and DAQ boards.

== Solutions ==
Orchestra Control Engine is a suite of programs. Using the various components in combination allows for flexibility. d

;Orchestra Motion Control Framework

The motion control framework allows users to develop motion control applications by integrating the best modules for their purpose. The modules may be ones already available or those the user develops using the orchestra designer and builder facilities.

The modules can be run so that the process has multiple threads. Parallelisms are identified and thus algorithms are refined. The modules can be "debugged" as they are completed if specific verifications are programmed. Alternatively, the modules can be completed in "release" mode if no special verifications are required.

The modules be completed with any number of entries, parameters, states and vectorial output in double precision floating point, as well as states of any other type. These characteristics are codified through XML files.

;Orchestra MultiPLC

Orchestra MultiPLC (multi programmable logic controller) is composed of Orchestra Run Time Manager, Orchestra Logic Programming and OrchestraHMI.  It allows the execution of a motion control application as one or more programs or functional blocks which may be reused. The controller's open schema accepts and translates XML files. The functional blocks can be prioritised within a series or programmed to operate periodically. New tasks may be added to the application.

;Orchestra Full for Numerical Control

Orchestra Full for [[numerical control|Numerical Control]] consists of Orchestra Motion Control Framework, OrchestraMulti PLC, and some other specific components:

'''OrchestraGCode''' interprets the [[G-code]] program received by the HMI: if the G-code instruction is one of motion, then it is sent to the MotionSupervisor, if not, OrchestraGCode will write the instruction to the appropriate software.

'''MotionSupervisor''' acts as an interface between the Motion Control Loop,  the Orchestra GCode, the ControllerSupervisor and the Logical Control Loop. Using information from the ControllerSupervisor, it selects either automatic or jog mode. In jog mode, MotionSupervisor provides axes to moves, direction and feed rates. In automatic and in semiautomatic mode, instructions on movement will come from the G-Code interpreter. 
The MotionSupervisor also collects error messages coming from the MotionControl Loop and sends them to the ControllerSupervisor.

'''ControllerSupervisor''' centralizes all the information related to Orchestra Control Engine. It receives information from the HMI, the Teach Pendant and other software components. Such information is sorted to the other components even if direct channels of communication among the various components for the specific information interchange are foreseen.

ControllerSupervisor sends error messages to OrchestraHMI. Local errors are handled in the software components in which they take place. Errors beyond the local level are handled by the ControllerSupervisor instigating a safety procedure and or showing the error to the user.

;Orchestra for Open Robot Controllers

Orchestra for Open Robot Controllers allows the feasibility of innovative industrial robot algorithms to be tested. It can integrate advanced sensors and functions. Its interface with a personal computer is via OrchestraCore. Its function is generally one of realization of movement rather than the logic of control and the generation of trajectory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4938">'''Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember''' is a [[traveling exhibition]] that explores the [[history]] of [[disability]] within the lives of Canadians.

The exhibition was produced in collaboration with students, scholars and [[alumni]] from the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofu.ryerson.ca/about/index.html |title=Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember |publisher=Ryerson University |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition originated from a special topic seminar designed to uncover the hidden history of disability in Canada. Each student identified an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] to explore that represented a particular moment in Canadian disability history. Thirteen objects were then selected for the exhibition, revealing [[narratives]] that pay homage to the resilience, creativity, and the civic and cultural contributions of Canadians with disabilities. Accompanying interpretive texts help confront [[stereotypical]] representations of disability such as [[pity]], [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] or [[freak]], helping to illustrate the complexity of disability struggles for social and political acknowledgement, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], survival and remembrance.

Out from Under is curated by three [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members from Ryerson University’s School of [[Disability Studies]].

==Exhibition components==
Each objects’ history is represented by a single word title: Digging, Labouring, Dressing, Fixing, Measuring, Naming, Breathing, Remembering, Packing, Trailblazing, Struggling, Leading and Aspiring.

==Accessibility features==

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Peripatric speciation''' is a mode of [[speciation]] in which a new [[species]] is formed from an isolated peripheral population.&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation |author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author1link=Jerry Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr |author2link=H. Allen Orr |date=2004 |pages=1–545 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-091-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} Since peripatric speciation resembles [[allopatric speciation]], in that populations are isolated and prevented from [[Gene flow|exchanging genes]], it can often be difficult to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{Citation |title=Divergence at the edges: peripatric isolation in the montane spiny throated reed frog complex |author=Lucinda P. Lawson, John M Bates, Michele Menegon, &amp; Simon P. Loader |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |year=2015 |volume=15 |issue=128 |doi=10.1186/s12862-015-0384-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the primary characteristic of peripatric speciation proposes that one of the populations is much smaller than the other. The terms '''peripatric''' and '''peripatry''' are often used in [[biogeography]], referring to [[organism]]s whose ranges are closely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated where these organisms do not occur—for example on an [[oceanic island]] compared to the mainland. Such organisms are usually closely related (''e.g.'' [[sister species]]); their distribution being the result of peripatric speciation.

The concept of peripatric speciation was first outlined by the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Mayr1954"&gt;Ernst Mayr. (1954). Change of genetic environment and evolution. In J. Huxley, A. C. Hardy &amp; E. B. Ford. (eds) ''Evolution as a Process'', Unwin Brothers, London. Pp. 157–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other alternative models have been developed such as '''centrifugal speciation''', that posits that a species' population experiences periods of geographic [[range expansion]] followed by shrinking periods, leaving behind small isolated populations on the periphery of the main population. Other models have involved the effects of [[sexual selection]] on limited population sizes. Other related models of peripherally isolated populations based on chromosomal rearrangements have been developed such as '''budding speciation''' and '''quantum speciation'''.

The existence of peripatric speciation is supported by observational evidence and laboratory experiments.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106}} Scientists observing the patterns of a species biogeographic distribution and its [[phylogenetic]] relationships are able to reconstruct the historical process by which they [[Genetic divergence|diverged]]. Further, oceanic islands are often the subject of peripatric speciation research due to their isolated habitats—with the [[Hawaiian Islands]] widely represented in much of the scientific literature.

== History ==
{{main|History of speciation}}
Peripatric speciation was originally proposed by [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1954,&lt;ref name="Mayr1954"/&gt; and fully theoretically modeled in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr. (1982). Processes of speciation in animals. In A. R. I. Liss. (eds) ''Mechanisms of Speciation'', Alan R. Liss Inc., New York. Pp. 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[founder effect]], where small living populations may undergo selection bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. B. Provine |title=Ernst Mayr: Genetics and speciation |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/167/3/1041 |journal=Genetics |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=1041–6 |date=1 July 2004|pmid=15280221 |pmc=1470966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder effect is based on models that suggest peripatric speciation can occur by the interaction of selection and [[genetic drift]],&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106}} which may play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alan R. Templeton |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–38 |date=1 April 1980|pmid=6777243 |pmc=1214177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr first conceived of the idea by his observations of [[kingfisher]] populations in New Guinea and its surrounding islands.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} ''[[Common paradise kingfisher|Tanysiptera galatea]]'' was largely uniform in morphology on the mainland, but the populations on the surrounding islands differed significantly—referring to this pattern as "peripatric".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} This same pattern was observed by many of Mayr's contemporaries at the time such as by [[E. B. Ford|E. B. Ford's]] studies of ''[[Maniola jurtina]]''.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"&gt;{{Citation | title=Animal Species and Evolution | edition= | author=Ernst Mayr | date=1963 | pages=1–797 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|522}} Around the same time, the botanist [[Verne Grant]] developed a model of quantum speciation very similar to Mayr's model in the context of plants.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"/&gt;

In what has been called Mayr's genetic revolutions, he postulated that genetic drift played the primary role that resulted in this pattern.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} Seeing that a species cohesion is maintained by conservative forces such as [[epistasis]] and the slow pace of the spread of favorable alleles in a large population (based heavily on [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s calculations), he reasoned that speciation could only take place in which a [[population bottleneck]] occurred.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} A small, isolated, founder population could be established on an island for example. Containing less genetic variation from the main population, shifts in allele frequencies may occur from different selection pressures.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|390}} This to further changes in the network of linked loci, driving a cascade of genetic change, or a "genetic revolution"—a large-scale reorganization of the entire genome of the peripheral population.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|391}} Mayr did recognize that the chances of success were incredibly low and that extinction was likely; though noting that some examples of successful founder populations existed at the time.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|522}}

Shortly after Mayr, William Louis Brown, Jr. proposed an alternative model of peripatric speciation in 1957 called centrifugal speciation. In 1976 and 1980, the Kaneshiro model of peripatric speciation was developed by [[Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro]] which focused on sexual selection as a driver for speciation during population bottlenecks.&lt;ref name=KYK1976&gt;{{Citation |title=Ethological isolation and phylogeny in the Plantibia subgroup of Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' |author=Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro |journal=Evolution |year=1976 |volume=30 |issue= 4 |pages=740–745 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1976.tb00954.x |pmid=28563322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KYK1980&gt;{{Citation |title=Sexual selection, speciation and the direction of evolution |author=Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro |journal=Evolution |year=1980 |volume=34 |issue= 3|pages=437–444 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1980.tb04833.x| pmid=28568697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AO&amp;ABF2002&gt;{{Citation |title=Sexual selection and peripatric speciation: the Kaneshiro model revisited |author=Anders Ödeen &amp; Ann-Britt Florin |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |year=2002 |volume=15 |issue= |pages=301–306 |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00378.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==
=== Peripatric ===
Peripatric speciation models are identical to models of [[vicariance]] (allopatric speciation).&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}} Requiring both geographic separation and time, speciation can result as a predictable byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Theory and speciation |author=Michael Turelli, Nicholas H. Barton, &amp; Jerry A. Coyne |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |year=2001 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=330–343 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peripatry can be distinguished from allopatric speciation by three key features:&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}}
*The size of the isolated population
*Strong [[Natural selection|selection]] caused by the dispersal and colonization of novel environments, 
*The effects of [[genetic drift]] on small populations.

The size of a population is important because individuals colonizing a new habitat likely contain only a small sample of the genetic variation of the original population. This promotes divergence due to strong selective pressures, leading to the rapid [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] of an [[allele]] within the descendant population. This gives rise to the potential for genetic incompatibilities to [[evolution|evolve]]. These incompatibilities cause [[reproductive isolation]], giving rise to—sometimes rapid—speciation events.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}} Furthermore, two important predictions are invoked, namely that geological or climactic changes cause populations to become locally fragmented (or regionally when considering allopatric speciation), and that an isolated population's reproductive traits evolve enough as to prevent interbreeding upon potential [[secondary contact]].&lt;ref name="ST2007"&gt;{{Citation |title=Song divergence at the edge of Amazonia: an empirical test of the peripatric speciation model |author=Nathalie Seddon &amp; Joseph A. Tobias |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |year=2007 |volume=90 |pages=173–188 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00753.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peripatric model results in, what have been called, progenitor-derivative species pairs, whereby the derivative species (the peripherally isolated population)—geographically and genetically isolated from the progenitor species—diverges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Progenitor-derivative species pairs and plant speciation |author=Daniel J. Crawford |journal=Taxon |year=2010 |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1413–1423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] signature results from this mode of speciation: the geographically widespread progenitor species becomes [[paraphyletic]] (thereby becoming a [[paraspecies]]), with respect to the derivative species (the peripheral isolate).&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|470}} The concept of a paraspecies is therefore a logical consequence of the [[Species#Evolutionary species|evolutionary species concept]], by which one species gives rise to a daughter species.&lt;ref name="AlbertReis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Albert &amp; Roberto E. Reis |title=Historical Biogeography of Neotropical Freshwater Fishes |url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8kZeHxkv9oC&amp;pg=PA316 |isbn=978-0-520-26868-5 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the character traits of the peripherally isolated species become [[Symplesiomorphy|apomorphic]], while the central population remains [[Symplesiomorphy|pleisomorphic]].&lt;ref name="JKFrey"&gt;{{Citation |title=Modes of Peripheral Isolate Formation and Speciation |author=Jennifer K. Frey |journal=Systematic Biology |year=1993 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=373–381 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.3.373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cladistic methods have developed definitions that have incidentally removed derivative species by defining clades in a way that assumes that when a speciation event occurs, the original species no longer exists, while two new species arise; this is not the case in peripatric speciation.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"/&gt; Mayr warned against this, as it causes a species to lose their classification status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A local flora and the biological species concept |author=Ernst Mayr |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1992 |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=222–238 |doi=10.2307/2445111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loren H. Rieseberg and Luc Brouillet recognized the same dilemma in plant classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Are many plant species paraphyletic? |author=Loren H. Rieseberg and Luc Brouillet |journal=Taxon |year=1994 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=21–32 |doi=10.2307/1223457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum and budding speciation ===
The botanist Verne Grant proposed the term quantum speciation that combined the ideas of [[J. T. Gulick]] (his observation of the variation of species in semi-isolation), [[Sewall Wright]] (his models of genetic drift), Mayr (both his peripatric and genetic revolution models), and [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (his development of the idea of [[quantum evolution]]).&lt;ref name="Grant1971"&gt;{{Citation|title=Plant Speciation |author=Verne Grant |date=1971 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0231083262 |pages=432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} Quantum speciation is a rapid process with large genotypic or phenotypic effects, whereby a new, cross-fertilizing plant species buds off from a larger population as a semi-isolated peripheral population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Speciational trends and the role of species in macroevolution |author=Douglas J. Futuyma |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1989 |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=318–321 |doi=10.1086/284983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant1971"/&gt;{{rp|114}} Interbreeding and genetic drift takes place due to the reduced population size, driving changes to the genome that would most likely result in extinction (due to low adaptive value).&lt;ref name="Grant1971"/&gt;{{rp|115}} In rare instances, chromosomal traits with adaptive value may arise, resulting in the origin of a new, derivative species.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"&gt;{{Citation|title=Rethinking classic examples of recent speciation in plants |author=L. D. Gottlieb |journal=New Phytologist |year=2003 |volume=161 |issue= |pages=71–82 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00922.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chromosomal rearrangements and speciation |author=Loren H. Rieseberg |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |year=2001 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=351–358 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the occurrence of this type of speciation has been found in several plant species pairs: ''[[Layia discoidea]]'' and ''[[Layia glandulosa|L. glandulosa]]'', ''[[Clarkia lingulata]]'' and ''[[Clarkia biloba|C. biloba]]'', and ''[[Stephanomeria malheurensis]]'' and ''S. exigua'' ssp. ''coronaria''.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"/&gt;

A closely related model of peripatric speciation is called budding speciation—largely applied in the context of plant speciation.&lt;ref name="Anacker&amp;Strauss2013"&gt;{{Citation|title=The geography and ecology of plant speciation: range overlap and niche divergence in sister species |author=Brian L. Anacker and Sharon Y. Strauss |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year=2013 |volume=281 |issue=1778 |pages= |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2980 |pmc=3906944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding process, where a new species originates at the margins of an ancestral range, is thought to be common in plants&lt;ref name="Anacker&amp;Strauss2013"/&gt;—especially in progenitor-derivative species pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Progenitor-derivative species pairs and plant speciation |author=Daniel J. Crawford |journal=Taxon |year=2010 |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1413–1423 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centrifugal speciation ===
William Louis Brown, Jr. proposed an alternative model of peripatric speciation in 1957 called centrifugal speciation. This model contrasts with peripatric speciation by virtue of the origin of the genetic novelty that leads to reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets"&gt;{{Citation |title=Patterns of Parapatric Speciation |author=Sergey Gavrilets, Hai Li, &amp; Michael D. Vose |journal=Evolution |year=2000 |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=1126–1134 |doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1126:pops]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A population of a species experiences periods of geographic range expansion followed by periods of contraction. During the contraction phase, fragments of the population become isolated as small [[Refugium (population biology)|refugial]] populations on the periphery of the central population. Because of the large size and potentially greater genetic variation within the central population, [[mutation]]s arise more readily. These mutations are left in the isolated peripheral populations, whereby, promoting reproductive isolation. Consequently, Brown suggested that during another expansion phase, the central population would overwhelm the peripheral populations, hindering speciation. However, if the species finds a specialized ecological niche, the two may coexist.&lt;ref name="DJH"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daniel J.

== Evidence ==
{{see also|Allopatric speciation#Observational evidence}}
Observational evidence and laboratory experiments support the occurrence of peripatric speciation. [[Island]]s and [[archipelago]]s are often the subject of speciation studies in that they represent isolated populations of organisms. Island species provide direct evidence of speciation occurring peripatrically in such that, "the presence of [[endemism|endemic]] species on oceanic islands whose closest relatives inhabit a nearby [[continent]]" must have originated by a colonization event.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106–107}} Comparative [[phylogeography]] of oceanic [[archipelago]]s shows consistent patterns of sequential colonization and speciation along island chains, most notably on the [[Azores]] islands, [[Canary Islands]], [[Society Islands]], [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Austral Islands]], and the Hawaiian Islands—all of which express geological patterns of spatial isolation and, in some cases, linear arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Comparative phylogeography of oceanic archipelagos: Hotspots for inferences of evolutionary process |author=Kerry L.

Laboratory studies have been conducted where populations of ''[[Drosophila]]'', for example, are separated from one another and evolve in reproductive isolation.

The occurrence of peripatry on continents is more difficult to detect due to the possibility of vicariant explanations being equally likely.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|110}} However, studies concerning the Californian plant species ''[[Clarkia]] biloba'' and ''C. biloba'' strongly suggest a peripatric origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The origin of ''Clarkia lingulata''|author=H.

The montane spiny throated reed frog [[species complex]] (genus: ''[[Hyperolius]]'') originated through occurrences of peripatric speciation events. Lucinda P.

Using a phylogeographic approach paired with [[Environmental niche modelling|ecological niche models]] (''i.e.'' prediction and identification of expansion and contraction species ranges into suitable habitats based on current [[ecological niche]]s, correlated with fossil and molecular data), researchers found that the [[prairie dog]] species ''[[Cynomys mexicanus]]'' speciated peripatrically from ''[[Cynomys ludovicianus]]'' approximately 230,000 years ago. North American glacial cycles promoted range expansion and contraction of the prairie dogs, leading to the isolation of a relic population in a [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] located in the present day [[Coahuila]], Mexico.&lt;ref name=GCM2016&gt;{{Citation |title=Peripatric speciation of an endemic species driven by Pleistocene climate change: The case of the Mexican prairie dog (''Cynomys mexicanus'') |author=Gabriela Castellanos-Morales, Niza Gámez, Reyna A.

Peripatric speciation has been researched in both laboratory studies and nature. [[Jerry Coyne]] and [[H. Allen Orr]] in ''Speciation'' suggest that most laboratory studies of allopatric speciation are also examples of peripatric speciation due to their small population sizes and the inevitable divergent selection that they undergo.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106}} Much of the laboratory research concerning peripatry is inextricably linked to [[founder effect]] research. Coyne and Orr conclude that selection's role in speciation is well established, whereas [[genetic drift]]'s role is unsupported by experimental and field data—suggesting that founder-effect speciation does not occur.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|410}} Nevertheless, a great deal of research has been conducted on the matter, and one study conducted involving [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] populations of ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'' found evidence of isolation after a single bottleneck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Founder-Flush Speciation Theory: An Experimental Approach| author=Jeffrey R. Powell |journal=Evolution |year=1978 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=465–474 |pmid=28567948|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1978.tb04589.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Founder-Flush Speciation: An Update of Experimental Results with ''Drosophila''|author=Diane M.

The table is a non-exhaustive table of laboratory experiments focused explicitly on peripatric speciation. Most of the studies also conducted experiments on vicariant speciation as well. The "replicates" column signifies the number of lines used in the experiment—that is, how many independent populations were used (not the population size or the number of generations performed).&lt;ref name=AO&amp;ABF2002/&gt;

Note that layout for a [[Operations management#Production systems|production system]] reflects a conceived organisation of resources to achieve a certain goal, besides satisfying certain space constraints.|alt=Model of typical plant layout]]

In [[manufacturing engineering]], '''process layout''' is a design for the floor [[plan]] of a plant which aims to improve [[efficiency]] by arranging equipment according to its function.&lt;ref&gt;Mikell P. Groover (2007). ''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production line should ideally be designed to eliminate waste in material flows, inventory handling and management.&lt;ref&gt;Shigeo Shingo(1985). "A revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System". Productivity Press. {{ISBN|0-915299-03-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In process layout, the work stations and machinery are not arranged according to a particular production sequence. Instead, there is an assembly of similar operations or similar machinery in each department (for example, a drill department, a paint department, etc.)

== Main advantages ==
# Provide visual control of activities
# Use space efficiently
# Use labour efficiently
# Eliminate bottlenecks
# Facilitate communication and interaction  between workers and supervisors

== Criticism ==
A common criticism of this layout is that the work can be monotonous for staff, especially if they are involved only in one stage of the process.
This criticism can however be eliminated if the staff are rotated to different departments (involving different processes) thus developing a multi-skilled body of staff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Rational analysis''' is a theoretical framework, methodology, and research program in [[cognitive science]] that has been developed by [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]].&lt;ref name="anderson91"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=J. R. |year=1991 |title=Is human cognition adaptive? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=14 |pages=471–517 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00070801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson90"&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990). "The adaptive character of thought". Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of rational analysis as a research program is to explain the function and purpose of [[cognitive processes]] and to discover the structure of the mind. Chater and Oaksford contrast it with the [[Mechanical philosophy#Mechanism and determinism|mechanistic]] explanations of cognition offered by both [[Cognitive model|computational model]]s and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="chater99"/&gt;

Rational analysis starts from the assumption that the mind is adapted to its environment. Rational analysis uses this assumption to investigate the structure and purpose of [[representations]] and [[cognitive processes]] by studying the structure of the environment. The methodology of rational analysis comprises six steps:&lt;ref name="anderson91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chater99"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chater |first1=N. |last2=Oaksford |first2=M. |year=1999 |title=Ten years of the rational analysis of cognition |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |number=2 |pages=57–65 |url=http://www.dectech.co.uk/publications/LinksNick/FoundationsTheoryAndMethodology/ten%20years%20of%20the%20rational%20analysis%20of%20cognition.pdf |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(98)01273-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Goals: Specify precisely the goals of the cognitive system.
#Environment: Develop a formal model of the environment to which the system is adapted.
#Computational Limitations: Make the minimal assumptions about computational limitations.
#Optimization: Derive the optimal behavioral function given 1-3 above. 
#Data: Examine the empirical literature to see whether the predictions of the behavioral function are confirmed.
#Iteration: Repeat, iteratively refining the theory

Rational analysis has been applied to memory, categorization, causal inference, problem solving,&lt;ref name="anderson90"/&gt; and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oaksford | first1 = M. | last2 = Chater | first2 = N. | year = 1994 | title = A rational analysis of the selection task as optimal data selection | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 101 | issue = 4| pages = 608–631 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.101.4.608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revisionary materialism''' is the view that falls between [[eliminative materialism]] and [[reductive materialism]] when it comes to a particular psychological phenomenon.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/#SpeProFolPsy, | title=Eliminative Materialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Take, for example, debates over the reality of a psychological concept like "[[demonology]]" – the posit that evil spirits influence human behaviour. An eliminativist might argue that this theory completely fails to describe anything real; the reductionist might argue that the concepts are valid, and that science will simply provide an increasingly detailed understanding of the demons. The revisionist would be somewhere in between, suggesting only that ''partial'' revision of the common sense understanding will be necessary. That is, parts of the demon theory will be validated by future research.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"/&gt;

Today, one is likely to be eliminativist about demons. However, eliminative materialists mention other psychological concepts (e.g. belief, will, consciousness) about which one is more likely to be revisionist.

Unlike strong eliminative materialism, the revisionist often claims that a theory or concept is only ''partially'' incorrect, perhaps because it ignores a few important causal factors.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"/&gt;

Largely viewed as a negative process, the barrier effect has also been found to have several positive effects, particularly with smaller species.&lt;ref name="positive-effects"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Downing |first1=R.J. |last2=Rytwinski |first2=T |last3=Fahrig |first3=L |date=2015 |title= Positive effects of roads on small mammals: a test of the predation release hypothesis |url= |journal=Ecological Research |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=651-662 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce a road or railway's barrier effect, [[wildlife crossings]] are regarded as one of the best mitigation options, ideally in combination with wildlife fencing.&lt;ref name="positive-effects"/&gt; The barrier effect is closely linked to [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[road ecology]].

==Effects on wildlife==

===Negative effects===

====Roads====
Both existing roads and the construction of new highways act as barriers for many species, fragmenting the surrounding habitat to such a degree that connectivity, or the ability for an animal to travel to all areas of its home range, is made practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupras |first1=J |last2=Marull |first2=J |last3=Parcerisas |first3=L |last4=Coll |first4=F |last5=Gonzalez |first5=A |last6=Girard |first6=M |last7=Tello |first7=E |date=2016 |title= The impacts of urban sprawl on ecological connectivity in the Montreal Metropolitan Region |url= |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy |volume=58 |issue= |pages=61-73 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, animals with a higher [[vagility]], or ability to travel long distances, are more severely impacted by roads compared to species with smaller home ranges.

====Railways====
While very few studies have analyzed the effect of railways on animal movement, their presence across landscapes in most areas of the world suggests that they likely pose a significant barrier for many species. Most studies relating to this sub-field focus on animal use of [[culverts|drainage culverts]] underneath railway networks. For example, Rodriguez et al. (1996) found that nearly 80% of culverts in their study received visits by both [[mammals]] and [[reptiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Rodriguez |first1=A |last2= Crema |first2=G |last3=Delibes |first3=M|date=1996 |title= Use of non-wildlife passages across a high speed railway by terrestrial vertebrates |url= |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume= |issue= |pages=1527-1540 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land-use types====
Although few studies have analyzed the effect of land type on animal movement, those that exist have found man-made clearings and agricultural land to be strong barriers for many species who may only travel within forested landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurance |first1=W.F. |last2=Lovejoy |first2=T.E. |last3=Vasconcelos |first3=H.L. |last4=Bruna |first4=E.M. |last5=Didham |first5=R.K. |last6=Stouffer |first6=P.C. |last7=Gascon |first7=C |last8=Bierregaard |first8=R |last9=Laurence |first9=S.G. |last10=Sampaio |first10=E |date=2002 |title= Ecosystem decay of Amazonian forest fragments: a 22‐year investigation |url= |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=16 |issue= 3|pages=605-618 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive effects===
12% of studies analyzing the effects of roads on animals have found positive effects, indicating that some species benefit from the presence of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fahrig |first1=L |last2= Rytwinski |first2=T |date=2009 |title= Effects of roads on animal abundance: an empirical review and synthesis |url= |journal=Ecology and Society |volume=14 |issue= 1|pages=21 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[predation release hypothesis]], suggesting that roads may indirectly cause increases in abundances of animals whose predators are negatively affected by road,&lt;ref name="positive-effects"/&gt; is often attributed to most positive effects of roads on animals. 

==Mitigation measures==

===Driver behavior===
Studies have found that reducing the speed at which drivers travel along the road produces less noise, potentially reducing the road's barrier effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Langevelde |first1=F |last2= van Dooremalen |first2=C |last3=Jaarsma |first3=C.F.|date=2009 |title= Traffic mortality and the role of minor roads |url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=90 |issue= 1|pages=660-667 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in noise coming from the highway is assumed to make the road surface less intimidating for animals, potentially allowing crossings to take place. This increase in crossings, however, may result in a subsequent increase in animal-vehicle collisions.

===Animal movement===
Wildlife crossings, such as wildlife overpasses or underpasses, are generally seen as the most effective mitigation measure to help make roads more passable for wildlife while increasing both driver and animal safety. To funnel wildlife towards these crossings, many studies have called for a combination of both wildlife crossings and exclusion fencing, making the crossings under or over the road the only available path for wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olsson |first1=M.P. |last2= Widen |first2=P |date=2008 |title= Effects of highway fencing and wildlife crossings on moose Alces alces movements and space use in southwestern Sweden |url= |journal=Wildlife Biology |volume=14 |issue= 1|pages=111-117 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yanes |first1=M |last2= Velasco |first2=J.M. |last3= Suarez |first3=F |date=1995 |title= Permeability of roads and railways to vertebrates: the importance of culverts |url= |journal=Biological conservation |volume=73 |issue= 3|pages=217-222 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a combination of both wildlife crossings and suitable lengths of fencing, the barrier effect of roads is expected to decrease, allowing animals to access both sides of the road and therefore allowing for important life cycle  processes including migration and mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beben|first1=D |date=2012 |title= Crossings for animals–an effective method of wild fauna conservation |url= |journal=Journal of environmental engineering and landscape management |volume=20 |issue= 1|pages=86-96 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seismic tomography''' is a technique for imaging the subsurface of the Earth with seismic waves produced by earthquakes or explosions. [[P-wave|P-]], [[S-wave|S-]], and surface waves can be used for tomographic models of different resolutions based on seismic wavelength, wave source distance, and the seismograph array coverage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-3899-1_1|title=Seismic wave propagation and seismic tomography|last=Nolet|first=G.|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789027725837|editor-last=Nolet|editor-first=Guust|series=Seismology and Exploration Geophysics|pages=1–23|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-3899-1_1#page-1|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data received at seismometers are used to solve an inverse problem, wherein the locations of reflection and refraction of the wave paths are determined. This solution can be used to create 3D images of velocity anomalies which may be interpreted as structural, thermal, or compositional variations. [[Earth science|Geoscientists]] use these images to better understand core, mantle, and [[Plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] processes.

==Theory==
Tomography is solved as an [[inverse problem]]. Seismic travel time data are compared to an initial Earth model and the model is modified until the best possible fit between the model predictions and observed data is found. Seismic waves would travel in straight lines if Earth was of uniform composition, but the compositional layering, tectonic structure, and thermal variations reflect and refract [[seismic wave]]s. The location and magnitude of these variations can be calculated by the inversion process, although solutions to tomographic inversions are non-unique.

Seismic tomography is similar to medical x-ray [[Computed Tomography|computed tomography]] (CT scan) in that a computer processes receiver data to produce a 3D image, although CT scans use attenuation instead of traveltime difference. Seismic tomography has to deal with the analysis of curved ray paths which are reflected and refracted within the earth and potential uncertainty in the location of the earthquake [[hypocenter]]. CT scans use linear x-rays and a known source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/downloads/optional/269|title=Seismic Tomography—Using earthquakes to image Earth's interior|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seismic tomography requires large datasets of [[seismogram]]s and well-located earthquake or explosion sources. These became more widely available in the 1960s with the expansion of global seismic networks and in the 1970s when digital seismograph data archives were established. These developments occurred concurrently with advancements in computing power that were required to solve inverse problems and generate theoretical seismograms for model testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/workshops/thailand/downloads/CSMpp1_History.pdf|title=A Brief History of Seismology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United States Geologic Survey (USGS)|access-date=4 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803190244/https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/workshops/thailand/downloads/CSMpp1_History.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, P-wave delay times were used to create the first seismic array-scale 2D map of seismic velocity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JBF8UGc_M-sC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=global+tectonics+kearey+and+vine#v=onepage&amp;q=global%2520tectonics%2520kearey%2520and%2520vine&amp;f=false|title=Global Tectonics|last=Kearey|first=Philip|last2=Klepeis|first2=Keith A.|last3=Vine|first3=Frederick J.|date=2013-05-28|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1118688083|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, P-wave data were used to determine 150 [[Spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic]] coefficients for velocity anomalies in the mantle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first model using iterative techniques, required when there are a large numbers of unknowns, was done in 1984.

== Process ==
Seismic tomography uses seismic records to create 2D and 3D images of subsurface anomalies by solving large inverse problems such that generate models consistent with observed data. Various methods are used to resolve anomalies in the crust and lithosphere, shallow mantle, whole mantle, and core based on the availability of data and types of seismic waves that penetrate the region at a suitable wavelength for feature resolution. The accuracy of the model is limited by availability and accuracy of seismic data, wave type utilized, and assumptions made in the model.

P-wave data are used in most local models and global models in areas with sufficient earthquake and seismograph density. S- and surface wave data are used in global models when this coverage is not sufficient, such as in ocean basins and away from subduction zones. First-arrival times are the most widely used, but models utilizing [[Seismic wave#Notation|reflected and refracted phases]] are used in more complex models, such as those imaging the core. Differential traveltimes between wave phases or types are also used.

=== Local tomography ===
Local tomographic models are often based on  a temporary seismic array targeting specific areas, unless in a seismically active region with extensive permanent network coverage. These allow for the imaging of the crust and upper mantle. 
* ''Diffraction and wave equation tomography'' use the full waveform, rather than just the first arrival times. The inversion of amplitude and phases of all arrivals provide more detailed density information than transmission traveltime alone. Despite the theoretical appeal, these methods are not widely employed because of the computing expense and difficult inversions.
* ''Reflection tomography'' originated with [[exploration geophysics]]. It uses an artificial source to resolve small-scale features at crustal depths. ''Wide-angle tomography'' is similar, but with a wide source to receiver offset. This allows for the detection of seismic waves refracted from sub-crustal depths and can determine continental architecture and details of plate margins. These two methods are often used together.
* ''Local earthquake tomography'' is used in seismically active regions with sufficient seismometer coverage. Given the proximity between source and receivers, a precise earthquake focus location must be known. This requires the simultaneous iteration of both structure and focus locations in model calculations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* ''Teleseismic tomography'' uses waves from distant earthquakes that deflect upwards to a local seismic array. The models can reach depths similar to the array aperture, typically to depths for imaging the crust and lithosphere (a few hundred kilometers). The waves travel near 30° from vertical, creating a vertical distortion to compact features.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebpagePDFs/Seismology.pdf|title=Seismology: The Hunt for Plumes|last=Julian|first=Bruce|date=2006|website=|publisher=mantleplumes.org|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional or global tomography ===
[[File:FarallonTomoSlice.png|thumb|267x267px|Simplified and interpreted P- and S-wave velocity variations in the mantle across southern North America showing the subducted Farallon Plate.]]
Regional to global scale tomographic models are generally based on long wavelengths. Various models have better agreement with each other than local models due to the large feature size they image, such as [[Subduction|subducted slabs]] and [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces|superplumes]]. The trade off from whole mantle to whole earth coverage is the coarse resolution (hundreds of kilometers) and difficulty imaging small features (e.g. narrow plumes). Although often used to image different parts of the subsurface, P- and S-wave derived models broadly agree where there is image overlap. These models use data from both permanent seismic stations and supplementary temporary arrays. 
* First arrival traveltime ''P-wave'' data are used to generate the highest resolution tomographic images of the mantle. These models are limited to regions with sufficient seismograph coverage and earthquake density, therefore cannot be used for areas such as inactive plate interiors and ocean basins without seismic networks. Other phases of P-waves are used to image the deeper mantle and core.
* In areas with limited [[seismograph]] or earthquake coverage, multiple phases of ''S-waves'' can be used for tomographic models. These are of lower resolution than P-wave models, due to the distances involved and fewer bounce-phase data available. S-waves can also be used in conjunction with P-waves for differential arrival time models.
* ''Surface waves'' can be used for tomography of the crust and upper mantle where no body wave (P and S) data are available. Both Rayleigh and Love waves can be used. The low frequency waves lead to low resolution models, therefore these models have difficulty with crustal structure. ''Free oscillations'', or normal mode [[seismology]], are the long wavelength, low frequency movements of the surface of the earth which can be thought of as a type of surface wave. The frequencies of these oscillations can be obtained through [[Fourier transform]]ation of seismic data. The models based on this method are of broad scale, but have the advantage of relatively uniform data coverage as compared to data sourced directly from earthquakes. 
* ''[[Attenuation]] tomography'' attempts to extract the anaelastic signal from the elastic-dominated waveform of seismic waves. The advantage of this method is its sensitivity to temperature, thus ability to image thermal features such as mantle plumes and subduction zones. Both surface and body waves have been used in this approach. 
* ''Ambient noise tomography'' cross-correlates waveforms from random wavefields generated by oceanic and atmospheric disturbances. A major advantage of this method is that unlike other methods, it does not require an earthquake or other event to occur in order to produce results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=N. M. |title=High-Resolution Surface-Wave Tomography from Ambient Seismic Noise |journal=Science |date=11 March 2005 |volume=307 |issue=5715 |pages=1615–1618 |doi=10.1126/science.1108339|pmid=15761151 |bibcode=2005Sci...307.1615S |citeseerx=10.1.1.399.6167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. A disadvantage of the method is that it requires a significant amount of time, usually a minimum of one year but several years of data collection are also common. This method has produced high-resolution images and is an area of active research. 
* [[Waveform]]s are modeled as rays in seismic analysis, but all waves are affected by the material near the [[Banana Doughnut theory|ray path.]] The finite frequency effect is the result the surrounding medium has on a seismic record. ''Finite frequency tomography'' accounts for this in determining both travel time and amplitude anomalies, increasing image resolution. This has the ability to resolve much larger variations (i.e. 10–30%) in material properties.

==Applications==
Seismic tomography can resolve anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound density.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Variations in these parameters may be a result of thermal or chemical differences, which are attributed to processes such as mantle plumes, subducting slabs, and mineral phase changes. Larger scale features that can be imaged with tomography include the high velocities beneath [[Shield (geology)|continental shields]] and low velocities under [[Mid-ocean ridge|ocean spreading centers]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Hotspots ===
[[File:Cartoon of African LLSVP.jpg|thumb|235x235px|The African large low-shear-velocity province (superplume)]]
The mantle plume hypothesis proposes that areas of volcanism not readily explained by plate tectonics, called [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], are a result of thermal upwelling from as deep as the core-mantle boundary that become [[diapir]]s in the crust. This is an actively contested theory,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; although tomographic images suggest there are anomalies beneath some hotspots. The best imaged of these are large low-shear-velocity provinces, or superplumes, visible on S-wave models of the lower mantle and believed to reflect both thermal and compositional differences.

The [[Yellowstone hotspot]] is responsible for volcanism at the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] and a series of extinct calderas along the [[Snake River Plain]]. The Yellowstone Geodynamic Project sought to image the plume beneath the hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert B.|last2=Jordan|first2=Michael|last3=Steinberger|first3=Bernhard|last4=Puskas|first4=Christine M.|last5=Farrell|first5=Jamie|last6=Waite|first6=Gregory P.|last7=Husen|first7=Stephan|last8=Chang|first8=Wu-Lung|last9=O'Connell|first9=Richard|date=2009-11-20|title=Geodynamics of the Yellowstone hotspot and mantle plume: Seismic and GPS imaging, kinematics, and mantle flow|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027309003308|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|series=The Track of the Yellowstone HotspotWhat do Neotectonics, Climate Indicators, Volcanism, and Petrogenesis Reveal about Subsurface Processes?|volume=188|issue=1–3|pages=26–56|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2009.08.020|bibcode=2009JVGR..188...26S}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a strong low-velocity body from ~30 to 250&amp;nbsp;km depth beneath Yellowstone and a weaker anomaly from 250 to 650&amp;nbsp;km depth which dipped 60° west-northwest. The authors attribute these features to the mantle plume beneath the hotspot being deflected eastward by flow in the upper mantle seen in S-wave models.

The [[Hawaii hotspot]] produced the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]. Tomographic images show it to be 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;km wide and up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;km deep.

=== Subduction zones ===
Subducting plates are colder than the mantle into which they are moving. This creates a fast anomaly that is visible in tomographic images. Both the [[Farallon Plate|Farallon plate]] that subducted beneath the west coast of North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/programs/education_and_outreach/lessons_and_resources/docs/es_tomography.pdf|title=Seismic Tomography|last=|first=|date=|website=earthscope.org|publisher=Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the northern portion of the [[Indian Plate|Indian plate]] that has subducted beneath Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Replumaz|first=Anne|last2=Negredo|first2=Ana M.|last3=Guillot|first3=Stéphane|last4=Villaseñor|first4=Antonio|date=2010-03-01|title=Multiple episodes of continental subduction during India/Asia convergence: Insight from seismic tomography and tectonic reconstruction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195109005666|journal=Tectonophysics|series=Convergent plate margin dynamics: New perspectives from structural geology, geophysics and geodynamic modelling|volume=483|issue=1–2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2009.10.007|bibcode=2010Tectp.483..125R}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been imaged with tomography.

==Limitations==
Global seismic networks have expanded steadily since the 1960s, but are still concentrated on continents and in seismically active regions. Oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere, are under-covered.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Tomographic models in these areas will improve when more data becomes available. The uneven distribution of earthquakes naturally biases models to better resolution in seismically active regions.

The type of wave used in a model limits the resolution it can achieve. Longer wavelengths are able to penetrate deeper into the earth, but can only be used to resolve large features. Finer resolution can be achieved with surface waves, with the trade off that they cannot be used in models of the deep mantle. The disparity between wavelength and feature scale causes anomalies to appear of reduced magnitude and size in images. P- and S-wave models respond differently to the types of anomalies depending on the driving material property. First arrival time based models naturally prefer faster pathways, causing models based on these data to have lower resolution of slow (often hot) features.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Shallow models must also consider the significant lateral velocity variations in continental crust.

Seismic tomography provides only the current velocity anomalies. Any prior structures are unknown and the slow rates of movement in the subsurface (mm to cm per year) prohibit resolution of changes over modern timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Penrose/PenPDFAbstracts/Dziewonski_Adam_abs.pdf|title=Global Seismic Tomography: What we really can say and what we make up|last=Dziewonski|first=Adam|date=|website=|publisher=mantleplumes.org|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomographic solutions are non-unique. Although statistical methods can be used to analyze the validity of a model, unresolvable uncertainty remains.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This contributes to difficulty comparing the validity of different model results.

Computing power limits the amount of seismic data, number of unknowns, mesh size, and iterations in tomographic models. This is of particular importance in ocean basins, which due to limited network coverage and earthquake density require more complex processing of distant data. Shallow oceanic models also require smaller model mesh size due to the thinner crust.&lt;ref name="Liu 31–66"/&gt;

Tomographic images are typically presented with a color ramp representing the strength of the anomalies. This has the consequence of making equal changes appear of differing magnitude based on visual perceptions of color, such as the change from orange to red being more subtle than blue to yellow. The degree of color saturation can also visually skew interpretations. These factors should be considered when analyzing images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited''''' is an academic anthology edited by the British archaeologists [[Martin Carver]], Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple which was first published by Oxbow Books in 2010. Containing nine separate papers produced by various scholars working in the fields of [[Anglo-Saxon archaeology]] and [[Anglo-Saxon history]], the book presents a number of new perspectives on [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] and, to a lesser extent, early [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]]. The collection &amp;ndash; published in honour of the archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]] &amp;ndash; was put together on the basis of a conference on "Paganism and Popular Practice" held at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2005.

Opening with a foreword by [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], the book's first paper, written by Carver, examines how archaeologists can best understand Anglo-Saxon paganism, drawing from the works of Price and [[David Lewis-Williams]] in order to do so. The second, written by Semple, looks at how pagan Anglo-Saxons viewed their surrounding landscape, whilst the third, written by Julie Lund, delves into Anglo-Saxon votive depositions into water. The fourth paper, authored by [[Howard Williams (archaeologist)|Howard Williams]], looks at funerary practices, which is followed by Jenny Walker's study on the religious aspects of the hall.

The sixth paper, produced by [[Aleks Pluskowski]], delves into the roles of animals in Anglo-Saxon belief, while Chris Fern's following paper focuses on the role of the horse. The eighth paper, written by Sanmark, looks at conceptions of ancestors and the soul, while the ninth, co-authored by Sue Content and Howard Williams, looks at the subsequent understandings of Anglo-Saxon pagandom. In the afterword, written by historian [[Ronald Hutton]], the findings of the book are summarised and potential areas of future research highlighted.

The book received a mixed review in Charlotte Behr's review for the journal ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'', and a positive one from Chris Scull in the ''British Archaeology'' magazine. It was praised by others looking at the field of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as [[Stephen Pollington]].

==Background==

The origins for ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' came from a conference held in 2005 at the [[University of Oxford]]; based around the subject of "Paganism and Popular Practice", it had been organised by Sarah Semple and Alex Sanmark, two archaeologists who would go on to edit the volume. The decision to produce a book based on the papers presented at that conference gained a "renewed impetus" after two further academic conferences were held by the [[Sutton Hoo Society]], on the subjects of paganism and Anglo-Saxon halls respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection was published in honour of the archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]], "in appreciation of her studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010]]. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword, archaeologist Neil Price commented on Meaney and her influential work, noting that most of the published studies that had previously delved into the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism came from her "monumental output", and that it was her "years spent patiently excavating Anglo-Saxon attitudes this collection honours."&lt;ref name="Price xiv"/&gt;

Previous understandings of the topic, well rooted in the ideas of its time, regarded the English as adherents of two consecutive religions: Paganism governed the settlers of the 4th&amp;ndash;6th century, but was superseded in the 7th&amp;ndash;10th century by Christianity. Of the two, Christianity, a religion of the book, documented itself thoroughly, while in failing to do so Paganism laid itself open to centuries of abuse, conjecture or mindless admiration."

}}
In the book's preface, written by Martin Carver, Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple, the anthology's three objectives are laid out. The first of these is to establish that Anglo-Saxon paganism consisted of "a set of beliefs that varied from place to place" rather than being a dogmatic religion that was the same across England. The second objective is to show that the beliefs of the pagan Anglo-Saxons, "whether pure reason or intellectual mish-mash, [were] expressed in their material culture". Carrying on from the second, the third objective of the anthology was to show that through [[archaeology]], contemporary scholars can "rediscover" Anglo-Saxon belief.&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt;

Summing up their view of Anglo-Saxon paganism, the editors state that it "was not a religion with supraregional rules and institutions but a loose term for a variety of local intellectual world views".&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt; They also "extend the same courtesy to Christianity", noting that "Christianisation too hides a multiplicity of locally negotiated positions".&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt; Ultimately, the writers noted that neither "paganism nor Christianity are treated here as independent agents, out to confront and better each other. They are sources on which people, local people &amp;ndash; the true agents of Anglo-Saxon England &amp;ndash; eclectically drew.&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt;

===Price's "Foreword: Heathen Songs and Devil's Games"===

The book's foreword, entitled "Heathen Songs and Devil's Games", was written by the archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], then a professor at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. Price had previously been involved in the investigation of the pre-Christian religious beliefs of northern Europe, authoring the influential book, ''[[The Viking Way (book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in the Later Iron Age of Scandinavia]]'' (2002). In his foreword, Price comments positively on ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' as a whole, noting that it is "remarkable that the present book represents the first attempt for nearly two decades to present an overall survey of early English beliefs that cannot be firmly situated within a Christian frame."&lt;ref name="Price xiv"&gt;[[#Pric10|Price 2010]]. p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Price writes, ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' "simply represents the state of the art, with supporting references to the work on which it builds, and summarises with admirable caution and sensitivity most of what we currently know about the intricate mental world of the pre-Christian English. All future journeys through this difficult terrain must necessarily start here, and they could not have a better guide."&lt;ref name="Price xvi"&gt;[[#Pric10|Price 2010]]. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carver's "Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda"===
In the first paper of the anthology, written by Martin Carver of the [[University of York]], the author opens with a discussion of the work of Neil Price in his book ''The Viking Way'' (2002), which explored the existence of female shamans in pre-Christian Scandinavian society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to note that the work of Price and other academics has enabled contemporary scholars to understand historical paganism far better than ever before because they are "better equipped in that triad of disciplines"; archaeology, anthropology and history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Carver then goes on to discuss the work of the archaeologist [[David Lewis-Williams]] in his book ''[[The Mind in the Cave]]'' (2002), which Carver argued has "redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists". Carver expresses his opinion that both Lewis-Williams' theories and his multidisciplinary approach (using methods drawn from disciplines like anthropology, psychology, art and ethnology) can be employed in order to shed light on the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to point out several problems facing archaeologists in their study of Anglo-Saxon paganism,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; before looking at the ideas put forward by the archaeologists [[Colin Renfrew]] and [[Tim Insoll]] for how to best understand the cognitive aspects of historical religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Setting up a "programme for investigating Anglo-Saxon spirituality", Carver argues that those Anglo-Saxonist archaeologists who have focused their research on either the pagan or the Christian periods of Anglo-Saxon history need to interact with one another far more, before stating that the same is true for prehistorians and medievalists; in Carver's opinion, an understanding of the beliefs of the Early Anglo-Saxon period can only be achieved by understanding it as being, in part, a "continuum of prehistory".&lt;ref name="Carver 8"/&gt; Moving on to discuss the burial monuments of Anglo-Saxon England and their relations with those found elsewhere in north-western Europe, Carver argues that we can understand more about the beliefs of people at the time by looking at the spread of specific burial styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 8&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; He then looks at the assembly sites found in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that there is sufficient archaeological evidence for specific shrine structures, here drawing parallels with the work of archaeologist [[Leszek Słupecki]] in relation to the pagan shrines of Slavic Europe. Going on to reference several excavations in northern Europe, Carver discusses the theory that halls were also used as ritual spaces, and considers whether the same could be true of Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third part of his paper, Carver deals with what he describes as "Christian variants", arguing that in his view, the archaeological evidence implies that "paganism and Christianity do not, in this period, describe homogenous intellectual positions or canons of practice. Pagan ideas and material vocabulary were drawn from a wide reservoir of cosmology and were recomposed as local statements with their own geographical and chronological context. I believe that the same kind of evidence, the evidence of monumentality, provokes us to a similar judgment of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Carver argues, most individuals in 7th-century England were neither clearly Christian or pagan, but adhered to elements of both in a syncretic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semple's "In the Open Air"===
In the second paper of the anthology, entitled "In the Open Air", Sarah Semple provides an overview of what she refers to as the "pre-Christian sacred landscape". Opening the article, Semple discusses the theoretical trends behind recent Anglo-Saxon scholarship and looks at how these can enlighten our understanding of the Anglo-Saxon landscape; in doing so she argues in favour of an interdisciplinary approach which uses historical sources to back up archaeology, before then arguing for the use of continental European parallels to shed light on the world of Early Mediaeval England. Finally she argues that the landscape archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England has to be seen as an extension of the earlier prehistoric and Romano-British landscape rather than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sem10|Semple 2010]]. pp. 21&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially describing "natural places" in the landscape, Semple discusses how the pagan Anglo-Saxons may have understood their surroundings, looking at the manner in which fields and groves were devoted to deities. Proceeding to look at the way in which pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons viewed hilltops, she discusses their association with sites designated as ''[[hearg]]'' in Old English. Semple then looks at the role of fissures, hollows and pits, highlighting how Anglo-Saxons believed them to be inhabited by monsters and goblins, before examining similar ideas regarding water-places, which were believed to be inhabited by ''[[nicor]]'' and which also saw some votive depositions occurring in the Early Mediaeval. Discussing [[votive offerings]] to such water-places, she then discusses the Anglo-Saxon attitude towards "ancient remains, monuments and ruins", discussing the re-use of prehistoric burial mounds and Roman-period structures. Rounding off her paper, Semple discusses evidence for pagan temples and shrines in the Anglo-Saxon landscape, as well as sacred beams, poles and totems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sem10|Semple 2010]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lund's "At the Water's Edge"===
The anthology's third paper was produced by Julie Lund, then a Senior Lecturer in archaeology at the [[University of Oslo]] in Norway.  Entitled "At the Water's Edge", it looked at the relationship between the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons and watery areas such as rivers and lakes, relying particularly on comparisons from Scandinavia. Opening with a discussion of those [[votive offerings]] that had been deposited into water, it goes on to discuss the Early Mediaeval idea that objects, and in particular swords, had personalities, and how this might be related to their ritual deposition. Proceeding to discuss the role of rivers in the Anglo-Saxon cognitive landscape, it examines the archaeological evidence for votive deposits placed into them at this time, noting the wide array of weapons, but also jewellery and tools, which have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lun10|Lund 2010]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lund moves on to discuss the role of bridges, fords and crossings in both Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon contexts, arguing that they were significant sites in the latter's cognitive landscape, and that they were often used as the sites for votive offerings. She then discusses the role of lakes, noting that while there is ample evidence for votive deposition in Scandinavian lakes, there is currently none from Anglo-Saxon England. Finally, she looks at Christian attempts to suppress pagan ritual activity at watery places, and the revival which it experienced following the Scandinavian settlement of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lun10|Lund 2010]]. pp. 54&amp;ndash;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Williams' "At the Funeral"===
The fourth paper in ''Signals of Belief'' was authored by Howard Williams, then a Professor of Archaeology at the [[University of Chester]]. Devoted to evaluating the evidence for pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon burial rites, it begins by explaining the approaches taken to this subject by earlier antiquarians and archaeologists. Moving on, Williams discusses the idea that mortuary practices in the Early Medieval Germanic-speaking world reflected pagan cosmology, eschatology, cosmogony and mythology, and describes those Scandinavian examples where aspects of the burial rituals have been interpreted as being symbolically related to elements of [[Norse mythology]]. Williams then discusses the role of cremation as a burial rite in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that the whole cremation process must be viewed as a series of ritualised events rather than as a singular occurrence. Proceeding to discuss inhumation burials, Williams once more argues that there would have been a series of different ritualised scenes as the corpse was prepared, laid in the grave, and then covered in soil, rather than simply one singular layout of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil10|Williams 2010]]. pp. 67&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walker's "In the Hall"===
[[File:West Stow Hall 1.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstructed Anglo-Saxon Hall; Walker devoted her paper to discussing the ritual uses of such buildings.]]
The fifth paper of the anthology, authored by Jenny Walker, a graduate of the [[University of York]]'s Department of Archaeology, explores the role that the great wooden halls served as "ritual theatre[s]" in Anglo-Saxon paganism, using the Northumbrian site of [[Yeavering]] as a case study. Commenting on earlier approaches to understanding the relationship between religious practices and the Early Medieval hall both in England and Scandinavia, she highlights the influence of [[post-processual archaeology]] in altering earlier [[Culture-historical archaeology|culture-historical]] perspectives on this subject. Referencing the theories of sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]], Walker maintains that the role of both [[human agency]] and [[ideology]] in constructing the halls "as a political act" must be taken into account by archaeologists adopting a post-processual approach.

Proceeding to discuss the evidence for three of the halls excavated at Yeavering by archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor in the early 20th century &amp;ndash; buildings A2, D2b and Bab &amp;ndash; she then goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for two Scandinavian examples, [[Uppåkra]] in Skana, Sweden, and Borg at [[Vestvågøy]], Norway, both of which show evidence for ritual activity. Concluding her paper, Walker emphasises the diversity in uses that halls in Anglo-Saxon England &amp;ndash; and wider Northwestern Europe &amp;ndash; had been put in the Early Medieval. Some, she asserts, would have been used for both socio-political and socio-religious activities, while others would have been explicitly reserved for just one of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Walker 2010]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluskowski's "Animal Magic"===
Aleks Pluskowski &amp;ndash; an Archaeology Lecturer at the [[University of Reading]] &amp;ndash; offers the anthology's six paper, an exploration of the role that non-human animals played in pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon religion. Opening with a discussion of the "zoomorphic" symbolism of [[Anglo-Saxon art|Early Anglo-Saxon art]], he also lists the various different species, both wild and domestic, that the people of Anglo-Saxon England would have been familiar with from their daily lives. Pluskowski then moves on to look at the zoomorphic symbolism found on shields, themselves symbols of adult masculinity in Anglo-Saxon England, before providing a discussion of the idea that animals offered "windows to cosmology", representing symbols of different mythological figures and cosmological places that contemporary scholarship is unaware of, in doing so referencing the work of Stephen Glosecki. Proceeding to examine the symbolic use of animals in Anglo-Saxon warfare, he rounds off this chapter by dealing with both comparisons from continental Europe and Scandinavia and by looking at the influence that Christianity had on re-deploying the symbolism of zoomorphic designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plu10|Plusckowski 2010]]. pp. 103&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fern's "Horses in Mind"===
In his paper, Chris Fern, an independent archaeologist and Research Associate of the [[University of York]], explored the role of the horse in Anglo-Saxon paganism. Remarking that the horse was "a motif with socio-political, heroic and spiritual significance" for the early Anglo-Saxons, he begins with a brief overview of the importance of horses in the preceding prehistoric and Roman periods of British history. Moving on to explore the ceremonial usages of horses in Anglo-Saxon England, he first examines the archaeological evidence for horses who had been cremated or placed in inhumation burials, including those from sites such as the [[Snape ship burial]] who had been ritually beheaded. Fern follows this with an examination of horses depicted in Anglo-Saxon art, noting the predominance of motifs featuring either two fighting stallions or a warrior riding a horse, the latter being an image which Fern argues had been adopted from Imperial Rome. He also puts forward the theory that the geometric stamps found imprinted on pots represented horse branding marks.

Proceeding to look at horses featured in documents from the period, Fern discusses the mythological figures [[Hengist and Horsa]] who appear in [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', as well as the role that the former played in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''. Turning his attention to the human consumption of [[Horse meat|horse flesh]] in this period, he argues that it was only eaten rarely, usually as "a sacred activity".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fer10|Fern 2010]]. pp. 128&amp;ndash;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanmark's "Living On"===
The penultimate paper in the anthology, "Living On: Ancestors and the Soul", is authored by Alexandra Sanmark, then a post doctoral Research Associate at the Millennium Institute Centre for Nordic Studies and Lecturer at the [[University of Western Australia]]'s Department of History. In it, she takes a primarily historical approach to studying Anglo-Saxon conceptions of the soul, utilising comparisons from [[Norse paganism]], which she recognises offers contemporary scholars "an echo or an analogy" of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Beginning by discussing the structure of Norse religious thinking, she describes the division between the "higher religion" devoted to the cult of the gods and the "lower religion" devoted to the veneration of [[animism|animistic]] deities; Sanmark includes the Norse "cult of the ancestors" within this latter category. Expanding on this by exploring the Norse conception of the soul and the manner it which it might migrate in an animal form, she then turns her attention to similar evidence from Anglo-Saxon England, in particular discussing the ideas regarding an Anglo-Saxon shamanic tradition advocated by Stephen Glosecki.

At first dealing with the literary evidence from Anglo-Saxon poems like ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', she then turns her attention to the evidence from Anglo-Saxon art, again citing the theories of Glosecki. Looking at the link between an ancestor cult and places of burial &amp;ndash; namely [[burial mounds]], which she considers to be places of communication between the living and the dead &amp;ndash; she makes use of Norse historical texts and ethnographic evidence from Eastern Europe to argue that the Anglo-Saxons probably used burial mounds for the same purposes. Moving on to look at the relation between the ancestors and the ritual consumption of alcoholic beverages, she primarily makes use of Norse sources, before discussing the role of the malevolent ancestors in the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon worldview, highlighting the [[Anglo-Saxon Deviant Burial Customs|theories regarding deviant burials]] advocated by archaeologist [[Andrew Reynolds (archaeologist)|Andrew Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#San10|Sanmark 2010]]. pp. 158&amp;ndash;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content and Williams' "Creating the Pagan English"===
The final paper of the anthology, "Creating the Pagan English: From the Tudors to the Present Day", is the product of a collaboration between Howard Williams and Sue Content, a doctoral student at the [[University of Chester]]'s Department of History and Archaeology. An overview of the history of Anglo-Saxon archaeological investigation into pre-Christian religion, it begins by looking at the manner in which the Anglo-Saxon pagans were glorified as proto-Protestants under the regime of the Tudor monarchs by the likes of [[Polydire Vergil]] and [[William Camden]], before highlighting how Roman Catholic writers such as [[Richard Verstegen]] counteracted this by portraying these pagans as barbaric. Chronologically proceeding to the 18th century, he discusses the ''Nenia Brittanica'', a proto-archaeological work authored by the Reverend James Douglas which discussed the material evidence for early Anglo-Saxon belief. Moving into the Victorian era, Content and Williams note that the period between ''circa'' 1845 and 1860 was important for the antiquarian investigation of Anglo-Saxon paganism, in particular making reference to the work of [[John Young Akerman]] and [[John Mitchell Kemble]]. They argue that following the deaths of these two figures, there was a period of stagnation in Anglo-Saxon archaeology lasting until 1910, when interest in the subject once more emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Con10|Content and Williams 2010]]. pp. 181&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The book's afterword, entitled "''Caveats'' and Futures", was written by the English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] (1953&amp;ndash;), then working at the [[University of Bristol]]. At the time a Commissioner for [[English Heritage]], Hutton had previously written about Anglo-Saxon paganism in a chapter of his book ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles|The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton notes that the collection exposes Anglo-Saxon England as a "world of fluid religious identities" in which people "pick and mix between religious systems", developing "their own idiomatic and personal manifestations" of belief and practice.&lt;ref name="Hutton 2010 201"/&gt;

In a review published in the academic journal ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'', Charlotte Behr of [[Roehampton University]] noted that ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' differed from many conference volumes in that the archaeologists who authored the book's papers appear to have undertaken "intense discussions" about how to carry out their research and interpret the evidence. Although she believed that there was much to commend in the anthology, she was wary that words like "superstitious", "magical", "numinous", "sacred", "sanctified" and "supernatural" had been used in a loose way as if they were synonyms despite the fact that they have distinct meanings. She was also critical of "two dozen spelling errors" and "minor factual mistakes" that made it into the text, but ultimately considered the presentation of the book to be "pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beh11|Behr 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Wallis reviewed the book for ''[[Time and Mind|Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture]]'', noting that it would be enjoyed by those who liked the theoretical positions adopted in the 1990s, and that much of the language used is similar to that which has been employed in Bronze and Iron Age Studies. Expressing that its [[post-processualism|post-processualist]] angle has given Anglo-Saxon archaeology "a sharper edge", he opines that it constitutes essential reading for those interested in this area, but that a greater attention to anthropological theory, particularly regarding concepts of animism, shamanism, and totemism, needs to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal12|Wallis 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[Council for British Archaeology]]'s bimestrial magazine, ''British Archaeology'', the Early Medievalist Chris Scull praised ''Signals of Belief in Early England'', opining that it should be "required reading" for any researcher investigating Anglo-Saxon beliefs. Arguing that the book was "[s]timulating and provocative", he believed that the most successful essays were those that engaged directly with the "material evidence and near-contemporary texts" rather than those which used later Scandinavian sources. Scull furthermore expressed his view that archaeologists should now discard the terms "pagan" and "paganism" when "considering the belief-worlds of early England."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scu11|Scull 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In the year following the publication of ''Signals of Belief in Early England'', the established Anglo-Saxonist [[Stephen Pollington]] published an overview of Anglo-Saxon paganism entitled ''The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol11|Pollington 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the event sometimes called the Technological Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Axe]] made of iron, dating from Swedish [[Iron Age]], found at [[Gotland Island|Gotland]], [[Sweden]]: the iron—as a new material—initiated a dramatic revolution in technology, economy, society, warfare and politics.]]
A '''technological revolution''' is a period in which one or more [[technology|technologies]] is replaced by another technology in a short amount of time. It is an era of accelerated [[technological progress]] characterized by new [[innovation]]s whose rapid [[wikt:application|application]] and [[diffusion]] cause an abrupt change in society.

A technological revolution is made of interconnected [[technological change|technological changes]]. 

==Description by Joseph C. Galisim==
[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The [[Spinning Jenny]] and [[Spinning Mule]] (shown) greatly increased the productivity of thread manufacturing compared to the [[spinning wheel]]]]
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|240px|A [[Watt steam engine]]—the [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by [[coal]], propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the world.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F077948-0006, Jugend-Computerschule mit IBM-PC.jpg|thumb|[[IBM Personal Computer XT]] in 1988—the PC was an invention that dramatically changed not only professional life, but personal life as well.]]
A technological revolution increases [[productivity]] and [[efficiency]]. It may involve material or ideological changes caused by the introduction of a device or system. Some examples of its potential impact are business management, education, social interactions, finance and research methodology; it is not limited strictly to technical  aspects. Technological revolution rewrites the material conditions of human  existence and can reshape culture. It can play a role of a trigger of a chain of various and unpredictable changes:&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Maury(2008): ''The Technological Revolution, in The Newsletter of Foreign Policy Research Institute, Vol.13, No. 18.'' [http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1318.200807.klein.techrevolution.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What distinguishes a technological revolution  from a random collection of technology systems and justifies conceptualizing it as a revolution are two basic features:

1. The strong interconnectedness and interdependence of the participating systems in their technologies and markets.

2. The capacity to transform profoundly the rest of the economy (and eventually society).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Carlota (2009):''Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms.'',  in Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20, (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn) [http://carlotaperez.org/papers/PerezTRsTEPsTUTWP20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequences of a technological revolution are not necessarily positive. For example, innovations, such as the use of [[coal]] as an [[Energy development|energy source]], can have negative environmental impact and cause [[technological unemployment]]. The concept of technological revolution is based on the idea that [[technological progress]] is not [[linear]] but [[undulatory]]. Technological revolution can be:

* Sectoral (more technological changes in one sector, e.g. [[Green Revolution]] and [[Commercial Revolution]])
* Universal (interconnected radical changes in more sectors, the universal technological revolution can be seen as a complex of several parallel sectoral technological revolutions, e.g. [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance technological revolution]])

The concept of universal technological revolutions is a key factor in the Neo-Schumpeterian theory of long economic waves/cycles&lt;ref&gt;for example: Perez, Carlota (2009):''Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms.'',  in Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20, (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn) [http://carlotaperez.org/papers/and/scissors/PerezTRsTEPsTUTWP20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Carlota Perez]], [[Tessaleno Devezas]], [[Daniel Šmihula]] and others).

==History==
The most known example of technological revolution was the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, the [[Information revolution|scientific-technical revolution]] about 1950–1960, the [[Neolithic revolution]], the [[Digital revolution]] and so on. The notion of "technological revolution" is frequently overused, therefore it is not easy to define which technological revolutions having occurred during [[world history]] were really crucial and influenced not only one segment of human activity, but had a universal impact. One universal technological revolution should be composed from several sectoral technological revolutions (in science, industry, transport and the like).

We can identify several universal technological revolutions which occurred during the [[modern era]] in [[Western culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;based on: Šmihula, Daniel (2011): ''Long waves of technological innovations, Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50-69. [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1. Financial-agricultural revolution (1600–1740)
* 2. Industrial revolution (1780–1840)
* 3. Technical revolution or [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1870–1920)
* 4. Scientific-technical revolution (1940–1970) 
* 5. Information and telecommunications revolution (1975–present)

Attempts to find comparable periods of well defined technological revolutions in the [[pre-modern era]] are highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;for example: Drucker, Peter F. (1965):''The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons.'' [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/d_rucker5.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Probably one of the most systematic attempts to suggest a timeline of technological revolutions in pre-modern [[Europe]] was done by Daniel Šmihula:&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2011): [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20 ''Long waves of technological innovations''], Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50-69&lt;/ref&gt;   
* A. Indo-European  technological revolution (1900–1100 BC) 
* B. Celtic and Greek technological revolution (700–200 BC)
* C. Germano-Slavic technological revolution (300–700 AD)
* D. Medieval technological revolution (930–1200 AD)
* E. Renaissance technological revolution (1340–1470 AD)

==Potential future technological revolutions==
After 2000 there became popular the idea that a sequence of technological revolutions is not over and in the forthcoming future we will witness the dawn of a new universal technological revolution. The main innovations should develop in the fields of [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]], [[alternative energy|alternative fuel and energy systems]], [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]], [[genetic engineering]], new materials technologies and so on .&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Anton,  Richard Silberglitt, James Schneider (2001): [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1307.pdf ''The Global Technology Revolution - Bio/Nano/Materials Trends and Their Synergies with Information Technology by 2015.''], RAND, {{ISBN|0-8330-2949-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to "technological revolution" and "technical revolution"==
Sometimes the notion of "technological revolution" is used for the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the period about 1900, but in this case the designation "technical revolution" would be more proper. When the notion of [[technical revolution]] is used in more general meaning it is almost identical with technological revolution, but technological revolution requires material changes in used tools, machines, energy sources, production processes. Technical revolution can be restricted to changes in  management, organisation and so called non-material [[technologies]] (e.g. a progress in [[mathematics]] or [[accounting]]).

==List of intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions (sectoral or universal)==
[[File:PPF expansion.svg|thumb|right|Technological revolution can cause the [[production-possibility frontier]] to shift outward and initiate economic growth]]
* The [[Upper Paleolithic Revolution]]: the emergence of "high culture", new technologies and regionally distinct cultures (50,000–40,000 years ago).
* The [[Neolithic Revolution]] (perhaps 13,000 years ago), which formed the basis for human civilization to develop.
* The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance technological revolution]]: the set of inventions during the Renaissance period, roughly the 14th through the 16th century.
* The [[Commercial Revolution]]: a period of European economic expansion, [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] which lasted  from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century.
* The [[Price revolution|Price Revolution]]: a series of economic events from the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, the price revolution refers most specifically to the high rate of inflation that characterized the period across [[Western Europe]].
* The [[Scientific Revolution]]: a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas around the 16th century.
* The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] (18th century), which spurred urbanisation and consequently helped launch the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* The [[Industrial Revolution]]: the major shift of technological, socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the late 18th century and early 19th century that began in Britain and spread throughout the world.
* The [[Market Revolution]]: a drastic change in the manual labor system originating in the South of the [[United States]] (and soon moving to the North) and later spreading to the entire world (about 1800–1900).
* The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1871–1914).
* The [[Green Revolution]] (1945–1975): the use of industrial fertilizers and new crops greatly increased the world's agricultural output.
* The [[Digital Revolution]]: the sweeping changes brought about by [[computing]] and [[communication technology]], starting from circa 1950 with the creation of the first general-purpose [[electronic computer]]s.
* The [[Information revolution|Information Revolution]]: the massive economic, social and technological changes resulting from the Digital Revolution (after 1960?).

'''''The Time Machine''''' is a [[science fiction]] novella by [[H. G. Wells]], published in 1895 and written as a [[Frame story|frame narrative]]. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of [[time travel]] by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pilkington |first1=Ace G. |title=Science Fiction and Futurism: Their Terms and Ideas |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Time Machine'' has been adapted into three [[feature film]]s of the same name, as well as two [[television]] versions, and a large number of [[comic book]] adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of [[fiction]] in many media productions.

==History==
Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled "[[The Chronic Argonauts]]" (1888). This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for ''The Time Machine''.

Wells frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' until the publisher asked him if he could instead write a [[serial novel]] on the same theme. Wells readily agreed and was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]100 (equal to about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1895|r=-3}}}} today) on its publication by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1895, which first published the story in serial form in the January to May numbers of ''The New Review'' (newly under the nominal editorship of [[W. E. Henley]]).&lt;ref name="jrhamm04"/&gt; [[Henry Holt and Company]] published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&amp;id=2256 |department=UCR Newsroom |title=Rare edition of "The Time Machine" acquired |publisher=University of California, Riverside |date=2010-02-09 |access-date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7&amp;nbsp;May 1895; Heinemann published an English edition on 29&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name="jrhamm04"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |title=H. G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide |date=2004 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313330077}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the "Holt text" and "Heinemann text", respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The story reflects Wells's own [[socialist]] political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about [[industrial relations]]. It is also influenced by [[Ray Lankester]]'s theories about social degeneration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mikejay.net/articles/man-of-the-year-million/ |title=Man Of The Year Million |publisher=Mikejay.net |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares many elements with [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s novel ''[[Vril|Vril, the Power of the Coming Race]]'' (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3-xlc8edbEC&amp;pg=PR46&amp;lpg=PR46&amp;dq=%22references+to+the+Sphinx,+the+buildings,+the+underground+machines%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_VWqsE0mmR&amp;sig=gR-gJJXjMXDO91yZ-LE2XAkp2fk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u78fUZiiMofAhAfdjoCIBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22references%20to%20the%20Sphinx%2C%20the%20buildings%2C%20the%20underground%20machines%22&amp;f=false |title=The Coming Race |authors=Edward Bulwer-Lytton, David Seed |via=Google Books |access-date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science fiction works of the period, including [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward|Looking Backward: 2000-1887]]'' (1888) and the later film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927),  dealt with similar themes.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Based on Wells' personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground. His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9373000/9373313.stm |title=HG Wells' letter goes on display in Sevenoaks |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with underground tunnels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/movies/film-wells-s-future-is-forever-recurring.html |department=Film |title=Wells's Future is Forever Recurring |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mR3_3vVoI1sC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22rigid+hierarchical+structure+of+staff+and+servants,+and+the+sharp+contrast+between+life+above+and+below+stairs%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WOp7X2i9qA&amp;sig=KP7hCx82IO7IPbJAMFDo2CBf9A4&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbrJS52J_cAhUlAZoKHalnARsQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rigid%20hierarchical%20structure%20of%20staff%20and%20servants%2C%20and%20the%20sharp%20contrast%20between%20life%20above%20and%20below%20stairs%22&amp;f=false |title=H.

This work is an early example of the [[Dying Earth (subgenre)|Dying Earth subgenre]]. The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places ''The Time Machine'' within the realm of [[eschatology]], i.e. the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The book's [[protagonist]] is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] English [[scientist]] and gentleman [[inventor]] living in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], [[Surrey]], and identified by a narrator simply as the ''Time Traveller''. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth [[dimension]] and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.

In the [[frame story|new narrative]], the Time Traveller tests his device. At first he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future. He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Time Traveller stops in [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] 802,701, where he meets the [[Eloi]], a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, and having a [[plant-based diet|fruit-based diet]]. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline.  They appear happy and carefree, but fear the dark and in particular fear moonless nights.  Observing them, he finds that they give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances. (Perhaps they had become traumatized and would not discuss it.) He speculates that they are a peaceful society.

Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the [[Morlock]]s, [[ape]]-like [[caveman|troglodytes]] who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Exploring one of many "wells" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden [[working class]]es have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks.

Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi.  His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.

Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named [[Weena (The Time Machine)|Weena]] from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, whereby Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire and the Time Traveller is devastated over his loss.

The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30&amp;nbsp;million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: Menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous [[butterflies]], in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.

Overwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Time Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. 

The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. However, the narrator reveals that he has waited three years before writing and stating the Time Traveller has not returned from his journey.

==Deleted text==
A section from the eleventh chapter of the serial published in ''New Review'' (May 1895) was deleted from the book. It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor, [[William Ernest Henley]], who wanted Wells to "oblige your editor" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of "the ultimate degeneracy" of humanity. "There was a slight struggle," Wells later recalled, "between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |title=H.

The deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller's escape from the Morlocks.  He finds himself in the distant future of an unrecognisable Earth, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resembling [[kangaroo]]s.  He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-like [[arthropod]] approaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid.

==Scholarship==
Significant scholarly commentary on ''The Time Machine'' began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi's ''The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances'') and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas's ''The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians''). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments.

===Academic publications===
A further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella's centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print as ''H.G. Wells’s Perennial Time Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=H.G. Wells’s ''Time Machine'' centenary conference, 1995 |title=H.G. Wells’s Perennial Time Machine: Selected Essays from the Centenary Conference, "The Time Machine: Past, Present, and Future" |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master's and Ph.D. level: ''H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A reference guide |publisher=Praeger |year=2004 |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313330077}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The scholarly journal ''The Wellsian'' has published around twenty articles on ''The Time Machine'', and a U.S. academic journal ''The Undying Fire'', devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002. Richard Wasson explores the use in ''The Time Machine'' of [[myth]] and [[Mythologies (book)#exnomination|ex-nomination of class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wasson |first=Richard |title=Myth and the ex-nomination of class in ''The Time Machine'' |journal=[[The Minnesota Review]] |volume=15 |pages=112–122 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |date=Fall 1980 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/427124 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtext of the names ''Eloi'' and ''Morlock''===
The name ''[[Eloi]]'' is the Hebrew plural for Elohim, or lesser gods, in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Time Machine: An invention – A critical text of the 1895 London first edition |last=Stover |first=Leon |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |year=1996 |isbn=0786401249 |location=Jefferson, NC |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells' source for the name ''morlock'' is less clear. It may refer to the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] god [[Moloch]] associated with child sacrifice. The name [[Morlock]] may be a play on ''mollocks'' – what miners might call themselves – or a Scots word for rubbish,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or a reference to the [[Morlacchi]] community in Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=u5tUbUyXtToC&amp;dq |article=The rise and fall of 'Morlacchismo': South Slavic identity in the mountains of Dalmatia |last=Wolff |first=Larry |title=Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2003 |editor-last=Naimark |editor-first=Norman |pages=49 |editor-last2=Case |editor-first2=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
''The Time Machine'' can be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire.

* The statue of the Sphinx is the place where the Morlocks hide the time machine and references the Sphinx in the story of [[Oedipus]] who gives a riddle that he must first solve before he can pass.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Science Fiction Before 1900: Imagination Discovers Technology |last=Alkon |first=Paul K. |publisher=Twayne Publishers |year=1994 |isbn=0805709525 |location=New York |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphinx appeared on the cover of the first London edition as requested by Wells and would have been familiar to his readers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The white flowers can symbolize Weena's devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time machine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are the only proof that the Time Traveller's story is true.

* Fire symbolizes civilization: the Time Traveller uses it to ward off the Morlocks, but it escapes his control and turns into a forest fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Adaptations==
=== Radio and audio ===
====''Escape'' radio broadcasts====
The CBS radio anthology ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'' adapted ''The Time Machine'' twice, in 1948 starring [[Jeff Corey]], and again in 1950 starring [[Lawrence Dobkin]] as the traveller. In both episodes, a script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used. The Time Traveller was named '''Dudley''' and was accompanied by his skeptical friend Fowler as they traveled to the year 100,080.

====1994 Alien Voices audio drama====
In 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] as the Time Traveller (named '''John''' in this adaptation) and [[John de Lancie]] as David Filby. John de Lancie's children, Owen de Lancie and [[Keegan de Lancie]], played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.

==== 7th Voyage ====
In 2000, Alan Young read ''The Time Machine'' for 7th&amp;nbsp;Voyage Productions, Inc., in 2016 to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells' novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lucas |first1=Clyde |title=The Time Machine Alan Young |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3630388/ |date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009 BBC Radio 3 broadcast====
[[Robert Glenister]] starred as the Time Traveller, with [[William Gaunt]] as [[H. G. Wells]] in a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed by [[Jeremy Mortimer]] as part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22&amp;nbsp;February 2009 on [[BBC Radio 3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hr4hq |department=BBC Radio 3 – Drama on 3 |title=The Time Machine |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book.

The other cast members were:
*Donnla Hughes as Martha
*Gunnar Cauthery as Young H. G. Wells
*[[Stephen Critchlow]] as Filby, friend of the young Wells
*Chris Pavlo as Bennett, friend of the young Wells
*Manjeet Mann as Mrs. Watchett, the Traveller's housemaid
*Jill Crado as Weena, one of the Eloi and the Traveller's partner
*[[Robert Lonsdale]], Inam Mirza, and [[Dan Starkey (actor)|Dan Starkey]] as other characters

The adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the American journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof of [[Broadcasting House]] during [[the Blitz]]. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there.

====Big Finish====
On 5&amp;nbsp;September 2017, [[Big Finish Productions]] released an adaptation of ''The Time Machine''. This adaptation was written by [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]], and starred [[Ben Miles]] as the Time Traveller.

Platt explained in an interview that adapting The Time Machine to audio was not much different to writing Doctor Who, and that he can see where some of the roots of early Doctor Who came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/out-now-hg-wells-the-time-machine |title=Out Now: H.G. Wells' ''The Time Machine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptations ===

==== 1949 BBC teleplay ====
The first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from [[Alexandra Palace]] on 25 January 1949 by the [[BBC]], which starred [[Russell Napier]] as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |last2=Day |first2=Martin |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |title=The Classic British Telefantasy Guide |page=7 |date=30 July 2015 |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-575-13352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1960 film====
{{main|The Time Machine (1960 film)}}

In 1960, the novella was made into an American [[science fiction film]], also known promotionally as ''H.G. Wells' The Time Machine''. The film starred [[Rod Taylor]], [[Alan Young]], and [[Yvette Mimieux]]. The film was produced and directed by [[George Pal]], who also filmed a 1953 version of Wells' ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''.  The film won an Academy Award for [[time-lapse]] photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly.

In 1993, Rod Taylor hosted ''[[Time Machine: The Journey Back]]'' reuniting him with Alan Young and Whit Bissell, featuring the only sequel to Mr. Pal's classic film, written by the original screenwriter, David Duncan. In the special were [[Academy Award]]-winners special effect artists [[Wah Chang]] and [[Gene Warren]].

====1978 television film====
{{main|The Time Machine (1978 film)}}
[[Sunn Classic Pictures]] produced a television film version of ''The Time Machine'' as a part of their "[[Classics Illustrated]]" series in 1978. It was a modernization of the Wells' story, making the Time Traveller a 1970s scientist working for a fictional US [[defence contractor]], "the Mega Corporation". Dr. '''Neil Perry''' ([[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]), the Time Traveller, is described as one of Mega's most reliable contributors by his senior co-worker Branly (Whit Bissell, an alumnus of the 1960 adaptation).  Perry's skill is demonstrated by his rapid reprogramming of an off-course missile, averting a disaster that could destroy [[Los Angeles]]. His reputation secures a grant of $20 million for his time machine project. Although nearing completion, the corporation wants Perry to put the project on hold so that he can head a military weapon development project.  Perry accelerates work on the time machine, permitting him to test it before being forced to work on the new project.

====2002 film====
&lt;!-- This section about a U.S.-produced film whose setting was moved to the U.S. uses a different English variant. --&gt;
{{main|The Time Machine (2002 film)}}
The 1960 film was [[The Time Machine (2002 film)|remade]] in 2002, starring [[Guy Pearce]] as the Time Traveller, a mechanical engineering professor named Alexander Hartdegen, [[Mark Addy]] as his colleague David Filby, [[Sienna Guillory]] as Alex's ill-fated fiancée Emma, [[Phyllida Law]] as Mrs. Watchit, and [[Jeremy Irons]] as the Uber-Morlock. Playing a quick cameo as a shopkeeper was [[Alan Young]], who featured in the 1960 film. (H.G. Wells himself can also be said to have a "cameo" appearance, in the form of a photograph on the wall of Alex's home, near the front door.)

The film was directed by Wells's great-grandson [[Simon Wells]], with an even more revised plot that incorporated the ideas of [[paradox]]es and changing the past. The place is changed from Richmond, Surrey, to downtown [[New York City]], where the Time Traveller moves forward in time to find answers to his questions on 'Practical Application of Time Travel;' first in 2030 New York, to witness an orbital lunar catastrophe in 2037, before moving on to 802,701 for the main plot. He later briefly finds himself in 635,427,810 with toxic clouds and a world laid waste (presumably by the Morlocks) with devastation and Morlock artifacts stretching out to the horizon.

It was met with generally negative  reviews and earned $56 million before VHS/DVD sales. The Time Machine used a design that was very reminiscent of the one in the Pal film but was much larger and employed polished turned brass construction, along with rotating glass reminiscent of the [[Fresnel lens]]es common to lighthouses. (In Wells's original book, the Time Traveller mentioned his 'scientific papers on optics'). Hartdegen becomes involved with a female Eloi named Mara, played by [[Samantha Mumba]], who essentially takes the place of Weena, from the earlier versions of the story. &lt;!-- Mara may be either the 2002 film counterpart to Weena or a distinct character. We'd like to see reliable sources one way or the other. --&gt; In this film, the Eloi have, as a tradition, preserved a "stone language" that is identical to English. The Morlocks are much more barbaric and agile, and the Time Traveller has a direct impact on the plot.

=== Derivative work ===
====''Time After Time'' (1979 film)====
{{main|Time After Time (1979 film)}}
In ''Time After Time'', H.G. Wells invents a time machine and shows it to some friends in a manner similar to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which prevents the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 [[Time After Time (TV series)|TV series]] of the same name.

===Comics===
''Classics Illustrated'' was the first to adapt ''The Time Machine'' into a [[comic book]] format, issuing an American edition in July 1956.

The Classics Illustrated version was published in French by ''Classiques Illustres'' in Dec 1957, and ''Classics Illustrated'' Strato Publications (Australian) in 1957, and ''Kuvitettuja Klassikkoja'' (a Finnish edition) in November 1957.  There were also ''Classics Illustrated'' Greek editions in 1976, Swedish in 1987, German in 1992 and 2001, and a Canadian reprint of the English edition in 2008.

In 1976, [[Marvel Comics]] published a new version of ''The Time Machine'', as #2 in their ''[[Marvel Classics Comics]]'' series, with art by [[Alex Niño]]. (This adaptation was originally published in 1973 by [[Pendulum Press]] as part of their ''Pendulum Now Age Classics'' series; it was colorized and reprinted by Marvel in 1976.) From April 1990, [[Eternity Comics]] published a three-issue miniseries adaptation of ''The Time Machine'', written by [[Bill Spangler]] and illustrated by [[John Ross (artist)|John Ross]] — this was collected as a trade paperback [[graphic novel]] in 1991.

==Sequels by other authors==
{{uncited section|date=September 2018}}

Wells's novella has become one of the cornerstones of science-fiction literature. As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on{{cn|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--currently this reads as original research, we need evidence that critics have stated these are expansions on ''The Time Machine''--&gt; Wells's story include:

* ''La Belle Valence'' by Théo Varlet and André Blandin (1923) in which a squadron of [[World War I]] soldiers find the Time Machine and are transported back to the Spanish town of [[Valencia]] in [[Valencia#Golden Age of Valencia|the 14th century]]. Translated by [[Brian Stableford]] as ''Timeslip Troopers'' (2012).

* ''Die Rückkehr der Zeitmaschine'' (1946) by [[Egon Friedell]] was the first direct sequel. It dwells heavily on the technical details of the machine and the time-paradoxes it might cause when the time machine was used to visit the past. This culminates in Westminster Abbey being used as a butcher shop of human beings by the Morlocks in the 20th century, and a total disruption and collapse of the time stream. There the hero and Merlin must find — and destroy — the Time Machine, to restore the time stream and history.  The 24,000-word German original was translated into English by Eddy C. Bertin in the 1940s and eventually published in paperback as ''The Return of the Time Machine'' (1972, DAW).
*''The Hertford Manuscript'' by [[John Middleton Murry, Jr.|Richard Cowper]], first published in 1976. It features a "manuscript", which reports the Time Traveller's activities after the end of the original story. According to this manuscript, the Time Traveller disappeared, because his Time Machine had been damaged by the Morlocks without him knowing it. He only found out when it stopped operating during his next attempted time travel. He found himself on 27&amp;nbsp;August 1665, in [[London]] during the outbreak of the [[Great Plague of London]]. The rest of the novel is devoted to his efforts to repair the Time Machine and leave this time period before getting infected with the disease. He also has an encounter with [[Robert Hooke]]. He eventually dies of the disease on 20 September 1665. The story gives a list of subsequent owners of the manuscript until 1976. It also gives the name of the Time Traveller as Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18&amp;nbsp;June 1894.

* ''[[The Space Machine]]'' by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]], first published in 1976. Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to stay in one spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth's trajectory through space. In Priest's book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on [[Mars]], just before the start of the invasion described in ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character.

* ''[[Morlock Night]]'' by [[K. W. Jeter]], first published in 1979. A [[steampunk]] fantasy novel in which the Morlocks, having studied the Traveller's machine, duplicate it and invade Victorian London.

* ''Time Machine II'' by [[George Pal]] and Joe Morhaim, published in 1981. The Time Traveller, named George, and the pregnant Weena try to return to his time, but instead land in the London Blitz, dying during a bombing raid. Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George's journals, and the Time Machine's original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future.  Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a third sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal's film version of ''The Time Machine'', using the original actors. This third sequel, the plot of which does not seem to fit with Pal's second, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out. He and his son return to save Filby in [[World War I]].  This act changes the future, causing the nuclear war not to happen.  He and his son are thus cut off from Weena in the far future. The Time Traveller thus has to solve a dilemma — allow his friend to die, and cause the later death of millions, or give up Weena forever.

* ''The Man Who Loved Morlocks'' (1981) and ''The Truth about Weena'' (1998) are two different sequels, the former a novel and the latter a short story, by [[David Lake (writer)|David J. Lake]]. Each of them concerns the Time Traveller's return to the future. In the former, he discovers that he cannot enter any period in time he has already visited, forcing him to travel into the further future, where he finds love with a woman whose race evolved from Morlock stock. In the latter, he is accompanied by Wells and succeeds in rescuing Weena and bringing her back to the 1890s, where her political ideas cause a peaceful revolution.

* ''[[The Time Ships]]'', by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], first published in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted by the fact that he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters.

* ''The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel'' by [[Joe R. Lansdale]], first published in ''[[The Long Ones]]'' (1999). In this story, the Time Traveller accidentally damages the space-time continuum and is transformed into the vampire-like Dark Rider.

* The 2003 short story "On the Surface" by [[Robert J. Sawyer]] begins with this quote from the Wells original: "I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it [the time machine] to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose." In the Sawyer story, the Morlocks develop a fleet of time machines and use them to conquer the same far future Wells depicted at the end of the original, by which time, because the sun has grown red and dim and thus no longer blinds them, they can reclaim the surface of the world.

* The Time Traveller and his machine appear in the story ''[[Allan and the Sundered Veil]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], which acts as a prequel to ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]''. The Time Traveller shares an adventure with fellow literary icons [[Allan Quatermain]], [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], and [[Randolph Carter]].

* David Haden's novelette ''The Time Machine: A Sequel'' (2010) is a direct sequel, picking up where the original finished. The Time Traveller goes back to rescue Weena but finds the Eloi less simple than he first imagined, and time travel far more complicated.

* Simon Baxter's novel ''The British Empire: Psychic Battalions Against the Morlocks'' (2010) imagines a [[steampunk]]/[[cyberpunk]] future in which the [[British Empire]] has remained the dominant world force until the Morlocks arrive from the future.

* [[Hal Colebatch]]'s ''Time-Machine Troopers'' (2011) (Acashic Publishers) is twice the length of the original. In it, the Time Traveller returns to the future world about 18 years after the time he escaped from the Morlocks, taking with him [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the real-world founder of the Boy Scout movement. They set out to teach the Eloi self-reliance and self-defence against the Morlocks, but the Morlocks capture them. H.G. Wells and [[Winston Churchill]] are also featured as characters.

*Paul Schullery's ''The Time Traveller's Tale: Chronicle of a Morlock Captivity'' (2012) continues the story in the voice and manner of the original Wells book. After many years' absence, the Time Traveller returns and describes his further adventures. His attempts to mobilize the Eloi in their own defense against the Morlocks failed when he was captured by the Morlocks. Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock / Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity's catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races.

* The ''[[Great Illustrated Classics]]'' in 1992 published an adaptation of Wells' novella that adds an extra destination to the Time Traveller's adventure: Stopping in 2200&amp;nbsp;AD on his way back home, he becomes caught up in a civil war between factions of a [[technocratic]] society that was established to avert ecological catastrophe.

'''Tommy Gate''' is an American brand of hydraulic [[liftgate]], or [[tail lift]], manufactured by Woodbine Manufacturing Company. The company was formed in 1965 by Delbert "Bus" Brown and its production facility is located in [[Woodbine, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=SygEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA68&amp;dq=Tommy+Gate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj4tq9-KnSAhWMOSwKHeFCBe4Q6AEIGDAA|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1967-11-11|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=jSgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Tommy+Gate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj4tq9-KnSAhWMOSwKHeFCBe4Q6AEIHDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Tommy%20Gate&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1969-08-09|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to founding Woodbine Manufacturing Company, Delbert Brown manufactured farming equipment as Brown Manufacturing Company. After inventing what was then one of the first trenching machines, Brown Manufacturing Company was sold to [[Omaha Steel Works]]. Three years later, Brown founded Woodbine Manufacturing Company and began the Tommy Gate brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.omaha.com/money/iowa-maker-of-lift-gates-meets-demand-with-help-of/article_7d6b8b6d-1daa-5efd-b2f5-180811e25268.html |author=Cole Epley |title=Iowa Maker of Lift Gates Meets Demand With Help of Night Crew |publisher=The Omaha World-Herald |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
[[File:Tommy_Gate_Factory_2014.png|265px|thumb|right|The Tommy Gate factory circa 2014.]]
The Woodbine manufacturing facility was initially built in 1965 to occupy 70,000 square feet of production space. It expanded in 1980 to 90,000 and once again in 2000 when it grew to 140,000. The most recent expansion, completed in 2011, grew the plant to an overall 200,000 square feet (including 40,000 square feet of warehouse space).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vendingtimes.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=Vending+Features&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=4BDCEE50355946C88F755B63EEA49EEE |author=Tim Sanford |title=Tommy Gate Readies New Cantilever Van Lift, Expands Iowa Plant |publisher=Vending Times |date=March 5, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tracking collars''' are collars used as a [[Electric beacon|radio beacon]] to [[tracking animal migration|track animal migration]] for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mech | first = L. David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Handbook of animal radio-tracking | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | date = 1983 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8166-1222-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pet owners use these collars for [[GPS tracking]] and [[Geofence|geofencing]] of their pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gps.engadget.com/2004/08/24/global-pet-finder-gps-pet-collar/ |title=Global Pet Finder: GPS pet collar |accessdate=2009-03-17 |last=Fehrenbacher |first=Katie |date=2004-08-24 |publisher=[[Engadget]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025090339/http://gps.engadget.com/2004/08/24/global-pet-finder-gps-pet-collar/ |archivedate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SMART Collars ==
A collar used on animals to study their behaviors indepth. The collars were invented in 2014 by Christopher Wilmers and eco-physiologist Terrie Williams. The collars are able to give the GPS location of the animal wearing it as well as the speed and direction the animal moves the whole time it is wearing the collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willoughby|first=Leslie|date=2017-03-28|title=Inner Workings: SMART collars help track and conserve wildlife|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/13/3266|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=114|issue=13|pages=3266–3268|doi=10.1073/pnas.1701956114|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5380070|pmid=28351956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collar also gives information on what types of movements the animal has made such as jumping, or just standing still. A company by the name of PetPace made a SMART collar for dogs which owners and vets can use to know when the dog is sick and how its body is reacting to its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229715-000-smart-collar-brings-poorly-pooches-to-heal/|title=Smart collar brings poorly pooches to heal|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on Animals ==
It was believed that GPS collars used on animals affected their behavior. This theory was tested on elephants that lived in a zoo in the United States. They studied how the elephants behaved with and without the collars for the same amount of time for both scenarios and saw no change in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effects of GPS collars on African elephant (Loxodonta africana) behavior at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park|first1=Kristina Marie|last1=Horback|first2=Lance Joseph|last2=Miller|first3=Jeffrey|last3=Andrews|first4=Stanley Abraham|last4=Kuczaj II|first5=Matthew|last5=Anderson|date=15 December 2012|publisher=|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=142|issue=1–2|pages=76–81|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2012.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done with mantled howler monkeys to see if GPS Ball and Chain collars had any affect on the monkeys behavior. The study involved observing a group of collared and uncollared female howler monkeys. There was no major difference in the collared and uncollared behavior but when the study was over it was discovered that the monkey's had been injured. The collars had done damage to the necks of the monkey's one had small scratches and some swelling while four other monkeys had deep cuts from the collar. Two of the monkey's with the laserations had their tissue healing over the collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Mariah E.|last2=Milton|first2=Katharine|date=2016-04-01|title=Adverse Effects of Ball-Chain Radio-Collars on Female Mantled Howlers (Alouatta palliata) in Panama|journal=International Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=213–224|doi=10.1007/s10764-016-9896-y|issn=0164-0291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''true mass''''' is synonymous with the term [[mass]], but is used in [[astronomy]] to differentiate the measured mass of a planet from the [[minimum mass|lower limit of mass]] usually obtained from [[radial velocity]] techniques.&lt;ref name="ut" /&gt; Methods used to determine the true mass of a [[planet]] include measuring the distance and period of one of its [[natural satellite|satellites]],&lt;ref name="Brown Schaller 2007" /&gt; advanced [[astrometry]] techniques that use the motions of other planets in the same [[star system]],&lt;ref name="ut" /&gt; combining radial velocity techniques with [[Astronomical transit|transit]] observations (which indicate very low orbital inclinations),&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; and combining radial velocity techniques with [[parallax|stellar parallax]] measurements (which also determine orbital inclinations).&lt;ref name="Han Black Gatewood 2001" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">The '''Uhlenhuth Research Laboratory of the University of Freiburg''', originally known as the '''State Research Laboratory''' ({{lang-de|Staatliches Forschungslaboratorium}}), was a [[research institute]] in the field of [[medical microbiology]] and [[infectious diseases]] in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. It was established in 1936 with funding from the [[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft|German Research Council]] for the world-renowned microbiologist and immunologist [[Paul Uhlenhuth]] to provide a platform for his continued research after he had retired from his university [[chair (academic)|chair]] at the [[University of Freiburg]], and Uhlenhuth served as the institute's director until his death in 1957 at the age of 87. The scientific staff consisted of Uhlenhuth and a small number of researchers. As the name suggests, it was a [[states of Germany|state]] institute in the [[Republic of Baden]] and later in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. It was originally an independent research institution, albeit closely associated with the University of Freiburg, but in the early 1950s, the institute formally became part of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Freiburg. After Uhlenhuth's death, it was integrated in the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene.

The institute was located in Hebelstraße 42 in central Freiburg, in the same building as the university's Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, and within the central university campus area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.ub.uni-freiburg.de/diglit/vvuf_1956_ss/0068/ocr?sid=c6a767a379e79a3f44c01cb6920108f3 Personen- und Vorlesungsverzeichnis : Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg im Breisgau], 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Seidler, ''Die Medizinische Fakultät der Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg im Breisgau: Grundlagen und Entwicklungen'', Springer-Verlag, 2013, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;
