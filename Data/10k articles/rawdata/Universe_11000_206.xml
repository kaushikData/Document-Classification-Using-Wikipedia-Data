The '''Ad Dimaniyat Islands''' is a protected area in [[Oman]].

The Nature Reserve is located in Wilayat AlSeeb in the [[Muscat Governorate]] and lies about {{Convert|18|km}} off the coast of [[Barka, Oman|Barka]] ({{Convert|70|km}} west of Muscat, the capital). It is composed of nine islands with a total area of {{convert|100|ha|acre|abbr=off}}. The reserve has a rich natural heritage and is replete with several kinds of coral reefs, including some examples that are quite rare. The island is home to a large number of sea turtles that lay their eggs and nest there, as well as a magnet for migratory and indigenous birds.

Locally, the islands go by the following names: Kharabah, Huyoot, Al Jabal Al Kabeer (Um As Sakan). The latter is divided into two islands: Um Al Liwahah (Minaret) and Al Jawn that includes three islands.

[[File:Diamond and graphite.jpg|thumb|193x193px|[[Diamond]] and [[graphite]] are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in crystalline structure.]]

'''Allotropy''' or '''allotropism''' ({{ety|gre|''ἄλλος'' (allos)|other||''τρόπος'' (tropos)|manner, form}}) is the property of some [[chemical element]]s to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical [[State of matter|state]], known as ''allotropes'' of these elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Allotrope|file=A00243|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atom]]s of the element are [[chemical bond|bonded]] together in a different manner. For example, the [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[diamond]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[state of matter|phase]] (i.e.:  [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]] states); differences in these states alone would not constitute examples of allotropy.

For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae despite difference in phase; for example, two [[allotropes of oxygen]] ([[oxygen|dioxygen]], O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Conversely, some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases; for example, [[phosphorus]] has [[allotropes of phosphorus|numerous solid allotropes]], which all revert to the same P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; form when melted to the liquid state.

==History==
The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779–1848).&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{citation | last = Jensen | first = W. B. | title = The Origin of the Term Allotrope | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | year = 2006 | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 838–39 | doi = 10.1021/ed083p838|bibcode = 2006JChEd..83..838J }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived {{ety|gre|''άλλοτροπἱα'' (allotropia)|variability, changeableness}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = allotropy | title = A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles | volume = 1 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1888 | page = 238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of [[Avogadro's law|Avogadro's hypothesis]] in 1860, it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; In the early 20th century, it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.

By 1912, [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]] noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, [[IUPAC]] and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2006, citing Addison, W. E. The Allotropy of the Elements (Elsevier 1964) that many have repeated this advice.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in properties of an element's allotropes==
Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]]. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure [[Allotropes of iron|(ferrite)]] to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906&amp;nbsp;°C, and [[tin]] undergoes a modification known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metal]]lic form to a [[semiconductor]] form below 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C (55.8&amp;nbsp;°F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==List of allotropes==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

Typically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to [[catenation|catenate]].

Examples of allotropes include:

* [[Allotropes of plutonium|Plutonium]] has six distinct solid allotropes under "normal" pressures. Their densities vary within a ratio of some 4:3, which vastly complicates all kinds of work with the metal (particularly casting, machining, and storage). A seventh plutonium allotrope exists at very high pressures. The transuranium metals Np, Am, and Cm are also allotropic.

== Nanoallotropes ==
In 2017, the concept of nanoallotropy was proposed by Prof. Rafal Klajn of the Organic Chemistry Department of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Udayabhaskararao|first=Thumu|last2=Altantzis|first2=Thomas|last3=Houben|first3=Lothar|last4=Coronado-Puchau|first4=Marc|last5=Langer|first5=Judith|last6=Popovitz-Biro|first6=Ronit|last7=Liz-Marzán|first7=Luis M.|last8=Vuković|first8=Lela|last9=Král|first9=Petr|date=2017-10-27|title=Tunable porous nanoallotropes prepared by post-assembly etching of binary nanoparticle superlattices|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6362/514|journal=Science|language=en|volume=358|issue=6362|pages=514–518|doi=10.1126/science.aan6046|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29074773|bibcode=2017Sci...358..514U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoallotropes, or allotropes of nanomaterials, are nanoporous materials that have the same chemical composition (e.g., Au), but differ in their architecture at the nanoscale (that is, on a scale 10 to 100 times the dimensions of individual atoms).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://israelbds.org/materials-that-dont-exist-in-nature-might-lead-to-new-fabrication-techniques/|title=Materials That Don’t Exist in Nature Might Lead to New Fabrication Techniques|website=israelbds.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such nanoallotropes may help create ultra-small electronic devices and find other industrial applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The different nanoscale architectures translate into different properties, as was demonstrated for [[surface-enhanced Raman scattering]] performed on several different nanoallotropes of gold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A two-step method for generating nanoallotropes was also created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Analysis Situs''''' is a book by the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] mathematician [[Oswald Veblen]], published in 1922. It is based on his 1916 lectures at the Cambridge Colloquium of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. The book, which went into a second edition in 1931, was the first English-language [[textbook]] on [[topology]], and served for many years as the standard reference for the domain. Its contents were based on the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] as well as Veblen's own work with his former student and colleague, [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]].{{sfnp|Hodge|1961|p=508}}

Among the many innovations in the book was the first definition of a [[topological manifold]],{{sfnp|Scholz|1999|p=}} and systematisations of [[Betti number]], [[Whitehead torsion|torsion]], the [[fundamental group]], and the [[topological spaces|topological classification problem]].{{sfnp|Batterson|2007|p=608}}

'''Australian Gas Networks Limited''', formerly '''Envestra Limited''', is an [[Australia]]n energy company that operates natural gas transmission pipelines and distribution networks in [[South Australia]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], and the [[Northern Territory]]. The company owns distribution systems in a number of towns and metropolitan areas including [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Melbourne]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Albury]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Bundaberg]] and [[Whyalla]]. It outsources the operation and management of the assets to the [[APA Group]].

In October 1993, [[Boral]] acquired from the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian government]] [[SAGASCO]], its vertically integrated natural gas monopoly. Boral combined SAGASCO's distribution network with businesses it owned in Queensland to form Envestra, which was [[Initial public offering|floated]] in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aemc.gov.au/Media/docs/First%20Final%20Report%20-%20Appendices-f166c14f-d1da-4307-b738-31706b886415-0.pdf#page=2|title=South Australia's Electricity and Gas Industries|publisher=[[Australian Energy Market Commission]]|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, Envestra acquired part of the former [[Gas and Fuel Corporation]]'s distribution network in Victoria, known as the Stratus distribution network, and renamed it Envestra (Vic).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aemc.gov.au/Energy-Rules/National-gas-rules/Gas-scheme-register/VIC-Envestra-(Vic)-Gas-Network&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, APA Group announced an approach to the board of Envestra with an all-share merger proposal.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In September 2014, Hong Kong-based [[Cheung Kong Group]] bought all the shares in Envestra, including APA's 33.4% stake, while APA retained the operation and management of Envestra's assets until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.com.au/about-apa/history-of-apa.aspx |title=APA Group - History of APA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106043126/http://apa.com.au/about-apa/history-of-apa.aspx |archivedate=November 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the company's name was changed to Australian Gas Networks Limited.

{{Wiktionary|batten}}

A '''batten''' is most commonly a strip of solid material, historically  [[wood]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. "Batten, N.2." Def. 1. ''The Century Dictionary''. Vol. 1. New York: Century, 1889. 476. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also of [[plastic]], [[metal]], or fiberglass.  Battens are variously used in construction, sailing, and other fields.  

In the lighting industry, battens refer to linear fittings, commonly [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] strips or using fluorescent tubes. Batten luminaires are typically of low cost and meant to be fixed directly to structural battens in loft spaces or to ceilings and soffits in back-of-house areas where aesthetic value is not required. The fluorescent options can include a low-spec diffuser cover, or simply be procured with the fluorescent tube exposed.

In the [[steel]] industry, battens used as [[furring]] may also be referred to as "top hats", in reference to the profile of the metal.

==Roofing==
''Roofing battens'' or ''battening'', also called ''roofing [[lath]]'', are used to provide the fixing point for roofing materials such as shingles or tiles.  The spacing of the battens on the [[truss]]es or [[rafter]]s depend on the type of roofing material and are applied horizontally like [[purlin]]s.

Battens are also used in metal roofing to secure the sheets called a ''batten-seam roof'' and are covered with a ''batten roll joint''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/arch/downloads/fig-36.pdf PDF illustrations of a batten being covered with a batten roll joint] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175819/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/arch/downloads/fig-36.pdf |date=April 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some roofs may use a grid of battens in both directions, known as a ''counter-batten system'', which improves ventilation.

==Wall battens==
''Wall battens'' like roofing battens are used to fix [[siding]] materials such as tile or shingles. [[Rainscreen]] construction uses battens (furring) as part of a system which allows walls to dry out more quickly than normal.

===Board-and-batten===
''Board-and-batten'' [[siding]] is an exterior treatment of vertical boards with battens covering the seams. Board-and-batten roofing is a type of [[board roof]] with battens covering the gaps between boards on a roof as the roofing material. Board-and-batten is also a synonym for [[American historic carpentry#Box houses|single-wall construction]], a method of building with vertical, structural boards, the seams sometimes covered with battens.

==Spacers==
Battens may be used as spacers, sometimes called furring, to raise the surface of a material. In flooring the sometimes large battens support the finish flooring&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. "flooring batten". ''Dictionary of Architecture and Building Construction''. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural, 2008. 156. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar manner to a [[joist]] but with the batten resting on a solid sub-floor as a ''[[floating floor]]'' and sometimes cushioned.

==Trim==
''Batten trim'' or ''batten molding'' is a thin strip of [[molding (decorative)|trim]] typically with a rectangular cross-section similar to [[lath]] used in [[latticework|lattice]], used to cover seams between panels of exterior siding or interior paneling.

==Flooring==
In flooring a batten may be relatively large, up to {{convert|2.5|in|cm}} thick by {{convert|7|in|cm}} wide and more than {{convert|6|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref&gt;"batten, n.1". def. 1.a. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Batten doors==
[[File:A Photograph of an Old Door from the Bolduc House in Ste Genevieve MO.png|thumb|A ''batten door''-the battens are the vertical pieces. The horizontal ledges hold the door together.]]
In [[door]] construction ledges and sometimes also braces are used to strengthen the vertical battens.

==Wall insulation==
Battens are used for solid wall insulation. Regularly spaced battens are fitted to the wall, the spaces between them filled with insulation, and plasterboard or drywall screwed to the battens. This method is no longer the most popular, as rigid insulation sheets give better insulation (with battens bridging the insulation) and take less time to fit.

==Screed batten==
In concrete work a ''screed batten'' is fixed to the [[formwork]] to smoothly guide a [[screed]] smoothing tool.

==Sailing==
[[File:Verschiedene Segellatten.jpg|thumb|A selection of sail battens]]
{{Main|Sail batten}}
{{See also|Junk rig}}
In [[sailing]], battens are long, narrow and flexible inserts used in sails, to improve their qualities as airfoils.

'''Cadjan''' are [[woven mat (disambiguation)|woven mats]] made from [[coconut palm]] leaves, used for roofing and walls. Cadjan houses were available in many [[Asia]]n countries in past, but with [[Land development|development]] these houses are now limited to very [[rural area]]s in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and a few other Asian countries.

'''Cadmium selenide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula [[Cadmium|Cd]][[Selenide|Se]].  It is a black to red-black solid that is classified as a [[II-VI semiconductor]] of the [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]].  Much of the current research on cadmium selenide is focused on its [[nanoparticle]]s.

==Structure==
Three crystalline forms of CdSe are known: [[Wurtzite (crystal structure)|wurtzite]] (hexagonal), [[Cubic crystal system#Zincblende structure|sphalerite]] (cubic) and [[Cubic crystal system#Rock-salt structure|rock-salt]] (cubic). The sphalerite CdSe structure is unstable and converts to the wurtzite form upon moderate heating. The transition starts at about 130&amp;nbsp;°C, and at 700&amp;nbsp;°C it completes within a day. The rock-salt structure is only observed under high pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=202| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty5Ymlg_Mh0C&amp;pg=PA202| title=Semiconductor materials|author= Lev Isaakovich Berger| publisher= CRC Press|year = 1996| isbn =0-8493-8912-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The production of cadmium selenide has been carried out in two different ways. The preparation of bulk crystalline CdSe is done by the High-Pressure Vertical Bridgman method or High-Pressure Vertical Zone Melting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sttic.com.ru/lpcbc/Basics.html II-VI compound crystal growth, HPVB &amp; HPVZM basics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadmium selenide may also be produced in the form of [[nanoparticles]]. (see applications for explanation) Several methods for the production of CdSe nanoparticles have been developed: arrested precipitation in solution, synthesis in structured media, high temperature pyrolysis, sonochemical, and radiolytic methods are just a few.&lt;ref name=didenko&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja054124t|date=Sep 2005|author1=Didenko, Yt |author2=Suslick, Ks |title=Chemical aerosol flow synthesis of semiconductor nanoparticles.|volume=127|issue=35|pages=12196–7|issn=0002-7863|pmid=16131177|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/nl202892p|date=Sep 2011|author1=Haitao Zhang |author2=Bo Hu |author3=Liangfeng Sun |author4=Robert Hovden |author5=Frank W.

[[File:CdSe Nanoparticle.png|thumb|Atomic resolution image of a CdSe nanoparticle.&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;]]

Production of cadmium selenide by arrested precipitation in solution is performed by introducing alkylcadmium and trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) precursors into a heated solvent under controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/ja00072a025| title=Synthesis and characterization of nearly monodisperse CdE (E = sulfur, selenium, tellurium) semiconductor nanocrystallites| year=1993| author=Murray, C.

:Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cd + TOPSe → CdSe + (byproducts)
CdSe nanoparticles can be modified by production of two phase materials with ZnS coatings.  The surfaces can be further modified, e.g. with mercaptoacetic acid, to confer solubility.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Somers | first1 = Rebecca C. | last2 = Bawendi | first2 = Moungi G. | last3 = Nocera | first3 = Daniel G. | year = 2007 | title = CdSe nanocrystal based chem-/bio- sensors | url = | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 579–591 | doi = 10.1039/B517613C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthesis in structured environments refers to the production of cadmium selenide in [[liquid crystal]] or [[surfactant]] solutions. The addition of surfactants to solutions often results in a phase change in the solution leading to a liquid crystallinity. A liquid crystal is similar to a solid crystal in that the solution has long range translational order. Examples of this ordering are layered alternating sheets of solution and surfactant, [[micelles]], or even a hexagonal arrangement of rods.

High temperature pyrolysis synthesis is usually carried out using an [[aerosol]] containing a mixture of volatile cadmium and selenium precursors. The precursor aerosol is then carried through a furnace with an inert gas, such as [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[argon]]. In the furnace the precursors react to form CdSe as well as several by-products.&lt;ref name=didenko/&gt;

==CdSe nanoparticles==
[[File:CdSeqdots.jpg|thumb|right|A photograph and representative spectrum of [[photoluminescence]] from colloidal CdSe [[quantum dots]] excited by UV light.]]
CdSe-derived [[nanoparticles]] with sizes below 10&amp;nbsp;nm exhibit a property known as [[quantum confinement]]. Quantum confinement results when the electrons in a material are confined to a very small volume. Quantum confinement is size dependent, meaning the properties of CdSe nanoparticles are tunable based on their size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringsurf.com/info/Technology_/Nanotechnology/Structures/ Nanotechnology Structures – Quantum Confinement]&lt;/ref&gt;  One type of CdSe nanoparticle is a CdSe [[quantum dot]].  This discretization of energy states results in electronic transitions that vary by quantum dot size.  Larger quantum dots have closer electronic states than smaller quantum dots which means that the energy required to excite an electron from HOMO to the LUMO is lower than the same electronic transition in a smaller quantum dot.  This quantum confinement effect can be observed as a red shift in absorbance spectra for nanocrystals with larger diameters.

CdSe quantum dots have been implemented in a wide range of applications including solar cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robel | first1 = I. | last2 = Subramanian | first2 = V. | last3 = Kuno | first3 = M. | last4 = Kamat | first4 = P.V. | year = 2006 | title = Quantum Dot Solar Cells.

CdSe-based materials also have potential uses in biomedical imaging. Human tissue is permeable to near [[infra-red]] light. By injecting appropriately prepared CdSe nanoparticles into injured tissue, it may be possible to image the tissue in those injured areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chan, W.

CdSe quantum dots are usually composed of a CdSe core and a ligand shell.  Ligands play important roles in the stability and solubility of the nanoparticles.  During synthesis, ligands stabilize growth to prevent aggregation and precipitation of the nanocrystals.  These capping ligands also affect the quantum dot’s electronic and optical properties by passivating surface electronic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = C.

Mater. | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 49–54 | doi=10.1021/cm0304243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of the ligands on the surface and the length of the ligand chain affect the separation between nanocrystal cores which in turn influence [[stacking (chemistry)|stacking]] and [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]].  Understanding the surface structure of CdSe quantum dots in order to investigate the structure’s unique properties and for further functionalization for greater synthetic variety requires a rigorous description of the ligand exchange chemistry on the quantum dot surface.

A prevailing belief is that [[trioctylphosphine oxide]] (TOPO) or [[trioctylphosphine]] (TOP), a neutral ligand derived from a common precursor used in the synthesis of CdSe dots, caps the surface of CdSe quantum dots.  However, results from recent studies challenge this model.  Using NMR, quantum dots have been shown to be nonstoichiometric meaning that the cadmium to selenide ratio is not one to one.  CdSe dots have excess cadmium cations on the surface that can form bonds with anionic species such as carboxylate chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Park | first2 = J. | last3 = Trudeau | first3 = P.E. | last4 = Alivisatos | first4 = A.

Soc. | volume = 130 | issue = 37| pages = 12279–12281 | doi=10.1021/ja804414f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CdSe quantum dot would be charge unbalanced if TOPO or TOP were indeed the only type of ligand bound to the dot.

The CdSe ligand shell may contain both X type ligands which form [[covalent bond]]s with the metal and L type ligands that form [[dative bond]]s.  It has been shown that these ligands can undergo exchange with other ligands.  Examples of X type ligands that have been studied in the context of CdSe nanocrystal surface chemistry are sulfides and thiocyanates.  Examples of L type ligands that have been studied are amines and phosphines (ref).  A ligand exchange reaction in which tributylphosphine ligands were displaced by primary alkylamine ligands on chloride terminated CdSe dots has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Owen | first2 = J. S. | year = 2013 | title = Soluble, Chloride-Terminated CdSe Nanocrystals: Ligand Exchange Monitored by 1H and 31P NMR Spectroscopy | url = | journal = Chem. Mater. | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 69–76 | doi=10.1021/cm303219a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoichiometry changes were monitored using proton and phosphorus NMR.  [[Photoluminescence]] properties were also observed to change with ligand moiety.  The amine bound dots had significantly higher photoluminescent [[quantum yield]]s than the phosphine bound dots.

==Applications==
CdSe material is transparent to infra-red (IR) light and has seen limited use in [[photoresistor]]s and in windows for instruments utilizing IR light. The material is also highly luminescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Efros | first1 = Al.

==Safety information==
Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal and appropriate precautions should be taken when handling it and its compounds. Selenides are toxic in large amounts.  Cadmium selenide is a known carcinogen to humans and medical attention should be sought if swallowed or if contact with skin or eyes occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Additional safety information available at www.msdsonline.com, search 'cadmium selenide' (must register to use).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sttic.com.ru/lpcbc/DANDP/cdsemsds.html CdSe Material Safety Data Sheet]. sttic.com.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capacitor vehicle''' or '''capa vehicle''' is a traction [[vehicle]] that uses [[supercapacitor]]s (also called ultracapacitors) to store electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US20120056600 Capacitor vehicle having high speed charging ability and method of operating a capacitor vehicle]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2010}}, the best ultracapacitors can only store about 5% of the energy that [[lithium-ion]] rechargeable batteries can, limiting them to a couple of miles per charge. This makes them ineffective as a general energy storage medium for passenger vehicles. But ultracapacitors can charge much faster than [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], so in vehicles such as [[bus]]es that have to stop frequently at known points where charging facilities can be provided, energy storage based exclusively on [[ultracapacitor]]s becomes viable&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/415773/next-stop-ultracapacitor-buses/?a=f |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses |publisher=MIT |work=MIT Technology Review |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=2013-04-13 |last=Hamilton |first=Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabus==
{{Further information|Battery electric bus}}
[[Image:Expo 2010 Electric Bus.jpg|thumb|Capabus recharging at the bus stop]]
[[China]] is experimenting with a new form of electric bus, known as ''Capabus'', which runs without continuous [[overhead lines]] (is an autonomous vehicle) by using power stored in large onboard [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s (EDLCs), which are quickly recharged whenever the vehicle stops at any [[bus stop]] (under so-called '''electric umbrellas'''), and fully charged in the [[bus terminus|terminus]].

A few [[prototype]]s were being tested in Shanghai in early 2005. In 2006 two commercial bus routes began to use electric double-layer capacitor buses; one of them is route 11 in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.52bus.com/article/special/200608/special_6.html |script-title=zh:超级电容公交车专题 |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105022719/http://www.52bus.com/article/special/200608/special_6.html |archivedate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 [[Sinautec Automobile Technologies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinautecus.com |title=SINAUTEC, Automobile Technology, LLC |publisher=Sinautecus.com |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and its Chinese partner [[Shanghai Aowei Technology Development Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aowei.com/english/index.htm |title=Aowei Technology |publisher=aowei.com |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125014115/http://www.aowei.com/english/index.htm |archivedate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are testing, with 17 forty-one seat Ultracap Buses serving the Greater Shanghai area since 2006 without any major technical problems.&lt;ref name="treehugger.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Richard |first=Michael |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/10/ultracapacitor-electric-buses-china.php |title=Ultracapacitor Buses Work...

The buses have very predictable routes and need to stop regularly every {{convert|3|mi}} or less, allowing quick recharging at [[charging station]]s at bus stops. A collector on the top of the bus rises a few feet and touches an overhead charging line at the stop; within a couple of minutes the ultracapacitor banks stored under the bus seats are fully charged. The buses can also capture energy from braking, and the company says that recharging stations can be equipped with solar panels. A third generation of the product, which will give {{convert|20|mi}} of range per charge or better is planned.&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"/&gt;

Sinautec estimates that one of its buses has one-tenth the energy cost of a diesel bus and can achieve lifetime fuel savings of $200,000. The buses use 40% less electricity even when compared to an electric [[trolley bus]], mainly because they are lighter{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The ultracapacitors are made of [[activated carbon]] and have an [[energy density]] of six watt-hours per kilogram (for comparison a high-performance lithium-ion battery can achieve 200 watt-hours per kilogram, but the ultracapacitor bus is about 40% cheaper than a lithium-ion battery bus and far more reliable).&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treehugger.com"/&gt;

There is also a [[plug-in hybrid]] version, which also uses ultracaps.

[[Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens|RATP]], the public-owned company that manages most of [[Paris]]' public transport system, is currently performing tests using a hybrid bus outfitted with ultracapacitors. The model, called [[Lion's City Hybrid]], is supplied by German manufacturer [[MAN SE|MAN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/04/15/paris-tests-a-new-hybrid-bus-that-uses-ultracapacitors/ |last=Navarro |first=Xavier |title=Paris tests a new hybrid bus that uses ultracapacitors |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=2013-10-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401103027/http://green.autoblog.com/2009/04/15/paris-tests-a-new-hybrid-bus-that-uses-ultracapacitors/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foton America Bus is in talks with [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and some towns in [[Florida]] about trialing the buses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[GSP Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] has launched the first bus line operated solo by super-capacitor buses from Chinese manufacturer Higer Bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/NewJsp/news.jsp?fileId=372911|title=Newscontent|website=newscontent.cctv.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 the public transport authority of the city of [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]] is also performing tests on a capabus made by Higer.

===Pantographs and  underbody collectors at bus stops===
[[Pantograph (rail)|Pantographs]] and underbody collectors are integrated in [[bus stop]]s to quick electric bus recharge, making possible to use a smaller battery on the bus, which reduces the investment and subsequent costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/eae3e161cc498140c1257b7b00552bcd.aspx Large-capacity, flash-charging, battery-powered pilot bus takes to the street.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schunk-sbi.com/en/sbi/ElektrobusStromabnehmer/schunk01.c.78265.en Current collectors for electric busses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2014/10/giant-charger-juices-electric-buses-three-minutes/ A Giant Charger That Juices Up Electric Buses in Three Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://revolution-green.com/ultrafast-electric-bus-charging/ Ultrafast Electric Bus Charging], [[Opbrid]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subway and tram==
In a [[subway car]] or [[tram]], an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] at a track switch may cut off power from the car for a few feet along the line and  use a large capacitor to store energy to drive the subway car through the insulator in the power feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/lc/capac1.htm# |title=Capacitors |access-date=10 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023326/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/LC/Capac1.htm# |archive-date=9 March 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[Trams in Nanjing|Nanjing tram]] uses the supercapacitor technology, with charging hardware at each stop instead of continuous catenary. The first line started operating in 2014. The rail vehicles were produced by [[CSR Corporation Limited|CSR Zhuzhou]]; according to the manufacturers, they are the world's first low-floor tram completely powered by  supercapacitors.

The company is set to receive £376,000 from the DTI in the UK for a project entitled “next generation supercapacitors for hybrid vehicle applications”. The project also involves [[Johnson Matthey]] and [[HILTech Developments]]. The project will use supercapacitor technology to improve hybrid electric vehicles and increase overall energy efficiency

===Future developments ===
Sinautec is in discussions with [[MIT]]'s Schindall about developing ultracapacitors of higher energy density using vertically aligned [[carbon nanotube]] structures that give the devices more surface area for holding a charge. So far they are able to get twice the energy density of an existing ultracapacitor, but they are trying to get about five times. This would create an ultracapacitor with one-quarter of the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Tyler |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23754/page2/ |title=Next Stop: Ultracapacitor Buses - Page 2 &amp;#124;  |publisher=MIT |work=MIT Technology Review |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future developments includes the use of [[inductive charging]] under the street, to avoid overhead wiring. A [[wikt:pad|pad]] under each [[bus stop]] and at each [[stop light]] along the way would be used.

==Motor racing==
The [[FIA]], the governing body for many [[motor racing]] events, proposed in the ''Power-Train Regulation Framework for [[Formula 1]]'' version 1.3 of 23 May 2007 that a new set of [[power train]] regulations be issued that includes a hybrid drive of up to 200&amp;nbsp;kW input and output power using "superbatteries" made with both batteries and supercapacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/07images/f1/fia/332668895__2011_Power_Train_Regulation_Framework.pdf |title=Formula One 2011: Power-Train Regulation Framework |last1=Goeschel |first1=Burkhard |last2=Mosley |first2=Max |date=24 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217191558/http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/07images/f1/fia/332668895__2011_Power_Train_Regulation_Framework.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Research Institute of  Electric Power Industry''' ('''CRIEPI'''; 電力中央研究所) is a [[Japan]]ese [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|non-profit foundation]] that conducts research and development of technologies in a variety of scientific and technical fields related to the electric power industry. Also, CRIEPI researches many aspects of social matters through subordinate laboratories. CRIEPI not only engages in research and education in Japan, but also provides education, training and [[technology transfer]] worldwide.

It is similar to the [[United States|U.S.]] [[EPRI]], though its energy research extends into areas that could be considered to be in the domain of the [[USDOE]]'s [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|national laboratories]] in the United States, such as research and design of fission reactor concepts.

In 2004, CRIEPI developed a U.S. presence due to the proposed [[Galena Nuclear Power Plant]] in Galena, Alaska, that is proposed to use an advanced reactor design&amp;nbsp;– the [[Toshiba 4S]]&amp;nbsp;– developed by Toshiba Corporation and CRIEPI.

{{nihongo|'''The Chugoku Electric Power Company, Incorporated'''|中国電力株式会社|Chūgoku Denryoku Kabushiki-gaisha}} is an electric utility with its exclusive operational area of [[Chūgoku region]] of [[Japan]]. It is the sixth largest by electricity sales among Japan’s ten regional power utilities.&lt;ref name="fepcstat" /&gt; It operates the [[Shimane Nuclear Power Plant]].

In 1982, Chugoku Electric Power Company proposed building a [[nuclear power plant]] near the island of [[Iwaishima]], but many residents opposed the idea, and the island’s fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. In January 1983, almost 400 islanders staged a protest march, which was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders carried out. Since the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in March 2011 there has been wider opposition to construction plans for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/world/asia/28nuclear.html |title=Japanese Island’s Activists Resist Nuclear Industry’s Allure |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=August 27, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://santarosa.loweselectrician.com/ |title=Electric Power Company Operational Area |author=Juliet Ledesma |date=December 20, 2013 |work=Lowes Electric Power Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric motorsport''' (also known as '''electric racing''' or '''electric motor racing''') is a category of motor sport that consists of the racing of electric powered vehicles for competition, either in all-electric series, or in open-series against vehicles with different power trains. Very early in the history of automobiles, electric cars held several performance records over [[internal combustion engine]] cars, such as [[Land speed record#1898.E2.80.931965 .28wheel-driven.29|land speed records]], but fell behind in performance during the first decade of the 20th century. With the renaissance of electric vehicles during the early 21st century, notable electric-only racing series have been developed, for both cars and motorcycles, including for example, the [[FIA Formula E Championship]]. In other racing events, electric vehicles are competing alongside combustion engine vehicles, for example in the [[Isle of Man TT]] and the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], and in some cases winning outright.

==History==

===Background and early powertrains===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Goldsworthy Gurney steam carriage - Project Gutenberg eText 12496.png|thumb|The [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]], in an 1827 illustration.]]
see also: [[History of the steam engine]] and [[Locomotive#Origins|Origins of the locomotive]]

Early mechanically powered vehicles used steam power, a technology first developed for static applications (notably, [[Thomas Newcomen]] 1712 and [[James Watt]] 1765) (see [[History of the steam engine]]). Steam for vehicle traction was taken up both for road vehicles and for rail by [[Richard Trevithick]] who creating the [[Richard Trevithick#Puffing Devil|Puffing devil]] for transporting passengers by road in 1801, and later rail transport, initially for coal (1804) and then for people (Trevethick 1808, [[George Stephenson]] 1824 onwards).  By the 1830s steam began to be more widely adopted for transportation, with steam carriages for road (e.g. the 1827 [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]]) and for rail, although the latter quickly became more established for medium and longer distance travel. Mechanically powered road vehicles were largely limited to utilitarian vehicles such as [[traction engine]]s during this period (especially 1850s onwards, see [[History of steam road vehicles#Victorian Age of Steam|History of steam road vehicles]]).

[[File:Thomas Parker Electric car.jpg|thumb|Electric car built by [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]] ]]

During the 1860s diverse small experiments with personal transportation and different powertrains blossomed, with steam buggies (e.g. [[History of steam road vehicles#Henry Taylor.27s steam buggy|Henry Taylor]] 1867) and even steam motorcycles ([[History of steam road vehicles#Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede|Michaex-Perreux]] and [[History of steam road vehicles#Sylvester H. Roper|Sylvester Roper]], both around 1867-69). [[Amédée Bollée]] developed several long distance (Le Mans to Paris, 210&amp;nbsp;km) steam vehicles from 1873 onwards, including the 1878 [[Amédée Bollée#La Mancelle|La Mancelle]] of which 50 were produced, and the 1881 [[Amédée Bollée#La Rapide|La Rapide]] capable of 62&amp;nbsp;km/h (39&amp;nbsp;mph). An early electric powertrain was exhibited in November 1881 by French inventor [[Gustave Trouvé]] at the [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris|International Exhibition of Electricity in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wakefield|first=Ernest H.|title=History of the Electric Automobile|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|year=1994|isbn=978-1-56091-299-6|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English inventor [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]], who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the [[London Underground]], overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel [[coalite]], built the first production electric car in [[London]] in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5212278/Worlds-first-electric-car-built-by-Victorian-inventor-in-1884.html  |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=World's first electric car built by Victorian inventor in 1884 |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-07-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects [[smoke]] and [[pollution]] were having in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/hybrid-technology/history-of-electric-cars1.htm |title=What is the history of electric cars? |last=Fuller |first=John |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-04-09 |access-date=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline-powered]] internal combustion engine automobiles were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in [[Mannheim]].  Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886, and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after [[Bertha Benz]], his wife, had proved - with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back (194&amp;nbsp;km) - that the horseless coach was absolutely suitable for daily use.

Overall, there were a variety of powertrains and vehicle forms experimented with during this period, each with different advantages and disadvantages, range, reliability and speed. In terms of outright performance, different powertrains competed for the land speed record through the turn of the 20th century (see below), and it was not until 1924 onwards that internal combustion powertrains began to dominate this aspect.

===Early land speed records===
[[File:Jamais contente.jpg|thumb|[[La Jamais Contente]] electric, 1899]]
{{Main|Land speed record}}

The table below details the early history of land speed records from 1898 into the early decades of the 20th century. ''[[La Jamais Contente]]'' ({{lang-en|The Never Satisfied}}) was the first road vehicle to go over {{convert|100|km/h}}. It was an [[electric car|electric vehicle]] with a [[light alloy]] [[torpedo]] shaped bodywork and with Fulmen [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. The vehicle established the [[land speed record]] on April 29 or May 1, 1899 at [[Achères, Yvelines]] near [[Paris]], [[France]].  The vehicle had two direct drive Postel-Vinay 25&amp;nbsp;kW motors, running at 200 V drawing 124 Amperes each&lt;ref name=pdf1&gt;{{cite web | title= La Jamais Contente | url = http://www.e-mobile.ch/pdf/2005/Fact-Sheet_LaJamaisContente_FW.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EV Zero? |publisher=EV1 Club |url=http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |accessdate=2006-10-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012220024/http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |archivedate=2006-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for about 68&amp;nbsp;hp, and was equipped with [[Michelin]] [[tires]].

As of 1900, 38% of US automobiles, 33,842 cars, were powered by electricity (40% by steam, and 22% by gasoline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Evolution of Electric Cars |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |publisher=Sustainnovate |url=http://sustainnovate.ae/en/innovators-blog/detail/evolution-of-electric-cars |access-date=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as combustion powertrains developed, they offered a superior range than electrics, and (especially after the 1908 [[Ford Model T]], and its mass production from 1913 onwards) a much lower purchase price. In 1912 the electric starter motor was invented by [[Charles F. Kettering|Charles Kettering]] leading to easier and faster starting of internal combustion powertrains, and removing what had been perceived as one of their main drawbacks (having to use a hand crank). Electric and subsequently steam still had some performance advantages and dominated the outright speed record until 1924.  Yet the combustion engine technology benefitted from much greater market penetration and thus more development, and began to achieve greater speed performance than electrics and stream from 1924 onwards.

===21st century renaissance===
{{Main|History of the electric vehicle}}
The emergence of higher volume manufacturing of electric powertrain vehicles has allowed for economies of scale and increased research and development of electrical batteries, the critical technology in electric powertrains. Battery power density (the amount of energy stored per unit weight) has typically been the greatest drawback of electric powertrains in comparison to gasoline combustion engine powertrains. Steady advances in battery technology, [[Research in lithium-ion batteries|especially lithium-ion battery technologies]] first commercialized in the early 1990s have driven innovations in electric powertrains, and further battery advances allow them to once again compete with the combustion engine powertrains in motorsports events.

[[Electric drag racing]] is a sport where electric vehicles start from standstill and attempt the highest possible speed over a short given distance.&lt;ref name="0EX1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.0-60mag.com/news/2010/12/cars-peugeot-ex1-sets-new-electric-records/ |title=Concept Or Not, Peugeot EX1 Is One Fast EV |work=0-60mag |date=December 2010|accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes race and usually beat gasoline sports cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MythBuster: Why Electric Vehicles Beat Gas in 5 Extreme Tests |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a3244/4264025/ |publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[NEDRA]] keep track of records worldwide using certified equipment.

At the [[Formula Student]] competition at the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in July 2013, the electric powered car of the [[ETH Zurich]] won against all cars with internal combustion engines. It is believed to be the first time that an electric vehicle has beaten cars powered by combustion engines in any accredited motorsport competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric vehicle storms to victory in Formula Student 2013 |url=http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |publisher=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |accessdate=2013-07-12 |date=2013-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515111913/http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an electric car won all places of the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]]. Also in that year the second place on all classes was won by an electric car. Already in 2014, electric cars had won second and third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gizmag.com/electric-cars-pikes-peak-winner/38214/ |title=Electric power lights up Pikes Peak |first=Scott |last=Collie |work=GizMag |location=Australia |date=2015-06-29 |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.9news.com/story/sports/2015/06/28/pikes-peak-hill-climb-rhys-millen-electric-car/29437641/ |title=Electric car wins title at Pikes Peak race |work=9News |location=US |date=2015-06-29 |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/06/28/2015-pikes-peak-hill-climb-results/ |title=Rhys Millen wins Pikes Peak under all-electric power |first=Domenick |last=Yoney |work=AutoBlog |location=US |date=2015-06-28 |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, a pure electric car participated in the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]] and completed the entire route of {{convert|9000|km|mi|abbr=on}} through Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The vehicle had been specially designed and built for the race. The car had a 250&amp;nbsp;kW engine (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and a 150 kWh battery. The battery consisted of several modules.

===Pikes Peak International Hill Climb===
{{main|Pikes Peak International Hill Climb}}

The [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], also known as ''The Race to the Clouds'', is an annual automobile and motorcycle [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] to the summit of [[Pikes Peak]] in Colorado, USA. The track measures {{convert|12.42|mi|km}} over 156 turns, climbing {{convert|4720|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at {{convert|14110|ft|m|abbr=on}}, on grades averaging 7.2%.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;''PPIHC race overview'', {{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727131916/http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |archivedate=2014-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916, making it the second oldest motorsport event in the Western Hemisphere behind the Indianapolis 500.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. In the modern era, electric vehicles have competed in the event since 1983 (Joe Balls, Sears Electric car). In the 2-wheeled divisions, the electric powertrains are already able to outcompete the combustion engines; the 2013 overall winner was an electric bike, the [[Lightning Motorcycle]] [[Lightning LS-218|LS-218 electric Superbike]] ridden by Carlin Dunne in a time of 10:00.694 minutes, a new course record for the 2-wheeled class.

In the 4-Wheeled Divisions, the results of recent years show that the relative improvements in race time are advancing at different rates in the electric classes compared to the unlimited/combustion engine classes. Unlimited class vehicles, with combustion engines, broke the 16 minute barrier in 1938, and have steadily improved over the subsequent decades, breaking the 10-minute barrier in 2011.&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/race_winners_by_year/ |title=Race winners by year |website=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the electric vehicle class broke the 16 minute barrier in 1994 (Katy Endicott, Honda Civic Shuttle finishing in 15:44:71 minutes), and the 10-minute barrier in 2013 (Nabuhiro 'Monster' Tajima, E-Runner finishing in 9:46:53 minutes).&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"/&gt; In the 2014 event, the Mitsubishi team ([[Mitsubishi MiEV Evolution|MiEV Evolution III]]) achieved 2nd (Greg Tracey, 9:08.188 minutes) and 3rd position (Hiroshi Masuoka, 9:12:204 minutes) - within 3 seconds and 7 seconds (respectively) of the overall fastest vehicle, a gasoline powered Norma race car.&lt;ref name="LiveTiming.net PPIHC results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |website=Live Timing |publisher=North Country Timing &amp; Scoring and LiveTiming.net |location=US |access-date=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716194314/http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |archivedate=2014-07-16 |df= |title=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb 2018&lt;br&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graph to the right shows the relative rates of improvement of these two classes since the 1980s.

2015 for the first time in the history of the race was an electric car to win the race outright. The winning car was the Latvian team [[Drive eO]]'s 3rd generation vehicle, eO PP03 with peak power of 1020&amp;nbsp;kW and peak torque of 2160 Nm, weighing 1200&amp;nbsp;kg. The time achieved was 9:07.222 minutes, just faster than Greg Tracey's 9:08.188 time in 2014. Second place was also earned by an electric car, the Tajima [[Rimac Automobili]] [[Rimac E-Runner Concept One|E-Runner Concept_One]] with peak power of 1100&amp;nbsp;kW, peak torque of 1500 Nm, and weighing 1500&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.electricautosport.com/2015/06/tajima-and-rimac-reveal-1100kw-electric-pikes-peak-racer-photos-and-specs/ |title=Tajima and Rimac reveal 1100kW electric Pikes Peak racer + photos and specs |first=Tim |last=Biesbrouck |work=Electric Autosport |date=2015-06-01 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning driver [[Rhys Millen]] said in an interview that the vehicle had lost half its tractive power (due to heat) from around the halfway point. Based on testing the team had expected a run 30 seconds faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMjsAMlXGBI |title=Rhys Millen Wins Pikes Peak First Electric Car Victory |via=YouTube |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the two above teams and drivers raced again in 2016, with evolutions of the vehicles, and were joined by a prototype '4-motor EV' from Acura based on the 2016 NSX production car, with heavy modifications to all-electric drive. The Acura, driven by Tetsuya Yamano, achieved a remarkable time for its first outing, finishing in 9:06:015 minutes, and third place overall. [[Drive eO]]'s 4th generation vehicle, eO PP100 achieved a time of 8:57:118 minutes, improving on the previous year's time and coming second overall. The winning 2016 vehicle was a combustion engine Norma driven by [[Romain Dumas]] with a time 8:51:445 minutes. The Norma has similar power to weight ratio to the PP100, but weighs half as much and as a result has better traction in corners. Dumas' team also won in an earlier version of the same vehicle in 2014 with a time of 9:05:801 minutes, thus improving by some 14 seconds over 2 years technological evolution. The Drive eO vehicle improved by some 10 seconds in one year, over its 2015 time.

In 2018, the outright winner was the all electric I.D. R Pikes Peak Prototype driven by Romain Dumas, in new overall record time 7:57.148 minutes. The previous track record stood at 8:13.878 minutes, driven by Sébastien Loeb in the 2013 [[Peugeot 208]] T16 Pikes Peak. Now that electrics have overtaken the performance of gasoline cars on Pike's Peak, it seems likely that electric cars will continue to dominate this race from 2018 onwards. Electric cars are still relatively early in their motorsport development with much room for further improvement, whereas gasoline powered cars have had over a century of development, with only incremental improvements likely to come in the future.

===Isle of Man TT===
{{main|Isle of Man TT|TT Zero}}

TT Zero is part of the [[Isle of Man TT]] and races for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the [[Snaefell Mountain Course]]. The TT Zero event as an officially sanctioned [[Isle of Man TT]] race is for [[racing motorcycle]]s where "''The technical concept is for motorcycles (two wheeled) to be powered without the use of carbon based fuels and have zero toxic/noxious emissions''."&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' p27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural 2010 TT Zero race was won by [[Mark Miller (TT motorcycle racer)|Mark Miller]] riding a [[MotoCzysz E1pc]] motor-cycle in 23 minutes and 22.89 seconds at an average race speed of 96.820&amp;nbsp;mph for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the Mountain Course and the first [[United States]] winner since Dave Roper won the 1984 Historic TT riding a 500cc [[Matchless]]. The TT Zero race replaced the [[TTXGP]] franchise with the simplification of the regulations&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races – Official Programme May 29–11 June 2010'' page 14 Isle of Man Department of Community, Culture &amp; Leisure – ACU Events Ltd (2010) Mannin Media Group Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; and the emphasis on electric powered motor-cycles.&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' Appendix C page 25–27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MotoCzysz]] [[MotoCzysz E1pc|E1pc]] was also the first [[United States|American]] manufactured motor-cycle to win an Isle of Man TT Race since Oliver Godfrey won the [[1911 Isle of Man TT|1911]] [[Senior TT]] with an [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] V-Twin motor-cycle.

The riders of the TT Zero bikes are typically those that also compete in the combustion engine classes and are very experienced on the circuit. Comparing the experience of the different powertrains, Lee Johnston said as he climbed off his electric bike in the 2015 practice sessions: “That was just mint. It feels so stable, it’s unbelievable. It’s just so peaceful. No revving.” Asked for what was memorable, he responded “I think just the peace and quiet and riding over the mountain, no noise and seeing the sunset..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2015/06/06/iomtt-victory-motorcycles-tt-qualifying-report/ |title=Victory Racing Breaks the 100mph Average Lap Speed Barrier on its First TT Practice Session |work=Cycle World |location=US |date=2015-06-06 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TT Zero lap speeds have been improving at an average rate of around 2&amp;nbsp;mph in recent years (121.824&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). With more mature technology, the combustion engine bikes' [[Isle of Man TT#Fastest race lap by year|lap speeds]] in the mainstream TT have been improving at a lower rate of around 1&amp;nbsp;mph each year in recent years (135.452&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). It's likely that the electric bikes will surpass the combustion bikes at some point, but it may not happen until the mid to late 2020s.

===FIA World Endurance Championship===
[[File:Nissan Zeod RC.JPG|thumb|Nissan ZEOD RC, first electric vehicle to complete a lap of Le Mans]]
{{main|FIA World Endurance Championship}}

The [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] is an [[auto racing]] [[world championship]] organized by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) and sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  The series usurps the ACO's former [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] which began in [[2010 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup|2010]], and is the first endurance series of world championship status since the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] at the end of [[1992 World Sportscar Championship season|1992]].  The World Endurance Championship name was previously used by the FIA from [[World Sportscar Championship|1981 to 1985]].

The series feature multiple classes of cars competing in [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance races]], with [[sports prototype]]s competing in the [[Le Mans Prototype]] categories, and production-based [[grand tourer]]s competing in the [[LM GTE]] categories.  World champion titles are awarded to the top scoring manufacturers and drivers over the season,&lt;ref name="FIA WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | title = 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063434/http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIA WMSC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | title = World Motor Sport Council | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063414/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other cups and trophies will be awarded for drivers and [[privateer (motorsport)|private teams]].&lt;ref name="ACO WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | title = The FIA World Endurance Championship is unveiled! | publisher = [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] | work = lemans.org | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616155004/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | archivedate = 2011-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nissan ZEOD RC]] was designed by Ben Bowlby, who previously designed the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] Garage 56 entry [[DeltaWing]] as an employee for DeltaWing Project 56 LLC, a consortium led by Don Panoz. He previously worked for DeltaWing LLC, a Chip Ganassi company created to develop a DeltaWing concept race car for IndyCar. Nissan provided an engine and received naming rights on the Garage 56 entry at the 2012 Le Mans race, as well as and other 2012 American Le Mans Series races

The ZEOD RC had a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric drivetrain]] with [[lithium ion]] battery packs in a chassis similar in design to the DeltaWing.&lt;ref name="ZEOD RC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/108176/ |title=Nissan unveils electric Le Mans Garage 56 car |publisher=[[Haymarket Press]] |work=[[Autosport]] |last=O'Leary |first=Jamie |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a June 22, 2013 article at Autosport.com, Bowlby said: "This is a new car, but it uses the narrow track technology of the DeltaWing and that gives us great efficiency. It is something we understand and it is an efficient way of getting around Le Mans."

At the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the car had to retire during the race's early hours due to a gearbox failure. However it managed to achieve its goals of reaching a speed above 300&amp;nbsp;km/h and completing a lap in [[Circuit de la Sarthe|Le Mans]] using electric power only.

===Rally Paris-Dakar===
{{main|Dakar Rally}}

In January [[2017 Dakar Rally|2017]], a pure electric car participated in the Paris-Dakar Rally and completed the entire route of 9000&amp;nbsp;km through Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The vehicle had been specially designed and built for the race. The car had a 250&amp;nbsp;kW engine (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and a 150 kWh battery. The battery consisted of several modules. Each module could be charged separately by power cable to speed up the charging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oekonews.at/?mdoc_id=1112013 |title=Dakar Rallye: Erstmals 100% elektrisch im Ziel |trans-title=Dakar Rallye: First 100% electric in the finish |work=oekonews [[Süddeutsche Zeitung|Süddeutschen Zeitung]] |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future prospects==

Electric powertrains have advantages over combustion engines in power delivery and vehicle dynamics (especially on motorbikes), but still have range disadvantages in longer races (note that combustion engine vehicle often have to refill energy supply also, e.g. Isle of Man TT bikes refill every two laps). Early electric challengers to combustion engine vehicles are therefore typically in shorter more intensive races such as hill climbs or other limited distance races, or simply in fastest lap times (e.g. around the Isle of Man Snaefell circuit). Nevertheless, for endurance racing, hybrid electric powertrains have also proven their advantages over pure combustion engine powertrains, with recent years at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] all won by the hybrid electric [[Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8433">'''Electrochemiluminescence''' or '''electrogenerated chemiluminescence''' ('''ECL''') is a kind of [[luminescence]] produced during electrochemical reactions in solutions. In electrogenerated chemiluminescence, electrochemically generated intermediates undergo a highly [[exergonic reaction]] to produce an electronically excited state that then emits light upon relaxation to a lower-level state. This wavelength of the emitted photon of light corresponds to the energy gap between these two states.&lt;ref name="Forster"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster RJ, Bertoncello P, Keyes TE | title=Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence | journal=Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry | year=2009 | pages=359–85| volume=2 | pmid=20636067 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-anchem-060908-155305 | doi=10.1146/annurev-anchem-060908-155305|bibcode = 2009ARAC....2..359F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valenti"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valenti G, Fiorani A, Li H, Sojic N, Paolucci F | title=Essential Role of Electrode Materials in Electrochemiluminescence Applications | journal=ChemElectroChem | year=2016 | pages=1990–1997| volume=3 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/celc.201600602/full | doi= 10.1002/celc.201600602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECL excitation can be caused by energetic electron transfer (redox) reactions of electrogenerated species. Such [[luminescence]] excitation is a form of [[chemiluminescence]] where one/all reactants are produced electrochemically on the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence, Edited by Allen J. Bard, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

ECL is usually observed during application of potential (several volts) to electrodes of electrochemical cell that contains solution of luminescent species (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metal complexes, Quantum Dots or [[Nanoparticles]]  &lt;ref name="Nanoparticles"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valenti G, Rampazzo R, Bonacchi S, Petrizza L, Marcaccio M, Montalti M, Prodi L,  Paolucci F | title=Variable Doping Induces Mechanism Swapping in Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence of Ru(bpy)32+ Core−Shell Silica Nanoparticles | journal= J.

In organic solvents both oxidized and reduced forms of luminescent species can be produced at different electrodes simultaneously or at a single one by sweeping its potential between oxidation and reduction. The excitation energy is obtained from recombination of oxidized and reduced species.

In aqueous medium, which is mostly used for analytical applications, simultaneous oxidation and reduction of luminescent species is difficult to achieve due to electrochemical splitting of water itself so the ECL reaction with the coreactants is used. In the later case luminescent species are oxidized at the electrode together with the coreactant which gives a strong reducing agent after some chemical transformations (the oxidative reduction mechanism).

== Applications ==
ECL proved to be very useful in analytical applications as a highly sensitive and selective method. It combines analytical advantages of chemiluminescent analysis (absence of background optical signal) with ease of reaction control by applying electrode potential. As an analytical technique it presents outstanding advantages over other common analytical methods due to its versatility, simplified optical setup compared with [[photoluminescence]] (PL), and good temporal and spatial control compared with [[chemiluminescence]] (CL). Enhanced selectivity of ECL analysis is reached by variation of electrode potential thus controlling species that are oxidized/reduced at the electrode and take part in ECL reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8685">A '''flownet''' is a graphical representation of two-[[dimensional]] steady-state [[groundwater]] flow through [[aquifer]]s.

Construction of a flownet is often used for solving groundwater flow problems where the geometry makes analytical solutions impractical. The method is often used in [[civil engineering]], [[hydrogeology]] or [[soil mechanics]] as a first check for problems of flow under hydraulic structures like [[dam]]s or sheet [[Deep foundation|pile]] walls. As such, a grid obtained by drawing a series of equipotential lines is called a flownet. The flownet is an important tool in analysing two-dimensional irrotational flow problems. Flow net technique is a  graphical representation method.

==Basic method==
The method consists of filling the flow area with stream and equipotential lines, which are everywhere [[perpendicular]] to each other, making a [[curvilinear grid]]. Typically there are two surfaces (boundaries) which are at constant values of potential or hydraulic head (upstream and downstream ends), and the other surfaces are no-flow boundaries (i.e., impermeable; for example the bottom of the dam and the top of an impermeable bedrock layer), which define the sides of the outermost streamtubes (see figure 1 for a stereotypical flownet example).

Mathematically, the process of constructing a flownet consists of [[contour line|contour]]ing the two harmonic or [[analytic function]]s of potential and [[stream function]]. These functions both satisfy the [[Laplace equation]] and the contour lines represent lines of constant head (equipotentials) and lines tangent to flowpaths (streamlines).  Together, the potential function and the stream function form the [[complex potential]], where the potential is the real part, and the stream function is the imaginary part.

The construction of a flownet provides an approximate solution to the flow problem, but it can be quite good even for problems with complex geometries by following a few simple rules (initially developed by [[Philipp Forchheimer]] around 1900, and later formalized by [[Arthur Casagrande]] in 1937) and a little practice:
* streamlines and equipotentials meet at [[right angle]]s (including the boundaries),
* diagonals drawn between the cornerpoints of a flownet will meet each other at [[right angle]]s (useful when near singularities),
* streamtubes and drops in equipotential can be halved and should still make squares (useful when squares get very large at the ends),
* flownets often have areas which consist of nearly [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, which produce true squares; start in these areas &amp;mdash; working towards areas with complex geometry,
* many problems have some [[symmetry]] (e.g., [[wikt:radial|radial]] flow to a [[water well|well]]); only a section of the flownet needs to be constructed,
* the sizes of the squares should change gradually; transitions are smooth and the curved paths should be roughly [[ellipse|elliptical]] or [[Parabola|parabolic]] in shape.

==Example flownets==
The first flownet pictured here (modified from Craig, 1997) illustrates and quantifies the flow which occurs under the [[dam]] (flow is assumed to be invariant along the axis of the dam &amp;mdash; valid near the middle of the dam); from the pool behind the dam (on the right) to the [[tailwater]] downstream from the dam (on the left). 

There are 16 green equipotential lines (15 equal drops in hydraulic head) between the 5 m upstream head to the 1m downstream head (4 m / 15 head drops = 0.267 m head drop between each green line). The blue streamlines (equal changes in the streamfunction between the two no-flow boundaries) show the flowpath taken by water as it moves through the system; the streamlines are everywhere tangent to the flow velocity.

[[Image:flownet pumping well.png|thumb|right|200px|Example flownet 2, '''click to view full-size'''.]]
The second flownet pictured here (modified from Ferris, et al., 1962) shows a flownet being used to analyze map-view flow (invariant in the vertical direction), rather than a cross-section.  Note that this problem has symmetry, and only the left or right portions of it needed to have been done. To create a flownet to a point sink (a singularity), there must be a recharge boundary nearby to provide water and allow a steady-state flowfield to develop.

==Flownet results==
[[Darcy's law]] describes the flow of water through the flownet. Since the head drops are uniform by construction, the gradient is inversely proportional to the size of the blocks.  Big blocks mean there is a low gradient, and therefore low discharge (hydraulic conductivity is assumed constant here).  

An equivalent amount of flow is passing through each streamtube (defined by two adjacent blue lines in diagram), therefore narrow streamtubes are located where there is more flow.  The smallest squares in a flownet are located at points where the flow is concentrated (in this diagram they are near the tip of the cutoff wall, used to reduce dam underflow), and high flow at the land surface is often what the civil engineer is trying to avoid, being concerned about [[Soil mechanics#Seepage: steady state flow of water|piping]] or [[Dam#Examples of dams|dam failure]].

==Singularities==
Irregular points (also called [[mathematical singularity|singularities]]) in the flow field occur when streamlines have kinks in them (the [[derivative]] doesn't exist at a point). This can happen where the bend is outward (e.g., the bottom of the cutoff wall in the figure above), and there is infinite flux at a point, or where the bend is inward (e.g., the corner just above and to the left of the cutoff wall in the figure above) where the flux is zero. 

The second flownet illustrates a [[water well|well]], which is typically represented mathematically as a point source (the well shrinks to zero radius); this is a singularity because the flow is converging to a point, at that point the [[Laplace equation]] is not satisfied.  

These points are mathematical artifacts of the equation used to solve the real-world problem, and do not actually mean that there is infinite or no flux at points in the subsurface.  These types of points often do make other types of solutions (especially numeric) to these problems difficult, while the simple graphical technique handles them nicely.

==Extensions to standard flownets==
Typically flownets are constructed for [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneous]], [[isotropic]] porous media experiencing saturated flow to known boundaries. There are extensions to the basic method to allow some of these other cases to be solved:
* inhomogeneous aquifer: matching conditions at boundaries between properties
* [[anisotropic]] aquifer: drawing the flownet in a transformed domain, then scaling the results differently in the principle hydraulic conductivity directions, to return the solution
* one boundary is a seepage face: iteratively solving for both the boundary condition and the solution throughout the domain

Although the method is commonly used for these types of groundwater flow problems, it can be used for any problem which is described by the [[Laplace equation]] (&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;), for example [[electric current]] flow through the earth.

'''Francium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Fr''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;87. It used to be known as [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[caesium]]. It is extremely [[radioactive]]; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called [[actinium]] K after the natural [[decay chain]] it appears in), has a half-life of only 22&amp;nbsp;minutes. It is the second-least [[electronegative]] element, behind only caesium,&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS, IT IS CORRECT. SEE BELOW. FRANCIUM IS VERY HEAVY, SO THE 7S ELECTRON MOVES SO FAST THAT YOU MUST INCLUDE RELATIVITY! THE EFFECT IS A STABILIZATION OF THE 7S ORBITAL, ENOUGH TO BRING THE ELECTRONEGATIVITY UP ABOVE CAESIUM'S!--&gt; and is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|second rarest]] naturally occurring element (after [[astatine]]). The isotopes of francium decay quickly into [[astatine]], [[radium]], and [[radon]]. As an [[alkali metal]], it has one [[valence electron]].

Bulk francium has never been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.

Francium was discovered by [[Marguerite Perey]] in [[France]] (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.{{efn|Some synthetic elements, like [[technetium]] and [[plutonium]], have later been found in nature.}} Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] ores, where the [[isotope]] francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30&amp;nbsp;g (one ounce) exists at any given time throughout the [[Earth's crust]]; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.&lt;ref name=chemnews/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Francium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a [[half-life]] of only 22&amp;nbsp;minutes. The only comparable element is [[astatine]], whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56&amp;nbsp;seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="andyscouse" /&gt; All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, [[radium]], or [[radon]].&lt;ref name="andyscouse"&gt;{{cite web| last = Price| first = Andy| title = Francium| date = December 20, 2004| url = http://www.andyscouse.com/pages/francium.htm| accessdate = February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, [[dubnium]].&lt;ref name="CRC2006"&gt;{{Cite book |date =2006 |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |volume = 4|page= 12|publisher = CRC|isbn= 0-8493-0474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium.&lt;ref name="CRC2006" /&gt; A heavy element with a single [[valence electron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Winter| first = Mark| title = Electron Configuration| work = Francium| publisher = The University of Sheffield| url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Fr/eneg.html| accessdate = April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has the highest [[equivalent weight]] of any element.&lt;ref name="CRC2006" /&gt; Liquid francium—if created—should have a [[surface tension]] of 0.05092&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]]/m at its melting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kozhitov| first = L.

Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677&amp;nbsp;°C (1250&amp;nbsp;°F, 950&amp;nbsp;K) is also uncertain.

[[Linus Pauling]] estimated the [[electronegativity]] of francium at 0.7 on the [[Pauling scale]], the same as caesium;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pauling| first = Linus| title = The Nature of the Chemical Bond|edition = Third| authorlink = Linus Pauling| publisher = Cornell University Press| date = 1960| isbn = 978-0-8014-0333-0| pages = 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Allred, A.

Francium should also have a higher [[electron affinity]] than caesium and the Fr&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion should be more [[polarizability|polarizable]] than the Cs&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion.&lt;ref name="Thayer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thayer |first1=John S. |title=Relativistic Methods for Chemists|chapter=Chap.10 Relativistic Effects and the Chemistry of the Heavier Main Group Elements |date=2010 |page=81 |isbn=978-1-4020-9975-5 |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9975-5_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium [[superoxide]] (FrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is expected to have a more [[covalent]] character than its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]]; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.&lt;ref name="Thayer"/&gt;

Francium [[coprecipitation|coprecipitates]] with several caesium [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], such as [[caesium perchlorate]], which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of [[Lawrence E. Glendenin]] and [[C. M. Nelson|Nelson]]. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the [[iodate]], the [[picrate]], the [[tartrate]] (also [[rubidium]] tartrate), the [[chloroplatinate]], and the [[silicotungstate]]. It also coprecipitates with [[silicotungstic acid]], and with [[perchloric acid]], without another alkali metal as a [[carrier (chemistry)|carrier]], which provides other methods of separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hyde |first= E.

{{main|Isotopes of francium}}
There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 199 to 232.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book |date = 2006 |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |editor-last = Lide |editor-first = David R. |volume = 11 |pages = 180–181 |publisher = CRC |isbn=0-8493-0487-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francium has seven [[metastability|metastable]] [[nuclear isomer]]s.&lt;ref name="CRC2006" /&gt; Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature, though the former is far more common.&lt;ref name="nostrand679"&gt;{{cite book|date = 2005|title= Francium, in Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry|editor-last = Considine| editor-first = Glenn D.| page= 679|location= New York| publisher = Wiley-Interscience| isbn = 0-471-61525-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francium-223 is the most stable isotope, with a half-life of 21.8&amp;nbsp;minutes,&lt;ref name="CRC2006" /&gt; and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized.&lt;ref name="mcgraw" /&gt; Francium-223 is the fifth product of the [[actinium]] decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227.&lt;ref name="nostrand332"&gt;{{cite book|date = 2005|title= Chemical Elements, in Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry|editor-last = Considine| editor-first = Glenn D.|page=332|location= New York| publisher = Wiley-Interscience| isbn = 0-471-61525-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by [[beta decay]] (1.149&amp;nbsp;MeV [[decay energy]]), with a minor (0.006%) [[alpha decay]] path to astatine-219 (5.4&amp;nbsp;MeV decay energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Nuclear Data Center |date=1990 |title=Table of Isotopes decay data |url=http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nuclide.asp?iZA=870223 |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] |accessdate=April 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031212436/http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nuclide.asp?iZA=870223 |archivedate=October 31, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As early as 1870, chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond [[caesium]], with an atomic number of 87.&lt;ref name="andyscouse" /&gt; It was then referred to by the provisional name ''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka-caesium]]''.&lt;ref name="chemeducator"&gt;Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B. (September 25, 2005). [http://chemeducator.org/sbibs/s0010005/spapers/1050387gk.htm Francium (Atomic Number 87), the Last Discovered Natural Element] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604212956/http://chemeducator.org/sbibs/s0010005/spapers/1050387gk.htm |date=June 4, 2013 }}. ''The Chemical Educator'' '''10''' (5). Retrieved on 2007-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.

===Erroneous and incomplete discoveries===
Soviet chemist [[D. K. Dobroserdov]] was the first scientist to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of [[potassium]], another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, [[potassium-40]]).&lt;ref name="fontani"&gt;{{cite conference| first = Marco| last = Fontani |authorlink= Marco Fontani | title = The Twilight of the Naturally-Occurring Elements: Moldavium (Ml), Sequanium (Sq) and Dor (Do)| booktitle = International Conference on the History of Chemistry| pages = 1–8| date = September 10, 2005| location = Lisbon|url = http://5ichc-portugal.ulusofona.pt/uploads/PaperLong-MarcoFontani.doc| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224090117/http://5ichc-portugal.ulusofona.pt/uploads/PaperLong-MarcoFontani.doc|archivedate=February 24, 2006|accessdate = April 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element ''russium'' after his home country.&lt;ref name="vanderkroft"&gt;{{cite web| last = Van der Krogt| first = Peter| title = Francium| work = Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict| date = January 10, 2006| url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Fr| accessdate = April 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of [[Odessa]], and he did not pursue the element further.&lt;ref name="fontani"/&gt;

The following year, English chemists [[Gerald J. F. Druce]] and [[Frederick H. Loring]] analyzed [[X-ray]] photographs of [[manganese(II) sulfate]].&lt;ref name="vanderkroft"/&gt; They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name ''alkalinium'', as it would be the heaviest alkali metal.&lt;ref name="fontani"/&gt;

In 1930, [[Fred Allison]] of the [[Alabama Polytechnic Institute]] claimed to have discovered element 87 when analyzing [[pollucite]] and [[lepidolite]] using his [[magneto-optic effect|magneto-optical]] machine. Allison requested that it be named ''virginium'' after his home state of [[Virginia]], along with the symbols Vi and Vm&lt;!--along with them how? and proposed the symbols Vi and Vm?--&gt;.&lt;ref name="vanderkroft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Alabamine &amp; Virginium| publisher = TIME| date = February 15, 1932|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743159,00.html| accessdate = April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of his discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacPherson| first = H. G.| title = An Investigation of the Magneto-Optic Method of Chemical Analysis| journal = Physical Review| volume = 47| issue = 4| pages = 310–315| publisher = American Physical Society|date=1934|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.310|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..310M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Romanian physicist [[Horia Hulubei]] and his French colleague [[Yvette Cauchois]] also analyzed pollucite, this time using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus.&lt;ref name="fontani"/&gt; They observed several weak emission lines, which they presumed to be those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name ''moldavium'', along with the symbol Ml, after [[Moldavia]], the Romanian province where Hulubei was born.&lt;ref name="vanderkroft"/&gt; In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist [[F. H. Hirsh Jr.]], who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[bismuth]] X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], [[Nobel Prize]] winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over [[Marguerite Perey]]'s recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87.&lt;ref name="fontani"/&gt; All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.&lt;ref name="vanderkroft" /&gt;

===Perey's analysis===
Eka-caesium was discovered in 1939 by [[Marguerite Perey]] of the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]] in [[Paris]], when she purified a sample of [[actinium]]-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220&amp;nbsp;keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&amp;nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being [[thorium]], radium, [[lead]], bismuth, or [[thallium]]. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.&lt;ref name="chemeducator" /&gt; Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of [[beta decay]] to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.&lt;ref name="mcgraw" /&gt;

Perey named the new isotope ''actinium-K'' (it is now referred to as francium-223)&lt;ref name="chemeducator" /&gt; and in 1946, she proposed the name ''catium'' (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most [[electronegativity|electropositive]] [[cation]] of the elements. [[Irène Joliot-Curie]], one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of ''cat'' rather than ''cation''; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to [[curium]].&lt;ref name="chemeducator"/&gt; Perey then suggested ''francium'', after France. This name was officially adopted by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in 1949,&lt;ref name="andyscouse" /&gt; becoming the second element after [[gallium]] to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="hackh"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Grant| first = Julius| contribution = Francium| date = 1969| title = Hackh's Chemical Dictionary| pages = 279–280| publisher = McGraw-Hill| isbn = 0-07-024067-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following [[hafnium]] and [[rhenium]].&lt;ref name="chemeducator" /&gt; Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, [[Sylvain Lieberman]] and his team at [[CERN]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Francium can be synthesized by a [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction when a gold-197 target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen-18 atoms from a [[linear accelerator]] in a process originally developed at in the physics department at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="sbproduction"&gt;{{cite web| title = Production of Francium| work = Francium| publisher = [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]]| date = February 20, 2007| url = http://fr.physics.sunysb.edu/francium_news/production.HTM| accessdate = March 26, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20071012010344/http://fr.physics.sunysb.edu/francium_news/production.HTM| archivedate = October 12, 2007| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the energy of the oxygen beam, the reaction can yield francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211.

The francium atoms leave the gold target as ions, which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a [[Magneto-optic effect|magneto-optical trap]] (MOT) in a gaseous unconsolidated state.&lt;ref name="sbtrapping"&gt;{{cite web| title = Cooling and Trapping| work = Francium| publisher = [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]]| date = February 20, 2007| url = http://fr.physics.sunysb.edu/francium_news/trapping.HTM| accessdate = May 1, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20071122170110/http://fr.physics.sunysb.edu/francium_news/trapping.HTM| archivedate = November 22, 2007| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the atoms only remain in the trap for about 30 seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay, the process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms. The result is a [[steady state]] containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time.&lt;ref name="sbtrapping"/&gt; The original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms, while a later improved design could trap over 300,000 at a time.&lt;ref name=chemnews&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/francium.html|title=Francium|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|date=2003|first=Luis A. |last=Orozco }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms provided the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium.

'''Fretwork''' is an interlaced decorative design that is either carved in low relief on a solid background, or cut out with a [[fretsaw]], [[coping saw]], [[jigsaw (power tool)|jigsaw]] or [[scroll saw]]. Most fretwork patterns are geometric in design. The materials most commonly used are [[wood]] and [[metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Olver | first = Elizabeth | title = Jewelry Making Techniques Book | page = 26 | publisher = North Light Books | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tqruTvemolwC&amp;pg=PT8 | isbn = 978-1-58180-210-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fretwork is used to adorn [[furniture]] and [[musical instrument]]s. The term is also used for [[tracery]] on glazed windows and doors. Fretwork is also used to adorn/decorate architecture, where specific elements of decor are named according to their use such as eave [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]], gable fretwork or baluster fretwork, which may be of metal, especially [[cast iron]] or [[aluminum]].

Fretwork patterns originally were ornamental designs used to decorate objects with a grid or a lattice.  Designs have developed from the rectangular wave Greek fret to intricate intertwined patterns.  A common misconception is that fretwork must be done with a fretsaw.  However, a fretwork pattern is considered a fretwork whether or not it was cut out with a fretsaw.

[[Computer numerical control]] (CNC) has brought about change in the method of timber fretwork manufacture. Lasers or router/milling cutting implements can now fashion timber and various other materials into flat and even 3D decorative items.

'''Guarana''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|w|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|n|ə}} from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''guaraná'' {{IPA-pt|ɡwaɾɐˈna|}}), ''Paullinia cupana'', [[synonymy|syns.]] ''P. crysan, P. sorbilis'') is a [[climbing plant]] in the [[maple]] family, [[Sapindaceae]], native to the [[Amazon basin]] and especially common in [[Brazil]]. Guarana has large leaves and clusters of [[flower]]s and is best known for the seeds from its fruit, which are about the size of a coffee bean.

As a [[dietary supplement]] or [[herb]], guarana seed is an effective [[stimulant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Johannes| first = Laura  | title = Can a Caffeine-Packed Plant Give a Boost?| newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]]| page = D3 |date = March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contains about twice the concentration of [[caffeine]] found in [[coffee seeds]] (about 2–4.5% caffeine in guarana seeds, compared to 1–2% for coffee seeds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int.

As with other plants producing caffeine, the high concentration of caffeine is a defensive [[toxin]] that repels [[herbivore]]s from the berry and its seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ashihara H, Sano H, Crozier A |title=Caffeine and related purine alkaloids: biosynthesis, catabolism, function and genetic engineering |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=841–56 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18068204 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.10.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colour of the fruit ranges from brown to red and it contains black [[seed]]s that are partly covered by white [[aril]]s. The colour contrast when the fruit is split open has been compared with the appearance of eyeballs and has become the basis of an [[origin myth]] among the [[Mawé people|Sateré-Mawé people]].&lt;ref name="culthistplants"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Prance G, Nesbitt M |title=Cultural History of Plants |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |location=New York |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
[[File:Guarana - Paullinia cupana.jpg|thumb|Guarana]]
The word ''guarana'' comes from the [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] word ''guara-ná,'' which has its origins in the [[Sateré-Maué]] word for the plant, ''warana'',&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/guarana | title=guarana | publisher=Merriam Webster | accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in Tupi-Guarani means "fruit like the eyes of the people."

Guarana plays an important role in [[Tupi people|Tupi]] and Guaraní Paraguayan culture. According to a myth attributed to the Sateré-Maué tribe, guarana's domestication originated with a [[deity]] killing a beloved village child. To console the villagers, a more benevolent god plucked the left eye from the child and planted it in the forest, resulting in the wild variety of guarana. The god then plucked the right eye from the child and planted it in the village, giving rise to domesticated guarana.&lt;ref name="culthistplants-179"&gt;{{cite book |author=Beck HT |chapter=10 Caffeine, Alcohol, and Sweeteners |title=Cultural History of Plants  |editor=Ghillean Prance |editor2=Mark Nesbitt |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=179 |isbn=978-0-415-92746-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guaranís would make an [[herbal tea]] by shelling, washing and drying the seeds, followed by pounding them into a fine powder. The powder is kneaded into a dough and then shaped into cylinders. This product is known as guarana bread, which would be grated and then immersed into hot water along with sugar.&lt;ref name="worldofcaffeine-259"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Weinberg BA, Bealer BK |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |pages=259–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plant was introduced to European colonizers and to Europe in the 16th century by Felip Betendorf, [[Fernández de Oviedo|Oviedo]], [[Francisco Hernández de Toledo|Hernández]], [[Bernabé Cobo|Cobo]] and other Spaniard chroniclers. By 1958, guarana was commercialized.&lt;ref name="worldofcaffeine-259"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K.

The table contains a partial listing of some of the chemicals found in guarana seeds,&lt;ref name="duke-db" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duke1992a" /&gt; although other parts of the plant may contain them as well in varying quantities.

According to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank, guaranine (better known as [[caffeine]]) is found in guarana and is identical to caffeine derived from other sources, like [[coffee]], [[tea]] and [[Yerba Maté|mate]]. Guaranine, theine and mateine are all synonyms for caffeine when the definitions of those words include none of the properties and chemicals of their host plants except caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/gen_metab_summary_5.php?molName=caffeine#SYNONYMS |title=Caffeine |publisher=Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--See talk page before disputing any of the above information.--&gt;Natural sources of caffeine contain widely varying mixtures of [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s other than caffeine, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]], [[theobromine]] and other substances such as [[polyphenol]]s, which can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Safety===
In the United States, guarana fruit powder and seed extract have not been determined for status as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], but rather are approved as [[food additive]]s for flavor (but not non-flavor) uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news/2012/08/fda-responds-to-durbins-energy-drink-letter.aspx |title=FDA Responds to Durbin's Energy Drink Letter |publisher=Natural Products Insider, Global Health and Nutrition Network |date=20 August 2012|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnNavigation.cfm?filter=guarana&amp;sortColumn=&amp;rpt=eafusListing&amp;displayAll=false#2691|title=Guarana gum and guarana seed extract; Everything Added to Food in the United States (EAFUS); Documents 2189 and 3150|date=23 April 2013|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guarana is used in sweetened or carbonated [[soft drink]]s and [[energy drink|energy drinks]], an ingredient of [[herbal tea]]s or contained in [[dietary supplement]] capsules. Generally, [[South America]] obtains most of its caffeine from guarana.&lt;ref name="worldofcaffeine-230"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Weinberg BA, Bealer BK |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beverages===
[[Brazil]], the third-largest consumer of soft drinks in the world,&lt;ref name="worldofcaffeine-192and3"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Weinberg BA, Bealer BK |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; produces several soft drink brands from guarana extract. [[Paraguay]] is also a producer of guarana soft drinks with several brands operating in its market. The word ''guaraná'' is widely used in Brazil and [[Paraguay]] as a reference to soft drinks containing guarana extract.

The '''Khammwamba Thermal Power Station''', also '''Khammwamba Power Station''', is a proposed [[coal-fired]] power plant in  [[Malawi]], with planned installed capacity of {{convert|300|MW}}.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web |date=14 June 2013 |url=https://www.esi-africa.com/malawi-and-china-in-us-667-million-power-deals/ |title=Malawi and China in US$667 million power deals |access-date=17 April 2018 |publisher=ESI-Africa.com

==Overview and history==
As of November 2016, Malawi had installed capacity of 351 megawatts of electric power generation. Peak demand stood at 350 megawatts, leaving very little room for flexibility.&lt;ref name="Six"/&gt; This has exposed the Malawi grid to recurrent, crippling load-shedding. It has also starved big industrial and manufacturing projects, especially in the areas of mining and processing, slowing national development and job creation.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.times.mw/phombeya-substation-ready-november-2017/ |title=Phombeya substation ready November 2017 | date=14 November 2016 |access-date=17 April 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Times (Malawi)]] |first=Feston |last=Malekezo |location=Blantyre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far back as 2013, the [[government of Malawi]] began engaging the [[China Gezhouba Group Company]] (CGGC), to design, build and operate a coal-fired electricity-generation power plant at Kammwamba, in Southern Malawi.&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.esi-africa.com/malawi-and-china-in-us-667-million-power-deals/ |title=Malawi and China in US$667 million power deals |access-date=17 April 2018 |date=14 June 2013 |  publisher=ESI-Africa.com |author=ESI-Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money needed for construction would be borrowed from the [[Exim Bank of China|Export–Import Bank of China]]. At that time, it was expected that the coal would be sourced within Malawi, where coal reserves are estimated at 22,000,000,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/malawi-power-station-2014-05-23/rep_id:4136 |title=Chinese bank looks to finance Malawi power station |access-date=18 April 2018 | 
date=23 May 2014 |first=Marcel |location=Johannesburg | last=Chimwala |publisher=Engineeringnews.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, the cost of the project was valued at US$295 million.&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mwnation.com/295m-coal-fired-plant-ready-april/ | title=US$295 Coal-fired Plant Ready April |access-date=17 April 2018 |date=22 January 2014 |first=Christopher |last=Jimu | newspaper=[[The Nation (Malawi)]] |location=Blantyre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, plans to build this power station were concretized. The new plans called for starting with a 300 megawatts development, expandable in the future to 1,000 megawatts. The primary source of the coal to fire the power station, was identified as the [[Moatize]] coalfields in neighboring [[Mozambique]]. The imported coal would be hauled to the site via the nearby railway line.&lt;ref name="Eight"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.worldcoal.com/power/08052014/malawi_will_build_coal_fired_power_plant_819/ |title=Malawi will build 300 MW coal-fired power plant |access-date=17 April 2018 |date=8 May 2014 |
publisher=Worldcoal.com |author=World Coal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power generated at this station, would be relayed to a 400kV substation at Phombeya, in [[Balaka District]], where it would be integrated into the Malawian national electricity grid.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

==Ownership and financing==
In September 2017, ''[[The Nation (Malawi)]]'' reported that the government of Malawi would own 85 percent of the power station, while CGGC of China would own 15 percent of the power station. [[Vale Logistics]] of [[Brazil]] would provide the coal needed, over a 30-year contract period.

A '''levitated dipole''' is a type of [[nuclear fusion]] reactor design using a [[Superconductor|superconducting]] [[torus]] which is [[Magnetism|magnetically]] levitated inside the reactor chamber. The name refers to the [[magnetic dipole]] that forms within the reaction chamber, similar to [[Earth]]'s or [[Jupiter]]'s [[magnetosphere]]s. It is believed that such an apparatus could contain [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] more efficiently than other fusion reactor designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2008/ldx-tt0319|title=MIT tests unique approach to fusion power}} MIT News, David Chandler, MIT News Office, March 19, 2008. Accessed March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Levitated Dipole Experiment''' ('''LDX''') was funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]]'s [[Office of Science#Program offices|Office of Fusion Energy]].  The machine was run in a collaboration between MIT and Columbia University. Funding for the LDX was ended in November 2011 to concentrate resources on [[tokamak]] designs.&lt;ref name="fundingcut" &gt;{{cite web | title=LDX funding canceled | url=http://www.fusenet.eu/node/216 | accessdate=June 27, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084532/http://fusenet.eu/node/216 | archive-date=2013-01-17 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the circulation of charges in the Earth's molten core. The resulting magnetic dipole field forms a shape with magnetic field lines passing through the Earth's center, reaching the surface near the poles and extending far into space above the equator. Charged particles entering the field will tend to follow the lines of force, moving north or south. As they reach the polar regions, the magnetic lines begin to cluster together, and this increasing field can cause particles below a certain energy threshold to reflect, and begin travelling in the opposite direction. Such particles bounce back and forth between the poles until the collide with other particles. Particles with greater energy continue towards the Earth, impacting the atmosphere and causing the [[aurora]].

This basic concept is used in the [[magnetic mirror]] approach to fusion energy. The mirror uses a [[solenoid]] to confine the plasma in the center of a cylinder, and then two magnets at either end to force the magnetic lines closer together to create reflecting areas. One of the most promising of the early approaches to fusion, the mirror ultimately proved to be very "leaky", with the fuel refusing to properly reflect from the ends as the density and energy were increased. Annoyingly, it was the particles with the most energy, those most likely to undergo fusion, that preferentially escaped. Research into large mirror machines ended in the 1980s as it became clear they would not reach [[fusion breakeven]] in a practically sized device.

The levitated dipole can be thought of, in some ways, as a toroidal mirror, much more similar to the Earth's field than the linear system in a traditional mirror. In this case, the confinement area is not the linear area between the mirrors, but the toroidal area around the outside of the central magnet, similar to the area around the Earth's equator. Particles in this area that move up or down see increasing magnetic density and tend to move back towards the equator area again. This gives the system some level of natural stability. Particles with higher energy, the ones that would escape a traditional mirror, instead follow the field lines through the hollow center of the magnet, recirculating back into the equatorial area again.

This makes the Levitated Dipole unique when compared with other [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement machines]].  In those experiments, small fluctuations can cause significant energy loss.  By contrast, in a dipolar magnetic field, fluctuations tend to compress the plasma, without energy loss. This compression effect was first noticed by Akira Hasegawa (of the [[Hasegawa-Mima equation]]) after participating in the [[Voyager 2]] encounter with Uranus.&lt;ref&gt;Hasegawa, A., Comments on Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, 1987, vol. 1, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting this concept to a fusion experiment was first proposed by Dr. Jay Kesner (MIT) and Dr. Michael Mauel (Columbia) in the mid to late nineties.&lt;ref&gt;"Plasma Confinement in a Levitated Magnetic Dipole" MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT SYSTEMS&lt;/ref&gt;  The pair assembled a team and raised money to build the machine.  They achieved first plasma on Friday, August 13, 2004 at 12:53 PM.  First plasma was done by (1) successfully levitating the dipole magnet and (2) [[Radio frequency|RF]] heating the plasma.&lt;ref name="20040813plasma"&gt;{{cite web | title=LDX begins first plasma experiments | website=Levitated Dipole Experiment | url=https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/ldx/reports/FirstPlasma.html | date=13 August 2004 | accessdate=7 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The LDX team has since successfully conducted several levitation tests, including a 40-minute suspension of the [[superconductor|superconducting]] coil on February 9, 2007.&lt;ref name="20070209levitation"&gt;{{cite web | title=First flight and damaged L-coil | website=Levitated Dipole Experiment | url=https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/ldx/reports/status_0702.html |date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the coil was damaged in a control test in February 2007 and replaced in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Levitation coil replacement |website=Levitated Dipole Experiment |url=https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/ldx/reports/status_0705.html |date=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The replacement coil was inferior, a copper wound electromagnet, that was also water cooled.  Scientific results, including the observation of an inward turbulent pinch, were reported in [[Nature Physics]].&lt;ref name="NaturePhysResults"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Turbulent inward pinch of plasma confined by a levitated dipole magnet | journal=Nature Physics | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=207 |doi=10.1038/nphys1510 | url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys1510.html | accessdate=January 24, 2010 |bibcode = 2010NatPh...6..207B | last1=Boxer | first1=A.

=== The Dipole ===
This experiment needed a very special free-floating electromagnet, which created the unique "toilet-bowl" magnetic field. The magnetic field was originally made of two counter-wound rings of currents.  Each ring contained a 19-strand [[niobium-tin]] [[Rutherford cable]] (common in superconducting magnets).  These looped around inside a [[Inconel]] magnet; a magnet that looked like an oversized donut.  The donut was charged using [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]].  Once charged, it generated a magnetic field for roughly an 8-hour period.  Overall, the ring weighed 450 kilograms and levitated 1.6 meters above a superconducting ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Levitated Dipole Experiment|url=https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/ldx/ldx.html#1.1%20Levitated%20Ring|publisher=MIT|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ring produced roughly a 5-tesla field.&lt;ref name = "Construction"&gt;"Design and Fabrication of the Cryostat for the Floating Coil of the Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX)" A. Zhukovsky, M. Morgan, D. Garnier, A. Radovinsky, B. Smith, J. Schultz, L. Myatt, S. Pourrahimi, J. Minervini.&lt;/ref&gt;  This superconductor was encased inside a liquid helium, which kept the electromagnet below 10 [[kelvin]]s.&lt;ref name = "Construction"/&gt; This design is similar to the [[D20 dipole]] experiment at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Berkeley]] and the RT-1 experiment at the University of Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;"Turbulent Transport in a Laboratory Magnetospheric Dipole" European Physical Society 38th Conference on Plasma Physics, Strasbourg, France June 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chamber ===
The dipole was suspended inside a mushroom-shaped vacuum chamber, which was about 5 meters in diameter and ~3 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;presentation"LDX Machine Design and Diagnostics" APS DPP meeting 1998, Garnier and Mauel&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the chamber was a charging coil.  This coil is used to charge the dipole, using [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]].  The coil exposing the dipole to a varying magnetic field.  Next, the dipole is raised into the center of the chamber.  This could be done with supports or using the field itself.  Around the outside of this chamber were [[Helmholtz coil]]s, which were used to produce a uniform surrounding magnetic field. This external field would interact with the dipole field, suspending the dipole. It was in this surrounding field that plasma moved.  The plasma forms around the dipole and inside the chamber. The plasma is formed by heating a low pressure gas.  The gas is heated using a [[radio frequency]], essentially microwaving the plasma in a 17-kilowatt field.&lt;ref&gt;"Optimization of Hot Electron Diagnostics on LDX" Nogami, Woskov, Kesner, Garnier, Mauel, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Diagnostics ===
[[File:The Mechanics of a Magnetic flux loop.png|thumbnail|A flux loop is a loop of wire. The magnetic field passes through the wire loop. As the field varied inside the loop, it generated a current. This was measured and from the signal the magnetic flux was measured.]]
The machine was monitored using diagnostics fairly standard to all of fusion.  These included: 
# A [[Flux loop]].  This is a loop of wire.  The magnetic field passes through the wire loop.  As the field varied inside the loop, it generated a current. This was measured and from the signal the magnetic flux was measured. 
# An X-ray detector.&lt;ref name = "X-rays"&gt;"X-Ray Diagnostics for the Levitated Dipole Experiment" Jennifer L. Ellsworth, Master's Thesis, MIT 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  This diagnostic measured the X-rays emitted.  From this, the plasmas' temperature was found.  There were four of these inside the machine, each measuring along a cord (or line out) inside the machine.&lt;ref name = "X-rays"/&gt; This detector was good for measuring electrons, typically around 100 electron-volts.  All plasma loses energy by emitting light.  This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays.  This occurs anytime a particle [[Larmor formula|changes speed]], for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;J. Larmor, "On a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 190, (1897) pp. 205–300 (Third and last in a series of papers with the same name).&lt;/ref&gt;  If the reason is deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is [[Cyclotron radiation]] at low speeds and [[Synchrotron radiation]] at high speeds.  If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as [[Bremsstrahlung]] radiation.

# A Conventional Video Camera &lt;ref name ="2003Diag"/&gt;
# An emissive [[Langmuir probe]].  A Langmuir probe is a wire, stuck into a plasma, which absorbs the surrounding charged particles.  You can vary the voltage on this wire. As the voltage changes, the charged particles absorbed change, making an [[Current–voltage characteristic|IV]] curve.  This can be read and used to measure the density and temperature of the nearby plasma.

Ellsworth, I. Karim, Presented at the APS Meeting, Philadelphia, November 2, 2006, Paper VP1.00020&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Single particles corkscrew along the field lines, flowing around the dipole electromagnet.  This leads to a giant encapsulation of the electromagnet.  As material passes through the center, the density spikes.&lt;ref name = "overview"/&gt;  This is because lots of plasma is trying to squeeze through a limited area.  This is where most of the fusion reactions occur.  This behavior has been called a turbulent pinch.  
  
In large amounts, the plasma formed two shells around the dipole: a low density shell, occupying a large volume and a high density shell, closer to the dipole.&lt;ref name = "overview"/&gt; This is shown here.  The plasma was trapped fairly well.  It gave a maximum [[Beta (plasma physics)|beta number]] of 0.26.&lt;ref&gt;"Improved Confinement During Magnetic Levitation in LDX", 50th Annual Meeting of the APS DDP, November 18, 2008 M Manuel&lt;/ref&gt;  A value of 1 is ideal.

=== Modes of Operation ===
There were two modes of operation observed:&lt;ref&gt;"Helium Catalyzed D-D Fusion in a Levitated Dipole" Presentation Kesner, Catto, Krasheninnikova APS 2005 DPP Meeting, Denver&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Hot electron interchange: a lower density, mostly electron plasma.
# A more conventional [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] mode
These had been proposed by [[Nicholas Krall]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"Stabilization of Hot Electron Plasma by a Cold Background" N Krall, Phys. Fluids 9, 820 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tritium Suppression ===
In the case of [[Fusion power#Deuterium.2C deuterium|deuterium]] fusion (the cheapest and most straightforward fusion fuel) the geometry of the LDX has the unique advantage over other concepts.  Deuterium fusion makes two products, that occur with near equal probability:

:{|
|D + D || → T|| + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H
|-
|D + D || → &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He || + n
|}

In this machine, the secondary tritium could be partially removed, a unique property of the dipole.&lt;ref&gt;"Fusion Technologies for Tritium-Suppressed D-D Fusion" White Paper prepared for FESAC Materials Science Subcommittee, M. E. Mauel and J. Kesner, December 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another fuel choice is tritium and deuterium. This reaction can be done at lower heats and pressures.  But it has several drawbacks.  First, tritium is far more expensive than deuterium.  This is because tritium is rare.  It has a short half-life making it hard to produce and store.  It is also considered a hazardous material, so using it is a hassle from a health, safety and environmental perspective.  Finally, tritium and deuterium produces [[fast neutrons]] which means any reactor burning it would require heavy shielding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18875">A '''liquid-crystal laser''' is a [[laser]] that uses a [[liquid crystal]] as the [[resonator cavity]], allowing selection of emission wavelength and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] from the [[active laser medium]]. The lasing medium is usually a [[dye laser|dye]] doped into the liquid crystal. Liquid-crystal lasers are comparable in size to [[Laser diode|diode lasers]], but provide the continuous wide spectrum tunability of [[dye laser]]s while maintaining a large [[Coherence (physics)|coherence area]]. The tuning range is typically several tens of [[nanometers]].&lt;ref name=Woltman2007_357&gt;[[#Woltman 2007|Woltman 2007]], p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-organization#Self-organization in physics|Self-organization]] at micrometer scales reduces manufacturing complexity compared to using layered [[photonic metamaterial]]s. Operation may be either in [[Continuous wave|continuous wave mode]] or in [[Laser#Pulsed operation|pulsed mode]].&lt;ref name=CWandPulsed /&gt;

==History==
Distributed feedback lasing using [[Bragg's law|Bragg reflection]] of a periodic structure instead of external [[mirror]]s was first proposed in 1971,&lt;ref name="Kogelnik1971" /&gt; predicted theoretically with [[cholesteric]] liquid crystals in 1978,&lt;ref name="Kukhtarev1978" /&gt; achieved experimentally in 1980,&lt;ref name="Ilchishin1980" /&gt; and explained in terms of a photonic [[band gap]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woltman 2007|Woltman 2007]], p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopp1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dolgaleva2008" /&gt;
A [[United States patent law|United States Patent]] issued in 1973 described a liquid-crystal laser that uses "a liquid lasing medium having internal distributed feedback by virtue of the molecular structure of a cholesteric liquid-crystal material."&lt;ref name=Patent /&gt;

==Mechanism==
Starting with a liquid crystal in the nematic phase, the desired helical pitch (the distance along the helical axis for one complete rotation of the nematic plane subunits) can be achieved by doping the liquid crystal with a chiral molecule.&lt;ref name="Dolgaleva2008" /&gt; For light circularly polarized with the same handedness, this regular modulation of the refractive index yields selective reflection of the wavelength given by the helical pitch, allowing the liquid-crystal laser to serve as its own resonator cavity. [[Photonic crystal]]s are amenable to [[Electronic band structure|band theory]] methods, with the periodic dielectric structure playing the role of the periodic electric potential and a photonic band gap (reflection notch) corresponding to forbidden frequencies. The lower photon group velocity and higher [[density of states]] near the photonic bandgap suppresses [[spontaneous emission]] and enhances [[stimulated emission]], providing favorable conditions for lasing.&lt;ref name="Kopp1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuroda2009" /&gt; If the electronic band edge falls in the photonic bandgap, electron-hole recombination is strictly suppressed.&lt;ref name="Yablonovich1987" /&gt; This allows for devices with high lasing efficiency, low [[lasing threshold]], and stable frequency, where the liquid-crystal laser acts its own waveguide. "Colossal" [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] change in refractive index is achievable in doped nematic-phase liquid crystals, that is the refractive index can change with illumination intensity at a rate of about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W of illumination intensity.&lt;ref name="Lucchetti2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khoo1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khoo2007" /&gt; Most systems use a semiconductor [[Laser pumping|pumping laser]] to achieve [[population inversion]], though flash lamp and electrical pumping systems are possible.&lt;ref name="Morris2008" /&gt;

Tuning of the output wavelength is achieved by smoothly varying the helical pitch: as the winding changes, so does the length scale of the crystal. This in turn shifts the band edge and changes the optical path length in the lasing cavity. Applying a static electric field perpendicular to the dipole moment of the local nematic phase rotates the rod-like subunits in the hexagonal plane and reorders the chiral phase, winding or unwinding the helical pitch.&lt;ref name="Maune2004" /&gt; Similarly, optical tuning of the output wavelength is available using laser light far from the pick-up frequency of the gain medium, with degree of rotation governed by intensity and the angle between the polarization of the incident light and the dipole moment.&lt;ref name="Furumi2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuh2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khoo1993" /&gt; Reorientation is stable and reversible. The chiral pitch of a cholesteric phase tends to unwind with increasing temperature, with a [[Order and disorder (physics)|disorder-order transition]] to the higher symmetry nematic phase at the high end.&lt;ref name="Ilchishin1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozaki2002" /&gt; By applying a temperature gradient perpendicular to the direction of emission varying the location of stimulation, frequency may be selected across a continuous spectrum.&lt;ref name="Huang2006" /&gt; Similarly, a quasi-continuous doping gradient yields multiple laser lines from different locations on the same sample.&lt;ref name="Morris2008" /&gt; Spatial tuning may also be accomplished using a wedge cell. The boundary conditions of the narrower cell squeeze the helical pitch by requiring a particular orientation at the edge, with discrete jumps where the outer cells rotate to the next stable orientation; frequency variation between jumps is continuous.&lt;ref name="Jeong2008" /&gt;

If a defect is introduced into the liquid crystal to disturb the periodicity, a single allowed mode may be created inside of the photonic bandgap, reducing power leeching by spontaneous emission at adjacent frequencies. Defect mode lasing was first predicted in 1987, and was demonstrated in 2003.&lt;ref name="Yablonovich1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woltman 2007|Woltman 2007]], pp. 332–334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidtke2003" /&gt;

While most such thin films lase on the axis normal to the film's surface, some will lase on a conic angle around that axis.&lt;ref name=Lee2009 /&gt;

==Applications==
* Biomedical sensing: small size, low cost, and low power consumption offer a variety of advantages in biomedical sensing applications. Potentially, liquid-crystal lasers could form the basis for "lab on a chip" devices that provide immediate readings without sending a sample away to a separate lab.&lt;ref name="Physorg2005" /&gt;
* Medical: low emission power limits such medical procedures as cutting during [[surgeries]], but liquid-crystal lasers show potential to be used in [[microscopy]] techniques and ''[[in vivo]]'' techniques such as [[photodynamic therapy]].&lt;ref name=Woltman2007_357 /&gt;
* Display screens: liquid-crystal-laser-based displays offer most of the advantages of standard liquid-crystal displays, but the low spectral spread gives more precise control over color. Individual elements are small enough to act as single pixels while retaining high brightness and color definition. A system in which each pixel is a single spatially tuned device could avoid the sometimes long relaxation times of dynamic tuning, and could emit any color using spatial addressing and the same monochromatic pumping source.&lt;ref name="Physorg2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Physorg2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFW2009" /&gt;
* Environmental sensing: using a material with a helical pitch highly sensitive to temperature, electric field, magnetic field, or mechanical strain, color shift of the output laser provides a simple, direct measurement of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Palffy-Muhoray2006" /&gt;

== Incidents ==
* On January 11, personnel from [[Millennium Pipeline]] noticed that a gas transmission pipeline was leaking in [[Tioga County, New York]]. This 30-inch diameter pipeline was built in 2008. A pinhole in a rejected girth weld was found to be the cause of the failure. It appears that during the course of the construction project for the line, the subject pipe section was inadvertently picked up and subsequently installed in the pipeline. PHMSA ordered testing of this pipeline for similar flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF 1-2011-1013S |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120111013S/120111013S_NOPSO_07062011.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225071520/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120111013S/120111013S_NOPSO_07062011.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Failure Investigation Report – Columbia Gas Transmission, Millennium Pipeline Weld Anomaly Failure Date 01/11/2011 |url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles//PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/CGT_2616_Millennium_West_NY_09132012_[Redacted_for_Internet].pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127033252/http://phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/CGT_2616_Millennium_West_NY_09132012_%5BRedacted_for_Internet%5D.pdf |archivedate=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Multiple gas pressure regulators failed, and caused a gas pressure surge in [[Fairport Harbor, Ohio]], on January 24, causing gas fires in 11 houses, and one apartment. 150 gas appliances were damaged or destroyed, but there were no injuries. Gas company Dominion East Ohio says it found fluids and debris in a failed regulator. A year after the explosion, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recommended a $500,000 fine for Dominion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/02/02/news/nh3594036.txt?viewmode=fullstory |title=Fairport Harbor blasts probed |publisher=news-herald.com |date=February 2, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313003640/http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/02/02/news/nh3594036.txt?viewmode=fullstory |archivedate=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/lawsuit-filed-over-natural-gas-fires-in-fairport-harbor |title=Lawsuit filed over natural gas fires in Fairport Harbor |publisher=Newsnet5.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309144633/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/lawsuit-filed-over-natural-gas-fires-in-fairport-harbor |archivedate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/10/19/news/nh4642830.txt |title=Dominion officials respond to Fairport residents |publisher=news-herald.com |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529082946/http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/10/19/news/nh4642830.txt |archivedate=May 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Puco Staff Report Fire Investigation |url=http://www.fox8.com/news/wjw-news-puco-staff-report-fire-investigation,0,910014.story |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Five people were killed, and eight houses were destroyed, in a gas explosion and fire in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] on February 9. The NTSB had warned UGI about cast iron gas mains needing replacement after the 1990 gas explosion in that city. Between 1976 and the date of the letter, July 10, 1992, two more gas explosions occurred. Three people were killed, 23 injured and 11 houses were destroyed or damaged in those explosions. UGI was cited in 2012 for several safety violations, including a lack of valves on their gas system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Five Killed in Pennsylvania Gas Explosion |url=http://www.firehouse.com/news/top-headlines/five-killed-massive-pennsylvania-gas-explosion |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221080733/http://www.firehouse.com/news/top-headlines/five-killed-massive-pennsylvania-gas-explosion |archivedate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UGI told years ago to remove old pipes |url=http://www.mcall.com/news/local/allentown/mc-allentown-ntsb-blast-20110301,0,3589679.story |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002151407/http://www.mcall.com/news/local/allentown/mc-allentown-ntsb-blast-20110301%2C0%2C3589679.story |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG8m7V0KXbs&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Allentown Explosion |date=February 10, 2011 |publisher= |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |via=YouTube |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115900/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG8m7V0KXbs&amp;feature=player_embedded |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/UGI-cited-for-multiple-safety-violations-leading-to-Allentown-gas-explosion/-/132502/14773532/-/t2eat7/-/index.html |title=UGI cited for multiple safety violations leading to Allentown gas explosion &amp;#124; Regional: Lehigh Valley – Home |publisher=Wfmz.com |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320172323/http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/UGI-cited-for-multiple-safety-violations-leading-to-Allentown-gas-explosion/-/132502/14773532/-/t2eat7/-/index.html |archivedate=March 20, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Load management''', also known as '''demand side management''' ('''DSM'''), is the process of [[Load balancing (electrical power)|balancing the supply of electricity]] on the network with the electrical load by adjusting or controlling the load rather than the power station output. This can be achieved by direct intervention of the utility in real time, by the use of frequency sensitive relays triggering the circuit breakers (ripple control), by time clocks, or by using special tariffs to influence consumer behavior. Load management allows utilities to reduce demand for electricity during peak usage times ('''peak shaving'''), which can, in turn, reduce costs by eliminating the need for [[peaking power plant]]s. In addition, some peaking power plants can take more than an hour to bring on-line which makes load management even more critical should a plant go off-line unexpectedly for example. Load management can also help reduce harmful emissions, since peaking plants or backup generators are often dirtier and less efficient than [[base load power plant]]s. New load-management technologies are constantly under development — both by private industry&lt;ref&gt;[http://tdworld.com/mag/power_mega_load_management/ Example of largest load management system developed by private industry]&lt;/ref&gt; and public entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oe.energy.gov/ US Dept. Of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery and Electricity Reliability]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricdistribution.ctc.com/monitoring_load_management_technologies.htm Analysis of current US DOE Projects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015185316/http://www.electricdistribution.ctc.com/monitoring_load_management_technologies.htm |date=October 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
In 1972, [[Theodore George “Ted” Paraskevakos]], while working for [[Boeing]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], developed a sensor monitoring system which used digital transmission for security, fire, and medical alarm systems as well as meter-reading capabilities for all utilities. This technology was a spin-off of his patented automatic telephone line identification system, now known as [[caller ID]]. In, 1974, Paraskevakos was awarded a U.S. patent for this technology.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent No. 3,842,208 (sensor monitoring device)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the [[Alabama Power Company]], Paraskevakos developed a load-management system along with automatic meter-reading technology. In doing so, he utilized the ability of the system to monitor the speed of the watt power meter disc and, consequently, power consumption. This information, along with the time of day, gave the power company the ability to instruct individual meters to manage water heater and air conditioning consumption in order to prevent peaks in usage during the high consumption portions of the day. For this approach, Paraskevakos was awarded multiple patents.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. patents Nos. 4,241,237, 4,455,453 and 7,940,901 (remote management of products and services) as well as Canadian Patent No. 1,155,243 (apparatus and method for remote sensor monitoring, metering and control)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and operating principles==
Since electrical energy is a form of [[energy]] that cannot be effectively stored in bulk, it must be generated, distributed, and consumed immediately. When the load on a system approaches the maximum generating capacity, network operators must either find additional supplies of energy or find ways to curtail the load, hence load management. If they are unsuccessful, the system will become unstable and [[Power outage|blackouts]] can occur.

Long-term load management planning may begin by building sophisticated models to describe the physical properties of the distribution network (i.e. topology, capacity, and other characteristics of the lines), as well as the load behavior. The analysis may include scenarios that account for weather forecasts, the predicted impact of proposed load-shed commands, estimated time-to-repair for off-line equipment, and other factors.

The utilization of load management can help a power plant achieve a higher [[capacity factor]], a measure of average capacity utilization. Capacity factor is a measure of the output of a power plant compared to the maximum output it could produce. Capacity factor is often defined as ''the ratio of average load to capacity'' or ''the ratio of average load to peak load in a period of time''. A higher load factor is advantageous because a power plant may be less efficient at low load factors, a high load factor means fixed costs are spread over more kWh of output (resulting in a lower price per unit of electricity), and a higher load factor means greater total output. If the power load factor is affected by non-availability of fuel, maintenance shut-down, unplanned breakdown, or reduced demand (as consumption pattern fluctuate throughout the day), the generation has to be adjusted, since [[grid energy storage]] is often prohibitively expensive.

Smaller utilities that buy power instead of generating their own find that they can also benefit by installing a load control system. The penalties they must pay to the energy provider for peak usage can be significantly reduced. Many report that a load control system can pay for itself in a single season.

==Comparisons to demand response==
When the decision is made to curtail load, it is done so on the basis of system ''reliability''. The utility in a sense "owns the switch" and sheds loads only when the stability or reliability of the electrical distribution system is threatened. The utility (being in the business of generating, transporting, and delivering electricity) will not disrupt their business process without due cause. Load management, when done properly, is non-invasive, and imposes no hardship on the consumer. The load should be shifted to off peak hours.

[[Demand response]] places the "on-off switch" in the hands of the consumer using devices such as a [[smart grid]] controlled [[load control switch]]. While many residential consumers pay a flat rate for electricity year-round, the utility's costs actually vary constantly, depending on demand, the distribution network, and composition of the company's electricity generation portfolio. In a free market, the wholesale price of energy varies widely throughout the day. Demand response programs such as those enabled by smart grids attempt to incentivize the consumer to limit usage based upon ''cost'' concerns. As costs rise during the day (as the system reaches peak capacity and more expensive peaking power plants are used), a free [[market economy]] should allow the price to rise. A corresponding drop in demand for the commodity should meet a fall in price. While this works for predictable shortages, many crises develop within seconds due to unforeseen equipment failures. They must be resolved in the same time-frame in order to avoid a [[power blackout]]. Many utilities who are interested in demand response have also expressed an interest in load control capability so that they might be able to operate the "on-off switch" before price updates could be published to the consumers.&lt;ref name="TCL1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Safe Protocols for Generating Power Pulses with Heterogeneous Populations of Thermostatically Controlled Loads |author=N. A. Sinitsyn. S. Kundu, S. Backhaus |journal=[[Energy Conversion and Management]]|volume=67|year=2013|pages=297–308|arxiv=1211.0248|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2012.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of load control technology continues to grow today with the sale of both [[radio frequency]] and [[powerline communication]] based systems. Certain types of [[smart meter]] systems can also serve as load control systems. [[Charge control]] systems can prevent the recharging of electric vehicles during peak hours. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] systems can return electricity from an electric vehicle's batteries to the utility, or they can throttle the recharging of the vehicle batteries to a slower rate.&lt;ref name="Liasi"&gt;Liasi, Sahand Ghaseminejad, and Masoud Aliakbar Golkar.

Ripple control is the most common form of load control, and is used in many countries around the world, including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[South Africa]]. Ripple control involves superimposing a higher-frequency signal (usually between 100 and 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) onto the standard 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz of the main power signal. When receiver devices attached to non-essential residential or industrial loads receive this signal, they shut down the load until the signal is disabled or another frequency signal is received.

Early implementations of ripple control occurred during [[World War II]] in various parts of the world using a system that communicates over the electrical distribution system. Ripple control systems are generally paired with a two- (or more) tiered pricing system, whereby electricity is more expensive during peak times (evenings) and cheaper during low-usage times (early morning).

Affected residential devices will vary by region, but may include residential electric hot-water heaters, air conditioners, pool pumps, or crop-irrigation pumps. In a distribution network outfitted with load control, these devices are outfitted with communicating controllers that can run a program that limits the duty cycle of the equipment under control. Consumers are usually rewarded for participating in the load control program by paying a reduced rate for energy. Proper load management by the utility allows them to practice [[load shedding]] to avoid [[rolling blackout]]s and reduce costs.

[[Zellweger off-peak]] is one common brand of ripple control systems.

==Frequency-based decentralized demand control==
Greater loads physically slow the rotors of a grid's synchronized generators. This causes AC mains to have a slightly reduced frequency when a grid is heavily loaded. The reduced frequency is immediately sensible across the entire grid. Inexpensive local electronics can easily and precisely measure mains frequencies and turn off sheddable loads. In some cases, this feature is nearly free, e.g. if the controlling equipment (such as an electric power meter, or the thermostat in an air-conditioning system) already has a microcontroller.  Most electronic electric power meters internally measure frequency, and require only demand control relays to turn off equipment. In other equipment, often the only needed extra equipment is a [[resistor divider]] to sense the mains cycle and a [[schmitt trigger]] (a small integrated circuit) so the microcontrollers' digital input can sense a reliable fast digital edge. A schmitt trigger is already standard equipment on many microcontrollers.

The main advantage over ripple control is greater customer convenience: Unreceived ripple control telegrams can cause a water heater to remain off, causing a cold shower. Or, they can cause an airconditioner to remain off, resulting in a sweltering home. In contrast, as the grid recovers, its frequency naturally rises to normal, so frequency-controlled load control automatically enables water heaters, air-conditioners and other comfort equipment.  The cost of equipment can be less, and there are no concerns about overlapping or unreached ripple control regions, mis-received codes, transmitter power, etc.

The main disadvantage compared to ripple control is a less fine-grained control. For example, a grid authority has only a limited ability to select which loads are shed. In controlled war-time economies, this can be a substantial disadvantage.

The system was invented in [[PNNL]] in the early 21st century, and has been shown to stabilize grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kalsi|first1=K.|last2=Et. Al.|title=Loads as a Resource: Frequency Responsive Demand Control|url=https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-23764.pdf|website=pnnl.gov|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of schemes==
In many countries, including [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], the power grids routinely use privately held, emergency diesel generators in load management schemes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/131/ Claverton Energy experts library]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217164416/http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/131/ |date=February 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[File:NZ household ripple control receiver.JPG|thumb|A ripple control receiver fitted to a New Zealand house. The left circuit breaker controls the water storage heater supply (currently on), while the right one controls the nightstore heater supply (currently off).]]
Since the 1950s, New Zealand has had a system of load management based on ripple control, allowing the electricity supply for domestic and commercial water storage heaters to be switched off and on, as well as allowing remote control of nightstore heaters and street lights. Ripple injection equipment located within each local distribution network signals to ripple control receivers at the customer's premises. Control may either done manually by the local distribution network company in response to local outages or requests to reduce demand from the transmission system operator (i.e. [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]]), or automatically when injection equipment detects mains frequency falling below 49.2&amp;nbsp;Hz. Ripple control receivers are assigned to one of several ripple channels to allow the network company to only turn off supply on part of the network, and to allow staged restoration of supply to reduce the impact of a surge in demand when power is restored to water heaters after a period of time off.

Depending on the area, the consumer may have two electricity meters, one for normal supply ("Anytime") and one for the load-managed supply ("Controlled"), with Controlled supply billed at a lower rate per kilowatt-hour than Anytime supply. For those with load-managed supply but only a single meter, electricity is billed at the "Composite" rate, priced between Anytime and Controlled.

===France===
France has an EJP tariff, which allows it to disconnect certain loads and to encourage consumers to disconnect certain loads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707075828/http://claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-wiki/EJP_-_load_reduction_in_France Claverton Energy Experts]  &lt;/ref&gt; This tariff is no longer available for new clients (as of July 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [https://www.edf-bleuciel.fr/accueil/mon-quotidien-avec-bleu-ciel-d-edf/option-ejp-141107.html EDF EPJ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624081704/https://www.edf-bleuciel.fr/accueil/mon-quotidien-avec-bleu-ciel-d-edf/option-ejp-141107.html |date=June 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tempo'' tariff also includes different types of days with different prices, but has been discontinued for new clients as well (as of July 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [https://www.edf-bleuciel.fr/accueil/mon-quotidien-avec-bleu-ciel-d-edf/option-tempo-141090.html EDF Tempo]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624081633/https://www.edf-bleuciel.fr/accueil/mon-quotidien-avec-bleu-ciel-d-edf/option-tempo-141090.html |date=June 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced prices during nighttime are available for customers for a higher monthly fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [http://www.edf-bleuciel.fr/accueil/j-ai-besoin-d-energies/electricite/les-tarifs-electricite-141626.html EDF Price grid]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, night storage heaters are used to increase the load by about 5 GW to accommodate the nuclear programme. There is also a programme that allows industrial loads to be disconnected using circuit breakers triggered automatically by frequency sensitive relays fitted on site. This operates in conjunction with [[Standing Reserve]], a programme using diesel generators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/commercial-opportunities-for-back-up-generation-and-load-reduction-via-national-grid-the-national-electricity-transmission-system-operator-netso-for-england-scotland-wales-and-offshore.html Commercial Opportunities for Back-Up Generation and Load Reduction via National Grid, the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) for England, Scotland, Wales and Offshore.]&lt;/ref&gt; These can also be remotely switched using BBC Radio 4 Longwave [[Radio teleswitch]].

'''Manila paper''' is a relatively inexpensive type of [[paper]], generally made through a less refined process than other types of paper. It is typically made from [[Bleaching of wood pulp|semi-bleached wood fibres]]. It is not as strong as [[craft paper]] but has better printing qualities. Manila is [[Buff (colour)|buff-coloured]] and the [[fibre]]s are usually visible to the naked [[Human eye|eye]]. Because this paper is generally inexpensive, it is commonly given to [[children]] for making [[Child art|art]].

Manila paper was originally made out of old Manila hemp ropes which were extensively used on ships, having replaced [[hemp|true hemp]]. It was made from [[Manila hemp]] (also called [[abacá]]) or ''Musa textilis'' which is grown in [[The Philippines]] and hence the association with [[Manila]], the capital of that country. Abaca is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like teabag tissue. It is also very expensive, priced several times higher than woodpulp, hence the change to that fiber for what is still called Manilla—usually with two "ll"s. More recently new woodpulp has often been replaced with a high proportion of recycled fibre. True manila hemp folders would have been much tougher and long lasting than modern folders.

Manila is most commonly used for making [[file folder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sd5EAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Manila+is+used+for+making+file+folders&amp;dq=Manila+is+used+for+making+file+folders&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh_vDI17fXAhUKqlQKHbdTAl8Q6AEINzAD|title=The Knox standard guide to design and control of business forms|last=Knox|first=Frank M.|date=January 1965|publisher=McGraw-Hill|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fashion schools and people in the fashion industry use large rolls of Manila to create finalised clothing patterns.

'''''[[Maranta (plant)|Maranta]] arundinacea''''', also known as '''arrowroot''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''maranta''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; '''West Indian arrowroot''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; '''obedience plant''', '''Bermuda arrowroot''', '''araru''', '''ararao''' or '''hulankeeriya''', is a large, [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herb]] found in [[rainforest]] habitats. Arrowroot flour is now produced commercially mostly in [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]].  Arrowroot was one of the earliest plants to be domesticated for food in northern South America, with evidence of exploitation or cultivation of the plant dating back to 8200 BCE.

==Description==
[[File:Arrowroots.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The root of ''M. arundinacea''.]]
Arrowroot is a perennial plant growing to a height of between {{convert|0.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.  Its leaves are lanceolate. The edible part of the plant is the [[rhizome]]. Twin clusters of small white flowers bloom about 90 days after planting. The plant rarely produces seed and reproduction is typically by planting part of a rhizome with a bud.  Rhizomes are ready for harvesting 10–12 months after planting as leaves of the plant begin to wilt and die. The rhizomes are fleshy, cylindrical, and grow from {{convert|20|cm|inch|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|45|cm|inch|0|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;''Root Crops'', NRI, 1987. http://www.nzdl.org/gsdlmod?e=q-00000-00---off-0fnl2%2e2--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-----sti--0-1l--11-en-50---20-about-root+crops+--00-0-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=fnl2.2&amp;srp=0&amp;srn=0&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HASHd8d905db1c6eae0daee48f.22; FAO, "Maranta arundinacea",  http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=2335, accessed 19 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrowroot plant probably originated in the [[Amazon rainforest]] of north-western Brazil and neighboring countries.  It grows best between temperatures of {{convert|23|C|F}} and {{convert|29|C|F}} with annual precipitation between {{convert|150|cm|inch|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|200|cm|inch|0|abbr=on}}. The dormant rhizomes can withstand temperatures as low as {{convert|5|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Maranta arundinacea", http://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Maranta+arundinacea, accessed 19 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the continental United States, arrowroot is cultivated as an outside plant only in southern Florida.&lt;ref&gt;"Arrowroot -- "Moscata arundinecea" EDIS, University of Florida, https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/mv009, accessed 19 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
''Maranta arundinacea'' is native to [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], the [[West Indies]] ([[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Trinidad]], [[Lesser Antilles]]) and [[South America]] ([[Brazil]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[French Guiana]]).&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; It is widely cultivated in the many warm countries and is considered naturalized in [[Jamaica]], [[Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]] ([[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Yunnan]]), [[Taiwan]], [[Volcano Islands|Kazan Rettō]] (火山列島), [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Florida]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=253261 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, ''Maranta arundinacea'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=200028493 Flora of China v 24, p 382, ''Maranta arundinacea'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caribbean]] island nation of [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] is the world's largest grower of arrowroot and producer of arrowroot flour.&lt;ref&gt;"Root Crops"&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Kerala]], [[India]], arrowroot, locally called bilathi koova, is cultivated to produce an easily digestible starch.&lt;ref&gt;"Koova (arrowroot), http://papanasini.blogspot.com/2014/01/koova.html, accessed 21 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric domestication==
[[Radio-carbon dating]] has established that ''M. arundinacea'' was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Arrowroot, along with leren (''[[Calathea allouia]]''), [[squash (plant)|squash]] (''[[Cucurbita moschata]]''), and bottle gourd (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'') became cultivated plants in northern South American and Panama between 8200 BCE and 5600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Piperno, Dolores R. (Oct 2011), "The Origins of Plant Cultivation and Domestication in the New World Tropics", ''Current Anthropology'', Vol 52, No. 54, p. S 459.  Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some archaeologists believe that arrowroot was first used by Native Americans not as food but as a poultice to extract poison from wounds caused by spears or arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Piperno, Dolores R. and Pearsall, Deborah M. (1998), ''The Origins of Agriculture in the Lowland Neotropics,'' San Diego: Academic Press, p. 115, 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the use of arrowroot as food has been found dating from 8200 BCE at the San Isidro archaeological site in the upper [[Cauca River]] valley of Colombia near the city of [[Popayán]].  Starch grains from arrowroot were found on grinding tools. It is unclear whether the arrowroot had been gathered or grown, although the elevation of the site of {{convert|1700|m|ft}} is probably outside the normal range of elevations at which ''M. arundinacea'' grows in the wild. Thus, the plant may have been introduced at San Isidro from nearby lowland rain forest areas in a pioneering effort to cultivate it. Stone hoes for cultivation of plants have been found which date as old as 7700 BCE in the middle Cauca valley, {{convert|150|km|mi}} north of San Isidro.&lt;ref&gt;Piperno and Pearsall, pp. 199-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of arrowroot at these early dates was probably on a small-scale with gardens of only a few plants being planted in alluvial soils near streams to ensure the steady supply of moisture needed during the growing season by arrowroot and other similar root crops. The exploitation of arrowroot foot was probably complicated by the difficulty of extracting the starch from the fibrous roots. The roots must first be pounded or ground then soaked in water to separate the starch from the fibers. The starch is excellent for digestibility.&lt;ref&gt;Piperno and Pearsall, pp 115, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Currently arrowroot starch is used in food preparations and confectionery, and for industrial applications such as cosmetics and glue. The residue of starch extraction has a high fibre content and can be fed to livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., 2017. Arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea).

'''Matchboard'''  by definition is "a board with a groove cut along one edge and a tongue along the other so as to fit snugly with the edges of similarly cut boards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/matchboard|title=Definition of MATCHBOARD|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bramble Cottage, Lundy (1).jpg|thumb|Bramble Cottage on [[Lundy Island]], weathered cedar matchboarding in an exposed location]]
Matchboarding can be used both internally and externally, and can be layered in many different styles including: square edge, feather edge, [[Shiplap|ship lap]] and [[tongue and groove]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wooduchoose.com/w.cfm/wooden/tongue-and-groove/|title=Tongue and groove Boarding {{!}} Tongue and groove panelling {{!}} Wood panelling {{!}} T&amp;G Boards|website=Wooduchoose - the wood price comparison website|language=en|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timbersource.co.uk/services/cladding|title=Timber Cladding for interior &amp; exterior use {{!}} Timbersource|website=www.timbersource.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matchboard was most popular in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], when woodworking machinery had developed that could cut the edge joints quickly and cheaply. In the 1930s, further developments in glues and veneer-cutting machinery made [[plywood]] affordable. This also gave a cleanly smooth-surfaced [[Modernism|Modernist]] look that suited the taste for new styles. Matchboard then became much less popular.  In the 1970s there was a resurgence of interest in the style as a [[Retro style|retro]] feature, but this was usually provided, for cost reasons, as a faux matchboard effect pressed into the surface of a plywood board.

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

'''Nanofibers''' are fibers with diameters in the [[Nanometre|nanometer]] range. Nanofibers can be generated from different [[polymers]] and hence have different physical properties and application potentials. Examples of natural polymers include [[collagen]], [[cellulose]], [[silk fibroin]], [[keratin]], [[gelatin]] and [[polysaccharides]] such as [[chitosan]] and [[alginate]].&lt;ref name="Vasita"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasita|first1=R.|last2=Katti|first2=D.|title=Nanofibers and their applications in tissue engineering|journal=Int J Nanomed|date=2006|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–30|pmid=17722259|doi=10.2147/nano.2006.1.1.15|pmc=2426767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khajavi|first1=R.|last2=Abbasipour|first2=M.|last3=Bahador|first3=A.|title=Electrospun biodegradable nanofibers scaffolds for bone tissue engineering|journal=J Appl Polym Sci|date=2016|volume=133|issue=3|pages=1–19|doi=10.1002/app.42883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of synthetic polymers include [[poly(lactic acid)]] (PLA), [[polycaprolactone]] (PCL), [[polyurethane]] (PU), [[poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)]] (PLGA), [[poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)]] (PHBV), and [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate|poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate)]] (PEVA).&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt; Polymer chains are connected via [[covalent bonds]].&lt;ref name="Teraoka"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teraoka|first1=Iwao|title=Polymer Solutions: An Introduction to Physical Properties|date=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|isbn=978-0-471-22451-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diameters of nanofibers depend on the type of polymer used and the method of production.&lt;ref name="Reneker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reneker|first1=D.|last2=Chun|first2=I.|title=Nanometre diameter fibres of polymer produced by electrospinning|journal=Nanotechnology|date=1996|volume=7|issue=3|pages=216–223|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/7/3/009}}&lt;/ref&gt; All polymer nanofibers are unique for their large surface area-to-volume ratio, high porosity, appreciable mechanical strength, and flexibility in functionalization compared to their [[microfiber]] counterparts.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=D.|last2=Xia|first2=Y.|title=Electrospinning of nanofibers: reinventing the wheel?|journal=Adv Mater|date=2004|volume=16|issue=14|pages=1151–1170|doi=10.1002/adma.200400719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist many different methods to make nanofibers, including drawing, [[electrospinning]], [[Molecular self-assembly|self-assembly]], template synthesis, and thermal-induced phase separation. Electrospinning is the most commonly used method to generate nanofibers because of the straightforward setup, the ability to mass-produce continuous nanofibers from various polymers, and the capability to generate ultrathin fibers with controllable diameters, compositions, and orientations.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; This flexibility allows for controlling the shape and arrangement of the fibers so that different structures (''i.e.'' hollow, flat and ribbon shaped) can be fabricated depending on intended application purposes.

Nanofibers have many possible technological and commercial applications. They are used in tissue engineering,&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt; drug delivery,&lt;ref name="Sharifi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garg" /&gt; cancer diagnosis,&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cristofanilli" /&gt; lithium-air battery,&lt;ref name="Zhang 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang 2" /&gt; optical sensors&lt;ref name="Wang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zubia" /&gt; and air filtration.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholten" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

==History of nanofiber production==

Nanofibers were first produced via [[electrospinning]] more than four centuries ago.&lt;ref name="Nascimento"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nascimento|first1=M et al.|title=A literature investigation about electrospinning and nanofibers: historical trends, current status and future challenges|journal=Recent Pat Nanotechnol|date=2015|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–10|pmid=27009122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=N et al.|title=The history of the science and technology of electrospinning from 1600 to 1995|journal=J Eng Fiber Fabr|date=2012|volume=7|pages=63–73|url=http://www.jeffjournal.org/papers/Volume7/7.2b.10N.Tucker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the development of the electrospinning method, English physicist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] (1544-1603) first documented the [[electrostatic attraction]] between liquids by preparing an experiment in which he observed a spherical water drop on a dry surface warp into a cone shape when it was held below an electrically charged amber.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=William|title=De magnete, magneticisque corporibus, et de magno magnete tellure|date=1600}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deformation later came to be known as the [[Taylor cone]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=G.|title=Disintegration of water drops in an electric field|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|date=1964|volume=280|issue=1382|pages=383–397|doi=10.1098/rspa.1964.0151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, English physicist [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] (1842-1919) analyzed the unstable states of liquid droplets that were electrically charged, and noted that the liquid was ejected in tiny jets when [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] was established between the [[surface tension]] and [[electrostatic force]].&lt;ref name="Lord Rayleigh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strutt|first1=J.|title=On the equilibrium of liquid conducting masses charged with electricity London, Edinburgh, and Dublin|journal=Philos. Mag.|date=1882|volume=14|pages=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, British physicist [[Charles Vernon Boys]] (1855-1944) published a manuscript about nanofiber development and production.&lt;ref name="Boys"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boys|first1=C.|title=On the production, properties, and some suggested uses of the finest threads|journal=Philos. Mag.|date=1887|volume=23|issue=145|pages=489–499|doi=10.1080/14786448708628043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, American inventor John Francis Cooley (1861-1903) filed the first modern electrospinning patent.&lt;ref name="Cooley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooley|first1=J.|title=Improved methods of and apparatus for electrically separating the relatively volatile liquid component from the component of relatively fixed substances of composite fluids|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&amp;NR=190006385|website=Espacenet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anton Formhals was the first person to attempt nanofiber production between 1934 and 1944 and publish the first patent describing the experimental production of nanofibers.&lt;ref name="Tucker" /&gt; In 1966, Harold Simons published a patent for a device that could produce thin and light nanofiber fabrics with diverse motifs.&lt;ref name="Harold"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harold|first1=Simon|title=Process and apparatus for producing patterned non-woven fabrics|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=3280229A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D|website=Espacenet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only at the end of the 20th century have the words electrospinning and nanofiber become common language among scientists and researchers.&lt;ref name="Nascimento" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker" /&gt; Electrospinning continues to be developed today.

==Synthesis methods==

Many chemical and mechanical techniques for preparing nanofibers exist.

=== Electrospinning ===
[[File:Electrospinning Image for Wikipedia.tif|thumb|Diagram of a general set-up of electrospinning.]]
[[File:Taylor cone.jpg|thumb|Taylor cone from which jet of polymer solution is ejected.]]
'''Electrospinning''' is the most commonly used method to fabricate nanofibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lolla|first=Dinesh|last2=Gorse|first2=Joseph|last3=Kisielowski|first3=Christian|last4=Miao|first4=Jiayuan|last5=Taylor|first5=Philip L.|last6=Chase|first6=George G.|last7=Reneker|first7=Darrell H.|date=2015-12-17|title=Polyvinylidene fluoride molecules in nanofibers, imaged at atomic scale by aberration corrected electron microscopy|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/NR/C5NR01619C|journal=Nanoscale|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1039/C5NR01619C|pmid=26369731|issn=2040-3372|pages=120–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Sarbatly R. 2016 8–16"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Sarbatly R.|author2=Kamin, Z.|author3=Krishnaiah D.|last-author-amp=yes|title=A review of polymer nanofibres by electrospinning and their application in oil-water separation for cleaning up marine oil spills|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|year=2016|volume=106|issue=1–2|pages=8–16|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.03.037|pmid=27016959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The instruments necessary for electrospinning include a high voltage supplier, a [[capillary tube]] with a pipette or needle with a small diameter, and a metal collecting screen. One [[electrode]] is placed into the polymer solution and the other electrode is attached to the collector. An [[electric field]] is applied to the end of the capillary tube that contains the polymer solution held by its surface tension and forms a charge on the surface of the liquid. As the intensity of the electric field increases, the hemispherical surface of the fluid at the tip of the capillary tube elongates to form a conical shape known as the [[Taylor cone]]. A critical value is attained upon further increase in the electric field in which the repulsive electrostatic force overcomes the surface tension and the charged jet of fluid is ejected from the tip of the Taylor cone. The discharged polymer solution jet is unstable and elongates as a result, allowing the jet to become very long and thin. Charged polymer fibers solidifies with solvent evaporation.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reneker2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reneker|first1=D.|last2=Yarin|first2=A.|title=Electrospinning jets and polymer nanofibers|journal=Polymer|date=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=2387–2425|doi=10.1063/1.3567097|pmid=21522493|pmc=3082340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomly-oriented nanofibers are collected on the collector. Nanofibers can also be collected in a highly aligned fashion  by using specialized collectors such as the [[rotating drum]],&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=K et al.|title=The effect of molecular weight and the linear velocity of drum surface on the properties of electrospun poly(ethylene terephthalate) nonwovens|journal=Fibers Polym|date=2004|volume=5|issue=2|pages=122–127|doi=10.1007/BF02902925}}&lt;/ref&gt; metal frame,&lt;ref name="Dersch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dersch|first1=R et al.|title=Electrospun nanofibers: internal structure and intrinsic orientation|journal=Polym Chem|date=2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=545–553|doi=10.1002/pola.10609}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a two-parallel plates system.&lt;ref name="Beachley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beachley|first1=V.|last2=Wen|first2=X.|title=Effect of electrospinning parameters on the nanofiber diameter and length|journal=Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl|date=2009|volume=29|issue=3|pages=663–668|doi=10.1016/j.msec.2008.10.037|pmid=21461344|pmc=3065832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parameters such as jet stream movement and polymer concentration have to be controlled to produce nanofibers with uniform diameters and morphologies.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leach|first1=M et al.|title=Electrospinning fundamentals: optimizing solution and apparatus parameters|journal=J Vis Exp|date=2011|volume=47|issue=47|page=2494|doi=10.3791/2494|pmid=21304466|pmc=3182658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrospinning technique transforms many types of polymers into nanofibers. An electrospun nanofiber network resembles the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) well.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Z et al.|title=A review on polymer nanofibers by electrospinning and their applications in nanocomposites|journal=Compos Sci Technol|date=2003|volume=63|issue=15|pages=2223–2253|doi=10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=J et al.|title=Electrospinning versus microfluidic spinning of functional fibers for biomedical applications|journal=Biomaterials|date=2017|volume=114|pages=121–143|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.040|pmid=27880892}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resemblance is a major advantage of electrospinning because it opens up the possibility of mimicking the ECM with regards to fiber diameters, high porosity, and mechanical properties. Electrospinning is being further developed for mass production of one-by-one continuous nanofibers.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;

===Thermal-induced phase separation===

Thermal-induced phase separation separates a homogenous polymer solution into a multi-phase system via [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] changes.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=P.|last2=Zhang|first2=R.|title=Synthetic nano-scale fibrous extracellular matrix|journal=J Biomed Mater Res|date=1998|volume=46|issue=1|pages=60–72|pmid=10357136|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199907)46:1&lt;60::aid-jbm7&gt;3.0.co;2-h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlos|first1=A et al.|title=Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering Via Thermally Induced Phase Separation, Advances in Regenerative Medicine|date=2011|isbn=978-953-307-732-1|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/advances-in-regenerative-medicine/scaffolds-for-tissue-engineering-via-thermally-induced-phase-separation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=P.|title=Scaffolds for tissue fabrication|journal=Materials Today|date=2004|volume=7|issue=5|pages=30–40|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(04)00233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure involves five steps: polymer [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], liquid-liquid or liquid-solid phase separation, polymer [[gelation]], [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] of solvent from the gel with water, and [[freezing]] and [[freeze-drying]] under vacuum.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt; Thermal-induced phase separation method is widely used to generate scaffolds for tissue regeneration.&lt;ref name="Ma 2" /&gt;

The homogenous polymer solution in the first step is thermodynamically unstable and tends to separate into polymer-rich and polymer-lean phases under appropriate temperature. Eventually after solvent removal, the polymer-rich phase solidifies to form the matrix and the polymer-lean phase develops into pores.&lt;ref name="Carlos" /&gt; Next, two types of phase separation can be carried out on the polymer solution depending on the desired pattern. Liquid-liquid separation is usually used to form bicontinuous phase structures while solid-liquid phase separation is used to form crystal structures. The gelation step plays a crucial role in controlling the porous morphology of the nanofibrous matrices. Gelation is influenced by temperature, polymer concentration, and solvent properties.&lt;ref name="Carlos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma 2" /&gt; Temperature regulates the structure of the fiber network: low gelation temperature results in formation of nanoscale fiber networks while high gelation temperature leads to the formation of a platelet-like structure.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt; Polymer concentration affects fiber properties: an increase in polymer concentration decreases porosity and increases mechanical properties such as tensile strength. Solvent properties influence morphology of the scaffolds. After gelation, gel is placed in distilled water for solvent exchange. Afterwards, the gel is removed from the water and goes through freezing and freeze-drying. It is then stored in a desiccator until characterization.

===Drawing===

The drawing method makes long single strands of nanofibers one at a time. The pulling process is accompanied by solidification that converts the dissolved spinning material into a solid fiber.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramakrishna"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramakrishna|first1=S et al.|title=An Introduction to Electrospinning and Nanofibers|date=2005|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-256-415-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cooling step is necessary in the case of melt spinning and evaporation of solvent in the case of dry spinning. A limitation, however, is that only a viscoelastic material that can undergo extensive deformations while possessing sufficient cohesion to survive the stresses developed during pulling can be made into nanofibers through this process.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ondarcuhu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ondarcuhu|first1=T.|last2=Joachim|first2=C.|title=Drawing a single nanofiber over hundreds of microns|journal=Europhys Lett|date=1998|volume=42|issue=2|pages=215–220|doi=10.1209/epl/i1998-00233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Template synthesis===

The template synthesis method uses a nanoporous membrane template composed of cylindrical pores of uniform diameter to make [[fibril]]s (solid nanofiber) and [[tubule]]s (hollow nanofiber).&lt;ref name="Martin 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=C.|title=Template synthesis of electronically conductive polymer nanostructures|journal=Acc Chem Res|date=1995|volume=28|issue=2|pages=61–68|doi=10.1021/ar00050a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=C.|title=Nanomaterials: a membrane-based synthetic approach|journal=Science|date=1994|volume=266|issue=5193|pages=1961–1966|doi=10.1126/science.266.5193.1961|pmid=17836514}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to prepare fibrils and tubules of many types of materials, including metals, semiconductors and electronically conductive polymers.&lt;ref name="Martin 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 3" /&gt; The uniform pores allow for control of the dimensions of the fibers so nanofibers with very small diameters can be produced through this method. However, a drawback of this method is that it cannot make continuous nanofibers one at a time.

===Self-assembly===

The self-assembly technique is used to generate [[peptide]] nanofibers and [[peptide amphiphiles]]. The method was inspired by the natural folding process of [[amino acid]] residues to form proteins with unique three-dimensional structures.&lt;ref name="Malkar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malkar|first1=N et al.|title=Characterization of peptide-amphiphiles possessing cellular activation sequences|journal=Biomacromolecules|date=2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages=518–528|doi=10.1021/bm0256597|pmid=12741765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-assembly process of peptide nanofibers involves various driving forces such as [[hydrophobic interaction]]s, [[electrostatic force]]s, [[hydrogen bonding]] and [[van der Waals force]]s and is influenced by external conditions such as [[ionic strength]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name="Zhang 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=C et al.|title=Self-assembled peptide nanofibers designed as biological enzymes for catalyzing ester hydrolysis|journal=ACS Nano|date=2014|volume=8|issue=11|pages=15–23|doi=10.1021/nn5051344|pmid=25375351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymer materials==
[[File:Dense connective tissue-400x.jpg|thumb|Collagen fibers in a cross-sectional area of dense connective tissue.]]
Due to their high porosity and large surface area-to-volume ratio, nanofibers are widely used to construct scaffolds for biological applications.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt; Major examples of natural polymers used in scaffold production are [[collagen]], [[cellulose]], [[silk fibroin]], [[keratin]], [[gelatin]] and [[polysaccharides]] such as [[chitosan]] and [[alginate]]. [[Collagen]] is a natural extracellular component of many [[connective tissue]]s. Its fibrillary structure, which varies in diameter from 50-500&amp;nbsp;nm, is important for cell recognition, attachment, proliferation and differentiation.&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt; Using [[type I collagen]] nanofibers produced via electrospinning, Shih et al. found that the engineered collagen scaffold showed an increase in cell adhesion and decrease in cell migration with increasing fiber diameter.&lt;ref name="Shih"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shih|first1=Y et al.|title=Growth of mesenchymal stem cells on electrospun type I collagen nanofibers|journal=Stem Cells|date=2006|volume=24|issue=11|pages=2391–2397|doi=10.1634/stemcells.2006-0253|pmid=17071856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using silk scaffolds as a guide for growth for bone tissue regeneration, Kim et al. observed complete bone union after 8 weeks and complete healing of defects after 12 weeks whereas the control in which the bone did not have the scaffold displayed limited mending of defects in the same time period.&lt;ref name="Kim 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=K et al.|title=Biological efficacy of silk fibroin nanofiber membranes for guided bone regeneration|journal=J Biotechnol|date=2005|volume=120|issue=3|pages=327–339|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2005.06.033|pmid=16150508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[keratin]], [[gelatin]], [[chitosan]] and [[alginate]] demonstrate excellent [[biocompatibility]] and [[bioactivity]] in scaffolds.&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;

However, cellular recognition of natural polymers can easily initiate an immune response.&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng" /&gt; Consequently, synthetic polymers such as [[poly(lactic acid)]] (PLA), [[polycaprolactone]] (PCL), [[polyurethane]] (PU), [[poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)]] (PLGA), [[Polylactic acid|poly(L-lactide)]] (PLLA), and [[Poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate)|poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate)]] (PEVA) have been developed as alternatives for integration into scaffolds. Being biodegradable and biocompatible, these synthetic polymers can be used to form matrices with a fiber diameter within the nanometer range. Out of these synthetic polymers, PCL has generated considerable enthusiasm among researchers.&lt;ref name="Azimi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azimi|first1=B et al.|title=Poly (ε-caprolactone) fiber: an overview|journal=J Eng Fiber Fabr|date=2014|volume=9|issue=3|pages=74–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCL is a type of biodegradable polyester that can be prepared via ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone using [[Catalysis|catalysts]]. It shows low toxicity, low cost and slow degradation. PCL can be combined with other materials such as gelatin, collagen, chitosan, and calcium phosphate to improve the differentiation and proliferation capacity (2, 17).&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Azimi" /&gt; PLLA is another popular synthetic polymer. PLLA is well known for its superior mechanical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility. It shows efficient cell migration ability due to its high spatial interconnectivity, high porosity and controlled alignment.&lt;ref name="Shim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shim|first1=I et al.|title=Novel 3D scaffold with enhanced physical and cell response properties for bone tissue regeneration, fabricated by patterned electrospinning/electrospraying|journal=J Biomed Mater Res B|date=2010|volume=27|issue=9|pages=150–160|doi=10.1007/s10856-016-5748-8|pmid=27550014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blend of PLLA and PLGA scaffold matrix has shown proper biomimetic structure, good mechanical strength and favorable bioactivity.

==Applications==
===Tissue engineering===

In tissue engineering, a highly porous artificial extracellular matrix is needed to support and guide cell growth and tissue regeneration.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burg|first1=K.|last2=Porter|first2=S.|last3=Kellam|first3=J.|title=Biomaterial developments for bone tissue engineering|journal=Biomaterials|date=2000|volume=21|issue=23|pages=2347–2359|pmid=11055282|doi=10.1016/s0142-9612(00)00102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=B et al.|title=Advances in three-dimensional nanofibrous macrostructures via electrospinning|journal=Pro Polym Sci|date=2014|volume=39|issue=5|pages=862–890|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers have been used to create such scaffolds.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;

Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous mats specifically intended for use as in vitro cell substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE) would adhere to and proliferate upon the fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317053872|title=NIH PHASE I FINAL REPORT: FIBROUS SUBSTRATES FOR CELL CULTURE (R3RR03544A) (PDF Download Available)|last=Simon|first=Eric M.|date=1988|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanofiber scaffolds are used in bone tissue engineering to mimic the natural extracellular matrix of the bones.&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlos" /&gt; The bone tissue is arranged either in a [[Compact bone|compact]] or [[Trabecular bone|trabecular]] pattern and composed of organized structures that vary in length from the centimeter range all the way to the nanometer scale. Nonmineralized organic component (i.e. [[Type I collagen|type 1 collagen]]), mineralized inorganic component (i.e. [[hydroxyapatite]]), and many other noncollagenous matrix proteins (i.e. [[glycoprotein]]s and [[proteoglycan]]s) make up the nanocomposite structure of the bone ECM.&lt;ref name="Burg" /&gt; The organic collagen fibers and the inorganic mineral salts provide flexibility and toughness, respectively, to ECM.

Although the bone is a dynamic tissue that can self-heal upon minor injuries, it cannot regenerate after experiencing large defects such as bone tumor [[Resection (surgery)|resections]] and severe nonunion fractures because it lacks the appropriate template.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlos" /&gt; Currently, the standard treatment is [[autograft]]ing which involves obtaining the donor bone from a non-significant and easily accessible site (i.e. [[iliac crest]]) in the patient own body and transplanting it into the defective site. Transplantation of autologous bone has the best clinical outcome because it integrates reliably with the host bone and can avoid complications with the immune system.&lt;ref name="Betz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Betz|first1=R.|title=Limitations of Autograft and Allograft: New Synthetic Solutions|journal=Orthopedics|date=2002|volume=25|issue=5|page=S561–570|doi=10.3928/0147-7447-20020502-04|doi-broken-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; But its use is limited by its short supply and donor site morbidity associated with the harvest procedure.&lt;ref name="Burg" /&gt; Furthermore, autografted bones are [[avascular]] and hence are dependent on [[diffusion]] for nutrients, which affects their viability in the host.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt; The grafts can also be resorbed before [[osteogenesis]] is complete due to high remodeling rates in the body.&lt;ref name="Burg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt; Another strategy for treating severe bone damage is [[Allografts|allografting]] which transplants bones harvested from a human cadaver. However, allografts introduce the risk of disease and infection in the host.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt;

Bone tissue engineering presents a versatile response to treat bone injuries and deformations. Nanofibers produced via electrospinning mimics the architecture and characteristics of natural extracellular matrix particularly well. These scaffolds can be used to deliver bioactive agents that promote tissue regeneration.&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt; These bioactive materials should ideally be [[Bone grafting|osteoinductive]], [[Bone grafting|osteoconductive]], and [[Osseointegration|osseointegratable]].&lt;ref name="Burg" /&gt; Bone substitute materials intended to replace autologous or allogeneic bone consist of bioactive ceramics, bioactive glasses, and biological and synthetic polymers. The basis of bone tissue engineering is that the materials will be resorbed and replaced over time by the body’s own newly regenerated biological tissue.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;

===Drug delivery===

Successful delivery of therapeutics to the intended target largely depends on the choice of the drug carrier. The criteria for an ideal drug carrier include maximum effect upon delivery of the drug to the target organ, evasion of the immune system of the body in the process of reaching the organ, retention of the therapeutic molecules from preparatory stages to the final delivery of the drug, and proper release of the drug for exertion of the intended therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name="Sharifi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=F et al.|title=Fiber based approaches as medicine delivery systems|journal=ACS Biomater Sci Eng|date=2016|volume=2|issue=9|pages=1411–1431|doi=10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the physical properties of the nanofibers are well suited for drug delivery system.&lt;ref name="Vasita" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khajavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; Due to their cylindrical morphology, they possess a high surface area-to-volume ratio. As a result, the fibers possess high drug-loading capacity and can release therapeutic molecules over a large surface area in the medium.&lt;ref name="Cheng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharifi" /&gt; Whereas surface area to volume ratio can only be controlled by adjusting the radius for spherical vesicles, nanofibers have more degrees of freedom in controlling the ratio by varying both the length and the cross-sectional radius. This adjustability is important for their application in drug delivery system in which the functional parameters need to be precisely controlled.&lt;ref name="Sharifi" /&gt;
[[File:Drug delivery diagram.png|thumb|Drugs and biopolymers can be loaded onto nanofibers via simple adsorption, nanoparticles adsorption, and multilayer assembly.]]

===Cancer diagnosis===

Although [[Pathology|pathologic examination]] is the current standard method for molecular characterization in testing for the presence of [[biomarker]]s in tumors, these single-sample analyses fail to account for the diverse genomic nature of tumors.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=J et al.|title=Clinical applications of NanoVelcro rare-cell assays for detection and characterization of circulating tumor cells|journal=Theranostics|date=2016|volume=6|issue=9|pages=1425–1439|doi=10.7150/thno.15359|pmid=27375790|pmc=4924510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the invasive nature, psychological stress, and the financial burden resulting from repeated tumor biopsies in patients, biomarkers that could be judged through minimally invasive procedures, such as blood draws, constitute an opportunity for progression in precision medicine.

[[Liquid biopsy]] is an option that is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to solid tumor biopsy.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ke"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ke|first1=Z et al.|title=Programming thermoresponsiveness of NanoVelcro substrates enables effective purification of circulating tumor cells in lung cancer patients|journal=ACS Nano|date=2015|volume=9|issue=1|pages=62–70|doi=10.1021/nn5056282|pmid=25495128|pmc=4310634}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simply a blood draw that contains circulating tumor cells (CTCs) which are shed into the bloodstream from solid tumors.

[[File:CTC mechanism.png|thumb|CTC capture and release mechanism of third generation Thermoresponsive Chip.]]
Recently, Ke et al. developed a NanoVelcro chip that captures the CTCs from the blood samples.&lt;ref name="Ke" /&gt; When blood is passed through the chip, the nanofibers coated with protein antibodies bind to the proteins expressed on the surface of cancer cells and act like Velcro to trap CTCs for analysis.

===Lithium-air battery===

Among many advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, rechargeable [[Lithium-air battery|lithium-air batteries]] are of particular interest due to their considerable energy storing capacities and high power densities.&lt;ref name="Zhang 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=B et al.|title=Recent advances in electrospun carbon nanofibers and their application in electrochemical energy storage|journal=Prog Mater Sci|date=2016|volume=76|pages=319–380|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lithium-air batteries: their time has come|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21703358-new-type-electrical-cell-may-displace-lithium-ion-design-their-time-has|publisher=The Economist|date=Aug 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the battery is being used, lithium [[ion]]s combine with oxygen from the air to form particles of [[lithium oxide]]s, which attach to [[carbon fibers]] on the electrode. During recharging, the lithium oxides separate again into lithium and oxygen which is released back into the atmosphere. This conversion sequence is highly inefficient because there is significant voltage difference of more than 1.2 volts between the output voltage and the charging voltage of the battery meaning that approximately 30% of the electrical energy is lost as heat when the battery is charging.&lt;ref name="Zhang 3" /&gt; Also the large volume changes resulting from continuous conversion of oxygen between its gaseous and solid state puts stress on the electrode and limits its lifetime. 
[[File:Li-air-solidstate.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a lithium-air battery. For the nanofiber-based lithium-air battery, the cathode would be made up of carbon nanofibers.]]
The performance of these batteries depends on the characteristics of the material that makes up the [[cathode]]. Carbon materials have been widely used as cathodes because of their excellent electrical conductivities, large surface areas, and chemical stability.&lt;ref name="Yang 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=X.|last2=He|first2=P.|last3=Xia|first3=Y.|title=Preparation of mesocellular carbon foam and its application for lithium/oxygen battery|journal=Electrochem Commun|date=2009|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1127–1130|doi=10.1016/j.elecom.2009.03.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=R et al.|title=All-carbon-nanofiber electrodes for high-energy rechargeable LiO2 batteries|journal=Energy Environ Sci|date=2011|volume=4|issue=8|pages=2952–2958|doi=10.1039/c1ee01496j}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially relevant for lithium-air batteries, carbon materials act as substrates for supporting metal oxides. Binder-free electrospun carbon nanofibers are particularly good potential candidates to be used in electrodes in lithium-oxygen batteries because they have no binders, have open macroporous structures, have carbons that support and catalyze the oxygen reduction reactions, and have versatility.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singhal|first1=R.|last2=Kalra|first2=V.|title=Binder-free hierarchically-porous carbon nanofibers decorated with cobalt nanoparticles as efficient cathodes for lithium-oxygen batteries|journal=RSC Adv|date=2016|volume=6|issue=105|pages=103072–103080|doi=10.1039/C6RA16874D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhu et al. developed a novel cathode that can store lithium and oxygen in the electrode they named nanolithia which is a matrix of carbon nanofibers periodically embedded with [[Cobalt oxide nanoparticles|cobalt oxide]].&lt;ref name="Zhu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Z et al.|title=Anion-redox nanolithia cathodes for Li-ion batteries|journal=Nature Energy|date=2016|volume=1|issue=8|pages=1–7|doi=10.1038/nenergy.2016.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cobalt oxides provide stability to the normally unstable superoxide-containing nanolithia. In this design, oxygen is stored as LiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and does not convert between gaseous and solid forms during charging and discharging. When the battery is discharging, lithium ions in nanolithia and react with superoxide oxygen the matrix to form Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The oxygen remains in its solid state as it transitions among these forms. The chemical reactions of these transitions provide electrical energy. During charging, the transitions occur in reverse.

===Optical sensors===

Polymer optical fibers have generated increasing interest in recent years.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=X et al.|title=Electrospun nanofibrous membranes for highly sensitive optical sensors|journal=Nano Lett|date=2002|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1273–1275|doi=10.1021/nl020216u|citeseerx=10.1.1.459.8052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Q et al.|title=Polymer micro or nanofibers for optical device applications|journal=J Appl Polym Sci|date=2008|volume=110|issue=2|pages=1080–1084|doi=10.1002/app.28716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of low cost, ease of handling, long [[wavelength]] transparency, great flexibility, and biocompatibility, polymer optical fibers show great potential for short-distance networking, optical sensing and power delivery.&lt;ref name="Zubia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zubia|first1=J.|last2=Arrue|first2=J.|title=Plastic optical fibers: an introduction to their technological processes and applications|journal=Opt Fiber Technol|date=2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=101–140|doi=10.1006/ofte.2000.0355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=K.|title=Polymer optical fiber sensors—a review|journal=Smart Mater Struct|date=2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1088/0964-1726/20/1/013002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrospun nanofibers are particularly well-suitable for optical sensors because sensor sensitivity increases with increasing surface area per unit mass. Optical sensing works by detecting ions and molecules of interest via [[Fluorescence quenching|fluorescence quenching mechanism]]. Wang et al. successfully developed nanofibrous thin film optical sensors for metal ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[2,4-Dinitrotoluene|2,4-dinitrotoluene]] (DNT) detection using the electrospinning technique.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

Quantum dots show useful optical and electrical properties, including high optical gain and [[Photochemical Reaction|photochemical]] stability. A variety of [[quantum dot]]s have been successfully incorporated into polymer nanofibers.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=H et al.|title=Electrospun polymer nanofibers as subwavelength optical waveguides incorporating quantum dots|journal=Small|date=2006|volume=2|issue=4|pages=495–499|doi=10.1002/smll.200500432|pmid=17193073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meng et al. showed that quantum dot-doped polymer nanofiber sensor for humidity detection shows fast response, high sensitivity, and long-term stability while requiring low power consumption.&lt;ref name="Meng"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meng|first1=C et al.|title=Quantum-dot doped polymer nanofibers for optical sensing|journal=Adv Mater|date=2011|volume=23|issue=33|pages=3770–3774|doi=10.1002/adma.201101392|pmid=21766349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly et al. developed a sensor that warns first responders when the carbon filters in their respirators have become saturated with toxic fume particles.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=T.|last2=Gao|first2=T.|last3=Sailor|first3=M.|title=Carbon and carbon/silicon composites templated in rugate filters for the adsorption and detection of organic vapors|journal=Adv Mater|date=2011|volume=23|issue=15|pages=1776–1781|doi=10.1002/adma.201190052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respirators typically contain activated [[charcoal]] that traps airborne toxins. As the filters become saturated, chemicals begin to pass through and render the respirators useless. In order to easily determine when the filter is spent, Kelly and his team developed a mask equipped with a sensor composed of carbon nanofibers assembled into repeating structures called [[photonic crystal]]s that reflect specific wavelengths of light. The sensors exhibit an iridescent color that changes when the fibers absorb toxins.

===Air filtration===
[[File:Living Room 2.jpg|thumb|Paints and protective coatings on furniture contain volatile organic compounds such as toluene and formaldehyde.]]
Electrospun nanofibers are useful for removing [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOC) from the atmosphere. Scholten et al. showed that adsorption and desorption of VOC by electrospun nanofibrous membrane were faster than the rates of conventional activated carbon.&lt;ref name="Scholten"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scholten|first1=E et al.|title=Electrospun polyurethane fibers for absorption of volatile organic compounds from air|journal=ACS Appl Mater Interfaces|date=2011|volume=3|issue=10|pages=3902–3909|doi=10.1021/am200748y|pmid=21888418|hdl=1721.1/81271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airborne contamination in the personnel cabins of mining equipment is of concern to the mining workers, mining companies, and government agencies such as the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA). Recent work with mining equipment manufacturers and the MSHA has shown that nanofiber filter media can reduce cabin dust concentration to a greater extent compared to standard [[cellulose]] filter media.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=K et al.|title=Polymeric nanofibers in air filtration applications|journal=Fifteenth Annual Technical Conference &amp; Expo of the American Filtration &amp; Separations Society|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil-water separation===
Nanofibre has the capabilities in oil–water separation, most particularly in sorption process when the material in use has the oleophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. These characteristic enable the nanofiber to be used as a tool to combat either oily waste- water from domestic household and industrial activities, or oily seawater due to the oil run down to the ocean from oil transportation activities and oil tank cleaning on a vessel.&lt;ref name="Sarbatly R. 2016 8–16"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">'''Nordic Windpower''' was a privately owned manufacturer of [[wind turbines]] based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in the [[United States]]. Nordic Windpower filed for liquidation in the Kansas City Bankruptcy court in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/print-edition/2012/10/19/turbine-maker-nordic-windpower-files.html |title=Nordic files |publisher=Kansas City BizJournal |date= |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had roots in a Swedish government wind turbine research and development program started 1975. Early prototypes in this program were erected in [[Maglarp]], [[Skåne]] and [[Näsudden]], [[Gotland]]. Nordic Windpower's N1000 turbine was designed with inspiration from the Maglarp prototype and has [[Unconventional wind turbines#Wind turbines with two blades|two blades]] rather than the more conventional three.

In the 1990s the company became privately owned Nordic Windpower AB. After selling only 5 turbines it became a United States entity in 2005 and promptly sold 7 turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicwindpower.com/history.html |title=Nordic WindPower |publisher=Nordic WindPower |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordicwindpower.com/images/2D_sidebar_1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  It received a $16 million loan guarantee from the [[United States Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_16913416?nclick_check=1 |title=Nordic Windpower leaving California - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its private owners were [[Khosla Ventures]], [[New Enterprise Associates]] and Novus Energy Partners, [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Impax Asset Management Group|Impax Asset Management]], I2BF Venture Capital, Pulsar Energy Capital and other investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicwindpower.com/investor.html |title=Nordic WindPower |publisher=Nordic WindPower |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to Kansas City it had its corporate headquarters in [[Berkeley, California]] with a production facility in [[Pocatello, Idaho]]. Engineering design was carried out in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicwindpower.com/overview.html |title=Nordic WindPower |publisher=Nordic WindPower |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010 Nordic announced its plans to move to Missouri to be closer to its target market and was offered $5.6 million in conditional incentive packages to relocate to [[Kansas City International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/12/21/BUG81GU0KL.DTL |title=Berkeley's Nordic Windpower moving to Missouri |publisher=Sfgate.com |date= 2010-12-22|accessdate=2010-12-22 |first=David R. |last=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordic temporarily occupied {{convert|50000|sqft|m2}} of the {{convert|1700000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former American Airlines Overhaul facility at the airport which the airline had abandoned.

'''Nygårdsfjellet Wind Farm''' is a [[windfarm]] located in [[Narvik]], [[Norway]]. The wind turbines are located 400&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. The farm is owned by [[Nordkraft Vind]], a joint venture between [[Narvik Energi]] and [[DONG Energy]]. It started production in 2006 with three 2.3&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] turbines, an annual production of 26&amp;nbsp;[[Watt hour|GWh]] and with plans to add more turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narvik-energi.no/nordkraft/default.aspx?sid=3 |title=Om Nygårdsfjellet vindpark |author=[[Narvik Energi]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 an additional 11 turbines of the same capacity were commissioned, bringing the total capacity to 32.2&amp;nbsp;MW and the annual production to 104.2&amp;nbsp;GWh corresponding to the average consumption of 5200 Norwegian households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nordkraft.no/kraftverk/nygardsfjellet-vindpark-article368-110.html |title= Nygårdsfjellet vindpark |website= nordkraft.no |accessdate= 2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armadillo Aerospace Pixel Hover.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Armadillo Aerospace]]'s quad [[rocket]] vehicle showing visible banding ([[shock diamond]]s) in the exhaust plume from its propulsion system]]
'''Propulsion''' means to push forward or drive an object forward .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/bgp.html|title=Beginner's Guide to Propulsion|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is derived from two Latin words: ''[[wikt:pro|pro]]'', meaning'' before'' or ''forward''; and ''[[wikt:pellere|pellere]]'', meaning ''to drive''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/bgp.html Beginner's Guide to Propulsion NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; 
A '''propulsion system''' consists of a source of mechanical power, and a ''propulsor'' (means of converting this power into propulsive force). 

A [[technology|technological]] system uses an [[engine|engine or motor]] as the power source (commonly called a '''powerplant'''), and [[wheel and axle|wheels and axles]], [[propeller]]s, or a [[propulsive nozzle]] to generate the force. Components such as [[clutch]]es or [[gearbox]]es may be needed to connect the motor to axles, wheels, or propellers.

[[Biology|Biological]] propulsion systems use an animal's muscles as the power source, and limbs such as [[wing]]s, [[fin]]s or [[leg]]s as the propulsors.

A technological/biological system may use human, or trained animal, muscular work to power a mechanical device.

== Vehicular propulsion ==

===Air propulsion===
{{main|Powered aircraft}}
[[File:Tupolev Tu-95 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[Tupolev Tu-95]] ]]

An aircraft propulsion system generally consists of an [[aircraft engine]] and some means to generate thrust, such as a [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] or a [[propulsive nozzle]].

An aircraft propulsion system must achieve two things. First, the thrust from the propulsion system must balance the drag of the airplane when the airplane is cruising. And second, the thrust from the propulsion system must exceed the drag of the airplane for the airplane to accelerate. The greater the difference between the thrust and the drag, called the excess thrust, the faster the airplane will accelerate&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Some [[aircraft]], like airliners and cargo planes, spend most of their life in a cruise condition. For these airplanes, excess thrust is not as important as high engine efficiency and low fuel usage. Since thrust depends on both the amount of gas moved and the velocity, we can generate high thrust by accelerating a large mass of gas by a small amount, or by accelerating a small mass of gas by a large amount. Because of the aerodynamic efficiency of propellers and fans, it is more fuel efficient to accelerate a large mass by a small amount, which is why high-bypass turbofans and turboprops are commonly used on cargo planes and airliners&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Some aircraft, like fighter planes or experimental high speed aircraft, require very high excess thrust to accelerate quickly and to overcome the high drag associated with high speeds. For these airplanes, engine efficiency is not as important as very high thrust. Modern combat aircraft usually have an afterburner added to a low bypass turbofan. Future hypersonic aircraft may use some type of ramjet or rocket propulsion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

===Ground===
[[File:Opel Ampera (front quarter).jpg|thumb|Wheels are commonly used in ground propulsion]]
{{main|Ground propulsion}}
Ground propulsion is any mechanism for propelling solid bodies along the ground, usually for the purposes of [[transportation]]. The propulsion system often consists of a combination of an [[engine|engine or motor]], a [[gearbox]] and [[wheel and axle]]s in standard applications.

===Maglev===
[[File:Transrapid-emsland.jpg|thumb|[[Transrapid]] 09 at the [[Emsland test facility]] in [[Germany]]]]
{{main|Maglev}}
Maglev (derived from '''mag'''netic '''lev'''itation) is a system of transportation that uses [[magnetic levitation]] to suspend, guide and propel vehicles with magnets rather than using mechanical methods, such as [[wheel and axle|wheels, axles and bearings]]. With maglev a vehicle is levitated a short distance away from a guide way using magnets to create both lift and thrust. Maglev vehicles are claimed to move more smoothly and quietly and to require less maintenance than wheeled [[mass transit]] systems. It is claimed that non-reliance on friction also means that acceleration and deceleration can far surpass that of existing forms of transport. The power needed for levitation is not a particularly large percentage of the overall energy consumption; most of the power used is needed to overcome air resistance ([[drag (physics)|drag]]), as with any other high-speed form of transport.

===Marine===
[[Image:Two Main Engines, V12.jpg|thumb|250px|A view of a ship's engine room]]
{{main|Marine propulsion}}
Marine propulsion is the mechanism or system used to generate [[thrust]] to move a [[ship]] or [[boat]] across water. While [[paddle]]s and [[sail]]s are still used on some smaller boats, most modern ships are propelled by mechanical systems consisting a motor or engine turning a [[propeller]], or less frequently, in jet drives, an [[impeller]]. Marine engineering is the discipline concerned with the design of marine [[propulsion system]]s.

[[Steam engine]]s were the first mechanical engines used in marine propulsion, but have mostly been replaced by [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] or [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] diesel engines, outboard motors, and [[gas turbine engine]]s on faster ships.[[nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear reactors]] producing steam are used to propel [[warship]]s and [[icebreaker]]s, and there have been attempts to utilize them to power commercial vessels.[[Electric motor]]s have been used on [[submarine]]s and [[electric boat]]s and have been proposed for energy-efficient propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/imt/electricship/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517060017/http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/imt/electricship/ |archivedate=2009-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent development in liquified natural gas (LNG) fueled engines are gaining recognition for their low emissions and cost advantages.

===Space===
[[Image:Shuttle Main Engine Test Firing.jpg|thumb|left|A remote camera captures a close-up view of a [[Space Shuttle main engine]] during a test firing at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]]]]
{{main|Spacecraft propulsion}}

Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s. There are many different methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of [[engine]] is called a [[rocket engine]].

All current spacecraft use chemical rockets ([[bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] or [[solid rocket|solid-fuel]]) for launch, though some (such as the [[Pegasus rocket]] and [[SpaceShipOne]]) have used [[air-breathing engine]]s on their [[Multistage rocket|first stage]]. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often [[monopropellant rocket]]s) or [[resistojet rocket]]s for [[orbital station-keeping]] and some use [[momentum wheel]]s for [[attitude control]]. Soviet bloc satellites have used [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used [[ion thruster]]s and [[Hall effect thruster]]s (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.

===Cable===
{{main|Cable car (railway)}}
A cable car is any of a variety of transportation systems relying on cables to pull vehicles along or lower them at a steady rate. The terminology also refers to the vehicles on these systems. The cable car vehicles are motor-less and engine-less and they are pulled by a cable that is rotated by a motor off-board.

==Animal==
{{main|Animal locomotion}}
[[Image:Beeinflightfromfront.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A [[bee]] in flight.]]

Animal locomotion, which is the act of self-propulsion by an animal, has many manifestations, including [[running]], [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]], [[jumping]] and [[Flying and gliding animals|flying]]. Animals move for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, or a suitable [[microhabitat]], and to escape predators. For many animals the ability to move is essential to survival and, as a result, selective pressures have shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms employed by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the [[Arctic tern]]) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators (such as [[frog]]s) are likely to have costly but very fast locomotion. The study of animal locomotion is typically considered to be a sub-field of [[biomechanics]].

Locomotion requires [[energy]] to overcome [[friction]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], [[inertia]], and [[gravity]], though in many circumstances some of these factors are negligible. In [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]] environments gravity must be overcome, though the drag of air is much less of an issue. In aqueous environments however, friction (or drag) becomes the major challenge, with gravity being less of a concern. Although animals with natural [[buoyancy]] need not expend much energy maintaining vertical position, some will naturally sink and must expend energy to remain afloat. Drag may also present a problem in [[flight]], and the [[aerodynamic]]ally efficient body shapes of [[bird]]s highlight this point. Flight presents a different problem from movement in water however, as there is no way for a living organism to have lower [[density]] than air.  Limbless organisms moving on land must often contend with surface friction, but do not usually need to expend significant energy to counteract gravity.

[[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] is widely used in the study of animal locomotion: if at rest, to move forwards an animal must push something backwards.  Terrestrial animals must push the solid ground; swimming and flying animals must push against a [[fluid]] (either [[water]] or [[air]]).&lt;ref name="Bie"&gt;Biewener, A. A. 2003. Animal Locomotion. Oxford University Press, USA. {{ISBN|978-0198500223}},  https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&amp;dq=biomechanics+biewener&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of forces during locomotion on the design of the skeletal system is also important, as is the interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement.

A '''proton''' is a [[subatomic particle]], symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} or {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}}, with a positive [[electric charge]] of +1''e'' [[elementary charge]] and a mass slightly less than that of a [[neutron]]. Protons and [[neutron]]s, each with masses of approximately one [[atomic mass unit]], are collectively referred to as "[[nucleon]]s".

One or more protons are present in the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of every [[atom]]; they are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the [[atomic number]] (represented by the symbol ''Z''). Since each [[chemical element|element]] has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number.

The word ''proton'' is Greek for "first", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the [[hydrogen]] nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of [[nitrogen]] by atomic collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/proton-subatomic-particle|title=proton {{!}} Definition, Mass, Charge, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protons were therefore a candidate to be a [[fundamental particle]], and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.

In the modern [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], protons are [[hadron]]s, and like [[neutron]]s, the other [[nucleon]] (particles present in atomic nuclei), are composed of three [[quark]]s. Although protons were originally considered fundamental or [[elementary particle]]s, they are now known to be composed of three [[valence quark]]s: two [[up quark]]s of charge +{{sfrac|2|3}}''e'' and one [[down quark]] of charge –{{sfrac|1|3}}''e''. The [[rest mass]]es of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton's mass, however.&lt;ref name="Mass"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2010/04/mass-common-quark-finally-nailed-down |title=Mass of the Common Quark Finally Nailed Down |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |date=2 April 2010 |website=Science Magazine |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of a proton's mass is due to [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]], which includes the [[kinetic energy]] of the quarks and the energy of the [[gluon]] fields that bind the quarks together.  Because protons are not fundamental particles, they possess a physical size, though not a definite one; the root mean square [[charge radius]] of a proton is about 0.84–0.87 [[femtometre|fm]] or {{val|0.84|e=-15}} to {{val|0.87|e=-15|u=[[meter|m]]}}.&lt;ref name="PSI"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Paul Shearer Institute

At sufficiently low temperatures, free protons will bind to [[electron]]s. However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the [[electron cloud]] of an atom. The result is a protonated atom, which is a [[chemical compound]] of hydrogen. In vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral [[hydrogen atom]], which is chemically a [[free radical]]. Such "free hydrogen atoms" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are the most common molecular component of [[molecular clouds]] in [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]].

Protons and [[neutron]]s are both [[nucleon]]s, which may be bound together by the [[nuclear force]] to form [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. The nucleus of the most common [[isotope]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] (with the [[chemical symbol]] "H") is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons.

==History==
The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period. As early as 1815, [[William Prout]] proposed that all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called "protyles"), based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of [[atomic weight]]s (see [[Prout's hypothesis]]), which was disproved when more accurate values were measured.&lt;ref name="Lecturer2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry UCLA Eric R.

In 1886, [[Eugen Goldstein]] discovered [[canal rays]] (also known as anode rays) and showed that they were positively charged particles (ions) produced from gases. However, since particles from different gases had different values of [[charge-to-mass ratio]] (e/m), they could not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative [[electron]]s discovered by [[J. J. Thomson]]. [[Wilhelm Wien]] in 1898 identified the hydrogen ion as particle with highest charge-to-mass ratio in ionized gases.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Wien: Über positive Elektronen und die Existenz hoher Atomgewichte. In: Annalen der Physik. Band 318 (4), 1904, S. 669–677.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1911, [[Antonius van den Broek]] proposed that the place of each element in the [[periodic table]] (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge. This was confirmed experimentally by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913 using [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectra]].

In 1917 (in experiments reported in 1919), Rutherford proved that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery of protons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author1=Petrucci, R.H.|author2=Harwood, W.S. |author3=Herring, F.G.  |year=2002  |title=General Chemistry  |edition=8th  |page=41  |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford had earlier learned to produce hydrogen nuclei as a type of radiation produced as a product of the impact of alpha particles on nitrogen gas, and recognize them by their unique penetration signature in air and their appearance in scintillation detectors. These experiments were begun when Rutherford had noticed that, when [[alpha particles]] were shot into air (mostly nitrogen), his scintillation detectors showed the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as a product. After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air, and found that when alphas were produced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. Rutherford determined that this hydrogen could have come only from the nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen must contain hydrogen nuclei. One hydrogen nucleus was being knocked off by the impact of the alpha particle, producing oxygen-17 in the process. This was the first reported [[nuclear reaction]], &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + α → &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + p. (This reaction would later be observed happening directly in a cloud chamber in 1925).

Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by [[Prout's hypothesis]] that hydrogen was the building block of all elements. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in all other nuclei as an elementary particle led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus a special name as a particle, since he suspected that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He named this new fundamental building block of the nucleus the ''proton,'' after the neuter singular of the Greek word for "first", πρῶτον. However, Rutherford also had in mind the word ''protyle'' as used by Prout. Rutherford spoke at the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at its [[Cardiff]] meeting beginning 24 August 1920.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v105/n2651/abs/105780a0.html meeting report] and [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/51/1330/627.2.extract announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford was asked by [[Oliver Lodge]] for a new name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom. He initially suggested both ''proton'' and ''prouton'' (after Prout).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romer A |journal=Am. J. Phys. |volume=65 |page=707 |year=1997 |title=Proton or prouton?

==Stability==
{{Main|Proton decay}}
{{unsolved|physics|Are protons fundamentally stable? Or do they decay with a finite lifetime as predicted by some extensions to the standard model?}}
The free proton (a proton not bound to nucleons or electrons) is a stable particle that has not been observed to break down spontaneously to other particles. Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from electrons, for which they have some affinity. Free protons exist in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with [[electron]]s. Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of [[cosmic ray]]s, which propagate in vacuum for interstellar distances. Free protons are [[proton emission|emitted directly]] from [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] in some rare types of [[radioactive decay]]. Protons also result (along with electrons and [[antineutrino]]s) from the [[radioactive decay]] of free neutrons, which are unstable.

The spontaneous decay of free protons has never been observed, and protons are therefore considered stable particles according to the Standard Model. However, some [[Grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] (GUTs) of particle physics predict that [[proton decay]] should take place with lifetimes between 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; years and experimental searches have established lower bounds on the [[mean lifetime]] of a proton for various assumed decay products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(89)90637-0| title = An upper limit for the proton lifetime in SO(10)| journal = Physics Letters B| volume = 233| issue = 1–2| pages = 178–182| year = 1989| last1 = Buccella | first1 = F.| last2 = Miele | first2 = G.| last3 = Rosa | first3 = L.| last4 = Santorelli | first4 = P.| last5 = Tuzi | first5 = T.|bibcode = 1989PhLB..233..178B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.51.229|arxiv=hep-ph/9404238| title = Predictions for the proton lifetime in minimal nonsupersymmetric SO(10) models: An update| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 51|issue=1| pages = 229–235| year = 1995| last1 = Lee | first1 = D.

Another experiment at the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] in Canada searched for [[gamma ray]]s resulting from residual nuclei resulting from the decay of a proton from oxygen-16. This experiment was designed to detect decay to any product, and established a lower limit to a proton lifetime of {{val|2.1|e=29|u=years}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.102004|pmid=15089201|bibcode=2004PhRvL..92j2004A|arxiv = hep-ex/0310030| title = Constraints on Nucleon Decay via Invisible Modes from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 92| issue = 10|pages=102004| year = 2004| last1 = Ahmed | first1 = S.| last2 = Anthony | first2 = A.| last3 = Beier | first3 = E.| last4 = Bellerive | first4 = A.| last5 = Biller | first5 = S.| last6 = Boger | first6 = J.| last7 = Boulay | first7 = M.| last8 = Bowler | first8 = M.| last9 = Bowles | first9 = T.| last10 = Brice | first10 = S.| last11 = Bullard | first11 = T.| last12 = Chan | first12 = Y.| last13 = Chen | first13 = M.| last14 = Chen | first14 = X.| last15 = Cleveland | first15 = B.| last16 = Cox | first16 = G.| last17 = Dai | first17 = X.| last18 = Dalnoki-Veress | first18 = F.| last19 = Doe | first19 = P.| last20 = Dosanjh | first20 = R.| last21 = Doucas | first21 = G.| last22 = Dragowsky | first22 = M.| last23 = Duba | first23 = C.| last24 = Duncan | first24 = F.| last25 = Dunford | first25 = M.| last26 = Dunmore | first26 = J.| last27 = Earle | first27 = E.| last28 = Elliott | first28 = S.| last29 = Evans | first29 = H.| last30 = Ewan | first30 = G.| display-authors = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, protons are known to transform into [[neutron]]s through the process of [[electron capture]] (also called [[inverse beta decay]]). For free protons, this process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied. The equation is:

:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino|link=yes}}

The process is reversible; neutrons can convert back to protons through [[beta decay]], a common form of [[radioactive decay]]. In fact, a [[free neutron]] decays this way, with a [[mean lifetime]] of about 15 minutes.

==Quarks and the mass of a proton==
In [[quantum chromodynamics]], the modern theory of the nuclear force, most of the mass of protons and [[neutron]]s is explained by [[special relativity]]. The mass of a proton is about 80–100 times greater than the sum of the rest masses of the [[quark]]s that make it up, while the [[gluon]]s have zero rest mass. The extra energy of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s in a region within a proton, as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the [[QCD vacuum]], accounts for almost 99% of the mass. The rest mass of a proton is, thus, the [[invariant mass]] of the system of moving quarks and gluons that make up the particle, and, in such systems, even the energy of massless particles is [[mass-energy equivalence#Fast-moving objects and systems of objects|still measured]] as part of the rest mass of the system.

Two terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up protons: ''[[current quark]] mass'' refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while ''[[constituent quark]] mass'' refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the [[gluon]] [[quantum field theory|particle field]] surrounding the quark.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book  |author=Watson, A.  |title=The Quantum Quark  |pages=285–286

As noted, most of a proton's mass comes from the gluons that bind the current quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy—to be more specific, [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]] (QCBE)—and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of protons (see [[mass in special relativity]]). A proton has a mass of approximately 938&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volt#As a unit of mass|MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks contributes only about 9.4&amp;nbsp;MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; much of the remainder can be attributed to the gluons' [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy|QCBE]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book  |author1=Weise, W. |author2=Green, A.M.  |title=Quarks and Nuclei  |pages=65–66  |publisher=[[World Scientific]]  |year=1984  |isbn=978-9971-966-61-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =Ball  | first =Philip  | title =Nuclear masses calculated from scratch  | publisher =Nature  | date =Nov 20, 2008  | url =http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081120/full/news.2008.1246.html  | accessdate = Aug 27, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reynolds  | first =Mark  | title =Calculating the Mass of a Proton  | journal =CNRS International Magazine  | issue =13  | date =Apr 2009  | url =http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1410.htm

The internal dynamics of protons are complicated, because they are determined by the quarks' exchanging gluons, and interacting with various vacuum condensates. [[Lattice QCD]] provides a way of calculating the mass of a proton directly from the theory to any accuracy, in principle. The most recent calculations&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/38788/title/Standard_model_gets_right_answer_for_proton,_neutron_masses this news report] and links&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fodor"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1163233|arxiv = 0906.3599| pmid = 19023076| title = Ab Initio Determination of Light Hadron Masses| journal = Science| volume = 322| issue = 5905| pages = 1224–7| year = 2008| last1 = Durr | first1 = S.| last2 = Fodor | first2 = Z.| last3 = Frison | first3 = J.| last4 = Hoelbling | first4 = C.| last5 = Hoffmann | first5 = R.| last6 = Katz | first6 = S.

==Charge radius==
{{unsolved|physics|What is the true charge radius of a proton?}}
{{main|Proton radius puzzle}}
The problem of defining a radius for an atomic nucleus (proton) is similar to the problem of [[atomic radius]], in that neither atoms nor their nuclei have definite boundaries. However, the nucleus can be modeled as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of [[electron scattering]] experiments: because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus, the electrons "see" a range of cross-sections, for which a mean can be taken. The qualification of "rms" (for "[[root mean square]]") arises because it is the nuclear cross-section, proportional to the square of the radius, which is determining for electron scattering.

The internationally accepted value of a proton's [[charge radius]] is {{val|0.8768|ul=fm}} (see [[Orders of magnitude (length)#1E-15|orders of magnitude]] for comparison to other sizes). This value is based on measurements involving a proton and an electron (namely, [[electron scattering]] measurements and complex calculation involving scattering cross section based on [[Marshall Rosenbluth|Rosenbluth]] equation for [[momentum-transfer cross section]]), and studies of the atomic [[energy level]]s of hydrogen and deuterium.

However, in 2010 an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the [[Lamb shift]] in muonic hydrogen (an [[exotic atom]] made of a proton and a negatively charged [[muon]]). As a muon is 200 times heavier than an electron, its [[de Broglie wavelength]] is correspondingly shorter.  This smaller [[atomic orbital]] is much more sensitive to the proton's charge radius, so allows more precise measurement.  Their measurement of the [[Root mean square|root-mean-square]] charge radius of a proton is "{{val|0.84184|(67)|u=fm}}, which differs by 5.0 [[standard deviation]]s from the [[CODATA]] value of {{val|0.8768|(69)|u=fm}}".&lt;ref name="Radius"&gt; {{Cite journal  |doi=10.1038/nature09250 |pmid=20613837 |bibcode=2010Natur.466..213P |title=The size of the proton  |journal=Nature |volume=466 |issue=7303 |pages=213–6 |date=8 July 2010  |last1=Pohl |first1=Randolf |last2=Antognini |first2=Aldo |last3=Nez |first3=François |last4=Amaro |first4=Fernando D.  |last5=Biraben |first5=François |last6=Cardoso |first6=João M.

 |title=Proton Structure from the Measurement of 2S-2P Transition Frequencies of Muonic Hydrogen  |journal=Science |volume=339 |issue=6118 |pages=417–420 |date=25 January 2013
 |pmid=23349284 |bibcode=2013Sci...339..417A |doi=10.1126/science.1230016 |hdl=10316/79993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2014 CODATA adjustment slightly reduced the recommended value for the proton radius (computed using electron measurements only) to {{val|0.8751|(61)|u=fm}}, but this leaves the discrepancy at {{#expr:(87510-84087)/sqrt(610^2 + 39^2) round 1}}σ.

The international research team that obtained this result at the [[Paul Scherrer Institut]] in [[Villigen]] includes scientists from the [[Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics]], [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]], the [[Institut für Strahlwerkzeuge]] of [[Universität Stuttgart]], and the [[University of Coimbra]], Portugal.&lt;ref name="nanotechnology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=The Proton Just Got Smaller |url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=42905  |work=Photonics.Com |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team is now attempting to explain the discrepancy, and re-examining the results of both previous high-precision measurements and complex calculations involving [[scattering]] [[cross section (physics)|cross section]].

The radius is linked to the form factor and [[momentum transfer cross section]]. The atomic form factor G modifies the cross section corresponding to point-like proton.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                     R_e^2 &amp;= -6 {\frac{dG_e}{dq^2}\, \Bigg\vert\,}_{q^2=0} \\
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\ &amp;= {\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\, \Bigg\vert\,}_{point} G^2(q^2)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[atomic form factor]] is related to the wave function density of the target:

:&lt;math&gt;G(q^2) = \int e^{i qr} \psi (r)^2 dr^3&lt;/math&gt;

The form factor can be split in electric and magnetic form factors. These can be further written as linear combinations of Dirac and Pauli form factors.&lt;ref name="The Proton Radius Puzzle"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                      G_m &amp;= F_D + F_P \\
                      G_e &amp;= F_D - \tau F_P \\
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} &amp;= {\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\, \Bigg\vert\,}_{NS} \frac{1}{1 + \tau}\left(G_e^2\left(q^2\right) + \frac{\tau}{\epsilon}G_m^2\left(q^2\right)\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Pressure inside the proton ===
Since the proton is composed of quarks confined by gluons, an equivalent [[pressure]] which acts on the quarks can be defined. This allows calculation of their distribution as a function of distance from the centre using [[Compton scattering]] of high-energy electrons (DVCS, for ''deeply virtual Compton scattering''). The pressure is maximum at the centre, about 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; Pa which is greater than the pressure inside a [[neutron star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The pressure distribution inside the proton |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0060-z |author1=V.

=== Charge radius in solvated proton, hydronium ===
The radius of hydrated proton appears in the [[Born equation]] for calculating the hydration enthalpy of [[hydronium]].

==Interaction of free protons with ordinary matter==

Although protons have affinity for oppositely charged electrons, this is a relatively low-energy interaction and so free protons must lose sufficient velocity (and [[kinetic energy]]) in order to become closely associated and bound to electrons. High energy protons, in traversing ordinary matter, lose energy by collisions with [[atomic nuclei]], and by [[ionization]] of atoms (removing electrons) until they are slowed sufficiently to be captured by the [[electron cloud]] in a normal atom.

However, in such an association with an electron, the character of the bound proton is not changed, and it remains a proton. The attraction of low-energy free protons to any electrons present in normal matter (such as the electrons in normal atoms) causes free protons to stop and to form a new chemical bond with an atom. Such a bond happens at any sufficiently "cold" temperature (i.e., comparable to temperatures at the surface of the Sun) and with any type of atom. Thus, in interaction with any type of normal (non-plasma) matter, low-velocity free protons are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come in contact, causing the proton and molecule to combine. Such molecules are then said to be "[[protonated]]", and chemically they often, as a result, become so-called [[Brønsted acid]]s.

==Proton in chemistry==

===Atomic number===
In [[chemistry]], the number of protons in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom is known as the [[atomic number]], which determines the [[chemical element]] to which the atom belongs. For example, the atomic number of [[chlorine]] is 17; this means that each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are chlorine atoms. The chemical properties of each atom are determined by the number of (negatively charged) [[electron]]s, which for neutral atoms is equal to the number of (positive) protons so that the total charge is zero. For example, a neutral chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons, whereas a Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[anion]] has 17 protons and 18 electrons for a total charge of −1.

All atoms of a given element are not necessarily identical, however, as the [[number of neutrons]] may vary to form different [[isotope]]s, and energy levels may differ forming different [[nuclear isomer]]s. For example, there are two stable [[isotopes of chlorine]]: {{nuclide|Chlorine|35}} with 35 − 17 = 18 neutrons and {{nuclide|Chlorine|37}} with 37 − 17 = 20 neutrons.

===Hydrogen ion===
{{see also|Hydron (chemistry)}}
[[File:Hydrogen.svg|thumb|220px|Protium, the most common isotope of hydrogen, consists of one proton and one electron (it has no neutrons). The term "hydrogen ion" ({{chem|H|+}}) implies that that H-atom has lost its one electron, causing only a proton to remain. Thus, in chemistry, the terms "proton" and "hydrogen ion" (for the protium isotope) are used synonymously]]

{{quote box|width=20%|align=left|quote=The proton is a unique chemical species, being a bare nucleus. As a consequence it has no independent existence in the condensed state and is invariably found bound by a pair of electrons to another atom.|salign=right|source=Ross Stewart, ''The Proton: Application to Organic Chemistry'' (1985, p. 1)}}
In chemistry, the term proton refers to the hydrogen ion, {{chem|H|+}}. Since the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, a hydrogen ion has no electrons and corresponds to a bare nucleus, consisting of a proton (and 0 neutrons for the most abundant isotope ''protium'' {{nuclide|Hydrogen|1|link=yes}}). The proton is a "bare charge" with only about 1/64,000 of the radius of a hydrogen atom, and so is extremely reactive chemically. The free proton, thus, has an extremely short lifetime in chemical systems such as liquids and it reacts immediately with the [[electron cloud]] of any available molecule. In aqueous solution, it forms the [[hydronium ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which in turn is further [[solvation|solvated]] by water molecules in [[Hydrogen ion#Cation (positively charged)|clusters]] such as [H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Headrick&gt;{{cite journal |last=Headrick|first=J.M. |author2=Diken, E.G. |author3=Walters, R. S. |author4=Hammer, N. I. |author5=Christie, R.A. |author6=Cui, J. |author7=Myshakin, E.M. |author8=Duncan, M.A. |author9=Johnson, M.A. |author10= Jordan, K.D. |year=2005 |title=Spectral Signatures of Hydrated Proton Vibrations in Water Clusters |journal=Science |volume=308 |pages=1765–69 |doi=10.1126/science.1113094 |pmid=15961665 |issue=5729|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1765H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of {{chem|H|+}} in an [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|acid–base reaction]] is usually referred to as "proton transfer". The [[acid]] is referred to as a proton donor and the [[base (chemistry)|base]] as a proton acceptor. Likewise, [[biochemistry|biochemical]] terms such as [[proton pump]] and [[proton channel]] refer to the movement of hydrated {{chem|H|+}} ions.

The ion produced by removing the electron from a [[deuterium]] atom is known as a deuteron, not a proton. Likewise, removing an electron from a [[tritium]] atom produces a triton.

===Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)===
Also in chemistry, the term "[[proton NMR]]" refers to the observation of hydrogen-1 nuclei in (mostly [[organic chemistry|organic]]) molecules by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]. This method uses the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the proton, which has the value one-half. The name refers to examination of protons as they occur in [[Hydrogen-1|protium]] (hydrogen-1 atoms) in compounds, and does not imply that free protons exist in the compound being studied.

==Human exposure==
{{main|Effect of spaceflight on the body}}
{{see also|Proton therapy}}

The [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]]s (ALSEP) determined that more than 95% of the particles in the [[solar wind]] are electrons and protons, in approximately equal numbers.&lt;ref name="LPI"&gt; {{cite web  |year=2009  |title=Apollo 11 Mission  |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_11/experiments/swc/  |publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]
 |accessdate=2009-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BNL"/&gt;

{{Quotation|Because the Solar Wind [[Spectrometer]] made continuous measurements, it was possible to measure how the [[Earth's magnetic field]] affects arriving solar wind particles. For about two-thirds of each orbit, the [[Moon]] is outside of the Earth's magnetic field. At these times, a typical proton density was 10 to 20 per cubic centimeter, with most protons having velocities between 400 and 650 kilometers per second. For about five days of each month, the Moon is inside the Earth's geomagnetic tail, and typically no solar wind particles were detectable. For the remainder of each lunar orbit, the Moon is in a transitional region known as the [[magnetosheath]], where the Earth's magnetic field affects the solar wind but does not completely exclude it. In this region, the particle flux is reduced, with typical proton velocities of 250 to 450 kilometers per second. During the lunar night, the spectrometer was shielded from the solar wind by the Moon and no solar wind particles were measured.&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt;}}

Protons also have extrasolar origin from galactic [[cosmic ray]]s, where they make up about 90% of the total particle flux. These protons often have higher energy than solar wind protons, and their intensity is far more uniform and less variable than protons coming from the Sun, the production of which is heavily affected by [[solar proton event]]s such as [[coronal mass ejection]]s.

Research has been performed on the dose-rate effects of protons, as typically found in [[Human spaceflight|space travel]], on human health.&lt;ref name="BNL"&gt;

[[CPT-symmetry]] puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and [[antiparticles]] and, therefore, is open to stringent tests. For example, the charges of a proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero. This equality has been tested to one part in {{val|e=8}}. The equality of their masses has also been tested to better than one part in {{val|e=8}}.

The '''Quantum Chromodynamic Vacuum''' or '''QCD vacuum''' is the [[vacuum state]] of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). It is an example of a ''[[non-perturbative]]'' vacuum state{{elucidate|date=March 2017}}, characterized by non-vanishing [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s such as the [[gluon condensate]] and the [[quark condensate]] in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the '''confined phase''' of [[quark matter]].

==Symmetries and symmetry breaking==

===Symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian===

Like any [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[quantum field theory]], [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] enjoys [[Poincaré group|Poincaré symmetry]] including the discrete symmetries [[CPT symmetry|CPT]] (each of which is realized). Apart from these space-time symmetries, it also has internal symmetries. Since QCD is an [[SU(3)]] [[gauge theory]], it has local SU(3) [[gauge symmetry]].

Since it has many [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]s of quarks, it has approximate flavour and [[chiral symmetry]]. This approximation is said to involve the '''chiral limit''' of QCD. Of these chiral symmetries, the [[baryon number]] symmetry is exact. Some of the broken symmetries include the axial U(1) symmetry of the flavour group. This is broken by the [[chiral anomaly]]. The presence of [[instanton]]s implied by this anomaly also [[strong CP problem|breaks CP symmetry]].

In summary, the QCD Lagrangian has the following symmetries:
*[[Poincaré symmetry]] and [[CPT symmetry|CPT]] invariance
*SU(3) local [[gauge symmetry]]
*approximate global SU({{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}})&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;SU({{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}) [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] [[chiral symmetry]] and the U(1) [[baryon number]] symmetry

The following classical symmetries are broken in the QCD Lagrangian:
*scale, i.e., [[conformal symmetry]] (through the [[scale anomaly]]), giving rise to [[asymptotic freedom]]
*the axial part of the U(1) [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] chiral symmetry (through the [[chiral anomaly]]), giving rise to the [[strong CP problem]].

===Spontaneous symmetry breaking===

{{Main article|Spontaneous symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking}}

When the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a system (or the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]) has a certain symmetry, but the [[vacuum#The quantum-mechanical vacuum|vacuum]] does not, then one says that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] (SSB) has taken place.

A familiar example of SSB is in [[magnet|ferromagnetic materials]]. Microscopically, the material consists of [[atom]]s with a non-vanishing spin, each of which acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a [[magnetic dipole]]. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under [[rotation]]s. At high temperature, there is no [[magnet]]ization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a ''preferred direction'', since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.

When a [[continuous symmetry]] is spontaneously broken, massless [[boson]]s appear, corresponding to the remaining symmetry. This is called the '''Goldstone phenomenon''' and the bosons are called [[Goldstone boson]]s.

===Symmetries of the QCD vacuum===

The SU({{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}})&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;SU({{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}) chiral flavour symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is broken in the [[vacuum state]] of the theory. The symmetry of the vacuum state is the diagonal SU({{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}) part of the chiral group. The diagnostic for this is the   formation of a non-vanishing [[chiral condensate]] {{math|⟨{{overline|''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}}, where {{mvar|ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the quark field operator, and the flavour index {{mvar|i}} is summed. The [[Goldstone boson]]s of the symmetry breaking are the [[pseudoscalar (physics)|pseudoscalar]] [[meson]]s.

When N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;=2, i.e., only the [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark|down]] quarks are treated as massless, the three [[pion]]s are the [[Goldstone boson]]s. When the [[strange quark|strange]] quark is also treated as massless, i.e., {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 3}}, all eight pseudoscalar [[meson]]s of the [[quark model]] become [[Goldstone boson]]s. The actual masses of these [[meson]]s are obtained in [[chiral perturbation theory]] through an expansion in the (small) actual masses of the quarks.

In other phases of [[quark matter]] the full chiral [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] symmetry may be recovered, or broken in completely different ways.

==Experimental evidence==

The evidence for QCD condensates comes from two eras, the pre-QCD era 1950–1973 and the post-QCD era, after 1974. The pre-QCD results established that the strong interactions vacuum contains a quark chiral condensate, while the post-QCD results established that the vacuum also contains a gluon condensate.

=== Motivating results ===
==== Gradient coupling ====

In the 1950s, there were many attempts to produce a field theory to describe the interactions of [[pion]]s and nucleons. The obvious renormalizable interaction between the two objects is the [[Yukawa coupling]] to a pseudoscalar:

:&lt;math&gt;L_I= \bar{N}\gamma_5 \pi N&lt;/math&gt;

And this is clearly theoretically correct, since it is leading order and it takes all the symmetries into account. But it doesn't match experiment. The interaction that does couples the nucleons to the ''gradient'' of the pion field.

:&lt;math&gt;g \bar{N}\gamma^\mu\gamma_5 \partial_\mu \pi N&lt;/math&gt;

This is the '''gradient-coupling model'''. This interaction has a very different dependence on the energy of the pion—it vanishes at zero momentum.
 
This type of coupling means that a coherent state of low momentum pions barely interacts at all. This is a manifestation of an approximate symmetry, a '''shift symmetry''' of the pion field. The replacement

:&lt;math&gt;\pi \rightarrow \pi+C&lt;/math&gt;

leaves the gradient coupling alone, but not the pseudoscalar coupling.

The modern explanation for the shift symmetry was first proposed by [[Yoichiro Nambu]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. The pion field is a [[Goldstone boson]], and the shift symmetry is the lowest order approximation to moving along the flat directions.

==== Goldberger–Treiman relation ====

There is a mysterious relationship between the strong interaction coupling of the pions to the nucleons, the coefficient {{mvar|g}} in the gradient coupling model, and the axial vector current coefficient of the nucleon which determines the weak decay rate of the neutron. The relation is

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\pi NN} F_\pi = G_A M_N &lt;/math&gt;

and it is obeyed to 10% accuracy.

The constant {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the coefficient that determines the neutron decay rate. It gives the normalization of the weak interaction matrix elements for the nucleon. On the other hand, the pion-nucleon coupling is a phenomenological constant describing the scattering of bound states of quarks and gluons.

The weak interactions are current-current interactions ultimately because they come from a non-Abelian gauge theory. The Goldberger–Treiman relation suggests that the pions for some reason interact as if they are related to the same symmetry current.

===== Partially conserved axial current =====

The phenomenon  which gives rise to the Goldberger–Treiman relation was called the ''partially conserved axial current'' (PCAC) hypothesis. Partially conserved is an archaic term for spontaneously broken, and the axial current is now called the chiral symmetry current.

The idea is that the symmetry current which performs axial rotations on the fundamental fields does not preserve the vacuum. This means that the current {{mvar|J}} applied to the vacuum produces particles. The particles must be spinless, otherwise the vacuum wouldn't be Lorentz invariant. By index matching, the matrix element is:

:&lt;math&gt;J_\mu |0\rangle = k_\mu |\pi\rangle \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|k&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the momentum carried by the created pion. Since the divergence of the axial current operator is zero, we must have

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu J^\mu |0\rangle  = k^\mu k_\mu |\pi\rangle  = m_\pi^2|\pi\rangle = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the pions are massless, {{math|''m''{{su|b=π|p=2}} {{=}} 0}}, in accordance with [[Goldstone's theorem]].

Now if the scattering matrix element is considered, we have

:&lt;math&gt;k_\mu \langle N(p) |\pi(k) N(p') \rangle  = \langle N(p) | J_\mu |N(p')\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Up to a momentum factor, which is the gradient in the coupling, it takes the same form as the axial current turning a neutron into a proton in the current-current form of the weak interaction.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle N |J^\mu |N\rangle  \langle e| J_\mu |\nu\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

==== Soft pion emission ====

Extensions of the PCAC ideas allowed [[Steven Weinberg]] to calculate the amplitudes for collisions which emit low energy pions from the amplitude for the same process with no pions. The amplitudes are those given by acting with symmetry currents on the external particles of the collision.

These successes established the basic properties of the strong interaction vacuum well before QCD.

===Pseudo-Goldstone bosons===
Experimentally it is seen that the masses of the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|octet]] of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of [[vector (geometric)|vector]] mesons (such as the [[rho meson]]). The most convincing evidence for SSB of the chiral [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these [[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with [[chiral perturbation theory]]. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by [[lattice QCD]] computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by [[chiral perturbation theory]].

===Eta prime meson===
This pattern of SSB solves one of the earlier "mysteries" of the [[quark model]], where all the pseudoscalar mesons should have been of nearly the same mass. Since {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 3}}, there should have been nine of these. However, one (the SU(3) singlet [[eta meson|η′]] meson) has quite a larger mass than the SU(3) octet. In the quark model, this has no natural explanation – a mystery named the '''η−η′ mass splitting''' (the η is one member of the octet, which should have been degenerate in mass with the η′).

In QCD, one realizes that the η′ is associated with the axial U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(1) which is ''explicitly broken'' through the [[chiral anomaly]], and thus its mass is not "protected" to be small, like that of the η. The η–η′ mass splitting can be explained&lt;ref name=DelDebbio&gt;

===Current algebra and QCD sum rules===
PCAC and [[current algebra]] also provide evidence for this pattern of SSB. Direct estimates of the chiral condensate also come from such analysis.

Another method of analysis of [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation function]]s in QCD is  through an [[operator product expansion]] (OPE). This writes the [[vacuum expectation value]] of a non-local operator as a sum over VEVs of local operators, i.e., [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s. The value of the correlation function then dictates the values of the condensates. Analysis of many separate correlation functions gives consistent results for several condensates, including the [[gluon condensate]], the [[quark condensate]], and many mixed and higher order condensates. In particular one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left\langle (gG)^2\right\rangle\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \left\langle g^2 G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}\right\rangle &amp;\approx 0.5 \;\text{GeV}^4 \\
\left\langle \overline\psi\psi\right\rangle &amp;\approx (-0.23)^3 \;\text{GeV}^3 \\
\left\langle (gG)^4\right\rangle&amp;\approx 5:10\left\langle (gG)^2\right\rangle^2 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{mvar|G}} refers to the [[gluon]] [[field (physics)|field]] [[tensor]], {{mvar|ψ}} to the [[quark]] [[field (physics)|field]], and {{mvar|g}} to the QCD coupling.

These analyses are being refined further through improved sum rule estimates and direct estimates in [[lattice QCD]]. They provide the ''raw data'' which must be explained by models of the QCD vacuum.

==Models of the QCD vacuum==
A full solution of QCD should give a full description of the vacuum, [[colour confinement|confinement]] and the [[hadron]] spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} [[Lattice QCD]] is making rapid progress towards providing the solution as a systematically improvable numerical computation. However, approximate models of the QCD vacuum remain useful in more restricted domains. The purpose of these models is to make quantitative sense of some set of condensates and [[hadron]] properties such as masses and [[form factor (quantum field theory)|form factor]]s.

This section is devoted to models. Opposed to these are systematically improvable computational procedures such as [[large N QCD|large {{mvar|N}} QCD]] and [[lattice QCD]], which are described in their own articles.

===The Savvidy vacuum, instabilities and structure===

The [[Savvidy vacuum]] is a model of the QCD vacuum which at a basic level is a statement that it cannot be the conventional [[Fock vacuum]] empty of particles and fields. In 1977, [[George Savvidy]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Since [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s are scalar, it seems like a good first approximation that the vacuum contains some non-zero but homogeneous field which gives rise to these condensates. However, [[Stanley Mandelstam]] showed that a homogeneous vacuum field is also unstable.  The instability of a homogeneous gluon field was argued by [[Niels Kjær Nielsen]] and [[Poul Olesen]] in their 1978 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===The dual superconducting model===

In a type II [[superconductor]], [[electric charge]]s condense into [[Cooper pair]]s. As a result, [[magnetic flux]] is squeezed into tubes. In the [[dual superconducting model|dual superconductor]] picture of the QCD vacuum, chromomagnetic monopoles condense into dual Cooper pairs, causing chromoelectric flux to be squeezed into tubes. As a result, [[colour confinement|confinement]] and the ''string picture'' of hadrons follows. This '''dual superconductor''' picture is due to [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and [[Stanley Mandelstam]]. [[Gerard 't Hooft|'t Hooft]] showed further that an [[Abelian projection]] of a non-Abelian [[gauge theory]] contains [[magnetic monopole]]s.

While the vortices in a type II superconductor are neatly arranged into a hexagonal or occasionally square lattice, as is reviewed in Olesen's 1980 seminar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===String models===

String models of [[colour confinement|confinement]] and [[hadron]]s have a long history. They were first invented to explain certain aspects of [[crossing symmetry]] in the scattering of two [[meson]]s. They were also found to be useful in the description of certain properties of the [[Regge trajectory]] of the [[hadron]]s. These early developments took on a life of their own called the [[dual resonance model]] (later renamed [[string theory]]). However, even after the development of QCD string models continued to play a role in the physics of [[strong interaction]]s. These models are called ''non-fundamental strings'' or [[QCD string]]s, since they should be derived from QCD, as they are, in certain approximations such as the strong coupling limit of [[lattice QCD]].

The model states that the colour electric flux between a quark and an antiquark collapses into a string, rather than spreading out into a Coulomb field as the normal electric flux does. This string also obeys a different force law. It behaves as if the string had constant tension, so that separating out the ends (quarks) would give a potential energy increasing linearly with the separation. When the energy is higher than that of a meson, the string breaks and the two new ends become a quark-antiquark pair, thus describing the creation of a meson. Thus confinement is incorporated naturally into the model.

In the form of the [[Lund model]] Monte Carlo program, this picture has had remarkable success in explaining experimental data collected in electron-electron and hadron-hadron collisions.

===Bag models===

Strictly, these models are not models of the QCD vacuum, but of physical single particle [[quantum states]] &amp;mdash; the [[hadron]]s. The model proposed originally in 1974 by A. Chodos ''et al.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chodos | first1 = A. | authorlink2 = Robert Jaffe | authorlink5 = Viki Weisskopf | last2 = Jaffe | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = K. | last4 = Thorn | first4 = C. B. | last5 = Weisskopf | first5 = V. F. | year = 1974 | title = New extended model of hadrons | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3471–3495 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.9.3471 | bibcode = 1974PhRvD...9.3471C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
consists of inserting a quark model in a ''perturbative vacuum'' inside a volume of space called a '''bag'''. Outside this bag is the real QCD vacuum, whose effect is taken into account through the difference between energy density of the true QCD vacuum and the perturbative vacuum (bag constant {{mvar|B}}) and boundary conditions imposed on the quark [[wave function]]s and the gluon field. The [[hadron]] spectrum is obtained by solving the [[Dirac equation]] for quarks and the Yang–Mills equations for gluons. The wave functions of the quarks satisfy the boundary conditions of a fermion in an infinitely deep potential well of scalar type with respect to the Lorentz group. The boundary conditions for the gluon field are those of the dual color superconductor. The role of such a [[Dual superconductor model|superconductor]] is attributed to the physical vacuum of QCD. Bag models strictly prohibit the existence of open color (free quarks, free gluons, etc.) and lead in particular to string models of hadrons.

The '''chiral bag model''' couples the [[Current algebra|axial vector current]] {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}''γ''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''γ&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;ψ''}} of the quarks at the bag boundary to a [[pion|pionic field]] outside of the bag.  In the most common formulation, the chiral bag model basically replaces the interior of the [[skyrmion]] with the bag of quarks.  Very curiously, most physical properties of the nucleon become mostly insensitive to the bag radius.  Prototypically,  the [[baryon number]] of the chiral bag remains an integer, independent of bag radius: the exterior baryon number is identified with the topological [[winding number]] density of the Skyrme [[soliton]], while the interior baryon number consists of the valence quarks (totaling to one) plus the [[spectral asymmetry]] of the quark eigenstates in the bag.  The spectral asymmetry is just the vacuum expectation value {{math|⟨{{overline|''ψ''}}''γ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ψ''⟩}} summed over all of the quark eigenstates in the bag.  Other values, such as the total mass and the axial coupling constant {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}, are not precisely invariant like the baryon number, but are mostly insensitive to the bag radius, as long as the bag radius is kept below the nucleon diameter.  Because the quarks are treated as free quarks inside the bag, the radius-independence in a sense validates the idea of [[asymptotic freedom]].

===Instanton ensemble===
{{Main article|instanton fluid}}
Another view states that [[BPST instanton|BPST]]-like [[instanton]]s play an important role in the vacuum structure of QCD. These instantons were discovered in 1975 by [[Alexander Belavin]], [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]], [[Albert S. Schwarz]] and [[Yu. S. Tyupkin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Belavin | first = A.A. | first2 = A. M. | last2 = Polyakov | author2-link = Alexander Markovich Polyakov | first3 = A. S. | last3 = Schwartz | first4 = Yu.

They represent [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] transitions from one vacuum state to another. These instantons are indeed found in [[lattice QCD|lattice]] calculations. The first computations performed with instantons used the dilute gas approximation. The results obtained did not solve the infrared problem of QCD, making many physicists turn away from instanton physics. Later, though, an [[instanton fluid|instanton liquid model]] was proposed, turning out to be more promising an approach.&lt;ref name="Hutter"&gt;{{cite arXiv| first = Marcus | last = Hutter | title = Instantons in QCD: Theory and application of the instanton liquid model  | date = 1995 | eprint = hep-ph/0107098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dilute instanton gas model''' departs from the supposition that the QCD vacuum consists of a gas of BPST-like instantons. Although only the solutions with one or few instantons (or anti-instantons) are known exactly, a dilute gas of instantons and anti-instantons can be approximated by considering a superposition of one-instanton solutions at great distances from one another. [[Gerard 't Hooft]] calculated the effective action for such an ensemble,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = 't Hooft | first = Gerard | authorlink = Gerardus 't Hooft | title = Computation of the quantum effects due to a four-dimensional pseudoparticle | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = D14 | issue = 12 | pages = 3432–3450 | date = 1976 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.14.3432   |bibcode = 1976PhRvD..14.3432T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he found an [[infrared divergence]] for big instantons, meaning that an infinite amount of infinitely big instantons would populate the vacuum.

Later, an '''[[instanton fluid|instanton liquid model]]''' was studied. This model starts from the assumption that an ensemble of instantons cannot be described by a mere sum of separate instantons. Various models have been proposed, introducing interactions between instantons or using variational methods (like the "valley approximation") endeavoring to approximate the exact multi-instanton solution as closely as possible. Many phenomenological successes have been reached.&lt;ref name="Hutter"/&gt; Whether an instanton liquid can explain confinement in 3+1 dimensional QCD is not known, but many physicists think that it is unlikely.

===Center vortex picture===
A more recent picture of the QCD vacuum is one in which [[center vortex|center vortices]] play an important role. These vortices are [[topological defect]]s carrying a [[center (group theory)|center]] element as charge. These vortices are usually studied using [[lattice gauge theory|lattice simulations]], and it has been found that the behavior of the vortices is closely linked with the [[Color confinement|confinement]]–[[deconfinement]] phase transition: in the confinement phase vortices percolate and fill the spacetime volume, in the deconfinement phase they are much suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Engelhardt | first1 = M. | last2 = Langfeld | first2 = K. | last3 = Reinhardt | first3 = H. | last4 = Tennert | first4 = O. | title = Deconfinement in SU(2) Yang–Mills theory as a center vortex percolation transition  | date = 2000 | journal = [[Physical Review D]] |volume=61 | issue = 5 | page = 054504 | doi =  10.1103/PhysRevD.61.054504|arxiv = hep-lat/9904004 |bibcode = 2000PhRvD..61e4504E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it has been shown that the string tension vanished upon removal of center vortices from the simulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Del Debbio | first1 = L. | last2 = Faber | first2 = M. | last3 = Greensite | first3 = J. | last4 = Olejník | first4 = Š. | title = Center dominance and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vortices in SU(2) lattice gauge theory | date = 1997 | journal = [[Physical Review D]] | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 2298–2306 | doi =  10.1103/PhysRevD.55.2298|arxiv = hep-lat/9610005 |bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.2298D }}&lt;/ref&gt; hinting at an important role for center vortices.

In mathematics, a '''sheaf of planes''' is the set of all [[plane (geometry)|planes]] that have the same common [[line (geometry)|line]].&lt;ref name="def"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SheafofPlanes.html Definition on ''Mathworld Wolfram'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerville|first1=D.

When extending the concept of line to the [[line at infinity]], a set of '''parallel planes''' can be seen as a ''sheaf of planes'' intersecting in a ''line at infinity''. To distinguish it from the more common definition the adjective ''parallel'' can be added to it, resulting in the expression: ''parallel sheaf of planes''.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;[http://www.vitutor.com/geometry/space/sheaf_planes.html Vitutor: Sheaf of Planes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''S'''mall '''A'''rms '''W'''eapons '''E'''ffect '''S'''imulator (SAWES) was a training device used by the British Army during the 1980s. It consisted of an infrared projector mounted on the L1A1 self-loading rifle and later the SA80, and a harness with receptors to receive the beams to simulate hits. The sight had a similar [[reticle]] as the SUSAT and a cable attached to the trigger that activated the device when using blank ammunition. An unusual 'Umpire gun' existed made from L1A1 components was used by range staff.

A '''substellar object''', sometimes called a '''substar''', is an [[astronomical object]] whose [[mass]] is smaller than the smallest mass at which [[hydrogen fusion]] can be sustained (approximately 0.08 [[solar mass]]es). This definition includes [[brown dwarf]]s and former stars similar to [[EF Eridani|EF Eridani B]], and can also include [[planemo|objects of planetary mass]], regardless of their formation mechanism and whether or not they are associated with a primary [[star]].&lt;ref&gt;§3, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....132.2513S What Is a Planet?], Steven Soter, ''Astronomical Journal'', '''132''', #6 (December 2006), pp. 2513–2519.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chabrier and Baraffe, pp. 337–338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/alulaaus.html Alula Australis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824152117/http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/alulaaus.html |date=2006-08-24 }}, Jim Kaler, in ''Stars'', a collection of web pages.  Accessed on line September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...460..799G A search for substellar members in the Praesepe and σ Orionis clusters], B. M. González-García, M. R. Zapatero Osorio, V. J. S. Béjar, G. Bihain, D. Barrado Y Navascués, J. A. Caballero, and M. Morales-Calderón, ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'' '''460''', #3 (December 2006), pp. 799–810.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that a substellar object has a composition similar to the [[Sun]]'s and at least the mass of [[Jupiter]] (approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses), its radius will be comparable to that of Jupiter (approximately 0.1 [[solar radii]]) regardless of the mass of the substellar object (brown dwarfs are less than 75 Jupiter masses). This is because the center of such a substellar object at the top range of the mass (just below the hydrogen-burning limit) is quite [[electron-degenerate matter|degenerate]], with a [[density]] of ≈10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but this degeneracy lessens with decreasing mass until, at the mass of Jupiter, a substellar object has a central density less than 10 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The density decrease balances the mass decrease, keeping the radius approximately constant.&lt;ref&gt;Chabrier and Baraffe, §2.1.1, 3.1, Figure 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Substellar objects like brown dwarfs can live forever even though they do not have enough mass to fuse hydrogen and helium.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A substellar object with a mass just below the hydrogen-fusing limit may ignite hydrogen fusion temporarily at its center. Although this will provide some energy, it will not be enough to overcome the object's ongoing [[gravitational contraction]]. Likewise, although an object with mass above approximately 0.013 solar masses will be able to [[deuterium burning|fuse deuterium]] for a time, this source of energy will be exhausted in approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; years.  Apart from these sources, the radiation of an isolated substellar object comes only from the release of its [[gravitational potential energy]], which causes it to gradually cool and shrink.  A substellar object in [[orbit]] about a star will shrink more slowly as it is kept warm by the star, evolving towards an [[Radiative equilibrium|equilibrium]] state where it emits as much energy as it receives from the star.&lt;ref&gt;Chabrier and Baraffe, §4.1, Figures 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Substellar objects are cool enough to have water vapor in their atmosphere. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] can detect the distinctive [[color of water]] in [[gas giant]] size substellar objects, even if they are not in orbit about a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/hubble-finds-substellar-objects-in-the-orion-nebula|title=Hubble Finds Substellar Objects in the Orion Nebula|last=Hille|first=Karl|date=2018-01-11|work=NASA|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[William Duncan MacMillan]] proposed in 1918 the classification of substellar objects into three categories based on their density and phase state: solid, transitional and dark (non-stellar) gaseous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=William Duncan MacMillan |last=MacMillan |first=W. D. |date=July 1918 |title=On stellar evolution |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=48 |pages=35–49 |doi=10.1086/142412 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1086/142412|bibcode = 1918ApJ....48...35M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid objects include Earth, smaller [[Terrestrial Planet Finder|terrestrial planets]] and moons; with Uranus and Neptune (as well as later [[mini-Neptune]] and [[Super Earth]] planets) as transitional objects between solid and gaseous. Saturn, Jupiter and large gas giant planets are in a fully "gaseous" state.

No definition of tornado alley has ever been officially designated by the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS).&lt;ref name=nssl /&gt; Thus, differences in location are the result of the different criteria used.&lt;ref name=nssl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tornado FAQ |work = Storm Prediction Center |publisher = NOAA |date = January 29, 2007 |url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado#alley1 |accessdate = September 29, 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66HiOfcTX?url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado#alley1 |archivedate = March 19, 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) FAQ,&lt;ref name=nssl /&gt; "Tornado Alley" is a term used by the media as a reference to areas that have higher numbers of tornadoes. A study of 1921–1995 tornadoes concluded almost one-fourth of all significant tornadoes occur in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Climatology Risk of Strong and Violent Tornadoes In the United States |publisher = Northern Illinois University &amp; NOAA/ERL/National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = January 29, 2007 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/concannon |accessdate = April 26, 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070503091216/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/concannon/ |archivedate = May 3, 2007 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No state is entirely free of tornadoes; however, they occur more frequently in the [[Central United States]], between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Appalachian Mountains]].&lt;ref name="nssl"&gt;{{cite web |title = Severe Weather 101: Tornado FAQ |work = National Severe Storms Laboratory |publisher = NOAA |date = January 29, 2007 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq |accessdate = September 29, 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131030104520/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/ |archivedate = October 30, 2013 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas reports the most tornadoes of any state due to its large size, in addition to its proximity to Tornado Alley. Kansas and Oklahoma ranked first and second respectively in the number of tornadoes per area, per data collected through 2007, however in 2013 statistics from the National Climatic Data Center show Florida ranked first.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; Although Florida reports a high number and density of tornado occurrences, tornadoes there rarely reach the strength of those that sometimes occur in the southern plains.&lt;ref name="ncdc"&gt;{{cite web |title = Tornado Climatology |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |date = January 29, 2007 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadoes.html |accessdate = April 26, 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629012820/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadoes.html |archivedate = June 29, 2011 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally, the frequency of tornadoes in the United States is closely tied with the progression of the warm season when warm and cold air masses often clash.&lt;ref name=ncdc /&gt;

Another criterion for the location of Tornado Alley (or Tornado Alleys) can be where the strongest tornadoes occur more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Taking Shelter from the Storm: Building a Safe Room for Your Home or Small Business |number=P-320 |institution=FEMA |date=December 2014 |url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1418837471752-920f09bb8187ee15436712a3e82ce709/FEMA_P-320_2014_508.pdf |access-date=July 18, 2015 |format=pdf |edition=4th |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721201637/http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1418837471752-920f09bb8187ee15436712a3e82ce709/FEMA_P-320_2014_508.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornado Alley can also be defined as an area reaching from central Texas to the Canadian prairies and from eastern Colorado to western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="si" /&gt;

It has also been asserted that there are numerous Tornado Alleys.&lt;ref name="si" /&gt; In addition to the Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas core, such areas include the Upper Midwest, the lower Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the lower Mississippi valley.&lt;ref name="si" /&gt; Some studies suggest that there are also smaller tornado alleys located across the United States.&lt;ref name="smaller alleys"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Chris |last=Broyles |author2=C.

The tornado alleys in the southeastern U.S., notably the lower [[Mississippi Valley]] and the upper [[Tennessee Valley]], are sometimes called by the nickname "[[Dixie Alley]]", coined in 1971 by [[Allen Pearson]], former director of the National Severe Storms Forecasting Center (NSSFC).&lt;ref&gt;Gagan et al. (2010), page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tornado Alley, warm, humid air from the equator meets cool, dry air from Canada and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. This creates an ideal environment for tornadoes to form within developed thunderstorms and [[Supercell|super cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-tornado-alley-where-are-tornadoes-most-likely-to-occur-where-is-the-tornado-belt.html|title=Tornado Alley: The Most Tornado Prone Region In The World|last=|first=|date=September 16, 2016|website=www.worldatlas.com|publisher=|access-date=October 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025153639/http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-tornado-alley-where-are-tornadoes-most-likely-to-occur-where-is-the-tornado-belt.html|archivedate=October 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
The term "tornado alley" was first used in 1952 by U.S. Air Force meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush (1915–1982) and Captain [[Robert C. Miller]] (1920–1998) as the title of a research project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essay Tornado|url=http://essaytornado.com|work=Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C.

== Impact ==
Despite the elevated frequency of destructive tornadoes, [[building code]]s, such as requiring strengthened roofs and more secure connections between the building and its [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]], are not necessarily stricter compared to other areas of the United States and are markedly weaker than some hurricane prone areas such as south Florida. One particular tornado-afflicted town, [[Moore, Oklahoma]], managed to increase its building requirements in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Simmons |first = Kevin M. |title = An Oklahoma Suburb, Tornado-Ready |newspaper = The New York Times |pages =  |date = May 14, 2015 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/opinion/an-oklahoma-suburb-tornado-ready.html |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161124101451/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/opinion/an-oklahoma-suburb-tornado-ready.html |archivedate = November 24, 2016 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common precautionary measures include the construction of [[storm cellar]]s, and the installation of [[Civil defense siren|tornado sirens]]. Tornado awareness, [[Tornado preparedness|preparedness]], and [[Mass media|media]] weather coverage are also high.

The southeastern United States is particularly prone to violent, long track tornadoes. Much of the housing in this region is less robust compared to other areas in the United States, and many people live in mobile homes. As a result, tornado-related casualties in the [[southern United States]] are particularly higher. Significant tornadoes occur less frequently than in the traditionally recognized tornado alley, however, very severe and expansive [[Tornado outbreak|outbreaks]] occur every few years.

== Frequency of tornadoes ==
The average tornado usually only stays on ground for 5 minutes but but these figures, reported by the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period between 1991 and 2010, show the seventeen U.S. states with the highest average number of tornadoes per {{convert|10000|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|1}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Average Annual Number of EF0-EF5 Tornadoes per 10,000 square miles during 1991 - 2010|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/images/tornado/clim/avg-ef0-ef5-torn1991-2010.gif|work=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=NOAA.gov|accessdate=October 26, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191409/http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/images/tornado/clim/avg-ef0-ef5-torn1991-2010.gif|archivedate=October 29, 2013|location=U.S. Tornado Climatology|format=gif|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian tornadoes==
{{main|Canada Tornado Alley}}

After the U.S., Canada gets the most tornadoes in the world. The average number of tornadoes per {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi|abbr=out|disp=or|order=flip}} is highest in the southern parts of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]], as well as [[Southern Ontario]]. [[Northern Ontario]] between the Manitoba border and the [[Lake Superior]] lakehead is also prone to severe tornadoes, but tornadoes in this area are believed to be underestimated due to the extremely low population in this region.&lt;ref name="yorku.ca" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/anderson/when-is-peak-tornado-season-in-canada/31509 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118051928/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/anderson/when-is-peak-tornado-season-in-canada/31509 |archivedate=2014-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly half of all Canadian tornadoes strike the [[Canadian prairies]] and Northern Ontario as far east as Lake Superior. Together, these regions make up the northernmost border of the U.S. Tornado Alley. Tornadoes up to EF5 in strength have been documented in this region.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=6C5D4990-1#tornadoes {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802230612/http://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=6C5D4990-1 |date=2016-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another third of Canadian tornadoes strike [[Southern Ontario]], especially in the region halfway between the Great Lakes from [[Lake St. Clair]] to [[Ottawa]]. This happens because tornadoes in this region are triggered or augmented by lake breeze fronts from [[Lake Huron]], [[Lake Erie]], [[Lake Ontario]], and [[Georgian Bay]]. Tornadoes do not often hit lake shadow regions,&lt;ref name="yorku.ca"/&gt; although they are not unknown, and some, such as the [[2011 Goderich, Ontario tornado]], have been violent. However, most Ontario tornadoes are concentrated in a narrow corridor from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]] through [[London, Ontario|London]], and then northeast to [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]] and Ottawa.&lt;ref name="yorku.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorku.ca/pat/research/dsills/papers/GLOMW2012/Sills_GLOMW2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118175543/http://www.yorku.ca/pat/research/dsills/papers/GLOMW2012/Sills_GLOMW2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mobile.theweathernetwork.com"&gt;http://mobile.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&amp;stormfile=Should__Tornado_Alley__be_expanded__11_04_2012?ref=ccbox_news_topstories {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121025510/http://mobile.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3%26stormfile%3DShould__Tornado_Alley__be_expanded__11_04_2012?ref=ccbox_news_topstories |date=2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes up to EF4 in strength have been documented in this region.

[[Southwestern Ontario]] weather is strongly influenced by its peninsular position between the [[Great Lakes]]. As a result, increases in temperature in this region are likely to increase the amount of precipitation in storms due to lake evaporation. Increased temperature contrasts may also increase the violence and possibly the number of tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/weather-predictions-made-by-the-global-warming-model-3254/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201185344/http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/weather-predictions-made-by-the-global-warming-model-3254/ |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8520">'''Traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands''' are the
native [[natural dye|vegetable dye]]s used in [[Gàidhealteachd|Scottish Gaeldom]].

The following are the principal dyestuffs with the colours they produce. Several of the tints are very bright, but have now been superseded for convenience of usage by various mineral dyes. The Latin names are given where known and also the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] names for various ingredients. Amateurs may wish to experiment with some of the suggestions, as [[urine]] (human or animal) is used in many recipes as a [[mordant]]. A number of the recipes used are for more than one colour, and that this chart is only a guide, and also that Scottish Gaelic spelling is subject to variations. Many of the dyes are made from lichens, the useful ones for this purpose being known as [[crottle]].

The process employed is to wash the thread thoroughly in urine long kept ("fual"), rinse and wash in pure water, then put into the boiling pot of dye which is kept boiling hot on the fire. The thread is lifted now and again on the end of a stick, and again plunged in until it is all thoroughly dyed. If blue, the thread is then washed in [[brine|salt water]] but any other colour uses fresh water.

'''Uranyl acetate''' (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is the [[acetate]] salt of [[uranyl]] and is a yellow-green [[crystalline]] solid made up of yellow-green rhombic [[crystal]]s and has a slight acetic odor. This compound is a [[nuclear fuel]] derivative, and its use and possession are sanctioned by international law.

==Production==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
Commercial preparations of uranyl acetate are usually made from [[depleted uranium]] and are prepared by reacting metallic uranium with [[acetic acid]].

Uranyl acetate is extensively used as a negative stain in [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name="NEGSTAIN"&gt;[http://web.path.ox.ac.uk/~bioimaging/bitm/instructions_and_information/EM/neg_stain.pdf "Negative Staining"] University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Most procedures in electron microscopy for biology require the use of uranyl acetate. Negative staining protocols typically treat the sample with 1% to 5% aqueous solution. Uranyl acetate staining is simple and quick to perform and one can examine the sample within a few minutes after staining. Some biological samples are not amenable to uranyl acetate staining and, in these cases, alternative staining techniques and or [[low-voltage electron microscopy]] technique may be more suitable.

1% and 2% uranyl acetate solutions are used as an [[chemical indicator|indicator]], and a [[titrant]] in stronger concentrations in [[analytical chemistry]], as it forms an insoluble salt with [[sodium]] (the vast majority of sodium salts are water-soluble). Uranyl acetate solutions show evidence of being sensitive to light, especially UV, and will precipitate if exposed.

Uranyl acetate is also used in a standard test—American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Designation T 299—for [[Alkali Silica Reaction|alkali-silica reactivity]] in aggregates (crushed stone or gravel) being considered for use in cement concrete. 

Uranyl acetate dihydrate has been used as a starting reagent in experimental inorganic chemistry, for example, [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (THF = [[tetrahydrofuran]]).&lt;ref&gt;Uranyl polyhalides. Molecular structure of [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAsPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;](Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]

and [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;](I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], Polyhedron, 2002, 21, 2755
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Uranyl acetate is both radioactive and toxic. Normal commercial stocks prepared from depleted uranium have a typical [[specific activity]] of {{convert|0.37|-|0.51|µCi|kBq}} per gram. This is a very mild level of radioactivity and is not sufficient to be harmful while the material remains external to the body.

Uranyl acetate is very toxic if ingested, inhaled as dust or by skin contact if skin is cut or abraded. The toxicity is due to the combined effect of chemical toxicity and mild radioactivity and there is a danger of cumulative effects from long term exposure.

[[Image:Water dimer.jpg|right|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of the linear water dimer]]
The '''water dimer''' consists of two [[water (molecule)|water]] molecules loosely bound by a [[hydrogen bond]]. It is the smallest [[water cluster]]. Because it is the simplest model system for studying hydrogen bonding in water, it has been the target of many theoretical &lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, A. D. The hydrogen bond, and the structure and properties of water and the water dimer. ''Journal of Molecular Structure'' '''1991''',  ''250'',  111-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., Leforestier, C., and Saykally, R. J., Water Dimers in the Atmosphere II: Results from the VRT(ASP-W)III Potential Surface, ''Journal of Physical Chemistry A'', '''2004''', ''108'', p.&amp;nbsp;787-794.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, M.; Brdarski, S.; Widmark, P.-O.; Lindh, R.; Karlström, G.  The water dimer interaction energy: Convergence to the basis set limit at the correlated level, Journal Chemical Physics, '''1997''', ''107'', 4597-4605.&lt;/ref&gt; (and later experimental) studies that it has been called a "theoretical Guinea pig".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, G. A.; ''An Introduction to Hydrogen Bonding (Topics in Physical Chemistry)''. Oxford University Press, USA (March 13, 1997). {{ISBN|0-19-509549-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and properties==
The [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] binding energy between the two water molecules is estimated to be 5-6 kcal/mol, although values between 3 and 8 have been obtained depending on the method. The experimentally measured dissociation energy (including nuclear quantum effects) of (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are 3.16 ± 0.03 kcal/mol (13.22 ± 0.12 kJ/mol)&lt;ref&gt;Rocher-Casterline, B. E.; Ch'ng, L. C.; Mollner, A. K.; Reisler, H. ''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''2011''', ''115'', 6903-6909 [[doi:10.1063/1.3598339]]&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.56 ± 0.03 kcal/mol (14.88 ± 0.12 kJ/mol),&lt;ref&gt;Ch'ng, L. C.; Samanta, A. K.; Czakó, G.; Bowman, J. M.; Reisler, H. ''Journal of American Chemical Society'' '''2012''', ''134'', 15430 [[doi:10.1021/ja305500x]]&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. The values are in excellent agreement with calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, A.; Wang, Y.; Kaledin, A.; Braams, B. J.; Bowman. J. M. ''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''2009''', ''130'', 144314 [[doi:10.1063/1.3112403]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leforestier, C.; Szalewicz, K.; [[Ad van der Avoird|van der Avoird, A.]] ''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''2012''', ''137'', 014305 [[doi:10.1063/1.4722338]]&lt;/ref&gt; The O-O distance of the vibrational ground-state is experimentally measured at ca. 2.98 Å;&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, S. Ab initio studies of hydrogen bonds: the water dimer paradigm. ''Annual Review of Physical Chemistry'' '''1994''', ''45'', 23-56.&lt;/ref&gt; the hydrogen bond is almost linear, but the angle with the plane of the acceptor molecule is about 57°. The vibrational ground-state is known as the linear water dimer (shown in the figure to the right), which is a near prolate top (viz., in terms of rotational constants{{what|date=January 2015}}, A &gt; B ≈ C).  Other configurations of interest include the cyclic dimer and the bifurcated dimer.

==History and relevance==
The first theoretical study of the water dimer was an [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] calculation published in 1968 by Morokuma and Pedersen.&lt;ref&gt;Morokuma, K.; Pedersen, L.  Molecular-orbital studies of hydrogen bonds. An ab initio calculation for dimeric water. ''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''1968''',  ''48'',  3275-3282.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the water dimer has been the focus of sustained interest by theoretical chemists concerned with hydrogen bonding—a search of the [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] database up to 2006 returns over 1100 related references (73 of them in 2005).  The water dimer is a hotly studied topic in Physical Chemistry for several reasons.  (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is thought to play a significant role in many atmospheric processes, including acid rain formation, absorption of excess solar radiation, condensation of water droplets, and chemical reactions. In addition, a complete understanding of the water dimer is thought to play a key role in a more thorough understanding of hydrogen bonding in liquid and solid forms of water.
