The '''1915 British football betting scandal''' occurred when a [[Football League First Division]] match between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Old Trafford]] on 2 April ([[Good Friday]]) 1915 was [[match-fixing|fixed]] in United's favour, with players from both sides benefiting from bets placed upon the result. In all, seven players were found to have participated in the scandal and all were subsequently banned for life, although most later had their bans overturned.

==The match==
At the time of the match, Manchester United were struggling to avoid [[relegation]], while Liverpool were in mid-table and neither challenging for honours nor facing the threat of relegation themselves. The effects of the [[First World War]] provided further motivation to perpetrate a fix - by the end of March it was almost certain that the league would suspend operations after the 1914–15 season was finished, interrupting and possibly ending the footballing careers of everyone then playing in the league. Also, the players perhaps thought that the diversion of the conflict would lessen the attention that would normally be paid to a dubious match result.

The match ended in a 2–0 win to United, with [[George Anderson (footballer born 1893)|George Anderson]] scoring both goals. However, the match referee and some observers noted Liverpool's lack of commitment during the game – they had missed a penalty that had been awarded to them, and when [[Fred Pagnam]] hit the Manchester United crossbar late in the match, his teammates publicly remonstrated with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillips, Oliver|title=The Golden Boys: A study of Watford's Cult Heroes|publisher=Alpine Press|page=49|year=2001|isbn=0-9528631-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and punishments==
After the match, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] started to appear, alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2–0 win to United.&lt;ref name="Sharpe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharpe|first=Graham|title=Gambling's Strangest Moments: Extraordinary But True Stories from Over 200 Years of Gambling's History|year=2005|publisher=Robson|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1-86105-864-0|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Football Association]] launched an investigation and found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match: [[Sandy Turnbull]], [[Arthur Whalley]] and [[Enoch West]] of United, and [[Jackie Sheldon]], [[Tom Miller (footballer)|Tom Miller]], [[Bob Pursell (footballer born 1889)|Bob Pursell]] and [[Thomas Fairfoul]] of Liverpool; Sheldon was a former United player himself and was found to be the plot's ringleader. Some players, such as Pagnam and United's George Anderson, had refused to take part. Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result, hence his late shot against the crossbar; he later testified against his team-mates at the FA hearing. At the same hearing, United player [[Billy Meredith]] denied any knowledge of the match-fixing, but stated that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tibballs|first=Geoff|title=Great Sporting Scandals: Fromm Over 200 Years of Sporting Endeavours|year=2003|publisher=Robson Publishing|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1-86105-686-9|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All seven players were banned from playing for life in a decision handed down on 27 December 1915. The FA concluded that it had been a conspiracy by the players alone – no official from either club was found guilty of wrongdoing, and neither club was fined or had points deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Peter|title=Swifter Than the Arrow: Wilfred Bartrop, Football and War|year=2008|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84876-068-4|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; West vociferously protested his innocence, even going so far as suing the FA for [[defamation|libel]]. However, he lost the case and the ban stood. In itself, the ban had no immediate effect on the players' footballing careers, as by that point the Football League had suspended operations for the duration of the [[First World War]]. The ban did not apply in [[Scotland]] (four of the suspended players were Scottish), however the [[Scottish Football League]] had also suspended operations and the [[Scottish Football Association]] was never called upon to issue any sort of ruling on the players' eligibility there.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Sandy Turnbull was killed while serving in the war, but all the other players, except West, had their bans lifted by the FA in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country; Turnbull received a posthumous reinstatement. The intervention of the First World War meant that the Football League did not resume until [[The Football League 1919–20|1919–20]]. This meant that West was the only player involved who was actually unable to play League football due to suspension. Fairfoul also did not return to football although he was re-instated, however the other four players resumed their careers after the war. West had to wait until 1945 for his ban to be lifted, by which time he was 59.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Consequences==
Although the players' main motives for the match-fixing appear to be financial, and not to save United from relegation{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}, the two points United won from that game were enough to earn them [[The Football League 1914–15|18th place]] and safety, one point ahead of 19th-placed [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], who were nominally relegated. Before the [[The Football League 1919–20|1919–20 season]] started, the League decided to expand the First Division by two teams; Chelsea (along with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]) were elected back into the First Division and thus spared the drop.

In [[association football]], an '''assist''' is a contribution by a player which helps to score a [[goal (sport)|goal]]. Statistics for assists made by players may be kept officially by the organisers of a competition, or unofficially by, for example, journalists or organisers of [[Fantasy football (Association)|fantasy football]] competitions. Recording assists is not part of the official [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] and the criteria for an assist to be awarded may vary. Record of assists was virtually not kept at all until the end of the 20th century, although reports of matches commonly described a player as having "made" one or more goals. Since the 1990s, some leagues have kept official record of assists and based awards on them.

==Criteria==
Most commonly, an assist is credited to a player for [[passing (association football)|passing]] or [[cross (football)|crossing]] the ball to the scorer.  It may also be awarded to a player whose shot rebounds (off a defender, [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] or goalpost) to a teammate who scores. Some systems may credit an assist to a player who wins a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] or a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] for another player to convert,&lt;ref name="tsg86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsg90"/&gt; or to an attacking player for contributing to an [[own goal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/athletics/soccerm/07Stats/070918hm.htm |title=Haverford College vs Alvernia College |date=18 September 2007 |publisher=[[Haverford College]] |accessdate=21 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713150309/http://www.haverford.edu/athletics/soccerm/07Stats/070918hm.htm |archivedate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goal may be unassisted, or have one assist; some systems allow for two assists.&lt;ref name="tsg86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncaas5a1p1"/&gt;

==FIFA==
FIFA's Technical Study Group is responsible for awarding assist points at the [[FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_03a_fwc-awards_new_2466.pdf |title=adidas Golden Shoe Award |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=29 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175841/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_03a_fwc-awards_new_2466.pdf |archivedate=26 June 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Technical Study Group's report on the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], the authors calculated for the first time unofficial statistics for assists, developing the following criteria:&lt;ref name="tsg86"&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/techdevp/fwc%5fmexico%5f1986%5fen%5fpart4%5f279.pdf |title=1986 World Cup Technical Report, part 4 |author=FIFA Technical Study Group |year=1986 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |page=The Table of Goalscorers: Goals and Assists, page 198 |nopp=y |accessdate=29 July 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
# An assist was awarded to the player who had given the last pass to the goalscorer.
# In addition, also the last but two holder of the ball could get an assist provided that his action had decisive importance for the goal.
# After goals from rebounds those players were awarded an assist who had shot on target.
# After goals scored on penalty or by a [[direct free kick|directly converted free-kick]] the fouled player received a point.
# In case that the goalscorer had laid on the goal for himself ([[dribbling|dribble]], solo run), no assists were awarded.
# No assists were awarded, either, if the goalscorer took advantage of a missed pass by an opponent.

The [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] technical report adopted similar criteria, but changed the free-kick/penalty criterion:&lt;ref name="tsg90"&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/techdevp/fwc%5fitaly%5f1990%5fa%5fpart6%5f273.pdf |title=1990 World Cup Technical Report, part 6 |author=FIFA Technical Study Group |year=1990 |publisher=FIFA|page=281 |accessdate=29 July 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where goals resulting from penalties are concerned, the player who is fouled in the area receives an assist point (unless, that is, the player who is fouled subsequently executes the penalty himself).

''Planet World Cup'' has calculated some retrospective data on assists back to the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1966/wc66statistics.html |title=World Cup 1966 statistics |publisher=Planet World Cup |accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the 1986 data differs from that of FIFA.&lt;ref name="tsg86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1986/wc86statistics.html |title=World Cup 1986 statistics |publisher=Planet World Cup |accessdate=29 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720164229/http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1986/wc86statistics.html| archivedate= 20 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA started officially keeping track of assists in [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup tournaments]] at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 edition]].&lt;ref name="afp1994"&gt;
{{cite news|publisher=[[Agence France Presse]]|date=11 July 1994 |title=Football by the numbers |first=Rebecca |last=Bryan |location=Los Angeles |quote=the assist has gained enough ground to earn a place in the calculations for the Golden Boot award, which in every previous World Cup has been awarded solely on the basis of goals scored. Under the formula, players get three points for a goal, and one point for an assist. "We made a two-point difference because we do not want someone who did not score winning the award," a FIFA official said.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This was popularly ascribed to the popularity of detailed [[:Category:Sports records and statistics|sports statistics]] among American fans.&lt;ref name="afp1994"/&gt; 1994 was also the first World Cup in which assists were used as a tie-breaker in determining the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Golden Shoe]] award for top scorer.&lt;ref name="afp1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="busw1994"&gt;
{{Cite news|title=Romario is voted the top player of World Cup '94 and winner of the FIFA/adidas Golden Ball award; Salenko and Stoichkov tie as leading scorers for World Cup USA '94 |date=17 July 1994 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |quote=[FIFA] has announced Oleg Salenko (Russia) and Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgaria) as [...] winners of the prestigious adidas Golden Shoe award [...] who made six goals and one assist each. Kennet Andersson (Sweden) with 5 goals and 3 assists, will receive a Bronze replica of the Predator [...] Throughout World Cup '94, three points were awarded for each goal scored and one point for each assist leading to a goal, with a maximum of two assists per goal. Assists are only taken into account if two or more players scored the same number of goals.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, both [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and [[Oleg Salenko]] tied with 19 points, from 6 goals and 1 assist.&lt;ref name="busw1994"/&gt;

==United States==
The original [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] kept assist statistics from its foundation in 1968, as its forebears the [[United Soccer Association]] and [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] had done the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midfielddynamo.com/players/awards/usa_nasl_ts.htm|title=NASL Top Scorer Award |publisher=midfielddynamo|accessdate=29 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724222222/http://www.midfielddynamo.com/players/awards/usa_nasl_ts.htm| archivedate= 24 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous statistics were already being kept [[Assist (basketball)|in basketball]] and [[Assist (ice hockey)|in ice hockey]], both established North American sports.

[[Major League Soccer]] formerly awarded the [[MLS Golden Boot]] based on 2 points per goal scored and one per assist. The all-time leader in assists in Major League Soccer is [[midfielder]] [[Landon Donovan]], with 136 assists as of October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/stats/alltime?group=ASSISTS&amp;op=Search&amp;form_build_id=form-14a1cde9fa22f6d2ec85a2a7409fbf00&amp;form_id=mls_stats_alltime_form|title=Statistics|work=mlssoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] makes regulations for statistics, including assists, in [[college soccer]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name="ncaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/Stats_Manuals/Soccer/2009ez.pdf#page=2|title=Section 5: Assists|year=2009|work=Official Soccer Statistics Rules; Approved Rulings and Interpretations|publisher=NCAA|page=2|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two players may be credited with assists if the second did not have to beat a defender before passing to the scorer.&lt;ref name="ncaas5a1p1"&gt;NCAA Official Soccer Statistics Rules, §5.Art 1.(1)&lt;/ref&gt; No assist is awarded for winning a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;NCAA Official Soccer Statistics Rules, §5.Art 1.(3)&lt;/ref&gt; If a goal is scored after a save, block, or rebound from the goal frame, the first shooter gets an assist.&lt;ref&gt;NCAA Official Soccer Statistics Rules, §5.Art 1.(8),(9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
In Britain, official game statistics, including assists, for the [[Premier League]], the [[Scottish Premier League]] and [[the Football League]] are provided by PA Sport under the Actim brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pa-sport.com/en/actim/actim-stats-faqs.html|title=Actim Stats Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=PA Sport|accessdate=29 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802142401/http://www.pa-sport.com/en/actim/actim-stats-faqs.html|archivedate=2 August 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[FA Premier League 2006–07|2006–07 season]], assists have been factored into the [[Actim Index]] of Premier League player performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pa-sport.com/en/actim/actim-index-explained.html|title=Actim Index Explained|publisher=PA Sport|accessdate=29 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802143312/http://www.pa-sport.com/en/actim/actim-index-explained.html|archivedate=2 August 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assist statistics provided by fantasy football competitions may differ from the Actim data; some uniformly credit an assist to whichever teammate last touched the ball before the scorer, regardless of other circumstances of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2013/09/22/mesut-ozil-when-is-an-assist-not-an-assist/|title=Mesut Ozil...

'''Botanical Gardens Cricket Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Old Trafford (district)|Old Trafford]], [[Stretford]], [[Lancashire]]. The ground was located adjacent to [[White City, Greater Manchester|Manchester Botanical Garden]]. The ground was on land owned by [[Humphrey de Trafford|Sir Humphrey de Trafford]], who allowed [[Manchester Cricket Club]] to lease the ground.

The first recorded match that is now considered to have been [[first-class cricket|first-class]] on the ground was in 1848, when Manchester Cricket Club played [[Sheffield Cricket Club]]. The following season [[Lancashire county cricket teams|a Lancashire team]] played [[Yorkshire county cricket teams|a team from Yorkshire]]. In 1851, a Lancashire side played their second and final first-class match at the ground in a repeat of the previous first-class fixture there involving. Manchester Cricket Club played two further first-class matches at the ground in 1852 and then 1854, both coming against Sheffield Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/616_f.html First-Class Matches played on Botanical Gardens Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match held on the ground came in 1856 when Manchester Cricket Club played rugby.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/616_misc.html Other matches played on Botanical Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the ground was developed for the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|1857 Art Treasures Exhibition]]. Later, the location of the ground became a [[motorcycle speedway]] venue before closing in 1982. Today the location of the ground is covered by the White City Retail Centre.

'''''Eat This Book''''' is a book by [[Ryan Nerz]] which explores the world of [[competitive eating]]. Published by [[St. Martin's Press]] in 2006, ''Eat This Book'' provides a firsthand look into this sometimes controversial sport. Nerz, who spent a year as an [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] for the [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]], has firsthand insight into the competitive eating phenomenon.

==Reviews==
Because Nerz's book was released in the same month as [[Jason Fagone]]'s ''[[Horsemen of the Esophagus]]'', and since both books cover the sport of competitive eating, a number of published reviews covered both books together and drew comparisons between them.

The strongest criticism levelled at ''Eat This Book'' in reviews is that Nerz uses prose that is more sensational than objective. Jay Jennings describes Nerz as "more mythifier than journalist",&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite news| author= Jay Jennings | date=2006-05-28 | title=Gluttons for Reward | work=The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/28/books/review/28jennings.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Booklist]]'' critiqued his book as "basically a book-length [[infomercial]] for the organization and its most famous athletes."&lt;ref name="Liz"/&gt;

Despite this negative criticism, other reviewers found the direct involvement by Nerz, and first-hand account of his own personal quest to become a competitive participant both absorbing and entertaining.&lt;ref name="Goodreads"&gt;{{cite web | date=February 20, 2007 | title= goodreads | url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131245.Eat_This_Book_A_Year_of_Gorging_and_Glory_on_the_Competitive_Eating_Circuit | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennings commends Nerz for presenting a broader cast of characters who participate in the sport, even though Nerz's book covers a narrower view of the sport than Fagone's ''Horsemen of the Esophagus''.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt; Nerz was able to provide increased coverage of the competitors as a result of emceeing many contests, and therefore obtaining direct access to many competitors that Fagone did not have.  The book's breadth of coverage, both in terms of contests arranged neatly by chapter and in terms of the number of competitors, was also noted positively in other reviews.&lt;ref name="Liz"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 4, 2006 |title=Eat This Book (Review) |work=Liz is working |url=http://www.urbanhonking.com/liz/2006/04/eat-this-book.html |accessdate=2008-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516042714/http://www.urbanhonking.com/liz/2006/04/eat-this-book.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Publishers Weekly review of the book said that “Nerz chronicles his amusing adventures in the perverse, repellent, strangely heroic world of competitive eating…with glee and good humor.” The New York Times Book Review compared the author’s style to that of Grantland Rice, an early 20th-century American sportswriter known for his elegant prose. Calling the author “more mythifier than journalist,” the Times Book Review added that the competitive eaters he profiled “are indeed a colorful, varied bunch, even without the pro-wrestling-style personalities the IFOCE encourages.”

Nerz appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on April 18, 2006, to discuss the book.

'''Eilat Tze'elim Sports Centre''' is located in the Tze'elim neighbourhood north-west of [[Eilat]], Israel. The building offers approximately 2,000 square meters on two levels. The entry level includes the main basketball court, a stage for performances and seating. The lower level features a gym, changing rooms, showers, toilets, and machine rooms. Funding for the building, which cost approximately 12 million [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] (about $3.1 million [[USD]]), came from the National Lottery and Eilat municipality.

'''Frisian handball''' ({{lang-fry|keatsen}}; {{lang-nl|kaatsen}}) is a traditional [[Friesland|Frisian]] sport, related to [[American handball]] and [[fives]], that is most commonly practiced by people from the northern [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Friesland]] (''Fryslân''). It is believed to be one of the oldest ballgames and was an unofficial [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]. The score is similar to tennis. The first team scoring six games wins the match.

==Rules==
The major Frisian handball tournament, called the P.C. (short for Permanent Committee), has been held in the city of [[Franeker]] since 1854 and is considered the oldest regular sports tournament in the world.

Frisian handball is played on a rectangular lawn of 61 meters by 32 meters, by two teams composed of 3 players. In the center of one short side of the field is a receiving zone of 5 meters by 19 meters defended by 2 players, the other team member remaining field player. One of the opponents serves the hard leather ball with his bare hand from a serving box at about 30 meters from the receiving zone. If he does not succeed in reaching the receiving zone, the receiving team gets a direct score. When the receiving team, of which the players are allowed to wear a single hardened [[leather glove]], returns the ball over the short line behind the serving box (called the upper line, in West Frisian ''boppe'') they also get a direct score. Of course, the serving team is allowed to prevent this happening by hitting or holding the ball before the upper line. The place where the ball remains after such a rally is marked with a small woodblock called a ''kaats'', which is best defined as an undecided score. When two such undecided points occur (or one, if one of the teams is on game point) the teams change places.
In the next rally, the team that then has the receiving position, tries to hit the ball past the first ''kaats'' and, if any, in the next rally past the second ''kaats'', so deciding the undecided points. Then they start all over again.

In parts of [[Belgium]], the similar game of [[jeu de balle-pelote]] is played. This game is played by teams of 5 players on a trapezium shaped field, mostly located on marketplaces.

'''Wessel Johannes "Hansie" Cronje''' (25 September 1969 – 1 June 2002) was a [[South Africa]]n [[cricket]]er and captain of the South African national cricket team in the 1990s. He was voted the [[SABC3's Great South Africans|11th greatest South African]] in 2004 despite having been banned from cricket for life due to his role in a match-fixing scandal. He died in a plane crash in 2002.

==Early life==
Cronje was born in [[Bloemfontein]], South Africa to Ewie Cronje and San-Marie Cronje on 25 September 1969. He graduated in 1987 from Grey College in Bloemfontein, where he was the head boy. An excellent all round sportsman, he represented the then [[Orange Free State Province]] in [[cricket]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] at schools level. He was the [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his school's cricket and rugby teams. Cronje earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the [[University of the Free State]]. He had an older brother, Frans Cronje, and a younger sister, Hester Parsons.

His father Ewie had played for [[Orange Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] in the 1960s, and Frans had also played [[first-class cricket]].

==First-class career==

Cronje made his first-class debut for Orange Free State against [[Transvaal cricket team|Transvaal]] at [[Johannesburg]] in January 1988 at the age of 18. In the following season, he was a regular, appearing in all eight [[SuperSport Series|Currie Cup]] matches plus being part of the Benson and Hedges Series winning team, scoring 73 as an opener in the final. In 1989–90, despite playing all the Currie Cup matches, he failed to make a century, and averaged only 19.76; however, in one-day games he averaged 60.12. During that season he scored his maiden century for [[South African Universities cricket team|South African Universities]] against [[Mike Gatting]]'s [[South African rebel tours#England Rebel Tour 1990|rebel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African Universities v England XI, England XI in South Africa 1989/90|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/52/52369.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having just turned 21, Cronje was made captain of Orange Free State for the 1990–91 season. He scored his maiden century for them against [[Natal cricket team|Natal]] in December 1990, and finished the season with another century and a total of 715 runs at 39.72. That season he also scored 159* in a 40-over match against [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]].

In 1992–93, he captained Orange Free State to the Castle Cup/Total Power Series double.

In 1995, Cronje appeared for [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] where he scored 1301 runs at 52.04 finishing the season as the county's leading scorer.

In 1995–96, he finished the season top of the batting averages in the Currie Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batting and Fielding in Castle Cup 1995/96 (Ordered by Average)|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/RSA/Castle_Cup_1995-96/Batting_by_Average.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; his top score of 158 helped Free State chase down 389 to beat Northern Transvaal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State v Northern Transvaal, Castle Cup 1995/96|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/61/61280.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Cronje played for [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] as an overseas player in the [[Benson and Hedges Cup]] and helped them to a 46-run win over [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] by scoring 94 not out and taking three wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ireland v Middlesex, Benson and Hedges Cup 1997 (Group D)|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/61/61280.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Ireland's first ever win against English county opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Daniel|title=Irish 'weekend amateurs' enjoy historic success|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997/ENG_LOCAL/B+H/R01/IRELAND_MIDDX_B+H_28-29APR1997_MR|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=30 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same competition, he scored 85 and took one wicket against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glamorgan v Ireland, Benson and Hedges Cup 1997 (Group D)|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/63/63891.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

===Debuts===
Cronje's form in 1991/92 was impressive especially in the one-day format where he averaged 61.40. He earned an international call up for the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], making his [[One Day International]] debut against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[Sydney]]. During the tournament he played in eight of the team's nine games, averaging 34.00 with the bat, while his medium pace was used in bowling 20 overs.

After the World Cup Cronje was part of the tour to the West Indies; he featured in the three ODI's, and in the Test match at [[Bridgetown]] that followed, he made his [[Test cricket|Test]] debut. This was South Africa's first Test since readmission and they came close to beating a strong [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indian]] side, going into the final day at 122/2 chasing 200 they collapsed to 148.

[[India national cricket team|India]] toured South Africa in 1992/93. In the first one-day international, he hit the famous six when his team needed 6 runs off only 4 balls, and was awarded Man of the match for his bowling. In the one-day series, Cronje managed just one fifty but with the ball he was economical and took his career best figures of 5/32, becoming the second South African to take five wickets in an ODI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosendorff|first=Peter|title=South Africa vs India 1st ODI Match Report|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1992-93/IND_IN_RSA/IND_RSA_ODI1_07DEC1992_MR|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=3 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Test series that followed he scored his maiden test century, 135 off 411 balls, after coming in at 0–1 in the second over he was last man out, after eight and three-quarter hours, in a total of 275. This contributed to South Africa's first Test win since readmission. At the end of the season in a triangular tournament with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and West Indies he scored 81 off 70 balls against Pakistan.

In South Africa's next Test series against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], Cronje scored his second Test century, 122 in the second Test in [[Colombo]]; the victory margin of an innings and 208 runs is a South African record. He finished the series with 237 runs at 59.25 after scoring 73* in the drawn third Test.

===Stand-in captain===

In 1993–94, there was another Castle Cup/Total Power Series double for Orange Free State. In international cricket, he was named as vice-captain for the tour of Australia despite being the youngest member of the squad. In the first ODI of the triangular tournament with [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], he guided South Africa to victory against Australia at the MCG with 91*, which won him the man of the match award. He scored 71 in a rain-affected first test at [[Melbourne]] before a tense second test that South Africa won by 5 runs. An injury to captain [[Kepler Wessels]] meant Cronje was captain for the final day of the match. Between the second and third tests, the one-day tournament continued, now with Cronje as captain, South Africa made the final series but lost it 2–1 to Australia. He became South Africa's second youngest Test captain, after [[Murray Bisset]] in 1898–99, when he led the team for the third test at [[Adelaide]] but it was an unsuccessful start to his captaincy career as the series was squared.

In February 1994, there was the return series as Australia toured South Africa. Cronje started the ODI series with scores of 112, 97, 45 and 50* and when Australia played Orange Free State in their final match before the first Test, Cronje hit 251 off 306 balls, 200 of these came on the final day in which 294 runs were added. Despite this, Orange Free State lost the match. In the first test at Johannesburg, he added another century as South Africa won by 197 runs. This innings was the end of a 14-day period in which he'd scored 721 runs against the Aussies. However, he failed to reach fifty in the next two tests and four ODIs as both series were drawn.

There was another drawn series when South Africa toured England in 1994. Cronje scored only one century on the whole tour and scored only 90 runs in the three-test series. In October 1994, South Africa again came up against Australia in a triangular one day series also featuring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]]. Cronje scored 354 runs at an average of 88.50. Despite this, South Africa lost all their matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batting and Fielding for South Africa, Wills Triangular Series 1994/95|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/PAK/Wills_Triangular_Series_1994-95/South_Africa_Batting.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series was [[Bob Woolmer]]'s first as coach and Kepler Wessels' last as captain. Cronje, who'd previously been vice-captain, was named as captain for the test series with New Zealand in 1994–95.

===Permanent captain===

South Africa lost the first Test in Johannesburg but before the second test the two teams plus Pakistan and Sri Lanka competed for the [[Mandela Trophy]], New Zealand failed to gain a win in the six match round robin stage while South Africa beat Pakistan in the final. This changed the momentum as South Africa secured wins in [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]], where Cronje scored his fourth test century, he was the first captain since [[W. G. Grace]] to win a three-match rubber after being one down.

In early 1995, South Africa won one-off tests against both Pakistan and New Zealand, in [[Auckland]] Cronje scored the only century of the match before a final day declaration left his bowlers barely enough time to dismiss the Kiwis.

In October 1995, South Africa won a one-off Test with [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]]. Cronje scored a second innings 54* to guide them to a seven wicket win. In two one-dayers that followed, he took five wickets as South Africa comfortably won both. South Africa won the five Test series against England 1–0 despite Cronje struggling, scoring 113 runs at 18.83. However, he top scored in the one-day series that they won 6–1.

In the [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996 World Cup]], he scored 78 and 45* against New Zealand and Pakistan respectively as South Africa won their group but in the Quarter final with West Indies a [[Brian Lara]] century ended their ten-game winning streak.

The 1996–97 season featured back-to-back series with India. The first away was lost 2–1. The home series was won 2–0. In the six tests combined, Cronje managed one fifty. Cronje produced better form against Australia, averaging over 50 in both test and ODI series although both were lost.

Cronje started 1997–98 by leading South Africa to their first series victory in Pakistan, his batting continued to struggle with his biggest contribution being taking the wickets of [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and [[Moin Khan]] in the Third Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan v South Africa, 1997/98, Third Test, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63768.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Better form===
Cronje once again came up against Australia and once again ended on the losing side. In the triangular one day series they won the group with Australia just scraping through, they also won the first 'final' but South Africa lost the last two finals. During the group matches Cronje had threatened to lead his team off after [[Pat Symcox]] had missiles thrown at him, Symcox had the last laugh ending the match with 4/24. Before the Test series started he scored consecutive centuries against [[Tasmania cricket team|Tasmania]] and [[Australia A cricket team|Australia A]] these were his first in two years.

In the first Test, Cronje scored 70 as South Africa saved the match; in the second Test, he lasted 335 minutes for his 88. Despite this, they lost by an innings. In the third Test, they scored 517 and although [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]] carried his bat for 169, Australia needed to bat 109 overs to save the match. [[Mark Waugh]] batted 404 minutes, and, despite controversy when Waugh hit one of his bails off (under Law 35 he was adjudged to have finished his stroke and therefore given not out), South Africa fell three wickets short. Cronje put a stump through the umpires' dressing room door after the match and was lucky to avoid a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia v South Africa, Third Test Report|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153368.html|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack – online archive|publisher=John Wisden &amp; Co.|accessdate=20 October 2010|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronje missed the first Test of the series with Pakistan because of a knee injury. The second Test at Durban was lost, but he top scored at [[Port Elizabeth]] with 85, to help square the three Test series 1–1. There was still time in the season for a two-Test series with Sri Lanka. The first was won with Cronje scoring 49 and 74; in the second Test, he took 3/14, his best bowling in Tests, and smashed 82 off 63 balls, his fifty being brought up with three consecutive sixes off [[Muttiah Muralitharan]], and was reached off just 31 balls; at the time, it was the second fastest in Tests after [[Kapil Dev]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa v Sri Lanka, 1997/98, Second Test, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63800.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the triangular series, which South Africa won, he scored only one fifty at [[East London, South Africa|East London]] where he also took 2/17 off 10 overs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa v Pakistan, 1997/98, Fifth Match, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66083.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1998 Test series against England, Cronje scored five consecutive fifties, having failed to score one in the nine previous Tests against them. In his fiftieth Test, at [[Trent Bridge]] he scored 126, his sixth and last Test century and his first in 29 matches. During his second innings of 67, he passed 3,000 runs – only the second South African to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chevallier|first=Hugh|title=England v South Africa, Fourth Test Report|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153342.html|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack – online archive|publisher=John Wisden &amp; Co.|accessdate=20 October 2010|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, England won the Test, and the one at [[Headingley Carnegie Cricket Ground|Headingley]], to win the series 2–1, Cronje finished the series as South Africa's top scorer with 401 runs at 66.83.

===Whitewash, tie and forfeit===

In the West Indies series of 1998–99, Cronje captained South Africa to their only whitewash in a five Test series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Test matches – Team records – Winning every match in a series (whitewashes)|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283942.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best batting against West Indies came when playing for Free State; he scored 158* as they chased down 438 and made up a first innings deficit of 249.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State v West Indians, West Indies in South Africa 1998/99|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/66/66723.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ODI series he was South Africa's top scorer and took 11 wickets at 14.72 as South Africa won 6–1.

In March 1999, they toured New Zealand, beating them 1–0 in the Test series and 3–2 in the one-dayers.

At the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]], Cronje finished with 98 runs at 12.25 as South Africa were eliminated after the famous tied semi-final against Australia at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]. In the first match of the tournament versus India, Cronje came onto the field with an earpiece wired to coach [[Bob Woolmer]], but at the first drinks break match referee [[Talat Ali]] ordered him to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Earpiece row mars South Africa win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/1999_cricket_world_cup/general_news/344904.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2010|date=15 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999, Cronje became South Africa's highest Test run scorer during the first Test against Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa v Zimbabwe, 1999/00, First Match, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63852.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Test series was won 2–0 thanks to innings victories. South Africa won the series with England in the fourth Test at Cape Town, Cronje's fiftieth as captain.

The fifth test of the 1999–2000 South Africa versus England series at [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] was ruined by rain, entering the final day only 45 overs had been possible with South Africa 155/6. On the final morning as they batted on, news filtered through that the captains had met and were going to "make a game of it". A target of 250 from 70 overs was agreed. When South Africa reached 248/8, Cronje declared; both teams then forfeited an innings leaving England a target of 249 to win the Test, which they did with two wickets left and only five balls remaining. It ended South Africa's 14 game unbeaten streak in Test cricket. It was later learnt Cronje accepted money and a gift from a bookmaker in return for making an early declaration in this Test. (See below).

Cronje top scored with 56 after South Africa were left reeling at 21–5 in the Final of the triangular tournament which featured England and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa v England, 1999/00, Final, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66097.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2000, his cricket career finished with a 73-ball 79 against Pakistan in the final of Sharjah Cup 1999/2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan v South Africa, 1999/00, Final, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65788.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

Under Cronje's captaincy, South Africa won 27 Tests and lost 11, completing series victories against every team except Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa – Test records – Most matches as captain|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/individual/most_matches_as_captain.html?class=1;id=3;type=team|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He captained the One Day International team to 99 wins out of 138 matches with one tied match and three [[no result]]s. He holds the South African record for matches won as captain, and his record of captaining his side in 138 matches stands bettered only by [[Graeme Smith]]'s 149 matches as ODI captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa – ODI records – Most matches as captain|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/individual/most_matches_as_captain.html?class=2;id=3;type=team|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 99 wins as captain makes him the fourth most successful captain worldwide in terms of matches won, behind [[Ricky Ponting]], [[Allan Border]] and [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] and in terms of percentage of wins (73.70), behind Ponting and [[Clive Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One-Day Internationals – Most matches as captain|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283747.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between September 1993 and March 2000, he played in 162 consecutive ODIs, a South African record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One-Day Internationals – Most consecutive matches for a team|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/128609.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronje has the record for playing the most consecutive ODI matches as captain (130) and is the only player to play in 100+ consecutive ODI matches as captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283754.html|title=Records {{!}} One-Day Internationals {{!}} Individual records (captains, players, umpires) {{!}} Most consecutive matches as captain of a team {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match fixing==
{{main|South Africa cricket match fixing}}
On 7 April 2000, it was revealed there was a conversation between Cronje and Sanjay Chawla, a representative of an Indian betting syndicate, over match-fixing allegations. Three other players, [[Herschelle Gibbs]], [[Nicky Boje]], and [[Pieter Strydom]], were also implicated. After an enquiry by the [[King Commission]], Cronje was banned from any involvement in cricket for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cronje banned for life|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/93082.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=11 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He challenged his life ban in September 2001 but on 17 October 2001, his application was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Peter|title=Cronje remains an outcast|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/109086.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=17 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 13 years, on 22 July 2013, the Indian Police registered a [[First Information Report]] for match-fixing in 2000; the charge sheet in the case involving a few South African cricketers including its former captain Hansie Cronje, was finally filed. The scandal was one of the biggest ever to have hit international cricket until the [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal]].

==Death==

On 1 June 2002, Cronje's scheduled flight home from Johannesburg to [[George, Western Cape|George]] was grounded. He then hitched a ride as the only passenger aboard a [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748]] [[turboprop]] aircraft. Near George airport, the pilots lost visibility in clouds and were unable to land, partly due to unusable navigational equipment. While circling, the plane crashed into the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] northeast of the airport. Cronje, aged 32, and the two pilots were killed instantly.

In August 2006, an inquest into the plane crash was opened by South Africa's High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cronje inquest opens|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/cronje-inquest-opens/2006/08/08/1154802862135.html|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=3 March 2010|date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest concluded that "the death of the deceased Wessel Johannes Cronje was brought about by an act or omission [[prima facie]] amounting to an offence on the part of pilots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pilot error caused Cronje crash|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4790609.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 March 2010|date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories that Cronje was murdered on the orders of a cricket betting syndicate flourished after his death and were most recently re-floated by former [[Nottinghamshire]] coach [[Clive Rice]] in the wake of the death of Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] in March 2007. It was alleged that he was murdered to hide the truths behind match-fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drake|first=Matt|title=Did a cricketer kill Woolmer?|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/2710|publisher=[[Daily Express]]|accessdate=3 March 2010|date=25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Hansie Cronje married Bertha Hans on 8 April 1995. They had no children. Hansie's widow later married Jacques Du Plessis, a financial auditor, in 2003. It was reported that the private ceremony was attended by Hansie's parents and siblings.

'''Jules Ottenstadion''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Gentbrugge]], [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]].  It was used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and used to be the home ground of [[K.A.A. Gent]].  The stadium held 12,919 seats and was built in 1920. It was replaced as the club's home ground by the new [[Ghelamco Arena]] in 2013. At the end of the use of the stadium for the home matches of KAA Gent, it was simply called Ottenstadion by the people of Ghent. It was situated in the centre of a residential neighbourhood in the Bruiloftstraat in Gentbrugge.

== History ==
The stadium was built in 1920 and was officially opened on 22 August of that year by the Dauphin of that time, Prince Leopold. The stadium was named after Jules Otten, one of the founders of KAA Gent, which was called La Gantoise at that time.

During the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], it hosted the [[Italy at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Italy]]-[[Egypt at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Egypt]] [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|football]] match which the Italians won 2-1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197008/matches/match=32276/report.html FIFA.com 1920 Summer Olympics ITA-EGY results.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201211636/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament%3D512/edition%3D197008/matches/match%3D32276/report.html |date= 1 February 2009 }}  - accessed 6 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

K.A.A. Gent played its home games at the stadium for 90 years, before moving to the new Ghelamco Arena, which is situated at the Ottergemsesteenweg. It was planned that the new stadium would be ready by the 2007-2008 season, but due to many delays, it wasn't opened until 2013. The new Arena with 20,000 seats was officially inaugurated on 17 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadiumguide.com/arteveldestadion/ stadiumguide.com: Ghelamco Arena] accessed 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jules Ottenstadium has been demolished and will be replaced by a residential environment.

'''Paralympic alpine skiing''' is an adaptation of [[alpine skiing]] for athletes with a disability. The sport evolved from the efforts of disabled veterans in Germany and Austria during and after the [[Second World War]]. The sport is governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] Sports Committee. The primary equipment used includes [[outrigger]] skis, [[sit-ski]]s, and [[mono-ski]]s. Para-alpine skiing disciplines include the [[Downhill (ski competition)|Downhill]], [[Super giant slalom skiing|Super-G]], [[Giant Slalom]], [[Slalom skiing|Slalom]], [[Super Combined]] and [[Snowboarding|Snowboard]].

[[Para-alpine skiing classification]] is the classification system for para-alpine skiing designed to ensure fair competition between alpine skiers with different types of disabilities. The classifications are grouped into three general disability types: standing, blind and sitting. A factoring system was created for para-alpine skiing to allow the three classification groupings to fairly compete against each other in the same race despite different functional skiing levels and medical problems.

Alpine skiing was one of the foundation sports at the first [[1976 Winter Paralympics|Winter Paralympics in 1976]] with Slalom and Giant Slalom events being held. Different disciplines were added to the Paralympic programme over time. The [[2010 Winter Paralympics]] para-alpine skiing events were held at [[Whistler Creekside]]. The disciplines at Whistler included Downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, Slalom and Giant Slalom.

==History==
Skiing as a sport for people with disabilities traces its origins back to the [[Second World War]], which produced large numbers of wounded soldiers. In Germany, Franz Wendel, an amputee who had lost a leg, successfully attached a pair of crutches to short skis. Sepp "Peppi" Zwicknagel, an Austrian veteran who had lost both his legs to a hand grenade, taught himself to ski and eventually became a ski instructor at [[Kitzbühel]], founded a division of the Austrian Ski Association for handicapped skiers. By 1947, annual races were being held in Austria. [[Ludwig Guttman]], a key figure in the history of paralympic sport, helped organise ski events. In the United States, [[Gretchen Fraser]] began teaching skiing to amputees in army hospitals. By the 1960s, a number of organisations had been founded. For a long time, disability skiing was restricted to amputees, but in 1969, blind skier Jean Eymere, a former ski instructor before he lost his eyesight, began a skiing program in [[Aspen, Colorado]] for blind skiers. The first international competition, the [[IPC Alpine skiing World Championship|World Disabled Alpine Championships]], was held in France in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disaboom.com/adaptive-skiing/from-rehab-tool-to-elite-sport-a-history-of-adaptive-skiing |accessdate=12 October 2012 |title=From Rehab Tool to Elite Sport: A History of Adaptive Skiing |publisher=Disaboom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Championships===
{{Main|World Para Alpine Skiing Championships}}

==Governance, rules and events==
International and national events for the sport include the Winter Paralympics, World Championships, World Cups, Continental Cups, National Championships, IPCAS Races and IPCAS Para-Snowboard.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=5}} Skiers from 39 different countries actively compete in para-alpine skiing&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt; in a sport is that one of eight governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] Sports Committee,&lt;ref name=gamesexplained39/&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} with rules for para-alpine skiing set forth in the IPCAS Rules and Regulations.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt; Event specific rules may be created for events like the Paralympic Games. One set of rules was created in 1994 and were specified in the IPC Handbook. This was used to govern IPC-sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=11}} Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the [[International Ski Federation]] (ISF).{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22-24}} These rules were set at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000. The two rule sets worked in concert with each other, with the ISF rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing, and the IPC providing modifications for para-alpine skiing.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=11}} The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can determine if skiers are eligible to compete in IPC sanctioned events at their own discretion regardless of what the rules say.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=19}} National Paralympic Committees can have their own rule sets at national competitions.&lt;ref name=canadasite/&gt;

==Equipment==
[[Image:Vail Veterans monoski.jpg|thumb|250px|A disabled veteran uses a [[sit ski]] at Vail, Colorado.|left]]
===Sitting===
The primary equipment used in the sport includes outrigger skis, sit-skis, and mono-skis.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} Depending on the classification, other equipment may be used by skiers including guide skiers, cut-down ski poles, orthopedic aids, or prostheses. For standing skiers, different class rules determine what sort of equipment is allowed in competition, such as one pole, two poles or no poles, or one or two skis.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=24}} Rules for equipment use in competition are set by FIS and the IPC.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=13}}

There are minimum lengths for skis used in competition, with men's skis needing to be at least {{convert|165|cm}} long and women's skis needing to be at least {{convert|155|cm}} long. Bindings used for skis have a maximum height of {{convert|55|mm}}.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt;

Sit-skis are designed for wheelchair users or other skiers with a form of paraplegia. The first sit-ski was built in 1967 by [[Josef Shrall]] from the [[Bavaria]] region of Germany. Early sit-skis used in para-alpine skiing had two wide skis, brakes, and were custom built to fit the specific skier. The weight of the ski prevented skiers from skiing moguls or steep slopes. Sit-ski development continued into the 1980s, with a more modern version demonstrated in [[Engelberg, Switzerland]] in 1987 at a workshop hosted by the [[Swiss Association of Paraplegics]]. As the technology advanced, a chair was developed that could be attached to the skis which were used by able-bodied skiers. They are now made from fibreglass and polyester, and the weight has been dramatically reduced, allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and compete in the moguls.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}} Current sit-skis include seat-belts.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt; As skis for able-bodied skiers have evolved to specialise for the event, the skis that sit-skiers use have also changed.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}

Sit-skiers use a specially designed ski called a mono-ski,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} sometimes called a maxi mono-ski. It is used by skiers with lower limb disabilities including paralysis. A variation of the mono-ski exists for skiers with bilateral, above the knee amputations. The mono-ski was developed in Austria in the early 1980s by bilateral above-the-knee amputee [[Josef Feirsinger]] and engineer [[Horst Morokuti]]. The fundamental design they created is still the one used for mono-skis currently used in competition.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}} The mono-ski was quickly used by German skiers who built their own at a workshop in [[Tübingen]]. The mono-ski uses the same skis used for able-bodied alpine skiing, adapted so that the skier [[:wikt:seat#Verb|sits]] on a chair attached to the ski via a spring. The mono-ski was first used at the [[1988 Winter Paralympics]].{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}

A monoski, also known as a ''sit-ski'', consists of a molded seat mounted on a metal frame. A [[shock absorber]] beneath the seat eases riding on uneven terrain and helps in turning by maximizing ski-snow contact. Modern monoskis&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sitski.com/pg2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; interface with a single, ordinary [[ski#downhill ski|alpine ski]] by means of a "ski foot," a metal or plastic block in the shape of a [[ski boot#Alpine|boot]] sole that clicks into the ski's [[ski bindings#Alpine|binding]]. A monoskier uses ''outriggers'' for stability; an outrigger resembles a [[crutch|forearm crutch]] with a short [[ski]] on the bottom. People new to mono-skiing are often surprised to see how much terrain is skiable in a monoski; advanced monoskiers can be found not only carving turns on groomed runs but also skiing [[mogul skiing|moguls]], [[terrain parks]], race courses, glades and even [[backcountry skiing|backcountry]] terrain—in short, wherever stand-up skiers can go.

As alpine ski technology has advanced, so has monoski technology.  In North America in the 1970s and early 1980s, early "sit-skis" took the form of fiberglass sleds with metal runners. The first downhill sit-ski in the US, the Arroya, was invented by American [[Peter Axelson]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rideataxia.org/Articles/Ski.pdf Adaptive Skiing Resources - When the snow flies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826051428/http://rideataxia.org/Articles/Ski.pdf# |date=2011-08-26 }}, rideataxia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsusa.org/ChallMagarchive/Fall07/challmag-fall07-DSUSA40Yrs.html Remembering and celebrating 40 years of disabled sports] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112073324/http://dsusa.org/challmagarchive/fall07/challmag-fall07-dsusa40yrs.html# |date=2012-11-12 }}, dsusa.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-05/news/vw-12619_1_ski-slopes/2 LA Times Article], LA Times.com&lt;/ref&gt; Dragging very long poles or "slicks" in the snow were the method in which turns were actually made harder, although not effectively.  Few users became proficient enough to descend even intermediate terrain without assistance from a "tetherer."  By the early '80s, Europeans were experimenting with "ski-bobs" that mounted on two small skis.  In place of today's minimal bucket seats were large fiberglass or Kevlar shells, and leaf springs at first were used instead of slide absorbers. The three-ski design proved accident prone, and it was soon abandoned for a single ski by most manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asdracing.org/daten/INFO/History%20English.pdf History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the decade, the technology had migrated to Canada, and on both continents the modern monoski began to emerge.  In the United States, Enabling Technologies'&lt;ref&gt;[http://enablingtech.com/ Enabling Technologies website]&lt;/ref&gt; Unique, Sunrise Medical's Shadow, and Dan Fallon's Fallonski were some of the first commercially available monoskis. Praschberger&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praschberger.com/en Praschberger website]&lt;/ref&gt; (Austria), [[Tessier]] (France), and [[DynAccess]] (USA) are some of the major companies.

In 1984, monoskiers took part in the [[1984 Winter Paralympics|1984 Innsbruck Paralympic Winter Games]] as a demonstration sport;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/release/Winter_Sports/Alpine_Skiing/About_the_sport/History/&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[1988 Winter Paralympics|Innsbruck 1988]], full medal categories were added for sitting skiers.

===Standing===
For standing competitors, outrigger skis can be used in some classifications. These are ski poles with small skis on the end.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} They assist a skier balancing as they ski down the slopes,{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} and in moving uphill for short distances, enabling skiers to do things like a climb a slope to get on a chair lift.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}

===Other equipment===
Beyond this equipment, skiers also gear up wearing special boots, helmets, ski suits, and goggles.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} At the Paralympic Games, this equipment is prohibited from having advertisements on it.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=13}} The boots attach to the ski at the heel and toe, and are designed to provide support to foot and ankle with the use of materials in boot construction like hard plastics. All helmets used in competition are required to be hard-shell helmets.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt;

For skiers with visual impairments, guides are used to assist the skier down the course.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} Guides are skiers who do not have a vision impairment who assist a skier down the slopes by telling the skier where to go using their voice or a radio.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} Skiers can use more than one guide in the course of a competition, but the guide is only eligible for a medal if they have competed with the same skier for the duration of the discipline event.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=6}} Like the skier, the guide is required to have an IPCAS Licence in order to participate in a competition{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=7}} and adhere to anti-doping rules.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=9}}

==Disciplines==
Para-alpine skiing disciplines include the Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom, Super Combined and Snowboard.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=40}} The rules for these disciplines are based on the rules set by the [[International Ski Federation]], though some rules have been adapted for skiers with disabilities.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} While skiing in these disciplines, skiers can reach speeds of {{convert|100|km}} an hour.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt;

===Downhill===
{{Main|Downhill (ski competition)}}
[[File:Xx0188 - 1988 winter paralympics - 3b - scans (13).jpg|thumb|A Norwegian skier in the downhill at the [[1988 Winter Paralympics]]|alt=a sit skier]]
This is a speed based timed discipline, where competitors ski down a steep course that can finish {{convert|450|m}} to {{convert|800|m}} lower than it started&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; while containing many turns and jumps.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} The winner is determined based on one run down the course, with the competitor with the fastest time being the winner.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} Skiers navigate between gates in the Downhill, the fewest number gates amongst all para-alpine disciplines, and if they miss a set, they are disqualified.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=6-7}}&lt;ref name=canadasite/&gt; In some competitions that require qualification for entry, a skier can qualify for this discipline through Downhill or Super-G.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} There are Disabled FIS points available in sanctioned events.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} This race is included on the current Paralympic programme.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt;

Skis for women must be at least {{convert|200|cm}} long with a tolerance of {{convert|1|cm}}. For men, the ski length must be at least {{convert|205|cm}} long with the same tolerance. Women and men's skis need a minimum radius of {{convert|45|m}}.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2012|p=1}} Skiers used curved ski poles for this event. Men and women both need their skis to have a profile radius of {{convert|67|mm}}.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} Top speeds in this event can be up to {{convert|100|km}} an hour.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=6-7}} Before the start of the event, the skier is required to do a practice run, and is required to wear a helmet during all their runs.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=33}}

===Super-G===
{{Main|Super-G}}
Developed in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; the Super-G is less technical than others, and is known for the speed of the skier,{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=12-13}}{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} who navigate a course that has a vertical drop between {{convert|400|m}} to {{convert|600|m}} from top to bottom.&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; Compared to other para-alpine skiing disciplines, this course tends to be mid-length. It is longer than the Giant Slalom and the Slalom but shorter than the Downhill course.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} In this discipline, competitors ski between alternating red and blue gates&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; that are {{convert|25|m}} apart,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} with men needing to clear 35 gates and women needing to clear 30 gates.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=12-13}} In some competitions that require qualification for entry, a skier can qualify for this discipline through Downhill, Slalom or Super-G.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} There are Disabled FIS points available in sanctioned events.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} This race is included on the current Paralympic programme.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt;

Skis for women must be at least {{convert|200|cm}} long with a tolerance of {{convert|1|cm}}. For men, the ski length must be at least {{convert|205|cm}} long with the same tolerance. Women and men's skis need a minimum radius of {{convert|33|m}}. Men and women both need their skis to have a profile radius of {{convert|65|mm}}.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2012|p=1}} Skiers used curved ski poles for this event.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}}

===Giant Slalom===
{{Main|Giant slalom skiing}}
With a vertical drop of {{convert|300|m}} to {{convert|400|m}},&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; this is one of the more technical of the para-alpine skiing disciplines.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=10-11}} This discipline involves two runs down a course straighter and shorter than the Downhill,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} but longer and having fewer turns than the Slalom course.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=10-11}} The winner is determined based on the combined time for both races.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=10-11}} After the first run, the bottom 20% of finishers can be eliminated from the competition at the discretion of the judges.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=11-13}} The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers, with the fastest skier in the first run skiing 15th. Any skiers who finished outside the top 15 then ski in order based on their times from the first run. For example, the 18th fastest finisher in the first run skis 18th in the second run.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=13}} In some competitions, this is modified using 30 skiers instead of 15.&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; The IPC/FIS run jointly sanctioned events for Slalom.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=17}} This race is included on the current Paralympic programme.&lt;ref name=IPCsite/&gt; Skiers used straight ski poles for this event.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}}

===Slalom===
{{Main|Slalom skiing}}
[[File:Dd0394- Lillehammer Winter Games, R.Hacon - 3b- scanned photo.jpg|thumb|left|Australian Paralympic athlete Rod Hacon at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer]]
The name for this event is from a Norwegian word meaning "sloping path."{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=8-9}} This event is the most technical para-alpine skiing disciplines,{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=8-9}}&lt;ref name=canadasite/&gt; with a vertical drop of only {{convert|140|m}} to {{convert|220|m}} on an intentionally iced course.&lt;ref name=gbsite/&gt; This is the shortest of all the para-alpine skiing events and uses two different courses. Skiers go down each course once, with their finishing position being determined based on their combined course completion time.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=8-9}} There are gates in this event, about 55-75 for men and 40-60 for women,&lt;ref name=canadasite/&gt; and if a skier misses a gate, they are disqualified from the race.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} After the first run, the bottom 20% of finishers can be eliminated from the competition at the discretion of the judges.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=11-13}} The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers, with the fastest skier in the first run skiing 15th.

===Super Combined===
{{Main|Alpine skiing combined}}
The Super Combined event is a combination of two disciplines such as the Slalom and the Super G,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} or the Downhill and the Slalom. In the event, skiers go down the Downhill course once, and the Slalom course twice. The times for the races are combined, with the fastest time winning.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=12-13}}

===Snowboard===
Snowboard has vertical drops between {{convert|100|m}} and {{convert|240|m}} for both men's and women's races with the course being run over a distance of {{convert|400|m}} to {{convert|900|m}}. The course has alternating gates.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=40}} The sport is only open to standing competitors.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing|2012|p=5}}

==Classification==
{{Main|Para-alpine skiing classification}}
[[Para-alpine skiing classification]] is the classification system for para-alpine skiing designed to ensure fair competition between [[Alpine skiing|alpine skiers]] with different types of disabilities.&lt;ref name="Broekhoff1986"/&gt; The classifications are grouped into three general disability types: standing, blind and sitting.&lt;ref name=wherehoescome/&gt; Classification governance is handled by International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing.&lt;ref name="HutsonSpeed2011"/&gt; Skiers are classified based on medical assessment, and their body position when they ski.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} Blind skiers are evaluated purely on a medical assessment.&lt;ref name="orissidehow96"/&gt; Prior to that, several sport governing bodies dealt with classification including the [[International Sports Organization for the Disabled]] (ISOD), [[International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation]] (ISMWSF), [[International Blind Sports Federation]] (IBSA) and [[Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association]] (CP-ISRA).{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=78}}&lt;ref name=cpisraa-site/&gt; Some classification systems are governed by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing for systems not used in international competition.&lt;ref name="Winnick2010"/&gt; The sport is open to all competitors with a visual or physical disability. It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name="HutsonSpeed2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winnick2010"/&gt;

The first classification systems for [[Paralympic alpine skiing|para-alpine skiing]] were developed in Scandinavia, with early systems designed for skiers with amputations.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} At the time, equipment had yet to be developed to allow participation for skiers with spinal cord injuries.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=78}} The goal of the early classification systems was to be functional but ended up being medical classification systems.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} At the first [[Winter Paralympics]] in 1976, there were two classifications for the sport.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} By the 1980s, classification existed for skiers with [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref name=cpirsa-1/&gt; At that time, with inspiration from [[wheelchair basketball classification]], efforts were made to make classification more of a functional system.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} Ten classes existed by the 1980s,&lt;ref name=disabilitysport-120/&gt; and since then, efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of classification by reducing the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded.&lt;ref name=wherehoescome/&gt;

==Factor system==
A factoring system was created for para-alpine skiing to allow the grouping of classifications into three general groups: sitting, standing and visually impaired. One medal event can then be held for each group even though there is a wide range of functional mobility and medical differences. The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels, where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number. The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used. This means the faster skier down a hill may not be the winner of an event.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=25}}

The factoring system is used at several para-alpine skiing competitions including the [[Alpine Cup]], [[North American Races]], [[European Cup]], [[Alpine Skiing World Cup|World Cup]] events, [[World Para Alpine Skiing Championships|World Championships]], and the [[Winter Paralympics]].{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=25}} Disciplines use factored results to combine classes unless there are six or more skiers competing in a specific class.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=13}}

'''Philip II National Arena''' (Macedonian: Филип Втори Арена , Philip II Arena).It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches, but sometimes also for music concerts or other events. It is the home stadium of [[FK Vardar]] and [[FK Rabotnički]] from [[Skopje]], both of which compete in the [[Macedonian First League]], as well as the home ground of the [[Macedonia national football team]] on almost all occasions (the other venues rarely chosen being the [[Goce Delčev Stadium]] in [[Prilep]], or [[SRC Biljanini Izvori]] in [[Ohrid]]). On 30 June 2015 the [[UEFA]] announced that the National Arena Philip II of Macedonia will host the [[2017 UEFA Super Cup]], Macedonia's first UEFA club competition final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=2262118.html|title=FYR Macedonia to host 2017 UEFA Super Cup|first=|last=UEFA.com|date=|website=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction and expansion==
The project for the south stand was designed in 1977 by architects Dragan Krstev and Todorka Mavkova from ''Beton''. Construction of the stadium in its present form began in 1978, with the building of the south stand, which took two years to finish.
The reconstruction and expansion started after a long delay in project implementation in January 2008. The construction of a new north stand was finished in August 2009 and was put in use on 2 August 2009, the [[Public holidays in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian national holiday]] "[[Republic Day (Republic of Macedonia)|Ilinden]]". Ten days later, on 12 August, the [[Macedonia national football team]] played a friendly match against then World Champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]], as part of the 100-year anniversary of football in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonianfootball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1426:macedonia-to-host-spain&amp;catid=13:international&amp;Itemid=64|title=Home - Macedonian Football|author=|date=|website=Macedonian Football}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reconstruction of the southern stand started in 2009, which was put into operation on 30 July of that year for the match between [[FK Rabotnički]] and [[Liverpool FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/07/22/liverpool-fc-to-face-fk-rabotnicki-in-uefa-europa-league-qualifier-100252-26912088|title=Liverpool FC to face FK Rabotnicki in UEFA Europa League qualifier|first=Liverpool|last=Echo|date=22 July 2010|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Soon after, the construction of the new western and eastern stands started. By mid July 2012, the majority of the stadium was completed with the reconstruction of the new pitch and athletic track. On 25 July 2012, [[FK Vardar]] played [[FC BATE Borisov]] in the second qualifying round of the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] to re-open the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedonianfootball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4848:uefa-cl-vardar-bate-borisov-00&amp;catid=13:international&amp;Itemid=64|title=Home - Macedonian Football|author=|date=|website=Macedonian Football}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000344/match=2009424/postmatch/report/index.html|title=UEFA.com Vardar-BATE 0:0|author=|date=|website=uefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction cost==
Since 2008, the stadium has seen investment of about two billion [[Macedonian denar|denari]], or €32 million. The second phase, which got underway in November 2011, is the planned reconstruction of the pitch and athletic track. The athletic track around the pitch, from the original 6 will be extended to 8 running tracks and it will use [[Tartan track]] surface. Total cost for this phase is €3.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://vest.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E45487999BBA984296390FF0961A71D1{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 it should be finished with the completion of a new illuminated outer facade. The total construction cost for all actions related to the stadium in the period 2008-2013 is estimated to reach over €60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beton.com.mk/en/istorija.shtml|title=HISTORY|first=IKT|last=Beton|date=|website=www.beton.com.mk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">'''Pocket Mutation Chess''' is a [[chess variant]] invented by Mike Nelson in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D. B. |authorlink=David Pritchard (chess player) |editor-last=Beasley |editor-first=John |title=The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants |publisher=John Beasley |year=2007 |contribution=Pocket Mutation Chess |page=164 |isbn=978-0-9555168-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this game a player can take a piece from the board and put it into a ''pocket''. The piece in the pocket can be put back on the board later. When placing the piece into the pocket the player can ''mutate'' the piece, i.e. change it to a different piece.

The game is one of the ''Recognized Chess Variants'' at ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/rindex.html The Chess Variant Pages: Recognized Chess Variants]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
The starting position in this game is the same as in standard chess. Players make moves as in standard chess. Instead of moving, a player can take one of their own pieces from the board and put it into the pocket, provided that the pocket is empty. If the piece is placed into the pocket from the last rank, it gets promoted to a piece of higher class. Otherwise the player has an option to mutate the piece into a different piece of the same class.  The choice of mutating (or not) must be made at the time the piece is removed.  White cannot use the pocket on the first move. The king cannot be placed into the pocket.

As a players move, a piece in the pocket can be dropped on any empty position on the board, except the last rank.  A pawn can make only a single step from the first rank, but can do a double step from the second one, even if dropped there or moved from the first rank. The ''[[en passant]]'' rule applies as in standard chess. Pawns that reach the last rank do not get promoted immediately. Instead, they can be placed into the pocket and promoted to a piece of higher class.

There is no [[castling]] in this chess variant. The game is declared a draw if no capture or promotion was made for 50 consecutive moves.

== Classes of the pieces ==
Besides usual pieces there are several [[fairy chess piece]]s in this game. All pieces are divided into the following classes. All pieces from the same class are of presumably the same (or close) value.

'''Sea Scouts''' are members of the international [[Scouting]] movement, with a particular emphasis on boating and water-based activities. These activities can be on the sea, rivers or lakes. Sea Scouts can provide a chance to sail, cruise on boats, learn navigation, learn how to work on engines and compete in [[regatta]]s. Sea Scouts often have distinctive uniforms. In some countries or Scout organizations, Sea Scouting is a program just for older Scouts.

==History==
[[File:A MEMBER OF THE JEWISH SEA SCOUTS ON BOARD THE "EVA READING" MOTOR BOAT OFF TEL AVIV. צופה ים מתנועת "זבולון" בסירת מנוע מול חופי תל אביב.D32-050.jpg|thumb|upright|A member of the Jewish Sea Scouts in 1938]]
[[File:Texas A&amp; M; students lead scouts at 2013 National Scout Jamboree 130722-G-NM852-745.jpg|thumb|US Sea Scout leaders in 2013]]
One of the earliest records of  "Sea Scouts" is in [[Chums (paper)|''Chums'']] magazine which refers to "Sea Scouts" as early as July 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Chums, vd. e.g. 14 July 1909 p879, 21 July 1909 p888, 28 July 1909 p921&lt;/ref&gt; These Sea Scouts were part of the Chums Scouts and [[British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association|British Boy Scouts]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Also in the ''Chums'' magazine, the British Boys Naval Brigade, later National Naval Cadets, were subtitled 'Scouts of the Sea' from the 14 July 1909 edition and, from the 28 July 1909 edition, 'Sea Scouts of the Empire'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boy-scout.net/en/page1/page31/page31.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214034419/http://www.boy-scout.net/en/page1/page31/page31.html |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Boy Scouts and an original company of The National Naval Cadets were both headquartered in Battersea, London and the 'boys' weekly newspaper ''Chums'' was the official journal of both. The National Naval Cadets affiliated with the British Boy Scouts as part of its Sea Scouts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Later, Sea Scouts were introduced within the [[The Scout Association|Baden-Powell Boy Scouts]] organization. In the first edition of 'Scouting for Boys', [[Baden-Powell]] mentioned that "A Scout should be able to manage a boat, to bring it properly alongside a ship or pier....". In December 1908, the first Seamanship badge was issued as one of the first 'Efficiency' badges.&lt;ref&gt;http://retentioninscouting.org/The_Early_History_of_Sea_Scouting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A camp for Scouts was held at [[Bucklers Hard]], [[Hampshire]] in August 1909 at which boating activities were a focus. In 1911, Baden-Powell wrote the booklet ''Sea Scouting for Boys''. [[Warington Baden-Powell]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Warington Baden-Powell]], K.C., an [[Admiralty]] lawyer, sailor, inventor of [[canoe]] sailing and author of ''Canoe Travelling: Log of a Cruise on the Baltic, and Practical Hints on Building and Fitting Canoes'' London, Smith, Elder, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''Sea Scouting and Seamanship for Boys'' in 1912, with a foreword by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]]. A special uniform for Sea Scouts was approved in 1910 and, in 1912, the name "Sea Scouts" was officially adopted within Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts Association.&lt;ref name="SeaHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seascout.org/about/history-uk.html|title=A Short History of Sea Scouting in the United Kingdom|last=Masini|first=Roy|year=2007|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea Scouting found its way to the rest of the world. In many organizations a Sea Scout troop or group has a special name, in the Boy Scouts of America it is called a ship.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Sixfields Stadium''', currently known as '''The PTS Academy Stadium''' for sponsorship reasons, is a 7,798-capacity all-seater sports [[stadium]] in the [[Sixfields]] area on the west side of [[Northampton]], England. It has been the home ground of [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town Football Club]] following their move from the [[County Cricket Ground, Northampton|County Ground]] in October 1994. It was also rented by [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] between July 2013 and August 2014. The site also hosts [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] in the adjacent stadium. Aside from being a sports venue, Sixfields also houses conference facilities.

==History==
[[File:The Club Shop at Sixfields Stadium - geograph.org.uk - 1515081.jpg|thumb|Club shop]]
Since 1897, Northampton Town had played their home games at the [[County Cricket Ground, Northampton|County Cricket Ground]], sharing it with [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club]]. Because of the larger size of a cricket pitch, the football ground only had stands on three sides. Northampton Town chose to construct their own stadium, more suitable for football, in the [[Sixfields]] area of Northampton.

The stadium had been scheduled to be opened at the start of the [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95]], but was not ready on time and as a result Northampton began the season still at the County Ground. The first game to be played at Sixfields was against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] on 15 October 1994. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with striker [[Martin Aldridge]] scoring the first goal at the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10425~1011452,00.html |title=The History of Northampton Town Football Club |author= |date=22 June 2011 |work=Official website |publisher=[[Northampton Town F.C.]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103012338/http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10425~1011452%2C00.html |archivedate=3 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a rent dispute between the owners of [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and the landlords of their home ground, the [[Ricoh Arena]], Coventry started a [[groundshare]] with Northampton in the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23163594 |title=BBC Sport – Coventry City set to groundshare with Northampton Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2013 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was due to continue for three seasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2355211/Coventry-City-agree-groundshare-Northampton-Town-34-miles-away.html|title= Why are the ex-Premier League side leaving their 32,000 stadium to move in at Northampton's 7,500 home that is a whopping 34 miles away?|date=3 July 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23233268|title= Coventry's Sixfields groundshare given Football League approval|date=8 July 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in September 2014 Coventry returned to playing at the Ricoh Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Coventry City Football Club have agreed a deal to return to the Ricoh Arena |url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/article/coventry-city-return-ricoh-arena-announcement-210814-1849840.aspx |publisher=Coventry City F.C |date=21 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stands==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}

===West Stand===
The largest of the stands, seating just under 4,000 home supporters on a match day. The West Stand also accommodates the Cave &amp; Sons Boardroom, the Able Print Players Lounge, the Grosvenor Casino 1897 Suite, Carrs Bar, and changing rooms.

===Sheinman Opticians Stand (North) Stand===
Recognition to Dave Bowen stand, Named after ex-Northampton Town player and manager [[Dave Bowen]], who helped take the club from [[Football League Two|Division Four]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] during the 1960s, the North Stand is behind the goal nearest to the hill. It seats approximately 900.

===East Stand===
Location for the Mick George Family Enclosure and faces the West Stand. It can seat approximately 1,974 fans and is usually reserved for home supporters, although if the opposition sell their allocation in Moulton College Stand, they are usually sent an extra 450 tickets for the south end of this stand.  The stand was commended for its facilities for [[disabled]] supporters by ''The Football Ground Guide''.

===Moulton College (South) Stand===
Standing opposite and identical to The Sheinman Opticians Stand, this end is reserved for away fans. Until the 2015/2016 season the only occasion on which this stand has held Northampton Town supporters was against [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] on 29 April 2006 when the stand was split and supporters segregated to allow the maximum number of home supporters to witness the club's promotion to [[Football League One|League One]].

During the 2015–16 season, the stand was split between home and away fans numerous times because of high demand from Northampton Town fans.

This stand holds 900 fans.

==Development and fiscal problems==
===Vision===
In December 2003, the football club secured a 150-year lease on the ground from the local council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/features_2_5744/ten_years_of_action_1_902967 |title=Ten years of action |author= |date=16 February 2004 |work=[[Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo]] |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The owners of Northampton Town, David and Tony Cardoza, proposed to redevelop the whole ground, doubling capacity into a 15,000 all-seater stadium. This would start by adding executive boxes and a further 2,000 seats to the West Stand, whilst expanding the clubs offices and facilities. The other stands would then be expanded and joined to create a 'bowl' stadium. The new complex would also feature a hotel, coinciding with one of the stands at the County Ground being known as The Hotel End.

The proposed expansion would be largely financed by associated development, such as new shops and the hotel. As these associated developments would not comply with national government policy on restricting out-of-town retail development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicystatements/pps4/ |title=Planning Policy Statement 4: Planning for Sustainable Economic Growth |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government |accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plans for stadium expansion have not progressed to the stage where a formal planning application has been made. In 2009, the Northampton Retail Strategy was produced by consultants CACI for Northampton Borough Council. This study concluded that further out-of-town retail development would harm the existing town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northampton.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=624&amp;pageNumber=1 |title=Northampton Retail Strategy |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Northampton Borough Council]] |accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East stand development===
[[File:East Stand Oct 2015.jpg|thumb|235px|Incomplete East Stand at Sixfields Stadium on 16 October 2015]]
In 2013, the club proposed redevelopment of the East stand. The project would provide a similar-scale stand to the existing West stand, housing: 4,000 supporters; additional executive facilities; a new family area; plus adding an adjoining hotel and conference centre. Redevelopment began in summer 2014, but in June scaled down plans were revealed, reducing capacity of the stand to about 3,100. Artist's impressions show a similar design to that of Morecambe F.C.'s [[Globe Arena (football stadium)|Globe Arena]] main stand. Supporters criticised these new designs, as some seats may have a restricted view of play. Currently the stand is only half finished.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The stand and associated works were in part funded by a £10.25 million loan from [[Northampton Borough Council]].&lt;ref name=bbcoct /&gt;

===Financial problems===
The redevelopment of the East Stand was not completed in time for the opening home match of the 2014–15 [[Football League Two|League Two]] season &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= http://stadiadirectory.com/northampton-town-s-east-stand-refurbishment-delayed/|title= Northampton Town's East Stand refurbishment delayed|date=15 July 2014|work=Stadia Directory|accessdate=15 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, with the building work incomplete and two repayments on the loan missed, the borough council issued legal notices to the club requiring that the loan be repaid by 15 October 2015.&lt;ref name=bbcoct&gt;{{cite news |date=25 September 2015 |title=Northampton Town must repay £10m loan to borough council |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-34358704 |newspaper=BBC News |access-date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NBC loan 1"&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/exclusive-no-firm-offer-yet-been-made-for-northampton-town-to-pay-back-10-25-million-council-confirms-1-7011890 Northampton Chronicle and  Echo 15 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2015 a [[winding-up]] petition was launched by [[HMRC|HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) to recover unpaid taxes from Northampton Town Football Club at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].&lt;ref name ="HMRC Northampton FC 1"&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/breaking-news-legal-proceedings-launched-to-recover-unpaid-taxes-from-northampton-town-football-club-1-7012223 HM Revenue &amp; Customs Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo website 15 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; HMRC claimed to be owed a five-figure sum in unpaid taxes from the club, and said it would take the club to the High Court on 16 November unless payment was received.&lt;ref name ="HMRC Northampton FC 2"&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/insolvency-expert-warns-northampton-town-fans-of-challenges-faced-by-club-1-7014146 Nothampton Chronicle &amp; Echo 16 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buckingham Group, which was building the new stand, told the supporters' group on 19 October 2015 that it was owed nearly £3M for work on the stand by May, and hence stopped work in June.&lt;ref name ="NBC loan 3"&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/contractor-at-centre-of-legal-dispute-around-development-of-northampton-town-stadium-claims-it-is-owed-2-9-million-1-7019453 Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo 19 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2015 it was reported that players and staff at the club had not been paid as the club’s bank account was frozen.&lt;ref name ="NBC loan 4"&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/northampton-town-confirms-players-and-staff-have-not-been-paid-today-but-says-all-squad-members-are-on-the-bus-for-newport-game-1-7039909 Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo 30 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, administrators' and liquidators' reports emerged for the companies undertaking the development.&lt;ref name="BBC34750400"&gt;{{Cite news|date = 6 November 2015|title = £7M of the £10.25M loan from NBC was given to 1st Land Ltd (now in liquidation), who were to oversee the project, and engaged contractors The Buckingham Group Ltd|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/northamptonshire|newspaper = BBC|access-date = 7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1st Land Ltd was a subsidiary of County Group Ltd (also in administration), part of a group owned by businessman Howard Grossman,&lt;ref name="BBC34750400"/&gt; and had paid monies to associated companies: £1.475m to County Homes (Herts) Ltd; and £233,000 to County Cemetery Services Ltd, directors of which included Howard Grossman, his son Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick.&lt;ref name="BBC34750400"/&gt; Further, 1st Land paid £2.65M to Tony and David Cardoza. The liquidators' report for 1st Land Ltd says that the Cardozas and 1st Land fell in dispute in March 2014, and during investigation the Cardozas called the sum a "Joint Venture Fee" – money paid to one party to help carry out a jointly-run project – whilst former director Howard Grossman called it a loan.&lt;ref name="BBC34750400"/&gt; After the collapse of 1st Land, County Developments (Northampton) Ltd (CDNL) took over the facilitation work, but it also now in liquidation; its directors are listed as David and Anthony Cardoza, while Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick resigned directorships in January 2015.&lt;ref name="BBC34750400"/&gt;

On 7 November 2015 ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper published a summary of the Sixfields issue under the headline ''Northampton Town: scandal of missing millions from council's stadium plan – Cobblers supporters baffled and distressed as council seeks answers about what happened to £10.25m loan to pay for improvements to Sixfields stadium''.&lt;ref name = "Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|date = 7 November 2015|title = Northampton Town: scandal of missing millions from council's stadium plan|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/06/northampton-town-extinction-missing-millions|Newspaper = |access-date = 7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 2016===
The club's new owners announced that seats would be put into the East Stand, which would take the capacity up to 7,724 for the final few home games of the 2015–16 season. It would form part of phase one while phase two would be completed during the off-season. The first phase would be completed by the start of April 2016. It was announced on 31 March 2016 that the stand would be open on 2 April for the game against Notts County.

===The PTS Academy Stadium===
The stadium was renamed the PTS Academy Stadium in June 2018 after the club agreed a naming rights partnership with local training provider PTS Training Academy.

The '''skull and crossbones''' was a common fraternal motif as a symbol of mortality and warning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The symbol was adopted, for various reasons, by many sporting teams, clubs and societies in both America and Europe. 

==Adoption by societies==
The skull and crossbones motif was used by many American college fraternities, sororities and secret societies founded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The most well-known example of this usage is the [[Skull and Bones]] society, a [[secret society]] at [[Yale University]] which derives its very name from the symbol. Other well-known college fraternal organizations which use the skull and bones in some capacity in their public symbols include, but are not limited to: [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Phi Kappa Sigma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Chi Psi]] and [[Zeta Beta Tau]] Fraternities and [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Delta]] Sororities. Other fraternal groups also use the skull and crossbones in their symbolism or in their secret fraternal rituals. These groups include the [[Knights of Columbus]], the [[Royal Black Institution]], [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] as well as the [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar degree of Freemasonry]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

In fraternal usage, the skull and crossbones – along with full skeletons and the skull alone – are a very common motif due to their common association with death. The significance of these symbols varies from group to group. For some, they are a symbolic reminder of mortality. For others, the symbol has a religious reference (as with the Masonic Knights Templar, for which the skull and bones symbolize Golgotha, the place of Jesus' crucifixion). Another common fraternal use is one of warning wherein the skull and crossbones symbolize a dire warning against betraying the group's secrets and/or failing to keep one's oath.

==Adoption by sporting teams==
[[File:Barbarians FC April 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Barbarians team that faced Exeter, April 1891]]
In sports, the symbol was first adopted in the 1870s and was popular across many football sports in [[Great Britain]] and is still widely used by modern sports teams. The earliest teams to adopt the skull and crossbones were [[rugby union]] teams of the time. Although some coastal teams adopted an association with pirates in their team name, most teams used the symbol simply as a form of rebellion and its connotation with danger. The first [[Cardiff RFC]] team adopted a white skull and crossbones on the teams black strip in 1876, but this was changed the next season after pressure from the players' parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=D.E. |coauthors= |title=Cardiff Rugby Club, History and Statistics 1876-1975 |year=1975 |publisher=The Starling Press |location=Risca|page=13 |isbn=0-9504421-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol was also used by the invitational touring rugby team the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]], but this was dropped for the black and white hoops by the late 1890s.

In Ireland the [[University College Cork]], has used the skull and crossbones laid over the University badge for many of its sporting teams, most notably the [[University College Cork RFC|College rugby team]]. Although there is dispute to the origin of the adoption of the badge, it is believed that the University's past connection as a medical school may have been the reason for its use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uccrugby.ie/clubhistory.aspx UCC Rugby :: Club History] uccrugby.ie&lt;/ref&gt; The University College even references the skull and crossbones in their College Victory Cry.

[[File:Stpauli.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Skull and crossbones on a St Pauli supporters flag.]]
[[Poole Pirates]] [[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway]] Team in the [[United Kingdom]] have the Skull and Crossbones as their team badge. 

The logo of the [[Blackshirts (American football)|Blackshirts]], the starting defensive unit for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football]] team, is a Skull and Crossbones with the skull wearing the team [[Football helmet|helmet]]. Additionally, the players and fans often celebrate by "throwing the bones", where they cross the forearms in the air, in a 'X', imitating the logo.

[[FC St. Pauli]] supporters adopted the Skull and Crossbones as an unofficial symbol of the club.

The athletic teams of [[East Carolina University]], nicknamed [[East Carolina Pirates|Pirates]], use a modified skull and crossbones flag as their symbol.  (The skull wears a purple tricornered hat.)

'''The Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre''', also known as the State Hockey Centre of [[New South Wales]] is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was built in 1998 as part of [[Sydney Olympic Park]] sporting complex, having held matches for the [[Field hockey at the 2000 Summer Olympics|field hockey]] events at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. Its current capacity is 8,000 people, with [[seating capacity]] for 4,000. For the [[Sydney Olympic Games]] capacity was boosted to 15,000 through the use of temporary stands.

==Usage==
[[Image:Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre.jpg|thumb|left|Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre during the 2000 Summer Olympics]]
The Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre is a premier [[field hockey]] facility, with the governing body of hockey in New South Wales, [[Hockey NSW]] being based there. The Sydney representatives of both the male and female versions of the semi professional [[Australian Hockey League]], the [[New South Wales Waratahs (field hockey)|New South Wales Waratahs]] and the [[New South Wales Arrows]] both play their home games at the stadium. The stadium also hosted the [[field hockey at the 2000 Summer Olympics]], in which the [[Kookaburras (hockey)|Kookaburras]], the men's Australian national hockey team, won the bronze medal, and the [[Hockeyroos]], the woman's Australian national hockey team won the gold medal for the third consecutive time.

At the [[2000 Summer Paralympics|Sydney Paralympic games]] in 2000, the [[Paralympic football]] 5 and 7-a-side games were played at the stadium. Other sports such as [[Gridiron football|gridiron]], [[Touch football (rugby league)|touch football]], [[Tag Rugby|Oztag]] and [[lacrosse]] have all been played at the stadium. The stadium has also been hired out by schools who require such a facility.

==Facilities==
The stadium contains two fields, one for warm-ups with the other for actual competition. The surface of both these fields, resurfaced in 2008, are POLIGRAS Olympia 2008 which contain polyethylene yarn for improved durability, UV stability, optimum ball/surface interaction and significantly less water requirements. POLIGRAS uses 100% recycled rubber for the elastic layers and heavy-metal-free yarns for the playing surface and uses 30-40% less water than other surfaces available on the market at the time. The pitch is 91.44 metres long by 54.86 metres wide. The main grandstand was designed by architects Ancher Mortlock Wooley and has seating for 1,500 people. It has a roof resembling a soaring glider or sail that sits 25 metres above the ground. It is held up by a 41m high mast removing any requirement for columns, a design that gives spectators an uninterrupted view of the action on the pitch. 

Other facilities available at the stadium include  a conference room (Waratah) overlooking the Olympic Pitch, and the Eva Redfern Lounge (overlooking Pitch 2) also available for hire. The Olympic pitch also has a series of team changerooms, FA room, tournament and drug testing rooms. A kiosk and retail outlet are open during competition and tournament events. Being part of the [[Sydney Olympic Park]] sporting complex, it shares many other facilities with the rest of the complex and makes it easily accessible by bus, train, ferry and car.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2228">The '''Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame''' is a [[hall of fame]] created to recognize people who became notable for participating in some form of sport in the American state of [[Tennessee]]. 

==History==
The Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1966 by the Middle Tennessee Sportswriters and Broadcasters Association, although it is now managed by the State of Tennessee. It was originally located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], on the [[University of Tennessee]] campus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VUO_J0YzpP0C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Tennessee%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit49SkqLrPAhWBVj4KHQA_BKcQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Tennessee%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame&amp;f=false|title=Hall of Fame Museums: A Reference Guide|first=Victor J.|last=Danilov|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=1 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later moved to [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIu0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT275&amp;dq=Tennessee%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit49SkqLrPAhWBVj4KHQA_BKcQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Tennessee%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame&amp;f=false|title=Moon Tennessee|first=Margaret|last=Littman|date=21 June 2016|publisher=Avalon Travel|accessdate=1 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state capital.

'''Three-sided football''' (often referred to as 3SF) is a variation of [[association football]] played with three teams instead of the usual two. It was devised by the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Asger Jorn]] to explain his notion of [[trivalent logic|triolectics]], his refinement on the [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] concept of [[dialectics]], as well as to disrupt one's everyday idea of football. Played on a [[hexagon]]al pitch [http://aaa.t0.or.at/images/feld.jpg], the game can be adapted for similarity to [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] as well as other versions of football.

Unlike conventional football, where the winner is determined by the highest scoring of the two teams, in three-sided football the winning team is that which concedes the fewest goals.

== History ==
[[Image:3-sided Football.jpg|thumb|3 sided football workshop, at the 1st Intergalactic Conference of the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]], [[Public Netbase]], Vienna, Austria, Summer Solstice, 1997]]
The first known game of 3SF, played on 28 May 1993, was organized by the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] on [[Glasgow Green]] as part of the Glasgow Anarchist Summer School. Participants included Richard Essex, [[Stewart Home]] and the members of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]].

Three-sided football has been practiced in various training sessions of the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]] in England, France, Italy and Austria, including the 1st Intergalactic Conference in Vienna (1997), the 2nd Intergalactic Conference in Bologna (1998), the Space 1999 in London, or as a protest event in Parc de La Villette during the 1998 two-sided football World Cup in Paris.

The Deptford Three Sided Football Club (D3FC) was founded in February 2012 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Jorn's invention of the game in his 1962 book Naturens Orden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://d3fc.wordpress.com/about/|title=D3FC|date=2013-02-01|work=d3fc|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games were held every other Sunday between D3FC and other local clubs at the Deptford Green Hexagon in Fordham Park, South East London.

The first three-sided football match in Turkey was organized by InEnArt on 14 September 2013, to coincide with the 13th [[Istanbul Biennial]]. The match was played in front of [[Kadir Has University]], [[Istanbul]] between Philosophy Football FC from the UK, FSC Dynamo Windrad Kassel from Germany and Ayazma FC from Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d3fc.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/istanbul-biennale/|title=Istanbul Biennale|date=2013-09-01|website=d3fc|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee was [[Halil İbrahim Dinçdağ]], who was suspended by the Turkish Football Federation in 2009 because of his sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gay-referee-gets-red-card-in-turkey-1718056.html|title=Gay referee gets red card in Turkey|date=2009-06-25|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoff Andrews, manager of Philosophy Football FC, launched the International Three Sided Football Federation before this match.

The first three sided football match in Australia was held on the 4th of May 2014. It was held at St Kilda Primary School in Melbourne and featured the 'St Kilda All Sartres', Pythagoras 3FC (the Pys) and Atletico Geometry (the Geometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://threesidedfootball.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/three-sided-foo/|title=Three-Sided Football Kicks Off in Melbourne (Match Report – Game 1)|date=2014-04-18|website=The Final Third|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams were mixed - an important feature of Australian Three Sided Football.

The first 3SF World Cup took place in cooperation with the International Three Sided Football Federation and the [[Museum Jorn, Silkeborg|Museum Jorn]] in Silkeborg, Denmark, May 23 until May 25, 2014. Teams from France, Germany, Poland, England, Lithuania and Denmark sought to win the Cup. The Danish team Silkeborg KFUM were crowned champions.

=== Kassel, 2017 ===
The second 3SF World Cup was held at the [[:de:Hessenkampfbahn|Hessenkampfbahn]] in Kassel, Germany on Sat 19 August, 2017. The tournament was hosted by Dynamo Windrad as part of [[documenta 14]] and featured twelve teams originating from Germany, England, Poland and Lithuania.

The final was contested between local side F2 Versenkt and two teams from the SE London league, Polish Husaria and New Cross Internationals. In a very tight and tactical game, New Cross Internationals scored the only goal of the game against F2 Versenkt. Although Polish Husaria and New Cross Internationals both finished the game with clean sheets, the rules of the tournament stated that in cases of a winning draw the team who scored the most goals in the match would be considered the winner. Therefore, New Cross Internationals were declared winners of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WM im Dreiseitenfußball in Kassel - Titel geht nach England|url=https://www.myheimat.de/kassel/sport/wm-im-dreiseitenfussball-in-kassel-titel-geht-nach-england-d2828074.html|website=My Heimat|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the final it transpired that Polish Husaria had not been aware of the rule regarding goals scored, and because of this New Cross Internationals offered to share the title with Polish Husaria.

=== London, 2020 ===
The next 3SF World Cup will be held in 2020 in London&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b7y9f0&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Domestic Leagues ==

=== Deptford 3SF League (New Cross, South East London) ===
In September 2014 Deptford Three Sided Football Club embarked on a new experiment in trialectics by establishing a formal league structure with five other teams from the local area. The inaugural teams involved in the league were Aesthetico Athletico, New Cross Irregulars 3FC, Philosophy Football Club, Polsky Budowlancy (now named Husaria), Strategic Optimists Football Club and, of course, Deptford Three Sided Football Club.[[Three sided football#cite note-17|[17]]] 

==== 2014-15 ====
The inaugural season ended on the 7th of June 2015 with New Cross Irregulars being awarded the trophy, having mathematically won the title in the penultimate game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nxi3fc.co.uk/2014-15-season/|title=2014-15 Season|date=2016-09-04|work=New Cross Irregulars|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2015-16 ====
The same six teams played in the 2015-16 season. It was decided on the final game of the season, with Husaria, Aesthetico Athletico and New Cross Irregulars 3FC playing each other in a match where all three teams could win the title. Defending champions NXI were taken out of contention early on, conceding 5 goals in total, and Husaria were crowned new champions courtesy of a single goal against Aesthetico.

NXI, Aesthetico and Strategic Optimists all ended in joint second place, a single point behind winners Husaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nxi3fc.co.uk/2015-16/|title=2015-16 Season|date=2016-09-04|work=New Cross Irregulars|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2016-17 ====
NXI reclaimed the league title in the penultimate game of the season on 07 May, 2017 with a win over Deptford and Aesthetico.

Up to this point Husaria still had a chance of defending their title, but came second in their May match to concede the point that handed the league to NXI.

=== Triball (London Bridge, South London) ===
In January 2017 the first season of the Triball 3SF league was established. Duplicating the Deptford points structure for the league table, Triball is played in a 4-a-side format between seven league teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triball.strikingly.com/#triball-league-table|title=Triball Football League|website=Triball Football League|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league also hosts a cup competition called the Triball Open Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triball.strikingly.com/#september-27th-2017-the-triball-open-cup|title=Triball Football League|website=Triball Football League|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournaments ==
On 31 October 2009, a three sided football competition was organised in [[Lyon]] during the [[Biennale d'art contemporain de Lyon]]. The subversive event was a confrontation of the non spectacular sense of the original game with the main title of the Biennale, Le Spectacle du Quoditidien. The manifestation took place in [[Stade Laurent Gérin]], [[Vénissieux]] and was organised by [[Pied La Biche]] association.[[Three sided football#cite note-2|[2]]]

In an event called "Thinking Football", aiming to reflect on the role of football in modern society, the [[Athletic de Bilbao]] Foundation organised among other things a three sided football championship taking place from October 2011 to April 2012 with 37 participant teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-three-teams-complete-during-a-three-sided-football-match-in-getxo-118781888.html|title=Stock Photo - Three teams complete during a|last=Limited|first=Alamy|website=Alamy|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition Matches ==
In August 2009, a three-sided football game was played in [[Alytus]] as part of the [[Art Strike]] events there. Stewart Home acted as referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d3fc.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/the-1516-season-starts-sunday-6th-sept/|title=The 15/16 Season starts Sunday 6th Sept|date=2015-09-01|website=d3fc|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]], a three-sided football game was played on 2 May 2010 in [[Haggerston Park]], with each team representing one of the main political parties. This match was organised by Whitechapel Gallery in conjunction with Philosophy Football FC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/3-sided-football-match/|title=3-Sided Football Match - Whitechapel Gallery|work=Whitechapel Gallery|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/leisure/highlights/8128186.Beautiful_game_played_in_three_sided_match/|title=Beautiful game played in three-sided match|website=Enfield Independent|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was won by Philosophy Football FC, representing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], who conceded no goals to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' 2 and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Lib Dems]]' 3.[[Three sided football#cite note-4|[4]]] Philosophy Football FC later organised and competed in the first ever three-sided football match to be played in Spain, on 7 May 2011, which was discussed by journalist [[Sid Lowe]] in the ''Guardian'''s football podcast.

The term '''Tirana derby''' refers to the [[local derby|local derbies]] in [[Tirana]] played between two of the three professional [[association football|football]] clubs [[KF Tirana]], [[FK Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo]] or [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani]]. It specifically refers to individual matches between the clubs, but can also be used to describe the general ongoing rivalry between the clubs, players and / or fans.

Tirana is the only city in the [[Albania]] hosting three professional football clubs. The only other Albanian city to host more than one professional football club is [[Vlora]], home of [[Flamurtari Vlorë|Flamurtari]] and [[KF Vlora]]. However, the two Vlora clubs hardly play head-to-head due to KF Vlora's common lower division status.

== Rivalries ==

===KF Tirana v Partizani===
{{main|KF Tirana–Partizani Tirana rivalry}}
The ''Big Derby'' is the name given to any match contested between [[KF Tirana]] and [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]] football clubs, the two biggest rivals in the capital-city [[Tirana]] of [[Albania]]. Matches between the 2 teams have a long history and have almost always made the first page of the news in the country, with high tensions between fans in stands and the players. Since 2008 however, Partzani's relegation, the derby faded away for a while until their return for the 2013-14 season. Since then the derby once again rose in importance.

KF Partizani have a historical advantage of 20 wins and 50 goals in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotbal.tv/matches/2008/12/07/albania/super-league/kf-partizani-tirana/kf-tirana/685563/head2head/|title=Derbys between 1997-present|author=|date=|website=fotbal.tv|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dinamo v KF Tirana===
{{main|Dinamo Tirana–KF Tirana rivalry}}
The rivalry between [[KF Tirana]] and [[FK Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]], is one of the longest currently running top-flight [[local derby|derbies]] in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotbal.tv/matches/2010/10/18/albania/super-league/kf-tirana/ks-dinamo-tirana/977760/head2head/|title=Derbys between 1990-present|author=|date=|website=fotbal.tv|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the most successful clubs from the city. KF Tirana dominates either historically, or during last 25 seasons against the Dinamo. However, they have equal ties in the Cup competition.

===Dinamo v Partizani===
The derby between [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani Tirana]] and [[FK Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]] has been contested numerous time and equally evokes strong emotions. As the two teams had varies fortunes recently, both period away from the top flight, the derby has risen in importance. As Dinamo were historically linked to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Albania)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and as Partizani were linked to the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] this fixture is often derogatorily referred to as "the communist derby".

[[File:United Hospitals Challenge Cup.png|thumb|United Hospitals Challenge Cup]]
The '''United Hospitals Challenge Cup''' is contested by the [[United Hospitals|six medical schools in London]] and is most notable for being the oldest rugby cup competition in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uhrugby.com/welcome.asp United Hospitals RFC - President's welcome] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502131348/http://uhrugby.com/welcome.asp |date=2 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1874 the [[United Hospitals RFC]] instituted a cup competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup, also known as the Inter-Hospital Challenge Cup. The first final was played on Wednesday 3 March 1875 at [[The Oval]], which had also been the site of England's first home rugby international three years earlier. The match predated by four years the first [[Calcutta Cup]] match and is the oldest cup competition in the game of rugby. The first final was contested by at 3.30pm by Guy's Hospital and St George's Hospital in front of 400 spectators. Guy's, wore an orange and blue kit, and kicked the game off, whilst their opponents wore green jersey, green shorts with brown socks. Guy's won but St George's got their revenge the next season. When this game was played matches were won by goals rather than points. A goal was a converted try, and tries themselves only value in the case of a draw in which case they would be counted up as the deciding factor. Guy's Hospital won the game by 1 Goal (a converted try) and 1 try to 2 tries. The records say that the three additional 'tries' were all defensive touch downs. The game was also notable for fielding 15 players per side at a time when all international matches, the Varsity Match, County matches and all other top level games were being played with 20 players per side and would continue to do so until 1877. In this regard, the United Hospitals RFC was a pioneer. With the exception of breaks for the two world wars of the twentieth century, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup has been played for without interruption since that first final.

The Royal Veterinary College was invited to join the competition for the first time after a vote was taken during the AGM on 13 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhrugby.com/uploads/4/5/5/2/4552444/agm-2008-uh-may.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416065317/http://www.uhrugby.com/uploads/4/5/5/2/4552444/agm-2008-uh-may.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 final took place at Richmond Athletic Ground. Mary's defeated Bart's and the London 28-6 in the 128th Cup Final. They reacquired the cup after a 2-year hiatus, making them the most successful club in the UH competition history, having won the cup 51 times (GKT, or constituents thereof, having won 50 times, and BL 24 times).

The 2015 UH Cup saw RUMS face defending champions Mary's, at Ealing Trailfinder's ground. RUMS had not reached the final in over a decade, and had not won since 1887. A hard-fought final, in front of a large support crowd from both medical schools, RUMS eventually emerged 20-6 winners. This broke RUMS' 128-year gap between last winning the cup, as the Middlesex hospital (before merging with UCH).
