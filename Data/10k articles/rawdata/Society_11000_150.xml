The '''1906 WSPU march''' on 19 February 1906 was the first march held in London to demand the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|right to vote for women in  the United Kingdom]]. Organized by [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Annie Kenney]] of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), the event saw around 300–400 women march through central London to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. It was held to coincide with the King's Speech and the [[State Opening of Parliament|opening of Parliament]].{{sfn|Purvis|2002|p=79}} 

Two hundred women from [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Bromley]], [[Canning Town]] and [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] in the East End marched to [[Caxton Hall]], near the Commons, from [[St. James's Park tube station]].{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=333}} There, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] heard there was no mention of votes for women in the King's Speech and led the women on another march to the Commons [[Strangers (Parliament of the United Kingdom)|Strangers' Entrance]]. Over the following two hours, the women were allowed to enter in groups of 20 to lobby their MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2004|p=334}}; {{harvnb|Van Wingerden|1999|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported the event on page 5: "Voteless Women. 3,000 [sic] Demonstrators March Behind a Red Banner. Smiling but Earnest."{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=334}}

Emmeline Pankhurst saw the march as the beginning of a militant women's suffrage movement.{{sfn|Van Wingerden|1999|p=75}} The women "were awake at last", she wrote. "They were prepared to do something that women had never done before—fight for themselves. Women had always fought for men, and for their children. Now they were ready to fight for their own human rights. Our militant movement was established."{{sfn|Pankhurst|1914|p=38}}

{{2007–2011 Belgian political crisis}}

The '''2007–2011 Belgian political crisis''' was a period of tense communal relations and [[political instability]] in [[Belgium]] rooted in the differing opinions on [[State reform in Belgium|state reform]], and in the continued existence of the controversial electoral district of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] (BHV). Parties from the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish Community]] are in general strongly in favour for a [[Devolution|devolution of powers]] to the communities and regions, and the splitting of the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde#BHV is declared unconstitutional|unconstitutional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Nl icon}}[http://www.gva.be/dekrant/experts/johndewit/vijftien-vragen-over-bhv.aspx Vijftien vragen over BHV] Gazet van Antwerpen, 27 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; BHV district, while French-speaking [[French Community of Belgium]] is generally in favour of retaining the status quo. After the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 elections]], the topics of public debt, deficit cuts and socio-economic reform were added to the debate, with most Flemish parties in favour of finding money by strongly reducing spending, whilst the proposals supported by most French-speaking parties also included a significant raise in taxes. The crisis came to an end in December 2011 with the inauguration of a [[Di Rupo Government|new federal government]] which agreed on partition of the BHV district and on policies aimed at tackling the economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/be/news/belgian-news/belgian-government-sworn-in-ending-18-month-crisis_193630.html|title=Belgian government sworn in, ending 18-month crisis|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=8 December 2011|work=[[Expatica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's continuing linguistic divide played a large part in the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/belgian-political-crisis-and-talk-of-linguistic-divisions-continue/a-2804788&lt;/ref&gt; Several times during the period Belgium was threatened to be [[Partition of Belgium|split up]] amid rising [[Flemish Movement|Flemish separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2007/10/belg-o03.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis broke out in the summer of 2007, following the electoral victory of the alliance of the [[Flemish Christian Democrats]] and the [[New Flemish Alliance]], who supported a wide-reaching state reform and the immediate split of BHV. After 194 days of often heated negotiations, parties finally succeeded in forming a new government. In December 2008, another crisis related to the [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis case]], erupted, again destabilising the country and resulting in the resignation of [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Belgian Prime Minister]] [[Yves Leterme]]. The new [[Herman Van Rompuy]]-led government brought a brief period of fragile stability, but ended when Van Rompuy left his office to become the first full-term [[President of the European Council]]. The succeeding [[Leterme II Government]] fell in April 2010 over the lack of progress on resolving the BHV issue.

New elections were held in June 2010, where the separatist and conservative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/belgium.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.de |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Flemish Alliance]] won a landslide victory in Flanders, while the pro-unity [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] won the elections in French-speaking Belgium. Due to the major differences between the two winning parties on a community and social-economic level, government negotiations and formation took a total of 541 days, breaking the world government formation record of 249 days, previously set by Iraq in 2010 &lt;ref name="Waterfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/8328926/Belgium-breaks-Iraqs-249-day-record-without-a-government.html|title=Belgium breaks Iraq's 249-day record without a government|last=Waterfield|first=Bruno|date=17 February 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110311013638/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/8328926/Belgium-breaks-Iraqs-249-day-record-without-a-government.html| archivedate= 11 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ten months record set by Lebanon in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Feb-15/247474-lebanon-announces-unity-government.ashx|title=Lebanon announces government of ‘national interest’|date=15 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September 2011 it was reported that Leterme aims to take up a new job as deputy secretary general of the [[OECD]] in 2012, although that it seemed to be unlikely at that time that he'd leave the post as the head of the [[caretaker government]] before the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/843/113617 |title=Belgian officials play down crisis, as caretaker PM opts to go |first=Andrew |last=Rettman |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=14 September 2011| accessdate= 17 October 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a new government was sworn in on 6 December 2011 with [[Elio Di Rupo]] as [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="DiRupo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/111206_oath |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20111207192549/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/111206_oath |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 December 2011 |title=New government sworn in at Laken Castle |publisher=FlandersNews.be |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 federal elections and aftermath==

===Federal elections===
{{Main|Belgian federal election, 2007}}
Of the Flemish parties, the alliance of [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&amp;V) and the [[New-Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) received an increased share of the vote from the previous election, held in 2003. The CD&amp;V/N-VA list was headed by [[Yves Leterme]], and became the largest political formation in Belgium, thus leading the coalition talks for a new government. The list campaigned heavily on the need for a far-reaching reform of the Belgian state.

In French-speaking Belgium, the liberal [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] managed to defeat the long-dominant [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS), although the PS remained strong.

===Formation negotiations===
{{Main|2007–2008 Belgian government formation}}
After the election, a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] coalition was proposed. Because of the differing views on the need for a state reform on both sides of the language border, it took the parties 196 days, i.e. over 6 months, following the election, to form an interim government. That set a record as the longest Belgian government formation, one that has since been broken by the 2010 formation.

===Verhofstadt III===
{{Main|Verhofstadt III Government}}
On 17 December 2007, incumbent [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]] was asked by the [[King of the Belgians]] [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] to start the formation of an [[interim government]] that would last until 23 March 2008, when Leterme would take over. Belgium's political uncertainty intensified when Yves Leterme was hospitalised on February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in the hospital for several days but it was soon made clear that his health would not prevent him from assuming premiership.

A first preliminary deal was reached on 25 February 2008. It was agreed that some powers over industrial policy and housing would be transferred from the federal government to the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7263246.stm |title=Deal eases Belgian political woes |date=25 February 2008 |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721223043/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7263246.stm |archivedate=21 July 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures would also be taken to strengthen inter-region cooperation; a second package of devolution changes would then be passed before the summer recess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/6360945.html|title='Wise men' strike devolution deal|date=26 February 2008| accessdate= 18 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leterme I===
{{Main|Leterme I Government}}
An official coalition agreement was signed on 18 March 2008. [[Yves Leterme]] was sworn in on 20 March 2008. In the late hours of 14 July 2008, after months of negotiations regarding the constitutional reform and electoral arrondissement Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde failed and with the deadline of 15 July 2008 within reach, Leterme offered the resignation of his cabinet to [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]]. After a series of consultations, King Albert II decided to reject Prime Minister Leterme's resignation on 17 July. The royal palace said that the King had asked two senior French-speaking politicians, [[Minister of State#Netherlands and Belgium|Ministers of State]] [[François-Xavier de Donnea]] ([[Mouvement Réformateur|MR]]) and [[Raymond Langendries]] ([[Centre démocrate humaniste|CdH]]), and the [[Minister-President]] of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]], [[Karl-Heinz Lambertz]] ([[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|SP]]), to establish how to start talks about institutional reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/de.redactie/politiek/1.340848 |title=Crisis in de Wetstraat |publisher=Deredactie.be |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7512975.stm |title=Belgian PM's resignation rejected |publisher=BBC News |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported back to the King on 19 September 2008 with a one-page report so that neither of the communities would back out of the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/de.redactie/politiek/1.382990 |title=deredactie.be - "Onderhandelen over grote staatshervorming" |publisher=Deredactie.be |date= |accessdate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few hours later, [[Didier Reynders]] angered the Dutch-speaking politicians with controversial statements and so sparked a crisis within the Flemish government. On 21 September 2008, the N-VA withdrew its parliamentary support for the federal government, saying that the 15-month-long negotiations had failed to result in state reform. The withdrawal of support plunged the country into another crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deredactie.be/cm/de.redactie/politiek/080921_nva_congres NVA zegt steun op] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921142009/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/de.redactie/politiek/080921_nva_congres |date=21 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure of the socialist and liberal coalition partners, the only N-VA minister in the Flemish government ([[Geert Bourgeois]]) resigned his post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deredactie.be/cm/de.redactie/politiek/080922_bourgeois_ontslag Bourgeois neemt ontslag] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923071618/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/de.redactie/politiek/080922_bourgeois_ontslag |date=23 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2008, Leterme again offered the resignation of the government to the king, who accepted the offer on 22 December. The resignation was offered after news broke out that the government had tried to intervene in the verdict of the Fortis case.

===Van Rompuy I===
{{Main|Van Rompuy Government}}
After the resignation of Leterme and his cabinet, the King consulted various dignitaries and party leaders. He then appointed [[Wilfried Martens]], a former prime minister and president of the [[European People's Party]], to consult the various political parties and pave the way to a new "emergency" cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/dehaene-ne-souhaite-pas-s-2008-12-22-676061.shtml |title=Wilfried Martens, l'" explorateur " à la recherche d'une sortie de crise |publisher=Lesoir.be |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general consensus is that a government should run until the regional and [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Belgium)|European Parliament elections]] in June 2009 or, if possible, until the next federal election in 2011. On 28 December, King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] gave [[Herman Van Rompuy]] the task of forming a new government, which would include the current ruling parties. Van Rompuy and [[Van Rompuy I Government|his government]] were sworn in on 30 December 2008.

===Leterme II===
{{Main|Leterme II Government}}
On 24 April 2010, the government of [[Yves Leterme]] (who had replaced Van Rompuy again when Van Rompuy became [[President of the European Council]]) fell over the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] issue.

==2010 federal elections and aftermath==

===Federal elections===
An [[Belgian federal election, 2010|early election]] was held on 13 June 2010, resulting in the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) winning most votes in the Flemish-speaking areas and the [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS) in French-speaking Belgium. Nationally the two parties were almost even with 27 seats for the N-VA and 26 for the PS, the remaining seats being split between ten other parties. Until 541 days after the elections, no agreement could be reached among the parties on a coalition to form a new government and during that period the country continued to be governed by an interim government. On 6 December 2011 the [[Di Rupo I Government]] was sworn in.&lt;ref name="DiRupo"/&gt;

===Formation negotiators===
{{Main|2010–2011 Belgian government formation}}
The various political parties had not succeeded in forming a new government for 541 days, which broke the 2007 record of the longest period without a government.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12170244 |title='Grow a beard for Belgium' appeal by actor Poelvoorde |publisher=BBC News |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113042738/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12170244 |archivedate=13 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period several people had made failed attempts to create an agreement, until [[Elio Di Rupo]] finally succeeded (in chronological order and all appointed by the King):
* [[Bart De Wever]] (Leader of [[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]]) as informateur: 17 June 2010 – 8 July 2010
* [[Elio Di Rupo]] (Leader of [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|PS]]) as pre-formateur: 9 July 2010 – 3 September 2010
* [[Danny Pieters]] ([[List of Presidents of the Belgian Senate|President of the Senate]]; N-VA) and [[André Flahaut]] ([[List of Presidents of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives|President of the Chamber of Representatives]]; PS) as mediators: 4 September 2010 – 5 October 2010
* De Wever as clarificator: 8 October 2010 – 18 October 2010

===Provisions and speculation on the possible partition of Belgium===
{{Main|Partition of Belgium}}
Towards the end of July 2011, as government formation had been dragging on for over a year, party leaders of the separatist [[Walloon Rally]] (which does not have any seats in parliament) have had talks with the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] party of French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialists]]. These talks resulted in that, in the event of the split with [[Flanders]], Wallonia could become the 28th [[Regions of France|region of France]]. A poll of the French daily newspaper [[Le Figaro]] suggests that around half of Walloons and around 66% of French Republic citizens favour this plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belgiumwatch.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/better-no-concessions-to-flanders-67-walloons-find/ | title=Better no concessions to Flanders 67% Walloons find | publisher= Belgium Watch | accessdate= 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Walloon parties have not been campaigning to become part of the [[French Republic]] as a solution to the political crisis but state that this would be the best outcome in the event of the [[partition of Belgium]], with the exception of the Walloon Rally who have been campaigning for partition and accession to the French Republic since 1968.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/news/belgium-separatism-movement-europe/ |title=Belgium sets standard for separatist contagion in Europe |publisher=RT News |date=2 August 2011| accessdate= 2 August 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian minister for Climate and Energy, [[Paul Magnette]], also suggested to incorporate Wallonia into Germany instead of France if the crisis in Belgium were to escalate. Although over 71,000 people on the Walloon-German border speak German as their first language, the vast majority of Walloons are French speakers. Thus arises the possibility that, if Wallonia had become part of France, the German-speaking towns might have been absorbed by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,724460,00.html | title=Belgischer Minister würde Wallonie an Deutschland angliedern | publisher= Spiegel Online | accessdate= 20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alternative Spring Break 2012 (8538779407).jpg|thumb|upright|Students on cleanup duty at [[Shenandoah River Raymond R. "Andy" Guest Jr. State Park]] in Virginia during an alternative spring break trip.]]
An '''alternative break''' is a trip where a group of college students (usually 10–12 per trip) engage in volunteer service, typically for a week. Alternative break trips originated with college students in the early 1980s as a counter to "traditional" spring break trips. These trips are usually led by 2 "site leaders" who are students that have already participated in an alternative break and have gone through extensive leadership training.

Alternative breaks may occur during students’ fall, winter, weekend, or summer school breaks. Each trip has a focus on a particular social issue, such as poverty, education reform, refugee resettlement, the environment, healthcare reform, mental health, immigration, animal care, and much more. Students learn about the social issues and then perform week-long projects with local non-profit organizations. Thus, students have the opportunity to connect and collaborate with different community partners.  Alternative breaks are also drug and alcohol-free experiences, with a heavy emphasis on group and individual reflection.

On the site, students provide necessary services and explore the culture and the history of the area. Students who participate in this program cultivate social responsibility, leadership, and lifelong learning; thereby fostering a generation of leaders committed to positive social change. Alternative breaks challenge students to critically think and react to problems faced by members of the communities they are involved with. Being immersed in diverse environments enables participants to experience, discuss, and understand social issues in a significant way.

The intensity of the experience increases the likelihood that participants will transfer their experience on-site back to their own communities even after the alternative break ends.

The aim of the experience is to contribute volunteer hours to communities in need and to positively influence the life of the alternative breaker.  Breakers are emboldened to take educated steps toward valuing and prioritizing their own communities in life choices such as recycling, donating resources, voting, etc.

Many breakers have returned to their college campuses to create a campus organization related to the social issue, have a deeper understanding and commitment to an academic path, execute a fundraiser for the non-profit organization they worked with, organize a letter writing campaign to members of Congress, volunteer in their local community, or commit to an internship or career within the non-profit sector.

== History ==
[[File:13-03-20 Alternative Spring Break - Asbury Park (Unedited) (52) (8576644464).jpg|thumb|left|[[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] students work during an Alternative Spring Break trip in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]].]]

In 1991, Michael Magevney and Laura Mann, two recent graduates who had been very involved in building a successful alternative break program at [[Vanderbilt University]], gained the support of then-Chancellor [[Joe B. Wyatt]] and founded a national nonprofit organization called Break Away:  The Alternative Break Connection.  Their purpose was to gather the resources and best practices for the alternative spring break programs that had been established on multiple campuses across the U.S.  Break Away began as a modest resource center for alternative breaks and continues to be the national organization dedicated to developing lifelong active citizenship through quality alternative break programs. Break Away's development and national growth was supported and facilitated by leveraging the national network of campus service programs built by the [[Campus Outreach Opportunity League]]. COOL's National Conference provided a great platform to engage college students interested or involved in alternative breaks from all over the nation.

Student-led initiatives, now known as alternative breaks, became more prevalent on college campuses in the 1980s and early 1990s "as part of an overall surge of interest in institutionalizing community service on college campuses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piacitelli|first1=Jill|journal=Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement|date=2003|volume=17|issue=2|pages=87–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than travel to a traditional spring break location, groups of students came together to form a new community that was immersed in education on social issues, service work, and reflection.

For the last two decades, there has been a consistent increase in the number of colleges and universities with alternative break programs. This growth accelerated in the mid-2000s, and has been attributed to two factors: 1) the institutionalization of volunteer service as an integral part of the college experience, 2) the overwhelming interest in service work along the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

== Motivations ==

•	Becoming active citizens &lt;www.alternativebreaks.org&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Interest in specific social issues addressed by trips&lt;br /&gt;
•	Further involvement in student body&lt;br /&gt;
•	Previous service experience&lt;br /&gt;
•	Lack of service experience&lt;br /&gt;
•	Word-of-mouth&lt;br /&gt;
•	Interest in new experiences&lt;br /&gt;
•	Desire to meet new people within university and external communities&lt;br /&gt;
•	Leadership opportunities (alternative breaks are overwhelmingly student-led)&lt;br /&gt;
•	College credit through curriculum-based alternative breaks&lt;br /&gt;
•	Less expensive than "traditional" spring breaks&lt;br /&gt;
•	Desire for experiences that will inform future career path&lt;br /&gt;
•	Resume building

== Components ==
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativebreaks.org Welcome to Break Away – The Alternative Break Connection!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Strong Direct Service:'' Should provide an opportunity for participants to engage in direct or “hands on” projects and activities that address unmet social needs, as determined by the community.

''Orientation:'' Alternative breakers learn about the purposes and goals of their community partners with which they will be working.

''Education:'' Breakers learn about the complexity of the social issue through reading materials, speaker panels, documentaries, and guest lecturers related to current trends and historical context. A strong educational foundation for the trip will contribute to a meaningful service experience.

''Training:'' Breakers are provided with adequate skills necessary to carry out service projects during their trip. This may include learning physical skills, such as construction or maintenance skills, as well as interpersonal communication, such as interacting with children, sensitivity training, working with people with disabilities, trail building, etc.

''[[Introspection|Reflection]]:'' During the trip participants process the service work as it connects to the broader social issue. Groups set aside time for reflection to take place individually and as a group. During reflection, site leaders and students discuss critical questions related to the service, themselves, and the world.

''Reorientation:'' After students return to campus, reorientation activities allow participants to talk about issues with others on campus, learn about local volunteer and civic involvement opportunities, and brainstorm other means to benefit their local community. Reorientation (the post-trip application of the experience) is the essential purpose of an alternative break – to provide a platform for participants to work towards lifelong active citizenship.

''Diversity and Social Justice:'' Strong alternative break programs include:  1) diverse representation of students from the campus community and 2)  studying the social issue by examining the social justice concepts of power, privilege, and oppression.

"The trouble around diversity, then, isn't just that people differ from one another.  The trouble is produced by a world organized in ways that encourage people to use difference to include or exclude, reward or punish, credit or discredit, elevate or oppress, value or devalue, leave alone or harass."  (Privilege, Power, and Difference, 2001, Allan G. Johnson)

''Alcohol &amp; Drug Free:'' Alternative breaks are alcohol- and drug-free.  Awareness of legality, liability, personal safety, and group cohesion addressed through training prior to the trip.

== Difference with "voluntourism" ==

“[[Voluntourism]]" is the integrated combination of voluntary service to a destination with the traditional elements of travel and tourism – arts, culture, geography, history, and recreation – while in the destination. (cite – voluntourism.org) Volunteer vacations are not alternative breaks because participants arrive as individuals with no prior preparation with educational components or group building.

Alternative breaks typically involve college students from the same institution, while most groups going on volunteer vacations will meet for the first time when they arrive at the location of the trip.

Alternative break groups meet and prepare for their experience up to six months in advance of their departure. During this preparation period, there is an emphasis on learning about the social issues addressed during the trip, learning about the community, becoming oriented with the mission and values of the organization, training for any skills they may need while on the trip, and team building. Some groups even do relevant service in their college communities prior to departure.

== Impact ==

Many students who return from an alternative break experience consider it a life changing event.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Alternative break alumni have reported changing their major, increasing their campus involvement, committing to continued community service, actively staying updated on social issues, and joining a service program post-graduation such as AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, or Teach for America. Many return to participate and lead alternative break programs throughout their time as students.

An impact analysis conducted in 2001 by Dr. Pushkala Raman and her Marketing Research Class at Florida State University in conjunction with Break Away revealed that there is overwhelming evidence to support the view that alternative breaks are "indeed contributing to the creating of active citizens." Some highlights of the study include the following:

•	Participants show stronger intentions of voting after participation&lt;br /&gt;
•	Research indicates that alternative break participants are inclined to increase the amount of time they dedicate to serving the community after an alternative break experience.

In 2002, Dr. Raman conducted another study measuring the satisfaction of nonprofit organizations that utilize alternative breakers. Her work produced the following insights:

•	100% of nonprofit organizations that responded and had hosted break groups agreed or strongly agreed that they benefited from the work done by alternative breakers.
•	100% of the same nonprofit organizations were interested in hosting alternative break groups again in the future.

[[Image:CPAS building.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University in Canberra]]
The '''Centre for the Public Awareness of Science''' is part of the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000 it became an accredited Centre for the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

==Work of the Centre==

As a [[UNESCO]] Centre, CPAS engages with [[science communication]] and communicators in the Pacific region and beyond.  In partnership with the [[UNESCO]] Pacific Office in [[Apia]], [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=36986&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt; CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations.  As well as running a science journalism workshop for [[Pacific Island]] journalists in 2001, CPAS  followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Pacific Science Communication Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] office in [[Jakarta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.id UNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; invited CPAS to join a mission to [[Cambodia]] to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with [[UNESCO]] ([[Apia]]) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific.

CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. 

Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in [[Fiji]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]. A joint teaching program is being developed with the [[National University of Singapore]]. In [[South Africa]], CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various [[South African]] science centres.

==Teaching, Outreach and Research==

With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of [[science communication]]. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php CPAS Academic Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113805/http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell [[Questacon]] Science Circus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/sqsc.html ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of [[science communication]] theory.

==History==

CPAS was launched by Professor [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/about/CPAS_launch.php CPAS Launch]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in [[Canberra]]. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into [[Questacon]] – The National Science and Technology Centre. [[Questacon]] was the brainchild of [[Mike Gore (physicist)|Michael Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike Prof. Michael Gore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from [[Shell Australia]].

Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris Prof. Chris Bryant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dean of Science at the [[Australian National University]], with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of [[science communication]]. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629085932/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program.

By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the [[Australian National University]] agreed to fund a Lectureship in [[Science Communication]]. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr [[Susan Stocklmayer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue Dr Susan Stocklmayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for [[science communication]].  The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today.

==Awards==

In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, [[Shell Australia]] and [[Questacon]] jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round Table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhert.com/ Business/Higher Education Round Table]&lt;/ref&gt; Award. The citation commends CPAS as “a university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.”  In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication.

In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

[[File:Monolito de la Piedra del Sol.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Aztec calendar stone]], also called the Sun Stone, on display at the [[National Museum of Anthropology]], [[Mexico City]]]]
The '''Aztec or Mexica calendar''' is the [[calendar]] system that was used by the [[Aztec]]s as well as other [[Pre-Columbian]] peoples of central [[Mexico]]. It is one of the [[Mesoamerican calendars]], sharing the basic structure of calendars from throughout ancient [[Mesoamerica]].

The calendar consisted of a 365-day calendar cycle called {{lang|nci|[[xiuhpōhualli]]}} (year count) and a 260-day ritual cycle called {{lang|nci|[[tōnalpōhualli]]}} (day count). These two cycles together formed a 52-year "century," sometimes called the "[[Calendar Round|calendar round]]". The {{lang|nci|xiuhpōhualli}} is considered to be the agricultural calendar, since it is based on the sun, and the {{lang|nci|tōnalpōhualli}} is considered to be the sacred calendar.

==Tōnalpōhualli==
The {{lang|nci|[[tōnalpōhualli]]}} ("day count") consists of a cycle of 260 days, each day signified by a combination of a number from 1 to 13, and one of the twenty day signs. With each new day, both the number and day sign would be incremented: 1 Crocodile is followed by 2 Wind, 3 House, 4 Lizard, and so forth up to 13 Reed, after which the cycle of numbers would restart (though the twenty day signs had not yet been exhausted) resulting in 1 Jaguar, 2 Eagle, and so on, as the days immediately following 13 Reed. This cycle of number and day signs would continue similarly until the 20th week, which would start on 1 Rabbit, and end on 13 Flower. It would take a full 260 days (13×20) for the two cycles (of twenty day signs, and thirteen numbers) to realign and repeat the sequence back on 1 Crocodile.

===Day signs===
The set of day signs used in central Mexico is identical to that used by [[Mixtec]]s, and to a lesser degree similar to those of other [[Mesoamerican calendars]]. Each of the day signs also bears an association with one of the four cardinal directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ciclos de tiempo y significado en los libros mexicanos del destino |trans-title=Cycles of time and meaning in the Mexican books of destiny |last=Hill Boone |first=Elizabeth |publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica |year=2016 |isbn=9786071635020 |location=[[Mexico City]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Manual de arqueología americana |trans-title=Manual of American Archeology |last=Beuchat |first=Henri |publisher=Daniel Jorro |year=1918 |location=[[Madrid]] |pages=349–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some variation in the way the day signs were drawn or carved. Those here were taken from the {{lang|la|[[Codex Magliabechiano]]}}.

Wind and Rain are represented by images of their associated gods, {{lang|nci|[[Ehēcatl]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|nci|[[Tlāloc]]|italic=no}} respectively.

Other marks on the stone showed the current world and also the worlds before this one. Each world was called a sun, and each sun had its own species of inhabitants. The Aztecs believed that they were in the Fifth Sun and like all of the suns before them they would also eventually perish due to their own imperfections. Every 52 years was marked out because they believed that 52 years was a life cycle and at the end of any given life cycle the gods could take away all that they have and destroy the world.

==={{lang|es|Trecenas}}===
The 260 days of the sacred calendar were grouped into twenty periods of 13 days each. Scholars usually refer to these thirteen-day "weeks" as {{lang|es|[[trecena]]s}}, using a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term derived from {{wikt-lang|es|trece}} "thirteen" (just as the Spanish term {{wikt-lang|es|docena}} "dozen" is derived from {{wikt-lang|es|doce}} "twelve"). The original [[Classical Nahuatl|Nahuatl]] term is not known.

Each {{lang|es|trecena}} is named according to the calendar date of the first day of the 13 days in that {{lang|es|trecena}}. In addition, each of the twenty {{lang|es|trecenas}} in the 260-day cycle had its own tutelary deity:

=={{lang|nci|Xiuhpōhualli}}==

{{quote |text=In ancient times the year was composed of eighteen months, and thus it was observed by the native people.  Since their months were made of no more than twenty days, these were all the days contained in a month, because they were not guided by the moon but by the days; therefore, the year had eighteen months.  The days of the year were counted twenty by twenty. |author={{lang|es|[[Diego Durán]]|italic=no}} }}

{{lang|nci|[[Xiuhpōhualli]]}} is the Aztec year ({{wikt-lang|nci|xihuitl}}) count ({{wikt-lang|nci|pōhualli}}). One year consists of 360 named days and 5 nameless ({{lang|nci|[[nēmontēmi]]}}). These 'extra' days are thought to be unlucky. The year was broken into 18 periods of twenty days each, sometimes compared to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] month. The [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word for moon is {{lang|nci|metztli}} but whatever name was used for these periods is unknown. Through Spanish usage, the 20-day period of the Aztec calendar has become commonly known as a {{lang|es|veintena}}.

Each 20-day period started on {{lang|nci|Cipactli}} (Crocodile) for which a festival was held. The eighteen {{lang|es|veintena}} are listed below. The dates are from early eyewitnesses; each wrote what they saw. {{lang|es|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]]|italic=no}}'s date precedes the observations of {{lang|es|Diego Durán|italic=no}} by several decades and is believed to be more recent to the surrender. Both are shown to emphasize the fact that the beginning of the Native new year became non-uniform as a result of an absence of the unifying force of {{lang|es|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}} after the Mexica defeat.

== Xiuhmolpilli ==
The ancient Mexicans counted their years by means of four signs combined with thirteen numbers, obtaining periods of 52 years,&lt;ref&gt;Tena, 2008: 103. There he shows us a table. &lt;/ref&gt; which are commonly known as ''Xiuhmolpilli'', a popular but incorrect name; the correct Nahuatl word for this cycle is '''Xiuhnelpilli'''.&lt;ref&gt;Tena, 2008:9.&lt;/ref&gt; We can see below the table with the current years:

==Reconstruction of the Solar calendar==
For many centuries scholars had tried to reconstruct the Calendar. The latest and more accepted version was proposed by Professor {{lang|es|Rafael Tena|italic=no}} of the {{lang|es|[[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]]}},&lt;ref&gt;The Mexica Calendar and the Chronography, Rafael Tena. INAH-CONACULTA. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; based on the studies of {{lang|es|Sahagún|italic=no}} and {{lang|es|Alfonso Caso|italic=no}} of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. His correlation confirms that the first day of the Mexica year was February 13 of the old [[Julian calendar]] or February 23 of the current [[Gregorian calendar]].
Using the same count, it has been verified the date of the birth of {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli}}, the end of the year and a cycle or "Tie of the Years," and the [[New Fire Ceremony]], day-sign {{lang|nci|1 Tecpatl}} of the year {{lang|nci|2 Acatl}},&lt;ref&gt;Crónica Mexicayotl, Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc p 36&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to the date [[February 22]].

'''Chhetri''' ('''Kshetri''', '''Kshettri''', '''Kshetry''' or '''Chhettri'''), ({{lang-ne|क्षेत्री}}; [[IAST]]: ''Kṣetrī'') historically called '''Kshettriya''' or '''Kshetriya''', are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers of [[Khas people|Khas]] community.{{sfn|Lawoti|2005|p=91}}&lt;ref name=PON&gt;{{cite book|title=People of Nepal|first=Dor Bahadur |last=Bista |authorlink=Dor Bahadur Bista |edition=4 |publisher=Ratna Pustak Bhandar |year=1980 |pages=2–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NiIKAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chhetri was a caste of administrators, governor and military elites in medieval [[Khasa kingdom|Khas Kingdom]] and [[Gorkha Kingdom]] (later unified [[Kingdom of Nepal]]).{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=20-21}} The nobility of [[Gorkha Kingdom]] were mainly based from Chhetri families and they had a strong presence in civil administration affairs.{{sfn|Pahari|1995|p=632}} The bulk of [[Prime Minister of Nepal|Prime Ministers of Nepal]] before [[Revolution of 1951|democratization of Nepal]] belonged to this caste as a result of old Gorkhali aristocracy. Gorkha-based aristocratic Chhetri families were [[Pande dynasty]], [[Basnyat dynasty]], [[Thapa dynasty]] and Kunwars ([[Rana dynasty]] &amp; other Kunwars).

Khas Chhetris (referred as '''Khas Rajputs'''{{sfn|Hitchcock|1978|p=116}}) were traditionally considered a division of the Khas people with [[Khas Brahmin]] (commonly called Khas Bahun).{{sfn|Hitchcock|1978|pp=116-119}} They make up 16.6% of Nepal's population according to the [[2011 Nepal census]], making them the most populous caste or [[ethnic groups in Nepal|ethnic community in Nepal]].&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; Chhetris speak an [[Indo-Aryan language|Indo-Aryan]] [[Nepali language]] (''[[Khas language|Khas-Kura]]'') as mother tongue.{{sfn|Dhungel|1998|p=5}}{{sfn|Lawoti|2005|p=91}} 
==Etymology &amp; Background==
Chhetri is considered a direct derivative of the Sanskrit word ''[[Kshatriya]]''.{{sfn|Burghart|1984|p=119}}{{sfn|Gurung|1996|p=33}} According to the 1854 Legal Code (''Muluki Ain'') of Nepal, Chhetris are the social group among the [[Upanayana|sacred thread bearers]] (''Tagadhari'') and ''[[Dvija|twice-born people]]'' of the [[Hindu]] tradition.{{sfn|Sherchan|2001|p=14}}&lt;ref&gt;Gurung, H. (2005). Social exclusion and Maoist insurgency. Paper presented at National Dialogue Conference on ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, Kathmandu, 19–20 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all Chhetris are Hindu.{{sfn|Dhungel|1998|p=8}} 

==History==
[[File:Bamshidhar Kalu Pande.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kalu Pande]] wearing [[Khukuri]], a [[Pande family|Pande Chhetri]] aristocrat; [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]] (Prime Minister and Army Chief) of [[Gorkha Kingdom]].]]
They are thought to be connected to the [[Khasas]] mentioned in the ancient Indian literature and the medieval [[Khasa kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Pradhan1984"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kumar Pradhan |title=A History of Nepali Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdRjAAAAMAAJ |year=1984 |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern history of Nepal, Chhetris played a key role in the [[Unification of Nepal]], providing the core of the [[Gurkha|Gorkhali]] army of the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=Faces/&gt; [[Bir Bhadra Thapa]] was a [[Thapa]] of Chhetri group{{sfn|Regmi|1995|p=44}} and leading Bharadar during [[Unification of Nepal]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=22}} His grandson [[Bhimsen Thapa]] became [[List of Prime Ministers of Nepal|Mukhtiyar (Prime Minister) of Nepal]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=22}} [[Swarup Singh Karki]], a leading politician and military officer, belonged to Chhetri family.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=142}} [[Abhiman Singh Basnyat]] of [[Basnyat dynasty]] and [[Damodar Pande]] of [[Pande dynasty]] were both members of Chhetri caste.{{sfn|Regmi|1975|p=73}} [[Jung Bahadur Rana]], founder of [[Rana dynasty]] also belonged to the Chhetri community.{{sfn|Adhikari|2015|p=120}}

[[File:Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bhimsen Thapa]], a leading Chhetri [[Mukhtiyar]] (Prime Minister).]]
During the monarchy, Chhetris continued to dominate the ranks of the [[Government of Nepal|Nepalese government]], [[Nepalese Army]], [[Nepal Police|Nepalese Police]] and administration.&lt;ref name=Faces&gt;{{cite book|title=Faces of Nepal |first=Harka B. |last=Gurung |publisher=Himal Books |year=1996 |pages=1–33, ''passim'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tSBAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chhetri noble families===
[[File:Abhiman Singh Basnyat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abhiman Singh Basnyat]], a [[Basnyat family|Basnyat Kshetri]] [[Mulkaji]] (Prime Minister)]]
The most prominent feature of Nepalese Chhetri society has been the ruling [[Shah dynasty]] (1768–2008){{refn|group=note|Shah monarchs were placed among [[Thakuri]] caste instead of Chhetri.{{sfn|Pahari|1995|p=631}}}}, the [[Rana dynasty|Rana Prime Ministers]] (1846–1953), [[Pande family]], [[Thapa family]], [[Basnyat family]],{{sfn|Pahari|1995|p=632}}. that marginalized the monarchy, and the Chhetri presence in the armed forces, police, and [[Government of Nepal]]. In traditional and administrative professions, Chhetris were given favorable treatment by the [[Kingdom of Nepal|royal government]].&lt;ref name=Burbank&gt;{{cite book|title=Nepal |series=Cultures of the World |first=Jon |last=Burbank |edition=2 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2002 |isbn=0-7614-1476-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaWLU6Blh_sC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHN&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural History of Nepal |first1=Bhadra Ratha |last1=Bajracharya |first2=Shri Ram |last2=Sharma |first3=Shiri Ram |last3=Bakshi |publisher=Anmol Publications |year=1993 |isbn=81-7041-840-2 |pages=286–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lELMFa9yZqsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chhetri and premiership===
The nobility of [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] were mainly from Chhetri families and they had a strong presence in civil administration affairs.{{sfn|Pahari|1995|p=632}} All of the [[Prime Minister of Nepal]] between 1768 to 1950 were Chhetris with the exception of [[Ranga Nath Poudyal]], being a Brahmin.{{sfn|Raj|1996|p=5}} These number varied after the [[Revolution of 1951|democratization of Nepal]]. Between 1951 to 1997, out of the 16 Prime Ministers of Nepal, 5 of them were Chhetris.{{sfn|Gurung|1998|p=129}}

==Military achievements==
[[File:Bir Shamsher JBR.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bir Shamsher JBR]], a [[Rana family|Rana Kshetri]] [[Maharaja]], and Prime Minister and C-in-C of Nepal]]
Chhetri had dominated high military positions and monopolized the military force at the times of Chhetri autocratic administrators like PM [[Bhimsen Thapa]] and PM [[Jung Bahadur Rana]]. There were 12 [[Basnyat family|Basnyat]]s, 16 [[Pande family|Pande]]s, 6 [[Thapa family|Thapa]]s and 3 [[Rana dynasty|Kunwar]] officers totalling to 51 Chhetri officers in the year 1841&amp;nbsp; A.D.{{sfn|Adhikari|2015|p=120}} The most prominent officers at [[Shah dynasty|Shah administration]] were the [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kazis]] which had control over civil and military functions like a Minister and Military officer combined. [[Rana Jang Pande]], the leader of Pande faction, was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Nepal|Prime Minister of Nepal]] in 1841&amp;nbsp; A.D.{{sfn|Joshi|Rose|1966|p=27}} which might have caused large Pande officers at 1841. After the rise [[Rana dynasty]](Kunwars), the number changed to 10 [[Basnyat family|Basnyat]]s, 1 [[Pande family|Pande]]s, 3 [[Thapa family|Thapa]]s and 26 [[Rana dynasty|Kunwar]] officers totaling to 61 Chhetri officers in the year 1854&amp;nbsp; A.D.{{sfn|Adhikari|2015|p=120}}

Chhetris dominated the position of the senior officers of the Nepali Army comprising 74.4% of total senior officers in 1967. Similarly, Chhetris composed of 38.1%, 54.3% and 55.3% of the senior officers in the year 2003, 2004 and 2007 respectively.{{sfn|Adhikari|2015|p=123}}

The 2011 Nepal census recorded Chhetris as the largest [[Hinduism in Nepal|Hindu]] adherents in the nation with 43,65,113 people which is 99.3% of total Chhetri population.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; Those Chhetri who follow Hinduism may also follow Buddhism. The ancient religion of the Chhetri is Masto which uses nature worship and can still be seen in western Nepal's Karnali district and in India's [[Gorkhaland]]. In Nepal's hill districts the Chhetri population rises to 41% compared to 31% [[Brahmin]] and 27% other castes. This greatly exceeds the Kshatriya portion in most regions with predominantly Hindu populations.&lt;ref name=CBS1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.np/Population/Monograph/Chapter%2003%20%20Social%20Composition%20of%20the%20Population.pdf |title=Chapter 3.

As per the [[Public Service Commission (Nepal)|Public Service Commission]] of Nepal, [[Bahun|Brahmins]] (33.3%) and Chhetris (20.01%) were two largest caste group to obtain governmental jobs in the fiscal year 2017-18 even though 45% governmental seats are reserved for women, indigenous groups, [[Madhesi people|Madhesis]], [[Dalit]]s, people with disability and those from the backward regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-10-16/brahmins-and-chhetris-land-most-government-jobs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==

'''Corobicí''' is an extinct [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]] [[lect]] of Costa Rica. Many authors consider it a dialect of Guatuso; others consider it (or at least the words which are claimed to be recorded in it) as [[Rama language|Rama]]. 

Mason considered it a variety of the [[Guatuso language]] in a "Rama-Corobici" subfamily of Chibchan. The 1950 ''Handbook of South American Indians'' agreed that Corobici was Guatuso, but not with the subfamily classification, saying "Guatuso, with its variety Corobici or Corbesi, and Rama with its dialect Melchora, are obviously very different from each other and from other Central American Chibchan languages, and Mason (1940) was evidently in error in making a Rama-Corobici subfamily." Voegelin and Voegelin also consider it a variety of Guatuso. Tozzer considers the Guatuso descendants of the Corobici, whereas Samuel Kirkland Lothrop writes that "It is generally assumed that the Rama were once a tribe identical in language and speech with the Corobici." Constenla writes that the extant "small sample of" Corobici is actually "words from the dialect of Rama that was spoken in the region of Upala, Costa Rica, up to the 1920s. Really, not a single word of the language of the Corobicies (an extinct group) was recorded."

'''Craig Vincent Smith''' (April 25, 1945 – March 16, 2012) was an [[Americans|American]] musician, songwriter and actor. He began his career in the 1960s playing pop and folk music and appearing on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''. After experimenting with drugs while travelling on the [[hippie trail]], he suffered mental health problems which worsened over time. He released two solo albums, ''Apache'' and ''Inca'', in the early 1970s under the names '''Maitreya Kali''' and '''Satya Sai Maitreya Kali'''. After spending nearly three years in prison for assaulting his mother, he spent the majority of the next 35 years homeless.

==Early and personal life==
Smith was born in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name = "Stax13"&gt;Stax, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Charles "Chuck" Smith and Marguerite "Carole" Smith (née Lundquist).&lt;ref name = "Stax15"&gt;Stax, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a descendant of gospel songwriter [[Charles H. Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p, 14&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of Swedish and German descent.&lt;ref name = "Stax15"/&gt; Smith had two older brothers and one younger sister.&lt;ref name = "Stax13"/&gt; Chuck Smith had worked as a manager at the Jade Room, a nightclub owned by Larry Potter, and was known by the stage name Chuck Barclay.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After World War Two he worked as a welder and a salesman.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck died in 1978, aged 64, from a stroke, and Carole died in 1998, aged 82, from pulmonary disease.&lt;ref name = "Stax205"&gt;Stax, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith attended [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Grant High School]], becoming class president and being on the school gymnastics team.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in June 1963, and turned down a number of offers from colleges in order to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1963–1966: the Good Time Singers===
In August 1963 Smith was recruited by [[Michael Storm]] and Tom Drake (who had performed together as the Other Singers) to join the Good Time Singers, a band formed to replace [[the New Christy Minstrels]] on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1963 to January 1964 Smith and Storm also performed shows with [[Gordon MacRae|Gordon]] and [[Sheila MacRae]], supported by their daughters [[Heather MacRae|Heather]] and [[Meredith MacRae|Meredith]].&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The Good Time Singers released their debut self-titled album in January 1964,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and their second album ''One Step More'' in October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In between the albums they had embarked on a 17-city tour.&lt;ref&gt;Stax. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time Smith began songwriting, and he wrote a song called "Christmas Holiday", which was recorded by [[Andy Williams]] for his 1965 album ''[[Merry Christmas (Andy Williams album)|Merry Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; As the Good Times Singers' was ending, Smith and fellow bandmember Lee Montgomery intended to form a new duo called Craig &amp; Lee, but Smith had to pull out after successfully auditioning for a new ABC television show,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; called ''The Happeners''.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; Smith had previously unsuccessfully auditioned for ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot for ''The Happeners'' was filmed in November 1965.&lt;ref name = "Stax67"&gt;Stax, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The Good Times Singers' contract for ''The Andy Williams Show'' was not renewed past 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===1966–1967: ''The Happeners'' and Chris &amp; Craig===
After a successful audition process, Smith won the role of Alan Howard on ''The Happeners''.&lt;ref name = "Stax67"/&gt; The show was to be directed by [[David Greene (director)|David Greene]],&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; and was a mix of acting and singing, set in New York and based on the fictional eponymous folk trio.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; However, ABC declined to pick up the show following the pilot episode.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and his ''The Happeners'' co-star Chris Ducey decided to form a musical duo called Chris &amp; Craig.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; They moved into an apartment together and began writing songs.&lt;ref name = "Stax73"&gt;Stax, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; They signed to [[Capitol Records]], recording a number of demos throughout the summer of 1966.&lt;ref name = "Stax74"&gt;Stax, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Their first single, "Isha", was written by Ducey and released in July 1966.&lt;ref name = "Stax74"/&gt; Originally an acoustic duo,&lt;ref name = "Stax73"/&gt; during their later 1966 sessions they began experimenting with a full band,&lt;ref&gt;Stax pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1966 they played a show supporting [[the Mothers of Invention]] with such a full band, with Smith and Ducey playing electric guitars.&lt;ref name = "Stax76"&gt;Stax, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout late 1966 and early 1967 the duo continued to write and record more songs, but they were never released by the label.&lt;ref name = "Stax76"/&gt; In 1967 Smith befriended [[Gábor Szabó]] and [[the Beach Boys]], unsuccessfully offering to write songs for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1967 Chris &amp; Craig began playing with a permanent backing band.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Through their friendship with [[Michael Nesmith]] of the Monkees, they hired [[Jerry Perenchio]] as their manager.&lt;ref name = "Stax88"&gt;Stax, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; They changed their name to the Penny Arcade, shortly becoming the Penny Arkade for trademark reasons.&lt;ref name = "Stax88"/&gt;

===1967–1968: the Penny Arkade===
Nesmith began producing Smith and Ducey, initially pairing them with [[John London]] (bass) and Johnny Raines (drums).&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; They were eventually replaced by [[Donald F. Glut]] on bass (who had appeared in an earlier incarnation of the band) and Bobby Donaho on drums.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; While the band worked on their own material, Smith continued to write songs, including "Salesman" for the Monkees,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; and "Hands of the Clock" and "Lazy Sunny Day" for Heather MacRae.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was also credited as co-producer for the songs, alongside [[Bob Thiele]].&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote "[[Holly (song)|Holly]]" for Williams.&lt;ref name = "Stax120"&gt;Stax, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Nesmith took the band into a studio to record their album.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; One of the songs written at this time by Smith was "Country Girl", which was later recorded and released by [[Glen Campbell]] for his ''[[Try a Little Kindness]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The album never materialised, but some of the songs were collected and released as ''Not the Freeze'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; After a bad review of one of their live shows, the band decided to concentrate on writing and recording songs.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1968 they unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of house band on the TV show ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1968 Smith and his father went into business together, running a bar called the Buckeye Inn.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1968 Smith was associating with the [[Manson Family]], and exploring an interest in Eastern philosophy, particularly [[Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Smith eventually left the Penny Arkade and decided to go travelling.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; The band continued without Smith until 1969, renamed as the Armadillo and with Bob Arthur as a replacement guitarist.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 135–137&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968: travelling to Asia===
After previously smoking small amounts of [[marijuana]] with friends,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Smith began experimenting with [[LSD]] in 1968.&lt;ref name = "Stax120"/&gt; During his travels Smith took LSD on a "regular" basis,&lt;ref name = "Stax126"&gt;Stax, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; and he smoked "copious amounts of [[hashish]]" while in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name = "Stax128"&gt;Stax, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Smith decided to travel to India alone, with just a guitar and a backpack.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; He set off to join the [[hippie trail]], arriving in Turkey in October 1968, possibly via Austria and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Smith met fellow Western travellers (an Irishman and two American women) in Istanbul, and they set off together in a VW van, intending to drive to Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; After the van broke down, they hitched a ride in a lorry transporting olive oil,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; before taking a bus to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; They passed through Afghanistan,&lt;ref name = "Stax126"/&gt; with Smith deciding to leave his companions for a few days in [[Kandahar]] while they travelled on to [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name = "Stax128"/&gt; Smith never joined them in Kabul; when his companions returned to Kandahar a few months later, they heard rumours that he had "gone crazy", running through the market with a knife threatening people, and then disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; It later became apparent that after threatening a market vendor, Smith had been beaten close to death and robbed, and possibly kidnapped and raped.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Smith possibly spent some time in an Afghan insane asylum,&lt;ref name = "Stax130"&gt;Stax, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; where he is thought to have developed acute [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Our Existence 2018"&gt;The sleevenotes from the album, ''Love is Our Existence'' (Maitreya Apache Music, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known if Smith ever reached India, although he and his travelogue claims he did visit India and reconnected with the Maharishi and went to Nepal.&lt;ref name = "Stax130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Our Existence 2018"/&gt;

===1969–1970: return to United States and travelling to South America===
Smith returned to the United States in late 1968 or early 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; initially living back with his parents.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; He was possibly institutionalized and medicated for a short period.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage he was using the name "Maitreya Kali",&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; which he intended to become his legal name,&lt;ref name = "Stax141"&gt;Stax, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; although this never happened until 1971.&lt;ref name="Our Existence 2018"/&gt; He continued to receive royalty checks from his historical songwriting for Williams and Campbell, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; After his girlfriend left him, Smith decided to travel to South America, spending time in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, and the Galapagos Islands of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from South America, Smith reunited with his girlfriend, and they became engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; When the engagement ended, Smith ripped up the wedding dress his fiancée had chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Following another brief re-connection, the relationship ended for good when Smith violently threatened one of her male friends.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–1971: deterioration in mental health===
Smith claimed to have mystical powers,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; and thought he was a messiah.&lt;ref name = "Stax141"/&gt; He prophesied that he would be "King of the World" by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to be a reincarnation of Jesus, Buddha, and Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; As his erratic and bizarre behavior became more pronounced, such as claiming voices were telling him to kill people, his friends started to ignore him.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; One friend eventually had to obtain a restraining order against Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; His appearance became more and more unkempt, with long hair and a wild beard.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, he shaved his head and beard off, and dressed in robes, his appearance comparable to a Buddhist monk, although his hair and beard would later grow back.&lt;ref name="Our Existence 2018"/&gt;  He visited Heather and Sheila MacRae in Miami, and was asked to leave by Sheila's new husband after he woke up to find Smith standing over their bed with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Heather saw him again in Los Angeles in 1972, when he "looked really scary [...] just totally looked insane, and would say weird things."&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–1972: ''Apache'' and ''Inca''===
Smith wrote two solo albums ''Apache'' and ''Inca'' in 1971, which were self-released in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; In the liner notes to both albums, Smith claims to have played every instrument.&lt;ref name = "Stax167"&gt;Stax, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The liner notes as a whole have been described as "bizarre [and] rambling",&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and display his belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apache'' was released on his own 'Akashic Records',&lt;ref name = "Stax167"/&gt; and features three songs from the Penny Arkade recording sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inca'' was released a few months after ''Apache'', in the summer of 1972,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; not as a standalone album but as a double gatefold with ''Apache'' on his new 'United Kingdom of America Records' label.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Apache'', ''Inca'' also features songs from the Penny Arkade recording sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The albums were mainly distributed to Smith's friends or sold on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===1973–1976: prison===
After the albums were released, Smith sold his car with the intention of going to Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; His mental health problems continued, such as suggesting to a friend that they fight to the death using samurai swords.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a small black spider tattooed in the middle of his forehead in 1972 or 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1973, Smith attacked his mother at the family home.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; An attempted murder charge was not established,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; and following a psychiatric examination, he pleaded 'no contest' to a charge of assault.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced in November 1973 to six months to life, the maximum sentence for the offence, and the Judge suggested intense medical and psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He began his sentence at the [[California Institution for Men]], before transferring to the [[Deuel Vocational Institution]] in December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred again, to the [[California Men's Colony]], in February 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted parole at the fourth attempt, and was released from prison in June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

===1977–2012: later years and death===
Suzannah Jordan, the third member of ''The Happeners'' trio, ran into Smith in LA in 1977; he was homeless but did not display any mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; He has been drifting in and out of mental hospitals until the mid-1980s when funding was cut, and would then spend the next years homeless.&lt;ref name="Our Existence 2018"/&gt;  He also had various run-ins with the law.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 208–210&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 or 1982 he saw another old friend and told her he had been recording music.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; He has been indeed recording music, according to Mike Stax, as late as the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/living-writers/stax/] By Frank Uhle, "Living Writers - Mike Stax". [[University of Michigan]] 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the 1994 song "Waves", which was released on the 2018 CD version of the album Love is Our Existence.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Smith. ''Love is Our Existence'' (Maitreya Apache Music, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2000s his "ramblings" had moved from Eastern philosophy/his Maitreya Kali persona to aliens.&lt;ref name = "Stax205"/&gt; Smith died on March 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; His family declined to collect his ashes,&lt;ref&gt;Stax, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; and they were eventually collected by journalist Mike Stax.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''criminal stereotype of African Americans in the United States''' is an [[ethnic stereotype]] according to which [[African American]] males in particular are stereotyped to be dangerous criminals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun L. Gabbidon|Gabbidon, Shaun L.]] (ed.); Greene, Helen Taylor (ed.); Young, Vernetta D. (ed.). (2001).

==African Americans and crime statistics==
In 2016 92% of interacial crimes in the US were committed by African Americans against whites but African Americans are most likely to be overrepresented in arrests. For example, in 1993, African Americans comprised 31 percent of total arrests yet constituted 12 percent of the population. A study found that in 1979, 80% of the racial disparity in prison populations was accounted for by African Americans committing more crime, but by 2008, another study by [[Michael Tonry]] and Matthew Melewski found that this percentage had decreased to 61%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=19 August 2011|title=Addressing Racial Disparities in Incarceration|journal=The Prison Journal|volume=91|issue=3 Suppl|pages=87S–101S|doi=10.1177/0032885511415227|last1=Mauer|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incarceration for violent crimes ===
In 1994, African Americans accounted for between 45 percent and 50 percent of crimes for murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In general, African Americans are approximately six times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes than are whites. African Americans are also most overrepresented in robbery in 1993, comprising 62 percent of arrestees. African Americans accounted for 52.5% of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with whites 45.3% and "Other" 2.2%. The offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than whites while blacks account for less than 15% of people living in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf|title=Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008|last=Cooper|first=Alexia|year=2012|isbn=1249573246|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homicides-fall-to-lowest-rate-in-four-decades-133967273.html|title=Homicides Fall to Lowest Rate in Four Decades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incarceration for drug related crimes ===
For drug related offenses, from 1965 through the early 1980s, African Americans were approximately twice as likely as whites to be arrested. However, with the [[War on Drugs]] in the 1970s, African American arrest rates skyrocketed, while white arrest rates increased only slightly. By the end of the 1980s, African Americans were more than five times more likely than whites to be arrested for drug-related offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/ucrdata/|title=UCR Statistics|last=Department of Justice|first=|date=1993|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumstein argues that as national self-report data showed that drug use was actually declining among both African Americans and Whites, it is highly unlikely that these race differences in arrest rates represent "real" patterns of drug use. Instead these crime statistics reflect the government's targeting of only specific types of drug use and trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumstein|first=Alfred|year=1993|title=Making Rationality Relevant|url=|journal=Criminology|volume=31|pages=|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1993.tb01119.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although the "black drug user" stereotype is heavily associated with young African Americans, a recent survey using self-reported data found African American young people less likely to use illegal drugs than other racial groups in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/study-whites-more-likely-to-abuse-drugs-than-blacks|title=Study: Whites More Likely to Abuse Drugs Than Blacks &amp;#124; TIME.com|last=Szalavitz|first=Maia|date=2011-11-07|publisher=Healthland.time.com|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelle Alexander]] furthers the argument that the disproportionate mass incarceration of African Americans in drug-related offenses is caused by racial bias within the criminal justice system, terming this phenomenon as "[[The New Jim Crow]]", in a book of the same name. Alexander claims that racial beliefs and stereotypes as a direct result of a media saturated with images of black criminals have obviously and predictably created a sharp disparity in the rates at which blacks and whites are subject to encounters with law enforcement.

=== Statistics and self-reporting ===
Scholars have argued that these official arrest statistics do not fully reflect actual criminal behavior as the criminal stereotype that African Americans hold influences the decisions to make arrests. Specifically, because the stereotype of African American is pervasive and embedded in society, police officers unconsciously believe that African Americans are dangerous and are therefore more likely to arrest African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jail: Managing the Underclass in American Society|last=Irwin|first=John|publisher=University of California Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0520277342|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, [[Self-report study|self-reporting]] crime statistics have been used to overcome the criticism that the official arrest statistics are biased. Many studies found little or no differences in self-reported offending among juveniles of different racial and ethnic group, with some scholars suggesting that [[Institutional racism|institutionalized racism]] within the criminal justice system is the cause for the disproportionate arrest rates of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampson et al.|first=|year=1997|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Crime and Criminal Justice in the United States|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3226952/Sampson_RacialEthnicDisparities.pdf?sequence=2|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hindelang found that black males were least likely to self-report offenses recorded by the police, with 33 percent of total offenses and 57 percent of serious offenses known to police not being self-reported by African American males,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hindelang|first=Michael|year=1981|title=Variations in Sex-Race-Age-Specific Incidence Rates of Offending|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=46|pages=|via=|doi=10.2307/2095265}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting some caution in concluding that self reported crime statistics accurately portray the actual rate of crime behavior.

==History==
According to some scholars, the stereotype of African Americans males as criminals was first constructed as a tool to "discipline" and control slaves during the time of [[slavery in the United States]]. For instance, Amii Barnard alleges that out of fear of the [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] staging a rebellion, slaveholders sought to spread the stereotype that African American males were dangerous criminals who would rape the "innocent" and "pure" white women if they had the opportunity to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Amii|year=1993|title=Application of critical race feminism to the anti-lynching movement: Black women's fight against race and gender ideology|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1kc308xf|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The African-American atlas: Black history and culture—An illustrated reference|last=Asante et al.|first=|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=978-0028649849|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law introduced in Pennsylvania in 1700 illustrates the fear of a dangerous African American man within the slaveholding society- it mandated that should a black man attempt to rape a White woman, the perpetrator will be castrated or punished to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The statutes at large of Pennsylvania from 1682 to 1801|publisher=State of Pennsylvania|year=1896|isbn=|location=Harrisburg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter et al. argues that this criminal stereotype contributed to [[lynching in the United States]] that mostly targeted African American males in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter et al.|first=|year=2017|title=You Can’t Fix What You Don’t Look At: Acknowledging Race in Addressing Racial Discipline Disparities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0042085916660350|journal=Urban Education|volume=52|pages=|via=SAGE|doi=10.1177/0042085916660350}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ida B. Wells]], the well-known anti-lynching activist published the pamphlet entitled the "Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases" from 1892-1920 reporting that contrary to the notion that lynchings occurred because African American males had sexually abused or attacked white women, fewer than 30% of reported lynchings even involved the charge of rape. She also followed up with an editorial that suggested that, most sexual liaisons between black men and white women were consensual and illicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gildedage.lib.niu.edu/wellspamphlets|title=The Anti-Lynching Pamphlets of Ida B.

According to [[Marc Mauer]] however, although African Americans have been consistently stereotyped as "biologically flawed" individuals who have a general tendency towards crime, the depiction of African Americans as criminals became more threatening only in the 1970s and early 1980s- with the evolution of the stereotype of African American males as "petty thieves" to "ominous criminal predators".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race to incarcerate|last=Marc|first=Mauer|publisher=The New Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-59558-022-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Melissa Hickman Barlow argued that the perception of African American males as criminals was so entrenched in society that she said “talking about crime is talking about race”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlow|first=Melissa|year=1998|title=Race and the Problem of Crime in 'Time' and 'Newsweek' Cover Stories, 1946 to 1995|journal=Social Justice|volume=25|pages=149–183|jstor=29767075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005 and 2015, the gap in the incarceration rate between blacks and whites declined while still remaining high. The rate of incarceration for blacks declined -2.0% per year, for Hispanics it declined -2.3% per year while for whites it declined only -0.1% per year. Blacks today continue to be incarcerated at a rate over 2.1 times Hispanics and 5.6 times whites.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity varies widely by state and region.

==Perceptions==
[[Katheryn Russell-Brown]] in her book ''[[The Color of Crime (1998 book)|The Color of Crime: Racial Hoaxes, White Fear, Black Protectionism, Police Harassment and Other Macroaggressions]]'' (1998) refers to the stereotype as the "criminal black man", because people associate young black men with crime in American culture. She writes that the black male is portrayed as a "symbolic pillager of all that is good".&lt;ref&gt;Russell-Brown, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell-Brown refers to the criminal black man as a myth&lt;ref&gt;Russell-Brown, p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, Letha A. Lee (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8kqFuOgvV2IC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22criminal+black+man%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vMSFTOKwDdHMswaAyN2aBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22criminal%20black%20man%22&amp;f=false ''Violence as Seen Through a Prism of Color'']. [[Haworth Press]]. p.&amp;nbsp;14. {{ISBN|0-7890-1393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that the stereotype contributes to "[[racial hoax]]es". She defines these as "when someone fabricates a crime and blames it on another person because of his race OR when an actual crime has been committed and the perpetrator falsely blames someone because of his race".&lt;ref&gt;Russell-Brown, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Henry and Mark Lanier in ''What Is Crime?: Controversies Over the Nature of Crime and What to Do about It'' (2001) refer to the criminal black man as a "mythlike race/gender image of deviance".&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Stuart; Lanier, Mark. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2l36DmN5r10C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22criminal+black+man%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ff56TL7AApOZONzbmJUG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22criminal%20black%20man%22&amp;f=false ''What Is Crime?: Controversies Over the Nature of Crime and What to Do about It'']. [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]. p.&amp;nbsp;159. {{ISBN|0-8476-9807-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetuation of negative images by popular culture===
Linda G. Tucker in ''Lockstep and Dance: Images of black Men in Popular Culture'' (2007) argues that the representations in popular culture of criminal African American men help perpetuate the image.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that the portrayal of crime by conservative politicians during heated campaigns is used as a metaphor for race: they have recast fears about race as fears about crime.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Republican opponents of Dukakis used the case of [[Willie Horton]] to attack the Democrat's stand on law enforcement, suggesting that people would be safer if led by Republicans. She says that such politicians used Horton as a collective symbol of African American male criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal African American man appears often in the context of athletics and sports. Arthur A. Raney and Jennings Bryant discuss this in ''Handbook of Sports and Media'' (2006). They cite ''Beyond the Cheers: Race as Spectacle in College Sport'' (2001) by C. Richard King and Charles Fruehling Springwood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_xNaX8QqMIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Beyond the Cheers: Race as Spectacle in College Sport - C. Richard King, Charles Fruehling Springwood - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines the connection between race, crime, and sports. They study the ways in which "criminality indelibly marks the African American athlete". Raney and Bryant says coverage and reception of accusations of crimes by sportspeople differed depending on the race of the individual.&lt;ref name=Raney531&gt;Raney, Arthur A.; Bryant, Jennings. (2006).

[[John Milton Hoberman]] in ''Darwin's Athletes: How Sport Has Damaged black America and Preserved the Myth of Race'' (1997) blames entertainment and advertising industries for propagating the negative stereotypes, namely, for "the merger of the athlete, the [[gangster rapper]], and the criminal into a single black male persona&amp;nbsp;... into the predominant image of black masculinity in the United States and around the world", which has harmed racial integration.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton Hoberman|Hoberman, John Milton]] (1997).

[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]. p.&amp;nbsp;xxvii. {{ISBN|0-395-82292-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have concluded that the [[news]] systematically portrays black Americans as criminals and whites as victims of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entman|first=Robert|year=1992|title=BLACKS IN THE NEWS: TELEVISION, MODERN RACISM AND CULTURAL CHANGE|url=http://www.aejmc.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Journalism-Quarterly-1992-Entman-341-611.pdf|journal=Journalism Quarterly|volume=69|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entman|first=Robert|year=1994|title=Representation and reality in the portrayal of Blacks on network television news.|url=|journal=Journalism Quarterly|volume=71|pages=509–520|via=|doi=10.1177/107769909407100303}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study found that in news programs broadcast in the [[Los Angeles]] area, blacks were overly represented as perpetrators of crime and underrepresented as victims of crimes on television news, compared to actual crime statistics. This is in stark contrast to how, compared to actual crime statistics, whites were found to be underrepresented as perpetrators and overrepresented as victims of crime in television news stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Travis|year=2000|title=Overrepresentation and Underrepresentationof African Americans and Latinos as Lawbreakers on Television News|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=|pages=131–151|via=|doi=10.1093/joc/50.2.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study examining the news reports from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' covering the effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] showed that in 80% of the time black evacuees were portrayed in photographs, the word "looting" was mentioned in the captions, suggesting that the black evacuees were criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommers et al.|first=|year=2006|title=Race and media coverage of Hurricane Katrina: Analysis, implications, and future research questions|url=|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|volume=6|pages=39–55|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2006.00103.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
There is evidence that the American society has internalized the criminal stereotype of African Americans. For example, in experiments where African American and white individuals perform the same act, respondents have reported that the black figure is more threatening than the white figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Birt|year=1976|title=Differential social perception and attribution of intergroup violence: Testing the lower limits of stereotyping of Blacks.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1977-21139-001|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=34|pages=|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.4.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in surveys asking about fear of strangers in hypothetical situations, respondents are more fearful of being victimized by black strangers than by white strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=St. John|first=Craig|year=1995|title=Fear of Black strangers|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-93292-001|journal=Social Science Research|volume=24|pages=|via=|doi=10.1006/ssre.1995.1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other research, whites have been found to overestimate the differences between the rates at which whites and blacks commit some crimes. A 2012 study found that white Americans overestimated the percent of burglaries, illegal drug sales, and juvenile crimes committed by blacks by between 6.6 and 9.5 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=CHIRICOS|first2=TED|last3=GOLDEN|first3=KRISTIN M.|last4=GERTZ|first4=MARC|date=February 2012|title=RECONSIDERING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEIVED NEIGHBORHOOD RACIAL COMPOSITION AND WHITES’ PERCEPTIONS OF VICTIMIZATION RISK: DO RACIAL STEREOTYPES MATTER?*|journal=Criminology|volume=50|issue=1|pages=145–186|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00255.x|last1=PICKETT|first1=JUSTIN T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some research suggesting that blacks have also internalized the criminal stereotype. According to a study, 82% of blacks think they are perceived as violent by Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sigelman|first=|year=1997|title=Metastereotypes: Blacks’ perceptions of Whites’ stereotypes of Blacks|url=|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=61|pages=|via=|doi=10.1086/297788}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans are also more likely than Whites to think that racial profiling is widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/12406/Racial-Profiling-Seen-Pervasive-Unjust.aspx|title=Racial profiling seen as pervasive, unjust.|last=Carlson|first=|date=|website=Gallup|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to think they are treated unfairly by police, both in general and in actual criminal justice encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/8389/Americans-See-Racial-Profiling-Widespread.aspx|title=Americans see racial profiling as widespread|last=Ludwig|first=|date=|website=Gallup|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences in the justice system===
Many psychologists argue that the cultural stereotype of black criminality can have an unconscious but substantial influence on the way that "people perceive individuals, process information, and form judgments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devine|first=Patricia|year=1989|title=Stereotypes and Prejudice: Their Automatic and Controlled Components|url=http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/devine89.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=56|pages=|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the criminal stereotype of African Americans could contribute to the reason behind why blacks are disproportionately more likely than Whites to be targeted by the police as suspects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weich|first=Ronald|year=2000|title=Justice on Trial: Racial Disparities in the American Criminal Justice System, Executive Summary|url=http://www.asca.net/system/assets/attachments/765/Racial_Disparities_in_the_American_Criminal_Justice_System.pdf|journal=Citizen's Commission on Civil Rights|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; interrogated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feld|first=|year=1997|title=Police interrogation of juveniles: An empirical study of policy and practice|url=|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|volume=96|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wrongly convicted: Perspectives on failed justice|last=Parker|first=|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype of a criminal African American has also been associated with [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Kelly|year=2007|title=Black Criminal Stereotypes and Racial Profiling|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/1043986207306870|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|volume=23|pages=276–288|via=|doi=10.1177/1043986207306870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a report from the U.S. Sentencing Commission stated that the sentences of black men were on average 19.5% longer than the sentences of white men from December 2007 to September 2011. Although the report did not attribute racism to the difference in sentencing decisions, the report did write that the judges “make sentencing decisions based on many legitimate considerations that are not or cannot be measured.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/prison-sentences-for-black-men-are-20-percent-longer-than-those-for-white-men-for-same-crimes-130220?news=847124|title=Controversies - Prison Sentences for Black Men Are 20% Longer Than Those for White Men for Same Crimes - AllGov - News|date=2013-02-20|publisher=AllGov|author=|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar study examining 58,000 federal criminal cases concluded that African-Americans’ jail time was almost 60% longer than white sentences while black men were on average more than twice as likely to face a mandatory minimum charge as white men were, even after taking into account arrest offense, age and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/black-americans-given-longer-sentences-than-white-americans-for-same-crimes?news=843984#.tzalfkfg6ey.facebook|title=Top Stories - Black Americans Given Longer Sentences than White Americans for Same Crimes - AllGov - News|date=2012-02-04|publisher=AllGov|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some scholars say this discrepancy is due to them being repeat offenders, others state that this is partially due to prosecutors over-charging African American defendants in contrast to white defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/NSPI201213.pdf/$file/NSPI201213.pdf|title=Program in Law &amp; Economics Working Paper Series|publisher=Fjc.gov|accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting the latter claim, in [[mock trial]]s that experimentally manipulate the race of the defendant, respondents have been found to give African-American defendants harsher judgments of guilt and punishment than white defendants in otherwise identical cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Laura|year=1992|title=The influence of race on sentencing: A meta-analytic review of experimental studies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bsl.2370100204/abstract|journal=Behavioral Sciences and The Law|volume=10|pages=|via=|doi=10.1002/bsl.2370100204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Giliam found that exposure to African American rather than White suspects led to increased support for [[capital punishment]] and the three-strikes legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giliam|first=Franklin|year=2000|title=Prime Suspects: The Influence Of Local Television News On The Viewing Public|url=https://pcl.stanford.edu/common/docs/research/gilliam/1999/primesuspects.pdf|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=44|pages=|via=|doi=10.2307/2669264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Rand also suggests that when black witnesses are on trial with white jurors, they are more likely to feel [[stereotype threat]] and are more likely to appear less credible. To elaborate, because black witnesses are aware of the stereotype relating them as criminals, they are more motivated to control their behavior to counter stereotypes and appear truthful. However, because they try so hard to appear credible, they appear more anxious and unnatural, and therefore less credible to jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rand|first=Joseph|year=2000|title=The demeanor gap: Race, lie detection, and the jury.|url=|journal=Connecticut Law Review|volume=33|pages=1–61.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social consequences===
Lincoln and Devah argue that the criminal stereotype of African American males can explain the growing [[racial segregation in the United States]]. Specifically, they found that the percentage of young black men in a neighborhood is correlated with the respondent's perceptions of neighborhood crime level, even after taking into account measures of actual crime rates and other neighborhood characteristics. This could explain why other races avoid areas with many black men, as the area is perceived to be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quillian|first=|year=2001|title=Black Neighbors, Higher Crime? The Role of Racial Stereotypes in Evaluations of Neighborhood Crime|jstor=10.1086/338938|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that after [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] the "black criminal" stereotype among respondents (by exposing them to photographs of blacks appearing to plunder after [[Hurricane Katrina]]), the respondents reduced policy support for black evacuees-in-need but did not influence responses towards white evacuees-in-need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=James|year=2009|title=Priming Media Stereotypes Reduces Support for Social Welfare Policies: The Mediating Role of Empathy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167208329856|journal=PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY|volume=35|pages=|via=|doi=10.1177/0146167208329856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences in other countries===
The criminal stereotype of black individuals is not just limited to the United States. One study administered a survey to [[Canadians]] showed that they believed African Canadians are more likely to commit crime, with nearly half of the respondents believing that 65% of black people committed more crimes than other racial groups in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Frances|year=1996|title=Perceptions of race and crime in Ontario: Empirical evidence from Toronto and the Durham region|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Criminology|volume=38|pages=469–476|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A working group of [[human rights]] experts from the [[United Nations]] has also expressed concerns that anti-African Canadian systemic racism is rampant in the Canadian justice system, especially in the arbitrary use of racial profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=UN Expert Panel Warns of Systemic Anti-Black Racism in Canada's Criminal Justice System|last=UN News Service New York|first=|date=2016|work=AllAfrica.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahier argues that [[Afro-Ecuadorian]]s have been consistently stereotyped to be dangerous criminals in the popular and widely circulated magazine Vistazo, since the late 1950s. Similarly, he also argues that when race is mentioned in reporting of a crime in Ecuador's daily newspapers, the criminal was always black and the victim was always not black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahier|first=|year=1998|title=Blackness, the Racial/Spatial Order, Migrations, and Miss Ecuador 1995-96|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100|pages=421–430|doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.421|jstor=683121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Lebanon]], including [[population density]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

About 99% of the population of Lebanon includes numerous [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] sects and [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] denominations. Because the matter of religious balance is a sensitive political issue, a national [[census]] has not been conducted since 1932, before the founding of the modern Lebanese state. Consequently, there is an absence of accurate data on the relative percentages of the population of the major religions and groups.&lt;ref name="irfrLeb2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2001/5615.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report – Lebanon|date=26 October 2001|work=2001 Report on International Religious Freedom|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of data and comprehensive statistics concerns also concerns all other demographic studies unrelated to religious balance, due to the all but total inactivity of the concerned public agencies. The only recent ([[Lebanese Civil War|post-war]]) statistics available are estimates based on studies made by private organizations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} There are from 8.6&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-01/255048-bassil-promises-to-ease-citizenship-for-expatriates.ashx#axzz30yVHukzf|title=Bassil promises to ease citizenship for expatriates|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 14&lt;ref name=fco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029394365&amp;a=KCountryProfile&amp;aid=1018721190906 |title=Country Profile: Lebanon |publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] |date=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403173435/http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029394365&amp;a=KCountryProfile&amp;aid=1018721190906 |archivedate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; million Lebanese and descendants of Lebanese worldwide.

The biggest study made after the independence on the Lebanese Population was made by the Central Administration of Statistics (in French: "Administration Centrale de la Statistique") under the direction of Robert Kasparian and [[Grégoire Haddad|Mgr. Grégoire Haddad]]'s Social Movement: "L'enquête par sondage sur la population active au Liban en 1970"(in English: "The survey on the active population in Lebanon in 1970"). It was conducted on a sample of 130,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/962648/gregoire-haddad-et-la-demographie-libanaise.html|title=Grégoire Haddad et la démographie libanaise|website=L'Orient-Le Jour|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanese===
{{Main article|Lebanese people}}
[[Ethnic]] background is an important factor in Lebanon. The country encompasses a great mix of cultural, religious, and [[ethnic]] groups which have been building up for more than 6,000 years. The Arabs invaded and occupied Phoenicia in the 7th century AD from Arabia. The predominant cultural backgrounds and ancestry of the Lebanese vary from Canaanite (Phoenician), Aramean (Ancient Syria) to Greek (Byzantine) and Arab. The question of ethnic identity has come to revolve more around aspects of cultural self-identification more than descent. Religious affiliation has also become a substitute in some respects for ethnic affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/40.htm|title=Sectarian and Clan Consciousness – Lebanon|work=U.S. Library of Congress|publisher=Country Studies|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the cultural and linguistic heritage of the Lebanese people is a blend of both indigenous Phoenician elements and Arab cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. Moreover, in a 2013 interview, the lead investigator, [[Pierre Zalloua]], pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions: "Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top. There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more [[Phoenicia]]n than another".&lt;ref name="Maroon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maroon|first=Habib|title=A geneticist with a unifying message|url=http://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2013.46|publisher=Nature|accessdate=3 October 2013|date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lebanese Christians are some of the oldest Christians in the world, preceded only by the [[oriental Orthodox]] of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenia]] and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Coptic Christians of Ethiopia]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egypt]]. The Maronite Christians, belong to the [[West Syrian Rite|West Syriac Rite]]. Their Liturgical language is the [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-[[Aramaic language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkerkelb.org/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143:-introduction&amp;catid=35:maronite-identity-&amp;Itemid=55|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191635/http://www.bkerkelb.org/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143%3A-introduction&amp;catid=35%3Amaronite-identity-&amp;Itemid=55|archivedate=2011-10-07|title=Identity of the Maronite Church - Introduction|publisher=Bkerkelb.org|date=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkerkelb.org/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=142:-identity-of-the-maronite-church-a-syriac-antiochene-church-with-a-special-liturgical-heritage&amp;catid=35:maronite-identity-&amp;Itemid=55|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191727/http://www.bkerkelb.org/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=142%3A-identity-of-the-maronite-church-a-syriac-antiochene-church-with-a-special-liturgical-heritage&amp;catid=35%3Amaronite-identity-&amp;Itemid=55|archivedate=2011-10-07|title=Identity of the Maronite Church - A Syriac Antiochene Church with a Special Lit. Heritage|publisher=Bkerkelb.org|date=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite Greek Catholics]] and the [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], tend to focus more on the Greco-Hellenistic heritage of the region from the days of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the fact that [[Greek language|Greek]] was maintained as a [[liturgical language]] until very recently. Some Lebanese even claim partial descent from [[Crusades|Crusader]] knights who ruled Lebanon for a couple of centuries during the [[Middle Ages]], also backed by recent genetic studies which confirmed this among Lebanese people, especially in the north of the country that was under the Crusader [[County of Tripoli]]. This identification with non-Arab civilizations also exists in other religious communities, albeit not to the same extent.

===The sectarian system===
Lebanon's [[religion|religious]] divisions are extremely complicated, and the country is made up by a multitude of religious groupings. The ecclesiastical and demographic patterns of the sects and denominations are complex. Divisions and rivalries between groups date back as far as 15 centuries, and still are a factor today. The pattern of settlement has changed little since the 7th century, but instances of civil strife and [[ethnic cleansing]], most recently during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], has brought some important changes to the religious map of the country. (See also [[History of Lebanon]].)

Lebanon has by far the largest proportion of [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] of any [[Arab world|Middle Eastern country]], but both Christians and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]] are sub-divided into many splinter sects and denominations. Population statistics are highly controversial. The various denominations and sects each have vested interests in inflating their own numbers. [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shias]], [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunnis]], [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]]s and [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] (the four largest denominations) all often claim that their particular religious affiliation holds a majority in the country, adding up to over 150% of the total population, even before counting the other denominations. One of the rare things that most Lebanese religious leaders will agree on is to avoid a new general [[census]], for fear that it could trigger a new round of denominational conflict. The last official census was performed in 1932.

Religion has traditionally been of overriding importance in defining the Lebanese population. Dividing state power between the religious denominations and sects, and granting religious authorities judicial power, dates back to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times (the [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system). The practice was reinforced during [[France|French]] mandate, when Christian groups were granted privileges. This system of government, while partly intended as a compromise between sectarian demands, has caused tensions that still dominate Lebanese politics to this day.

The Christian population majority is believed to have ended in the early 1960s, but government leaders would agree to no change in the political power balance. This led to Muslim demands of increased representation, and the constant sectarian tension slid into violent conflict in 1958 (prompting [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|U.S. intervention]]) and again in the grueling [[Lebanese Civil War]], in 1975–90.
[[File:Natural Growth Rate in Lebanon throughout years.png|thumb|right|140px|Natural Growth Rate in Lebanon throughout years]]
The balance of power has been slightly adjusted in the 1943 [[National Pact]], an informal agreement struck at [[independence]], in which positions of power were divided according to the 1932 census. The [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] elite was then accorded more power, but Maronites continued to dominate the system. The sectarian balance was again adjusted towards the Muslim side but simultaneously further reinforced and legitimized. Shia Muslims (by now the second largest sect) then gained additional representation in the state apparatus, and the obligatory Christian-Muslim representation in [[Lebanese Parliament|Parliament]] was downgraded from a 6:5 to a 1:1 ratio. Christians of various denominations were then generally thought to constitute about 40% of the population, although often Muslim leaders would cite lower numbers, and some Christians would claim that they still held a majority of the population.

====18 recognized religious groups====

The present [[Constitution of Lebanon|Lebanese Constitution]] officially acknowledges 18 religious groups (see below). These have the right to handle [[family law]] according to their own courts and traditions, and they are the basic players in Lebanon's complex sectarian politics.

Sectarian Breakdown:

* The [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]]s are the largest of the Christian groups about 21%&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; of the population of Lebanon. They have had a long and continuous association with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but have their own [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|patriarch]], [[liturgy]], and customs. Traditionally they had good relations with the [[Western world]], especially [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon/Government-and-society#toc23374|title=French Mandate|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Fr.-Samir:-Benedict-XVI’s-courage-carries-the-Churches-of-the-Middle-East-and-the-Arab-Spring-25780.html Fr. Samir: Benedict XVI’s courage carries the Churches of the Middle East and the Arab Spring]&lt;/ref&gt; They traditionally dominated the Lebanese government. Their influence in later years has diminished, because of their relative decrease in numbers but also due to the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]], which generally benefited Muslim communities, and was resisted by most Maronites. Today the Maronites are believed to compose about 21% of the population, scattered around the Lebanese countryside but with heavy concentrations on [[Mount Lebanon]] and in [[Beirut]] ([[Greater Beirut]]).
* The second largest Christian group is the [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Eastern Orthodox]] that constitute at least 8%&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; of the population. The church exists in many parts of the Arab world and Eastern Orthodox Christians have often been noted for [[pan-Arab]] or [[Greater Syria|pan-Syrian]] leanings; it has had less dealings with Western countries than the Maronites. The Eastern Orthodox Lebanese Christians have a long and continuous association with Eastern Orthodox European countries like [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]]. The Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the deputy Prime Minister are reserved for Eastern Orthodox Christians.
* The [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite Catholics]] are thought to constitute about 5%&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; of the population.
* The [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestants]] are thought to constitute about 1%&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; of the population.
* The remaining Christian churches are thought to constitute another 6%&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; of the population ([[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Roman Catholics]], Armenian Apostolic, Armenian Catholic, [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]], and Assyrians.)

====Druze====
The [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] constitute 5%&lt;ref name="state.gov" /&gt; of the population and can be found primarily in Mount Lebanon and the Shouf District.

====Other religions====
Other religions account for only an estimated 0.3% of the population mainly foreign temporary workers, according to the [[CIA Factbook]]. There remains a very small [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jewish]] population, traditionally centered in [[Beirut]]. It has been larger: most Jews left the country after the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990) as thousands of Lebanese did at that time.

{{Main article|Lebanese diaspora}}
Apart from the four and a half million citizens of Lebanon proper, there is a sizeable Lebanese [[diaspora]]. There are more [[Lebanese people]] living [[Lebanese diaspora|outside of Lebanon]] (8.6&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb"/&gt;-14&lt;ref name="fco"/&gt; million), than within (4.3 million). The majority of the diaspora population consists of [[Lebanese Christians]]; however, there are some who are Muslim. They trace their origin to several waves of [[Christian emigration]], starting with the exodus that followed the [[1860 Lebanon conflict]] in [[Ottoman Syria]].

Under the current [[Lebanese nationality law]], diaspora Lebanese do not have an automatic [[right of return]] to Lebanon. Due to varying degrees of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and high degree of interethnic marriages, most diaspora Lebanese [[language shift|have not passed on the Arabic language to their children]], while still maintaining a Lebanese [[ethnic identity]].

Many Lebanese families are economically and politically prominent in several [[Latin America]]n countries (in 2007 Mexican [[Carlos Slim Helú]], son of Lebanese immigrants, was determined to be the wealthiest man in the World by [[Fortune Magazine]]), and make up a substantial portion of the [[Lebanese American]] community in the [[United States]]. The largest Lebanese diaspora is located in [[Brazil]], where about 6–7 million people have Lebanese descent (see [[Lebanese Brazilian]]). In [[Argentina]], there is also a large Lebanese diaspora of approximately 1.5 million people having Lebanese descent. (see [[Lebanese Argentine]]). In [[Canada]], there is also a large Lebanese diaspora of approximately 250,000-500,000 people having Lebanese descent. (see [[Lebanese Canadians]]).

There are also sizable populations in [[West Africa]], particularly [[Lebanese people in Ivory Coast|Ivory Coast]], [[Lebanese people in Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]] and [[Lebanese people in Senegal|Senegal]]. 

The large size of Lebanon's diaspora may be partly explained by the historical and cultural tradition of seafaring and traveling, which stretches back to Lebanon's ancient [[Phoenicia]]n origins and its role as a "gateway" of relations between [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. It has been commonplace for Lebanese citizens to emigrate in search of economic prosperity. Furthermore, on several occasions in the last two centuries the Lebanese population has endured periods of [[ethnic cleansing]] and displacement (for example, 1840–60 and 1975–90). These factors have contributed to the geographical mobility of the Lebanese people.

While under Syrian occupation, Beirut passed legislation which prevented second-generation Lebanese of the diaspora from automatically obtaining [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanese citizenship]]. This has reinforced the émigré status of many diaspora Lebanese. There is currently a campaign by those Lebanese of the diaspora who already have [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanese citizenship]] to attain the vote from abroad, which has been successfully passed in the Lebanese parliament and will be effective as of 2013 which is the next parliamentary elections. If suffrage was to be extended to these 1.2{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} million Lebanese émigré citizens, it would have a significant political effect, since as many as 80% of them are believed to be Christian.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Lebanese Civil War refugees and displaced persons===
{{see also|Lebanese Civil War}}
With no official figures available, it is estimated that 600,000–900,000 persons fled the country during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–90). Although some have since returned, this permanently disturbed Lebanese population growth and greatly complicated demographic statistics.

Another result of the war was a large number of [[internally displaced person]]s. This especially affected the southern Shia community, as [[Israel]]i invasion of southern Lebanon in [[Operation Litani|1978]], [[1982 Lebanon War|1982]] and [[Qana#operation grapes of wrath|1996]] prompted waves of mass emigration, in addition to the continual strain of [[South Lebanon security belt|occupation and fighting]] between Israel and [[Hezbollah]] (mainly 1982 to 2000).

Many Shias from Southern Lebanon resettled in the suburbs south of Beirut. After the war, the pace of Christian emigration accelerated, as many Christians felt discriminated against in a Lebanon under increasingly oppressive [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syrian occupation]].

According to a [[UNDP]] study, as much as 10% of the Lebanese had a [[disability]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=disable&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/node/195086 LEBANON: Disabled remain marginalized, study finds], IRIN. Accessed August 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have pointed to the fact that this portion of society is highly marginalized due to the lack of educational and governmental support of their advancement.&lt;ref name=disable/&gt;

==Languages==
{{see also|Lebanese Arabic|Modern Standard Arabic|French language in Lebanon}}
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the country. [[Lebanese Arabic]] is mostly spoken in non-official contexts. [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are taught in many schools from a young age. Among the [[Armenians in Lebanon|Armenian ethnic minority in Lebanon]], [[Armenian language]] is taught and spoken within the Armenian community.

==Immigrants and ethnic groups==
There are substantial numbers of immigrants from other [[Arab world|Arab countries]] (mainly [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]]) and non-Arab-speaking Muslim countries. Also, recent years have seen an influx of people from [[Ethiopia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/newsArticleAF/cache/offonce?entryId=9427|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101034921/http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/newsArticleAF/cache/offonce?entryId=9427|archivedate=2006-11-01|title=IOM Steps Up Evacuation of Stranded Migrants from Lebanon|date=July 26, 2006 |publisher=International Organization for Migration|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South East Asia]]n countries such as [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/middleeast-crisis/canada-lebanon.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721030419/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/middleeast-crisis/canada-lebanon.html|archivedate=2006-07-21|title=CBC News In Depth: Middle East in Crisis – Canada and Lebanon, a special tie|date=1 August 2006|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as smaller numbers of other immigrant minorities, [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Colombians]] and [[Lebanese Brazilian|Brazilians]] (of Lebanese descent themselves). Most of these are employed as guest workers in the same fashion as Syrians and Palestinians, and entered the country to search for employment in the post-war reconstruction of Lebanon. Apart from the Palestinians, there are approximately 180,000 [[Stateless person|stateless]] persons in Lebanon.

===Armenians, Jews and Iranians===
{{Main article|Armenians in Lebanon|History of the Jews in Lebanon|Iranians in Lebanon}}
[[File:Antelias - Armeni.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Armenian Church]] in north [[Beirut]]]]
Lebanese [[Armenians in Lebanon|Armenians]], [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jews]] and [[Iranians in Lebanon|Iranians]] form more distinct ethnic minorities, all of them in possession of a separate languages ([[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]]) and a national home area ([[Armenia]], [[Israel]], [[Iran]]) outside of Lebanon. However, they combined total 5% of the population.

===French and Italians===
{{Main article|French people in Lebanon|Italians in Lebanon}}
{{see also|France–Lebanon relations}}
During the [[French Mandate of Lebanon]], there was a fairly large French minority and a tiny Italian minority. Most of the French and Italian settlers left after Lebanese independence in 1943 and only 22,000 [[French people in Lebanon|French Lebanese]] and 4,300 [[Italians in Lebanon|Italian Lebanese]] continue to live in Lebanon. The most important legacy of the French Mandate is the frequent use and knowledge of the [[French language]] by most of the educated Lebanese people, and [[Beirut]] is still known as the "[[Paris]] of the Middle East".

===Palestinians===
{{Main article|Palestinians in Lebanon}}
Around 450,000 [[Palestinian refugee]]s were registered in Lebanon with the [[UNRWA]] in 2014, who are refugees or descendants of refugees from the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Some 53% live in 12 [[Palestine refugee camps]], who "suffer from serious problems" such as poverty and overcrowding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon|title=Where We Work: Lebanon|work=UNRWA|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these may have emigrated during the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]], but there are no reliable figures available. There are also a number of Palestinians who are not registered as UNRWA refugees, because they left earlier than 1948 or were not in need of material assistance. The exact number of Palestinians remain a subject of great dispute and the Lebanese government will not provide an estimate. A figure of 400,000 Palestinian refugees would mean that Palestinians constitute more than 10% of the resident population of Lebanon.

Palestinians living in Lebanon are considered foreigners and are under the same restrictions on employment applied to other foreigners. Prior to 2010, they were under even more restrictive employment rules which permitted, other than work for the U.N., only the most menial employment. They are not allowed to attend public schools, own property, or make an enforceable will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nada Bakri|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/world/middleeast/18lebanon.html?_r=0|title=Lebanon Gives Palestinians New Work Rights|publisher=The New York Times|date=17 August 2010|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian refugees, who constitute nearly a tenth of the country's population, have long been denied basic rights in Lebanon. They are not allowed to attend public schools, own property or pass on inheritances, measures Lebanon says it has adopted to preserve their right to return to their property in what constitutes Israel now.

Their presence is controversial, and resisted by large segments of the Christian population, who argue that the primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinians dilute Christian numbers. Many Shia Muslims also look unfavorably upon the Palestinian presence since the refugee camps have tended to be concentrated in their home areas. The Lebanese [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunnis]], however, would be happy to see these Palestinians given the [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanese nationality]], thus increasing the Lebanese Sunni population by well over 10% and tipping the fragile electoral balance much in favor of the Sunnis. Late prime minister Rafiq Hariri —himself a Sunni— had hinted on more than one occasion on the inevitability of granting these refugees Lebanese citizenship. Thus far the refugees are Lebanese citizenship as well as many rights enjoyed by the rest of the population, and are confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps, in which construction rights are severely constricted.

Palestinians may not work in a large number of professions, such as lawyers and doctors. However, after negotiations between Lebanese authorities and ministers from the [[Palestinian National Authority]] some professions for Palestinians were allowed (such as taxi driver and construction worker). The material situation of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is difficult, and they are believed to constitute the poorest community in Lebanon, as well as the poorest Palestinian community with the possible exception of [[Gaza Strip]] refugees. Their primary sources of income are UNRWA aid and menial labor sought in competition with Syrian [[guest worker]]s.

The Palestinians are almost totally Sunni Muslim, though at some point Christians counted as high as 40% with Muslims at 60%. The numbers of Palestinian Christians has diminished in later years, as many have managed to leave Lebanon. During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian Christians sided with the rest of the Palestinian community, instead of allying with Lebanese Eastern Orthodox or other Christian communities.

60,000 Palestinians have received Lebanese citizenship, including most Christian Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julie Peteet|url=http://prrn.mcgill.ca/research/papers/peteet.htm|title=From Refugees to Minority: Palestinians in Post-War Lebanon|publisher=prrn.mcgill.ca|date=1996|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=4565c2258&amp;toid=465467da2&amp;docid=3ae6abc95b&amp;skip=0|title=Lebanon: Information on the treatment of Palestinian Christians by the government|publisher=Unhcr.org|date=1 August 1996|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrians===
{{Main article|Syrians in Lebanon}}
{{see also|Lebanon–Syria relations}}
In 1976, the then Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] sent troops into Lebanon to fight PLO forces on behalf of Christian militias. This led to escalated fighting until a cease-fire agreement later that year that allowed for the stationing of Syrian troops within Lebanon. The Syrian presence in Lebanon quickly changed sides; soon after they entered Lebanon they had flip-flopped and began to fight the Christian nationalists in Lebanon they allegedly entered the country to protect. The Kateab Party and the Lebanese Forces under Bachir Gemayel strongly resisted the Syrians in Lebanon. In 1989, 40,000 Syrian troops remained in central and eastern Lebanon under the supervision of the Syrian government. Although, the Taif Accord, established in the same year, called for the removal of Syrian troops and transfer of arms to the Lebanese army, the [[Syrian Army]] remained in Lebanon until the Lebanese [[Cedar Revolution]] in 2005 to end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.

In 1994, the Lebanese government under the pressure of the Syrian government, gave Lebanese passport to thousands of Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/5481746f4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nearly 1.08 million registered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486676.html|website=unhcr.org|title=UNHCR - Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122|title=Syria Regional Refugee Response - Lebanon|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)|work=UNHCR Syria Regional Refugee Response|date=31 October 2015|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrians===
{{Main article|Assyrians in Lebanon}}
There are an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 [[Assyrians in Iraq|Iraqi Assyrian]] refugees in Lebanon. The vast majority of them are [[Illegal immigration|undocumented]], with a large number having been deported or put in prison.&lt;ref name=IraqisInLebanon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aina.org/news/2007049133807.htm|author=Serene Assir|title=Invisible Lives:Iraqis In Lebanon|accessdate=15 August 2007|date=4 September 2007|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/lebanon.religions.htm|title=Lebanon: Religions|author=Tore Kjeilen|publisher=LookLex Encyclopedia|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/assyrians.htm|title=Assyrians|author=Tore Kjeilen|publisher=LookLex Encyclopedia|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They belong to various denominations, including the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], and [[Syriac Catholic Church]].

===Iraqis===
{{Main article|Iraqis in Lebanon}}
Due to the US-led [[invasion of Iraq]], Lebanon has received a mass influx of [[Iraqi refugees]] numbering at around 100,000. The vast majority of them are undocumented, with a large number having been deported or put in prison.&lt;ref name="IraqisInLebanon"/&gt;

===Kurds===
{{Main article|Kurds in Lebanon}}
There are an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Kurdish refugees from Turkey and Syria within Lebanese territory. Many of them are [[Illegal immigration|undocumented]]. As of 2012, around 40% of all Kurds in Lebanon do not have [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanese citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brooke Anderson|url=http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2012/2/kurdsworld580.htm|title=Kurds in Lebanon endure poverty, grapple with assimilation|publisher=Ekurd Daily|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turks===
{{Main article|Turks in Lebanon}}

The [[Turkish people]] began to migrate to Lebanon once the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Selim I]] conquered the region in 1516. Turks were encouraged to stay in Lebanon by being rewarded with land and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Orhan|first=Oytun|year=2010|url=http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/enUploads/Article/Files/2010110_sayi11_eng_web.pdf|title=The Forgotten Turks: Turkmens of Lebanon|place=|publisher=ORSAM|page=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181832/http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/enUploads/Article/Files/2010110_sayi11_eng_web.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Today the Turkish minority numbers approximately 80,000.&lt;ref name=Al-Akhbar&gt;{{cite web|author=Al-Akhbar|title=Lebanese Turks Seek Political and Social Recognition| url= http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/lebanese-turks-seek-political-and-social-recognition|accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since the [[Syrian Civil War]], approximately 125,000 to 150,000 [[Syrian Turkmen]] refugees arrived in [[Lebanon]], and hence they now outnumber the long established Turkish minority who settled since the Ottoman era.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmed|first=Yusra|year=2015|title=Syrian Turkmen refugees face double suffering in Lebanon|url=https://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/11837.html|publisher=Zaman Al Wasl|accessdate= 11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Syrian Observer|year=2015|title=Syria's Turkmen Refugees Face Cruel Reality in Lebanon|url=http://syrianobserver.com/EN/Features/29920/Syria_Turkmen_Refugees_Face_Cruel_Reality_Lebanon|accessdate= 10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drug detoxification''' is variously the intervention in a case of [[physical dependence]] to a [[drug]]; the process and experience of a [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]]; and any of various treatments for acute [[drug overdose]].

A detoxification program for physical dependence does not necessarily address the precedents of [[addiction]], social factors, psychological addiction, or the often-complex behavioral issues that intermingle with addiction.

The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] acknowledges three steps in a drug detoxification process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|authorlink=United States Department of Health and Human Services|title=Detoxification and Substance Abuse Treatment|pages=4–5|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Evaluation'': Upon beginning drug detoxification, a patient is first tested to see which specific substances are presently circulating in their bloodstream and the amount. [[Clinician]]s also evaluate the patient for potential co-occurring disorders, [[dual diagnosis]], and mental/behavioral issues.
#''Stabilization'': In this stage, the patient is guided through the process of detoxification. This may be done with or without the use of medications but for the most part the former is more common. Also part of stabilization is explaining to the patient what to expect during treatment and the recovery process. Where appropriate, people close to the addict are brought in at this time to become involved and show support.
#''Guiding Patient into Treatment'': The last step of the detoxification process is to ready the patient for the actual recovery process. As drug detoxification only deals with the physical dependency and addiction to drugs, it does not address the psychological aspects of drug addiction. This stage entails obtaining agreement from the patient to complete the process by enrolling in a [[drug rehabilitation]] program.

==Rapid detoxification==
The principle of rapid detoxification is to use heavy sedation alongside dosing with opioid [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]]. This approach is expensive, ineffective and extremely dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gowing L, Ali R, White J |title=Opioid antagonists under heavy sedation or anaesthesia for opioid withdrawal |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD002022 |year=2010 |pmid=20091529 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3 |type=Systematic Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The concept of "detoxification" comes from the discredited [[autotoxin]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/autotoxin&lt;/ref&gt; theory of [[George E. Pettey]] and others.  [[David F. Musto]] says that "according to Pettey, opiates stimulated the production of toxins in the intestines, which had the physiological effect associated with withdrawal phenomena... Therefore treatment would consist of purging the body of toxins and any lurking morphine that might remain to stimulate toxin production in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Rapid detox controversy==
Naltrexone therapy, which critics claim lacks long-term efficacy and can actually be detrimental to a patient's long-term recovery, has led to controversy. Additionally, there have been many questions raised about the ethics as well as safety of rapid detox following a number of deaths resulting from the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/316/7126/167/e?andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;HITS=10&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;hits=10&amp;stored_search=&amp;author1=dyer+c&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;maxtoshow=&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;title=opiate&amp;resourcetype=1%2C2%2C3%2C4&amp;searchid=1123476546900_16815&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group|last=Dyer|first=Clare|title=Addict died after rapid opiate detoxification|date=1998-01-17|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/144346|title=Coroner probes 'rapid detox' death: Addict succumbed during procedure.

'''Central Dusun''', also known as '''Bunduliwan''' (Dusun: ''Boros Dusun''), is one of the more widespread languages spoken by the [[Dusun]] and [[Kadazan]] peoples of [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]].

==Official dialect==

Under the efforts of the [[Kadazandusun Cultural Association Sabah]], the standardized [[Kadazan-Dusun]] language is of the central Bundu-Liwan dialect spoken in Bundu and Liwan (now parts of the present-day districts of [[Ranau]], [[Tambunan]] and [[Keningau]]). Dusun Bundu-liwan's selection was based on it being the most mutually intelligible, when conversing with other Dusun or [[Kadazan language|Kadazan]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Kadazandusun Cultural Association. [http://kdca.org.my/hongkod/official-dialect "Official dialect"]. 11 April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet and pronunciation==

The Dusun-Kadazan language is written using the [[Latin alphabet]] and it has 22 characters (the letters C, E&lt;!--If E's are not used, then why is it listed below?--&gt;, F, Q, and X are not used except in loanwords):

A B D G H I K L M N O P R S T U V W Y Z

These characters together are called ''Pimato''.

Semivowels /w j/ and rhotic /r/ only occur in most of the other dialects of the Dusun/Kadazan languages. Forschner (1978) and Antonissen (1958) list two fricatives /v z/ for the Rungus and Penampang Kadazan dialects. [x] is also listed as an allophone of /k/ in word-medial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phonological descriptions of Sabah languages : Studies from Ten Languages, Bonggi, Ida'an, Kadazan/Dusun, Kalabuan, Kimaragang, Labuk-Kinabatangan Kadazan, Lotud, Tagal, Tatana', Tombonuwo|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|publisher=|year=1993|isbn=|location=Kadazan/Dusun Phonology Revisited|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
The vowels are divided into:

Simple vowels: /i u a o/

Diphthongs: ''aa ai'' (sometimes pronounced /e/) ''ii oi uu''

Forschner (1978) notes for the Rungus dialect that the phoneme /e/ is a contraction of the diphthongs /ai/ or /oi/.

Some combinations of vowels do not form diphthongs and each vowel retains its separate sound: '''ao ia iu ui ue'''. In some words aa is not a diphthong, and this is indicated by an apostrophe between the two vowels: a’a.

==Structure==
The Dusun phrase structure follow a different pattern since the normal English [[Subject-verb-object|SUBJECT – VERB – OBJECT]] structure is non-existent in the Dusun construction. A typical Dusun sentence follows the [[Verb-subject-object|VERB – SUBJECT – OBJECT]] structure.

Direct English translation: What do you tomorrow?

English interpretation: "What are you doing tomorrow?" or to a lesser extent, "Are you doing anything tomorrow?"

====Translation====
In the beginning God created heaven and earth. The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep water. The spirit of God was hovering over the water. Then God said, "Let there be light!" So there was light. God saw the light was good. So God separated the light from the darkness. God named the light "day", and the darkness he named "night". There was evening, then morning, the first day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20798">The '''Eastern Bolivian Guaraní,''' or '''Ava Guaraní''', are an [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indigenous people]] formerly known as '''Chiriguanos''' or Chiriguano Indians.  Noted for their warlike character, the Chiriguanos retained their lands in the Andes foothills of southeastern [[Bolivia]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries by fending off, first, the [[Inca Empire]], later, the [[Spanish Empire]], and, still later, independent [[Bolivia]]. The Chiriguanos were finally subjugated in 1892.     

The Chiriguanos of history nearly disappeared from public consciousness after their 1892 defeat -- but were reborn beginning in the 1970s.  In the 21st century the descendants of the Chiriguanos call themselves [[Guarani people|Guaranis]] which links them with millions of speakers of Guarani dialects and languages in [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Combés, Isabelle (2005), "Las batallas de Kuruyuki. Variaciones sobre una derrota chiriguana," ''Bulletin de l'Institut d'Etudes Andines, Vol 34, No. 2, p. 221, 230-231&lt;/ref&gt;  

The census of 2001 counted 81,011 Guaraní, mostly Chiriguanos, over 15 years of age living in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, "The Guarani People and the Situation of the Captive Communities in the Bolivian Chaco", pp. 1-2, http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/ComunidadesCautivas.eng/Chap.Iv.htm, accessed 24 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 census counted 18,000 Ava Guarani in Argentina.&lt;ref name=encuesta2010NOA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadistica.sanluis.gov.ar/estadisticaWeb/Contenido/Pagina148/File/LIBRO/censo2010_tomo1.pdf |title=Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas 2010: Pueblos Originarios: Región Noroeste Argentino: Serie D N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 1 |language=Spanish |accessdate=5 December 2015 |publisher=INDEC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409013106/http://www.estadistica.sanluis.gov.ar/estadisticaWeb/Contenido/Pagina148/File/LIBRO/censo2010_tomo1.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The [[Eastern Bolivian Guaraní language]] was spoken by 33,000 people in [[Bolivia]], 15,000 in [[Argentina]], and a few hundred in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gui Eastern Bolivian Guaraní at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origin of the name and people==
[[File:Pueblos originarios de Bolivia.png|thumb|right|Ethnic groups of Bolivia (2006). The Guarani (Chiriguanos) occupied a larger area in the 16th through 19th century.]]
The common name for the Eastern Bolivian Guaraní since the 16th century has been variations of the name "Chirihuano", a word of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] origin which referred to itinerant doctors or medicine vendors ([[curandero]]s) from the Bolivian [[Larecaja Province|province of Larecaja]], called also ''Collahuayas'', ''Yungeños'' and ''[[Charazani|Charasanis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Clements Markham]] | title=Contributions towards a grammar and dictionary of Quichua | entry=Collahuayas, Chirihuanos | year=1864 | url=https://archive.org/details/contributionstow00mark | pages=86,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Clements Markham]] | title=Travels in Peru and India | year=1862 | pages=247-248 | url=https://archive.org/stream/travelsinperuind00mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because "[[Chile#Etymology|chiri]]" means "cold" in Quechua, the word chirihuano has been interpreted with the pejorative meaning of "people who die from freezing".&lt;ref&gt;Alconini, Sylvia (2004), "The Southeastern Inka Frontier against the Chiriguanos: Structure and Dynamics of the Inka Imperial Borderlands," ''Latin American Antiquity'', Vol. 15, No. 4, p. 394. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 16th century, the Quechua term was Hispanized to Chiriguanos.  Although Chiriguanos usually refers to [[Guarani language]] speaking peoples in eastern Bolivia, the Spanish sometimes applied the term to all Guarani peoples and other lowland people speaking non-Guarani languages living in the eastern Andes and the [[Gran Chaco]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, Jonathan (2015), "At the Limits of Empire: Incas, Spaniards, and the Ava-Guarani (Chiriguanaes) on the Charca-Chiriguana Frontier, Southeastern Andes (1450s-1620s)", Dissertation, University of Florida, pp. 12, 78-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chiriguanos called themselves "ava," meaning humans. The Guarani people are believed by archaeologists to have originated in the central part of the [[Amazon rainforest]] and migrated southward at an uncertain date. Equally uncertain is the date they arrived in eastern Bolivia. The historical Chirguano were a synthesis of the [[Chané]] and the Guaraní. The Chiroguanos migrated from Paraguay to Bolivia in the beginning of the 16th century absorbing, assimilating, and enslaving the Chané.&lt;ref&gt;Alconini, Sonia (2016), ''Southeast Inka Frontiers: Boundaries and Interactions'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida, pp. 26-34. Downloaded from [[Project Muse]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Ava Guaraní peoples may still have been migrating into the eastern Andes at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 1530s, possibly drawn by the riches of the Incas and Spanish and in search of the mythical land of "Candire", the "land without evil", rich with gold and other wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Alconini (2004), p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The Chiriguanos occupied the foothills between the high Andes and the [[Altiplano]] and the flat plains of the [[Gran Chaco]], living mostly at elevations between {{convert|1000|m|ft}} and {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt;  The climate is sub-tropical and precipitation during the rainy season is adequate for growing crops. The region is characterized by steep ridges and deep river valleys making access and communication difficult.  The Chriguanos were never united as a people into a single political unit, but instead functioned on the village level and formed loosely-organized regional coalitions headed by a paramount chieftain, or ''tubicha rubicha'' (''capitán grande'' in Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Erick D. (2009), ''Expecting Pears from an Elm Tree,'', Durham: Duke University Press, p. 13, 290&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Chiriguanos had a warrior ethos, fighting among themselves as well as outsiders. They said they were "men without masters" and considered themselves superior to other peoples whom they called "tapua" or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, pp. 50, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish described them in the most unfavorable terms possible: without religion and government, dedicated to war and cannibalism, naked and sexually promiscuous.  That litany of offenses justified, in Spanish eyes, undertaking wars of "fire and blood" against the Chiriguanos and enslaving them.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;     

The Chiriguanos acquired horses and guns from the Spanish, but their preferred method of fighting was on foot and with [[bow and arrow]]. The Spanish by contrast preferred to fight on horseback and with guns, although guns were in short supply on the frontier for much of history.  The Chiriguanos were an agricultural people, cultivating [[maize]] and other crops.  They initially lived in very large longhouses in villages, but, probably for defense, they came to live in small dispersed settlements of individual houses.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;     

Until the 19th century the Chiriguanos proved impervious to the attempts of missionaries to convert them to Christianity.  A Jesuit mission in 1767 had only 268 Chiriguano converts, as compared to the tens of thousands the Jesuits had converted eastward in Paraguay among other Guarani speaking peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early wars against the Incas and Spanish==
Spanish estimates of the number of Chiriguano warriors between 1558 and 1623 range from 500 to 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;Saignes, Thierry, edited by Isabelle Combés (n.d.), ''Historia del Pueblo Chiriguano, Lima: Institution Frances de Estudias Andinas, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite epidemics of European diseases, the Chiriguano population, probably due in part to the incorporation of the Chané, rose to a high of more than 100,000 in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;   

Large-scale Chiriguano raids against the Inca began in the 1520s. The Inca established defensive settlements, including what are now the archaeological sites of [[Oroncota]] and [[El Fuerte de Samaipata|Samaipata]], to fend off the Chiriguanos.&lt;ref&gt;"Fuerte de Samaipata--UNESCO World Heritage Centre" http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/883. Accessed 23 Sep 2016; Parssinen, Martti, Suriainen, Ari, and Korpisaari, Antti, "Western Amazonia-Amazonia Ocidental", pp. 32. 45-53. https://www.academia.edu/7322394/Fortifications_Related_to_the_Inca_Expansion, accessed 24 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish became concerned with the raids of the Chiriguanos in the 1540s because they threatened the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] (Indian) workers of the rich silver mines at [[Cerro de Potosí|Potosí]] and surrounding areas. The Spanish also wished to establish links between their settlements in the Andes and those in Paraguay. In 1564, under a leader named Vitapue, the Chriguanos destroyed two Spanish settlements in eastern Bolivia and a generalized war between the Spaniards and the Chiriguanos began.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, pp. 18, 259&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1574, The Viceroy of Peru, [[Francisco de Toledo]] led a large--and unsuccessful invasion--into Chiriguano territory and in 1584 the Spanish declared a "war of fire and blood" against the Chiriguanos.&lt;ref&gt;Saignes, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1594, the Chiriguano forced the abandonment of the Spanish settlement of Santa Cruz and its relocation to the present site of the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].  Some of the settlers abandoned the area and floated down the [[Amazon River]] to its mouth and returned to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Gott, Richard (1993), ''Land without Evil: Utopian Journeys across the South American Watershed'', London: Verso, pp. 161-163&lt;/ref&gt;     

The Spanish in the early 17th century followed a policy of attempting to populate the Andean foothills where the Chiriguanos lived and established three main centers as frontier defense: [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Tomina]], {{convert|80|km|mi}} east of [[Sucre]]), and [[Tarija]].  By about 1620, however, the Spanish had given up ambitious attempts to advance the frontier. Records are lacking for the next 100 years, but it appears it was a period of relative peace in which Spaniard and indigenous allies enjoyed an uneasy co-existence with the Chiriguanos, although punctuated by mutual raids on each other.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl pp. 23, 451, 472-496&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jesuits]], successful in their missionary enterprises in Paraguay, attempted to Christianize the Chiriguanos as early as the 1630s, but had little success.&lt;ref&gt;Gott, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

What historian Thierry Saignes called the "General Uprising" of the Chiriguanos began in 1727.  The underlying causes of the uprising were the Spanish colonization of areas near Tarija, led by Jesuit, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], and [[Franciscan]] missionaries and Spanish cattle ranchers who coveted the rich pasture lands of the Andes foothills. The spark that ignited the war was the punishment by the missionaries of Chiriguano [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s at Jesuit and Dominican missions, especially that of Juan Bautista Aruma, who became one of the three principal leaders of the uprising. However, during the war, the Chiriguanos were not united. Their leaders pursued different strategies and some Chiriguanos did not join the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Saignes, pp. 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;   

In October 1727, with cooperation from the [[Toba people|Toba]] and [[Mocoví people|Mocoví]] peoples, the Chiriguanos attacked with an army of 7,000 men, destroying Christian missions and Spanish ranches east of Tarija, killing more than 200 Spaniards and taking many women and children prisoner. In March 1728, they attacked [[Monteagudo, Bolivia|Monteagudo]] (then called Sauces), burned the Church and took 80 Spanish prisoners. The Spanish counterattacked from Santa Cruz in July 1728 with an army of 1200 Spaniards and 200 [[Chiquitano people|Chiquitano]] archers recruited from the [[Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos]] in eastern Bolivia. The Spanish army destroyed many Chiriguano villages, killed more than 200 people, and took more than 1,000 prisoners. Violating a truce to negotiate an exchange of prisoners, the Spanish captured 62 Chiriguano leaders, including Aruma, and enslaved them in the silver mines. Spanish expeditions into Chiriguano territory in 1729 and 1731 were less successful. In 1735 the Chiriguano besieged Santa Cruz but the siege was broken by 340 Chiquitano warriors sent from Jesuit missions. In that same year, the Chiriguanos destroyed two reestablished Jesuit missions near Tarija. The Chiriguano integrated some of their captives into their society; others on both sides were released or ransomed, with slavery being a common fate of captives of the Spanish, especially women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Gott, pp. 180-182; Saignes, pp 92-94, 220-22; 236; Langer, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  

After the General Uprising, additional wars in the 18th century between the Chiriguano and Spanish occurred in 1750 and from 1793 to 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Combés, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;  The brush-fire wars between Spaniard and Chiriguano were largely conflicts about resources. The Chiriguanos were farmers who grew corn; the Spanish and [[Mestizo]] settlers encroaching upon or living in Chiriguano territory were ranchers who raised cattle.  The ranchers and their cattle destroyed Chiriguano settlements and corn fields and the Chiriguanos killed cattle and often ranchers.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 45--47&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century== 

According to scholar Erick Langer, the Chiriguanos held the upper hand in the Andes borderlands until the 1860s. Spanish-speaking communities, called Creole or "karai" as most of the people were of mixed Spanish/Indian heritage, survived by paying tribute to local Chiriguano groups. However, Chiriguano maize crops failed during a drought from 1839 to 1841 and the Chiriguanos resorted to increased raids on cattle herds, both eating the cattle and killing them to halt the advances of the Hispanic ranchers.  As the demand for meat increased in the rest of Bolivia, the pressure on the Chiriguanos by the ranchers and soldiers became more intense. Also, it appears that the population of the Chiriguanos declined after the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 41-47&lt;/ref&gt;

"The most important factor in the loss of Chiriguano independence was the reestablishment of the Franciscan missions" beginning in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, 50&lt;/ref&gt; After more than two centuries of failure, Christian missions enjoyed some success among the Chiriguanos.  The reasons for this success seemed to be that many Chiriguanos turned to the missions for protection from internal disputes and conflict with the Creole ranchers and settlers, the Bolivian government, and other Indian peoples. The missions and the Bolivian government benefited from the labor of the mission Chiriguanos and also recruited many of them as soldiers against independent Chiriguanos and other Indians. The numbers and the independence of the Chiriguano also declined beginning in the 1850s when many of them began migrating to Argentina to work on sugar plantations. By the 1860s, the Bolivian government was taking a more aggressive stand against the Chiriguanos, awarding large grants of land to ranchers in their territory. Outright massacres of Chiriguanos became more common.  Chiriguano fighters were routinely executed when captured and women and children sold into servitude.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 48-49, 60, 114-117&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chiriguanos made two last attempts to retain their independence: the Huacaya War of 1874-1877, in which rebellious Chiriguanos were defeated, and the rebellion of 1892. The 1892 rebellion broke out in January at the mission of Santa Rosa de [[Cuevo]].  It was led by a 28 year old man named Chapiaguasu, who styled himself [[Apiaguaiki Tumpa]] (Eunuch of God) and said that he had been sent to earth to save the Chiriguanos from Christianity and the Franciscan missionaries. With an army of 1,300 Chiriguanos, Apiaguaiki led a failed attack against the mission on January 21. The Creoles led a counter-attack on January 28 with 50 soldiers, 140 Creole militia, and 1,500 friendly Indians armed with bows and arrows. In the [[Battle of Kuruyuki]], the Creole army killed more than 600 Chiriguanos with losses of their own of only four killed, all Indians. Following the battle, the Creole army massacred Chiriguanos who surrendered and sold women and children into slavery.  The 2,000 Chiriguanos resident at the Santa Rosa de Cuevo mission mostly supported the Creole army.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 186-195&lt;/ref&gt;

Apiaguaiki was later captured and on March 29, 1892 was tortured and executed by Bolivian authorities.&lt;ref&gt; Hurtado Guzman, Emilio, "Apiaguaiqui Tumpa" http://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/153112.pdf, accessed 23 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The movement he led was similar to other contemporary [[Millenarianism in colonial societies|Millenarian]] movements around the world such as the [[Ghost Dance]] in the United States and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.

==20th and 21st centuries==
The influence of the Fransciscan missions declined during the 20th century. A Chiriguano leader named Ubaldino Cundeye, his wife, Octavia, and relatives moved to [[La Paz]] in 1930 and asserted that the Chiriguanos had rights as citizens of Bolivia. Cundeye campaigned for the Chiriguanos to reclaim land from the missions. However, the [[Chaco War]] (1932-1935) resulted in the dispossession of much of the remaining land belonging to the missions and the Chiriguanos. The Chiriguanos largely became migrant, landless workers, many in Argentina. The missions were finally dissolved in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, pp. 256, 266, 281-282&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Communist]] revolutionary [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]] was attempting to foment revolution among the Chiriguanos when he was captured and executed by Bolivian soldiers on October 9, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Gott, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;  Guevara and his Cuban followers had studied Quechua to communicate with Bolivian peasants, but the Chiriguanos spoke [[Guaraní language|Guarani]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Daniel (2001), ''Che Guevara'', Cooper Square Press, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, to attract tourists, the Guarani created the "Trail of Che Guevara" which extends for {{convert|300|km|mile}} through the territory in which Guevara and his mini-army operated.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, David, "On the Trail of Che Guevara," https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-133810073/on-the-trail-of-che-guevara-as-south-america-s-poorest, accessed 24 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Eastern Bolivian or Ava Guaraní, as they are increasingly called rather than Chiriguano (which has pejorative origins), participate in the [[Assembly of the Guarani People – North Charagua|Assembly of the Guaraní People]], founded in 1987, a pan-national organization which represents the Guaraní people in the several countries in which they live.  The Guaraní are also represented in the [[Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia]]. Their aim is to recover some of their ancestral lands and promote economic development, education, and health among their people.&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, "The Guarani People and the Situation of the Captive Communities in the Bolivian Chaco", pp. 1-2, http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/ComunidadesCautivas.eng/Chap.Iv.htm, accessed 24 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 investigation by the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] found that 600 Guaraní families in Bolivia continue to live in conditions of "debt bondage and forced labor, which are practices that comprise contemporary forms of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, pp. 3, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economic systems sidebar|Coordination}}

'''Economic planning''' is a mechanism for the allocation of resources between and within organizations which is held in contrast to the [[market (economics)|market]] mechanism. As an allocation mechanism for socialism, economic planning replaces [[Factor market|factor markets]] with a direct allocation of resources within a single or interconnected group of [[Social ownership|socially-owned]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mandel | first = Ernest | author-link = Ernest Mandel | title = In defense of socialist planning | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 159 | pages = 5–37 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 1986 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/159/ernest-mandel-in-defence-of-socialist-planning | quote = Planning is not equivalent to ‘perfect’ allocation of resources, nor ‘scientific’ allocation, nor even ‘more humane’ allocation.

As such, it is the opposite of market allocation, which is ex post. | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digamo.free.fr/mandelsp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various forms of economic planning. The level of centralization in the decision-making depends on the specific type of planning mechanism employed. As such, one can distinguish between [[centralized planning]] and [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized]] planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century |year=2003 |last=Gregory |first=Paul R. |last2=Stuart |first2=Robert C. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-618-26181-8 |pages=23–24 |quote=Centralization is commonly identified with plan and decentralization with market, but there is no simple relationship between the level of decision making and the use of market or plan as a coordinating mechanism. In some economies, it is possible to combine a considerable concentration of decision-making authority and information in a few large corporations with substantial state involvement and yet to have no system of planning as such...To identify an economy as planned does not necessarily reveal the prevalent coordinating mechanism, or for that matter, the degree of centralization in decision making. Both depend on the type of planning mechanism. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An economy primarily based on central planning is referred to as a [[planned economy]]. In a centrally planned economy the allocation of resources is determined by a comprehensive plan of production which specifies output requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Nove]] (1987), "planned economy", ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 879-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Planning may also take the form of directive planning or [[indicative planning]].

A distinction can be made between physical planning (as in pure socialism) and financial planning (as practiced by governments and private firms in capitalism). Physical planning involves economic planning and coordination conducted in terms of disaggregated physical units, whereas financial planning involves plans formulated in terms of [[Money|financial units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellman |first=Michael |title=Socialist Planning |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-35866-3 |page=25 |quote=Planning in the traditional model is primarily an activity that takes place in physical terms. That is, it is concerned with allocating tonnes of this, cubic metres of that, etc. rather than being concerned with allocating financial flows. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In socialism==
{{see also|Socialist economics}}
{{Socialism sidebar |Ideas}}

Different forms of economic planning have been featured in various models of socialism. These range from decentralized-planning systems, which are based on collective decision-making and disaggregated information, to centralized systems of planning conducted by technical experts who use aggregated information to formulate plans of production. In a fully developed socialist economy, engineers and technical specialists, overseen or appointed in a democratic manner, would coordinate the economy in terms of physical units without any need or use for financial-based calculation. The economy of the Soviet Union never reached this stage of development, so planned its economy in financial terms throughout the duration of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the Name of Socialism: The Left-Wing Origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=35 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a number of alternative metrics were developed for assessing the performance of non-financial economies in terms of physical output (i.e. [[net material product]] versus [[gross domestic product]]).

In general, the various models of socialist economic planning exist as theoretical constructs that have not been implemented fully by any economy, partially because they depend on vast changes on a global scale (see [[mode of production]]). In the context of mainstream economics and the field of [[comparative economic systems]], "socialist planning" usually refers to the Soviet-type [[command economy]], regardless of whether or not this economic system actually constituted a type of socialism or [[state capitalism]] or a third, non-socialist and non-capitalist type of system.

In some models of [[socialism]], economic planning completely substitutes the market mechanism, supposedly rendering monetary relations and the price system obsolete. In other models, planning is utilized as a complement to markets.

===Concept of socialist planning===
The classical conception of socialist economic planning held by [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxists]] involved an economic system where goods and services were valued, demanded and produced directly for their [[use-value]], as opposed to being produced as a by-product of the pursuit of profit by business enterprises. This idea of "production for use" is a fundamental aspect of a socialist economy. This involves social control over the allocation of the [[surplus product]] and in its most extensive theoretical form [[calculation in kind|calculation-in-kind]] in place of financial calculation. For Marxists in particular, planning entails control of the surplus product (profit) by the associated producers in a [[Economic democracy|democratic manner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists |last=Schweickart |first=David |last2=Lawler |first2=James |last3=Ticktin |first3=Hillel |last4=Ollman |first4=Bertell |year=1998 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-91967-3 |chapter=Definitions of Market and Socialism |pages=58–59 |quote=For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process... The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from planning within the framework of capitalism, which is based on the planned [[Capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]] in order to either stabilize the business cycle (when undertaken by governments) or to maximize profits (when undertaken by firms), as opposed to the socialist concept of planned production for use.

In such a socialist society based on economic planning, the primary function of the state apparatus changes from one of political rule over people (via the creation and enforcement of laws) into a technical administration of production, distribution and organization; that is, the state would become a coordinating economic entity rather than a mechanism of political and class-based control and thereby ceasing to be a state in the traditional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |work=Marxists.org |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm |quote=In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning versus Command===
The concept of a command economy is differentiated from the concept of a planned economy (or economic planning), especially by socialists and Marxists who liken command economies (such as that of the former Soviet Union) to that of a single capitalist firm, organized in a top-down administrative fashion based on bureaucratic organization akin to that of a capitalist corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Glossary of Terms: Command Economy | url = http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm | website = marxists.org | publisher = Marxists Internet Archive Encyclopedia }} For an overview of the Soviet experience, see {{cite book

Economic analysts have argued that the economy of the former Soviet Union actually represented an administered or command economy as opposed to a planned economy because planning did not play an operational role in the allocation of resources among productive units in the economy, since in actuality the main allocation mechanism was a system of command-and-control. As a result, the phrase administrative command economy gained currency as a more accurate descriptor of Soviet-type economies.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy |last=Wilhelm |first=John Howard |year=1985 |journal=[[Europe-Asia Studies|Soviet Studies]] |pages=118–130 |volume=37 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/09668138508411571 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09668138508411571  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decentralized planning===
{{see also|Decentralized planning (economics)}}

Decentralized economic planning is a planning process that starts at the user-level in a bottom-up flow of information. As such, decentralized planning often appears as a complement to the idea of socialist [[Worker self-management|self-management]] (most notably by [[libertarian socialist]]s and [[democratic socialists]]).

The theoretical postulates for models of decentralized socialist planning stem from the thought of [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Oskar Lange]].&lt;ref name="Theoretical Expositions of Centralized versus Decentralized Strands of Socialist Economic Systems"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Theoretical Expositions of Centralized versus Decentralized Strands of Socialist Economic Systems |last=Dowlah |first=Abu F. |journal=International Journal of Social Economics |volume=19 |issue=7/8/9 |year=1992 |pages=210–258 |doi=10.1108/EUM0000000000497 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000000497 | publisher = [[Emerald Group Publishing|Emerald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model involves economic decision-making based on self-governance from the bottom-up (by employees and consumers) without any directing central authority. This often contrasts with the doctrine of orthodox [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninism]], which advocates directive administrative planning where directives are passed down from higher authorities (planning agencies) to agents (enterprise managers), who in turn give orders to workers.

Two contemporary models of decentralized planning are [[participatory economics]], developed by the economist [[Michael Albert]]; and negotiated coordination, developed by the economist [[Pat Devine]].

===Material balances===
[[Material balance planning]] was the type of economic planning employed by Soviet-type economies. This system emerged in a haphazard manner during the collectivisation drive under [[Joseph Stalin]] and emphasized rapid growth and industrialization over efficiency. Eventually this method became an established part of the Soviet conception of "socialism" in the post-war period and other socialist states emulated it in the latter half of the 20th century. Material balancing involves a planning agency ([[Gosplan]] in the case of the Soviet Union) taking a survey of available inputs and raw materials, using a balance-sheet to balance them with output targets specified by industry, thereby achieving a balance of supply and demand.&lt;ref name="Planning with Material Balances in Soviet-Type Economies, 1959"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planning with Material Balances in Soviet-Type Economies |authorlink=John Michael Montias |last=Montias |first=J. M. |year=1959 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=963–985 | jstor = 1813077  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lange-Lerner-Taylor model===
{{see also|Lange model}}
The economic models developed in the 1920s and 1930s by American economists [[Fred M. Taylor]] and [[Abba Lerner]] and by Polish economist [[Oskar Lange]] involved a form of planning based on marginal cost pricing. In Lange's model, a central planning board would set prices for producer goods through a trial-and-error method, adjusting until the price matched the marginal cost, with the aim of achieving [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto-efficient]] outcomes. Although these models were often described as "market socialism", they actually represented a form of "market simulation" planning.

==In capitalism==
===Intra-firm and intra-industry planning===
{{See also|Enterprise resource planning}}

Large [[corporations]] use planning to allocate resources internally among its divisions and subsidiaries. Many modern firms also use [[regression analysis]] to measure market demand to adjust prices and to decide upon the optimal quantities of output to be supplied. [[Planned obsolescence]] is often cited as a form of economic planning that is used by large firms to increase demand for future products by deliberately limiting the operational lifespan of its products.

The internal structures of corporations have been described as centralized command economies that use both planning and hierarchical organization and management.

According to [[J. Bradford DeLong]], many transactions in Western economies do not pass through anything resembling a market but are actually movements of value among different branches and divisions within corporations, companies, and agencies. Furthermore, much economic activity is centrally planned by managers within firms in the form of [[production planning]] and marketing management (that consumer demand is estimated, targeted and included in the firm's overall plan) and in the form of production planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/events/spring08/governance/DeLong,%20B.-Corporation-1997.pdf | title=The Corporation as a Command Economy | author=J. Bradford DeLong | year=1997 | work= | publisher=UC Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research | accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Industrial State]]'', the American economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] noted that large firms manage both prices and consumer demand for their products by sophisticated statistical methods. Galbraith also pointed out that because of the increasingly complex nature of technology and the specialization of knowledge, management had become increasingly specialized and bureaucratized. The internal structures of corporations and companies had been transformed into what he called a "[[technostructure]]." Its specialized groups and committees are the primary decision-makers, and specialized managers, directors, and financial advisers operate under formal bureaucratic procedures, replacing the individual entrepreneur's role (see also [[intrapreneurship]]). Galbraith stated that both the obsolete notion of "entrepreneurial capitalism" and democratic socialism (defined as [[workplace democracy|democratic management]]) are impossible organizational forms for managing a modern industrial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Galbraith | first = John K. | author-link = John Kenneth Galbraith | title = The new industrial state | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2007 | origyear = 1967 | isbn = 9780691131412 }} Abridge version: [http://abridge.me.uk/doku.php?id=the_new_industrial_state Part I: The History and Nature of the New Industrial State], 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]], an economist associated with both the [[Austrian economics|Austrian school]] and the [[Institutional economics|Institutional school]] of economics, argued that the changing nature of economic activity (specifically the increasing bureaucratization and specialization required in production and management) was the major cause for capitalism eventually evolving into socialism. The role of the businessman was increasingly bureaucratic, and specific functions within the firm required increasingly specialized knowledge, which could be supplied as easily by state functionaries in publicly-owned enterprises.

In the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', [[Karl Marx]] identified the process of capital accumulation as central to the law of motion of capitalism. The increased industrial capacity caused by the increasing returns to scale further socializes production. Capitalism eventually socializes labor and production to a point that the traditional notions of private ownership and commodity production become increasingly insufficient for further expanding the productive capacities of society,&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p. 40. Capitalist property relations put a "fetter" on the productive forces.&lt;/ref&gt; necessitating the emergence of a socialist economy in which means of production are socially owned and the surplus value is controlled by the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;''Capital, Volume 1'', by Marx, Karl. From "Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation": "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] stands on its own feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers."&lt;/ref&gt; Many socialists viewed these tendencies, specifically the increasing trend toward economic planning in capitalist firms, as evidence of the increasing obsolescence of capitalism and inapplicability of ideals like perfect competition to the economy, with the next stage of evolution being the application of society-wide economic planning.

===State development planning===
{{See also|Industrial policy|Developmental state}}
State development planning or national planning refers to macroeconomic policies and financial planning conducted by governments to stabilize the market or promote economic growth in market-based economies. This involves the use of monetary policy, industrial policy and fiscal policy to "steer" the market toward targeted outcomes. Industrial policy includes government taking measures "aimed at improving the competitiveness and capabilities of domestic firms and promoting structural transformation".{{sfn|UNCTAD|UNIDO|2011|p=34}}

In contrast to socialist planning, state development planning does not replace the market mechanism and does not eliminate the use of money in production. It only applies to privately owned and publicly owned firms in the strategic sectors of the economy and seeks to coordinate their activities through indirect means and market-based incentives (such as tax breaks or subsidies).

==Around the world==
===Soviet Union===
{{Main article|Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning|Economy of the Soviet Union}}
The [[Soviet Union]]'s model of economic planning had decisions on production and investment are embodied in a plan formulated by the [[Gosplan]], the state planning agency. The system used [[material balance planning]]. Economic information, including consumer demand and enterprise resource requirements, were aggregated to balance supply, from the available resource inventories, with demand, based on requirements for individual economic units and enterprises, through a system of iterations.

The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]] operated in a centralized and hierarchical manner. The process used directives, which were issued to lower-level organizations. The Soviet economic model was thus often referred to as a [[command economy]] or an administered economy, as plan directives were enforced by inducements in a vertical power structure, but planning played little functional role in the allocation of resources.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy, 1985" /&gt;

===United States===
The United States used economic planning during the First World War. The federal government supplemented the price system with centralized resource allocation and created a number of new agencies to direct important economic sectors: notably, the Food Administration, Fuel Administration, Railroad Administration and War Industries Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Rockoff.WWI ''Hugh Rockoff'' – U.S. Economy in World War I, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, the economy experienced staggering growth under a similar system of planning. In the postwar period, U.S. governments utilized such measures as the [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970|Economic Stabilization Program]] to directly intervene in the economy to control prices, wages, ''et cetera'' in different economic sectors.

Since the start of the Cold War, the federal government has directed a significant amount of investment and funding into [[research and development]] (R&amp;D), often initially through the [[US Department of Defense]]. The government performs 50% of all R&amp;D in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zeh, Jr. | first = Herbert J. | title = The Federal Funding of R&amp;D: Who Gets the Patent Rights? | journal = [[JOM (journal)|JOM]] | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | page = 69 | publisher = [[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]] | date = 1990 | url = http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9004.html  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a dynamic state-directed public-sector developing most of the technology that later becomes the basis of the private sector economy. As a result, [[Noam Chomsky]] has referred to the US economic model as a form of state capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | author-link = Noam Chomsky | title = State and Corp. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121012025610/http://www.zcommunications.org/state-and-corp-by-noam-chomsky | archive-date = 12 October 2012 | url = http://www.zcommunications.org/state-and-corp-by-noam-chomsky | work = [[Z Communications#Publications and organizations|Z Net]] | publisher = [[Z Communications]] | date = 18 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include laser technology, the internet, nanotechnology, telecommunications and computers, with most basic research and downstream commercialization financed by the public sector. That includes research in other fields including healthcare and energy, with 75% of most innovative drugs financed through the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mazzucato | first = Mariana |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/features/2013/06/the-myth-of-the-meddling-state-nothing-ventured/ |title=The Myth of the "Meddling" State |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=Public Finance International |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
The development models of the East Asian Tiger economies involved varying degrees of economic planning and state-directed investment in a model sometimes described as "[[state-sponsored capitalism|state development capitalism]]" or the "East Asian Model."

The economy in both [[economy of Malaysia|Malaysia]] and [[economy of South Korea|South Korea]] were instituted by a series of macroeconomic government plans ([[First Malaysia Plan]] and [[Five-Year Plans of South Korea]]) that rapidly developed and industrialized their mixed economies.

The economy of [[economy of Singapore|Singapore]] was partially based on government economic planning that involved an active [[industrial policy]] and a mixture of state-owned industry and free-market economy.

===France===
Under ''[[dirigisme]]'', France used [[indicative planning]] and established a number of state-owned enterprises in strategic sectors of the economy. The concept behind indicative planning is the early identification of oversupply, bottlenecks, and shortages so that state investment behavior can be quickly modified to reduce market disequilibrium so that stable economic development and growth can be sustained. France experienced its ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (Thirty Glorious), years with economic prosperity.

===United Kingdom===
The need for long-term economic planning to promote efficiency was a central component of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] thinking until the 1970s. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] largely agreed, which produced the [[postwar consensus]], the broad bipartisan agreement on major policies.&lt;ref&gt;Glen  O'Hara, ''From dreams to disillusionment: economic and social planning in 1960s Britain'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007) [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317692/1/271224.pdf online PhD version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Economic calculation problem}}
The most notable critique of economic planning came from Austrian economists [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Hayek argued that central planners could not possibly accrue the necessary information to formulate an effective plan for production because they are not exposed to the rapid changes that take place in an economy in any particular time and place and so they are unfamiliar with those circumstances. The process of transmitting all the necessary information to planners is thus inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hayek | first = Friedrich | author-link = Friedrich Hayek | title = The use of knowledge in society | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 519–530 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] via [[JSTOR]] | date = September 1945 | jstor = 1809376 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html Full text.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mises had a similar opinion.

Proponents of [[decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized economic planning]] have also criticized central economic planning. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and so they would be unable to respond to local conditions quickly enough to effectively coordinate all economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Writings 1932-33, P.96'', Leon Trotsky.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Guerrero Pérez''' (1840–1910), also known as '''''Antonio Prida''''', was a Mexican [[serial killer]] in the late 19th century. He was the first serial killer to be captured in [[Mexico]], although he was not the country's first recorded serial killer. Guerrero killed approximately twenty female [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] in [[Mexico City]] between 1880 and 1888. He also killed one woman whose status as a prostitute has been inconsistently reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=México y sus asesinos seriales |last=Ham |first=Ricardo |year=2007 |publisher=Samsara |location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] |isbn=978-970-9425727&lt;!--This ISBN is shown on the back cover, but it may also be the ISBN for a different book by the same author --&gt;|chapter=1.

Guerrero and [[Jack the Ripper]] were contemporaries and their [[modus operandi]] were similar—some authors compare the two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey M. |last=Pilcher |title=The Sausage Rebelion: Public Health, Private Enterprise, and Meat in Mexico City, 1890-1917 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHgF0Xz2fcYC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=francisco+guerrero+chalequero#v=onepage&amp;q=francisco%20guerrero%20chalequero&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-07-23 |year=2006 |edition=1st |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=New Mexico, USA |isbn= 978-0-8263-3796-2 |chapter= 2. THe Porfirian Jungle |pages=62–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as ''"El Chalequero"'', ''"The Mexican Bluebeard"'', ''"The Consulado River Strangler"'', ''"The Consulado River Ripper"'', or ''"The Mexican Ripper"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Alberto |last=Del Castillo Troncoso |title= Libro Rojo, Vol. 1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hTkS8dDnorQC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=francisco+guerrero+el+chalequero#v=onepage&amp;q=francisco%20guerrero%20el%20chalequero&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-07-23 |language=Spanish |edition= 1&lt;sup&gt;st.&lt;/sup&gt; |year=1888 |publisher=Gerardo Villadelángel; Fondo de Cultura Económica |location=Mexico City, Mexico |isbn= 9681686152 |chapter=13. El Chalequero |pages=128–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an organized, [[wikt:sedentary|sedentary]], and missionary killer who was motivated by [[hate crime|hatred]].

==Early life==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
Francisco Guerrero Pérez was born in 1840 in the [[Bajío]] region of Mexico to an impoverished family. He was an eleventh child whose [[childhood]] was marked by [[poverty]], maternal abuse and paternal absence. In 1862, the twenty-two-year-old migrated to [[Mexico City]], where he worked for a [[shoemaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Alberto |last=Del Castillo Troncoso |title= Libro Rojo, Vol. 1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hTkS8dDnorQC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=francisco+guerrero+el+chalequero#v=onepage&amp;q=francisco%20guerrero%20el%20chalequero&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-07-23 |language=Spanish |edition= 1&lt;sup&gt;st.&lt;/sup&gt; |year=1888 |publisher=Gerardo Villadelángel; Fondo de Cultura Económica |location=Mexico City, Mexico |isbn= 9681686152 |chapter=13. El Chalequero |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guerrero dressed extravagantly but elegantly, with [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] pants, a [[charro]] vest and a charro jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Juan Pablo Arango and Martỉn Gabriel Barrón (interviewee), and Atala Sarmiento (interviewer)|year=2009 |title=La Historia detrás del Mito: "Crimenes Legendarios" (7/8) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFS6qZAumZA&amp;feature=related |format=Youtube Video |medium=TV |language=spanish |trans-title=The History behind to the Myth: "Legendary Crimes" (7/8) |publisher=[[TV Azteca]] |location=[[Mexico City]], Mexico |accessdate=2012-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by an anonymous source as a "...handsome, elegant, flirtatious and quarrelsome man".&lt;ref name="sangre-y-plomo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sangre-y-plomo.com/2011/10/francisco-guerrero-el-chalequeroel.html |title=Francisco Guerrero "El Chalequero"; el primer asesino serial mexicano; reportaje |author= Hernan Almaguer |work=Reports |publisher=Sangre y Plomo |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two theories on the origin of the nickname ''"Chalequero"''. One says that it was simply because he always used vests, and the other postulates it was because the name ''"Chalequero"'' alludes to the Spanish expression ''"... a puro chaleco"''. This expression means that he made a sexual victim of any woman that he felt attracted to, whether they liked him or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hábitos, normas y escándalos: prensa, criminalidad y drogas durante el Porfiriato tardío |last=Pérez Montfort |first=Ricardo |year=1997 |publisher=Plaza y Valdés Editores |location=Mexico City, Mexico |isbn=968-856-558-X |chapter=9.

==Psychiatric profile==
[[File:Francisco Guerrero (005).jpg|thumb|Francisco Guerrero`s picture in 1888]]
Guerrero was [[psychopathic]]; he did not feel [[empathy]] or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and he had a parasitic lifestyle. He saw other persons as objects, had inflated [[self-esteem]], suffered sudden anger attacks, was manipulative and promiscuous. However, he was charismatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sin Clemencia: Los Crimenes Que Conmocionaron A Mexico |last=Lazo |first=Norma  |year=2007 |publisher=Random House Mondadori |location=[[Mexico City]], Mexico |isbn=9789707807402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison, he was described by the other prisoners as: ''"a silent and quiet person, he cares about his appearance"''. On one occasion, he wrote a letter to the prison director asking permission for his family to bring him a new pair of pants so that he could, in his words, "dress according to his education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://escritoconsangre1.blogspot.mx/2010/04/francisco-guerrero-chalequero.html |title=Francisco Guerrero: "El Chalequero" |publisher=Escrito con Sangre |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He saw the female gender as nothing more than a disposable conduit to sexual gratification. His crimes involved hate, showed extreme cruelty and were marked by perversions such as sexual mutilation. He violated his victims to show the superiority and power that, according to him, he held over the women. Almost all of his victims were prostitutes, but he didn't kill them because of their work; he killed them because they were vulnerable. According to him, ''"...women had a duty to be faithful to their men, and female [[adultery]] should be punished with the [[death penalty]]."''&lt;ref name="sangre-y-plomo"/&gt;

[[Carlos Roumagnac]], one of the first Mexican criminologists, concluded that ''Consulado River`s Ripper'' was a born criminal:

{{quote|text= ''"...there isn't sufficient information by to suppose than (...) the Chalequero committed his crimes motivated by an irresistible sexual compulsion (..) he didn't commit it by a sexual impulse (...) he committed it by conscious and violent impulse (...) he's a violent degenerate."'' |source=Roumagnac, Carlos; 1906 }}

== References in pop culture ==
His crimes have since been dramatized in [[:es:Bernardo_Esquinca|Bernardo Esquinca]]'s novel Carne de Ataud.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5624">The '''Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles''' (IRCCs) are local-level inter-faith platforms in every constituency, formed to promote racial and religious harmony. The work of the IRCCs is instrumental in strengthening social cohesion and supports the [[SGSecure]] movement. 

==History==
The Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs) were formed in 2002 by then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] against the backdrop of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, and the arrest in December 2001 of 15 [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] members in Singapore who planned to [[Singapore embassies attack plot|bomb diplomatic missions and attack nationals of Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States based in Singapore]]. Re-positioned in 2006 to include religious organisations, the IRCCs serve as the local-level inter-faith platforms under the Community Engagement Programme (CEP) to respond quickly to incidents with racial and religious dimensions. Friendships and networks of trust are built during peace time to ensure that we can withstand challenges and strains on our social cohesion.

The IRCCs were officially renamed as “Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles” on 7 Sep 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ircc.sg/pdf/IRCC_media_release.pdf |title=Media Release : Re-naming of IRCCs to Include Inter-religious Dimension |date=2007-09-06 |publisher=[[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (Singapore)|Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports]] |accessdate=2007-09-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005183204/http://www.ircc.sg/pdf/IRCC_media_release.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acronym, IRCC, however, remained the same. The renaming signifies the IRCCs’ active promotion of inter-religious understanding and harmony.

==Purpose==
The IRCCs serve as important bridges between religious, ethnic and community groups at the local level. Leaders from various religious, ethnic and other community organisations have come together to join the IRCC networks to build friendships and trust. The IRCCs also aim to deepen people's understanding of the various faiths, beliefs and practices through inter-faith and inter-ethnic themed activities such as inter-faith heritage trails, inter-faith talks and dialogues and various ethnic and religious celebrations. The IRCCs are also primed to respond quickly to incidents with racial and religious tensions and to project solidarity on the ground during crises.

Through the IRCC, [[Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth]] (MCCY) encourages leaders and their followers from religious organisations to join in the efforts to build networks of trust during peace time. MCCY is also actively involving the other ethnic and community organisations such as clan associations to participate in the IRCCs. In the aftermath of a crisis, they will be the key links to disseminate information, soothe and minimise communal tension, and maintain confidence in the community.

IRCC members also keep track of grievances and complaints from the ground, thus giving them a unique understanding of local racial or religious sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-Racial Confidence Circles|url=http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/FCD/Templates/FCD-GenericContentTemplate.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fCommunityDevelopment%2fPromoteRacialHarmonyNCommunityBonding%2f&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7bE403F4AF-A9ED-4A4E-AA0D-00C02FE0CAB6%7d&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest|publisher=eCitizen, [[Government of Singapore]]|date=2007-02-28|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRCCs also function as the main sources of information from the Government on the ground.&lt;ref name="ST: Challenge"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwek|first=Ken|title=Challenge for IRCCs : Rope in More Religious Leaders, Build Ties : Minister Urges Inter-Racial Confidence Circles to Reach Out Further so They Will be Better Prepared During Crises|publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|date=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A National Steering Committee (NSC) on IRCCs provides broad guidance for IRCCs to deepen inter-racial and inter-religious rapport within the community.

There are currently 89 IRCCs in Singapore, one for each constituency. 

==Recent developments==
===January 2007===
*On 13 January 2007, speaking at a forum for chairmen and members of IRCCs, Dr. [[Vivian Balakrishnan]], [[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (Singapore)|Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports]], challenged IRCCs to recruit more ethnic and religious leaders and build informal ties with cultural groups so that the confidence circles would be more representative of the ethnic and religious composition of their constituencies. This would help the nation to be better prepared in the event of a [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]]. He also suggested that IRCCs broaden their reach by working with grassroots organizations, sharing their networks and organizing events for residents. This way, they could reach out to a significant proportion of residents who might not be part of any ethnic- or religious-based organization. To prepare for a crisis, IRCCs should also devise "community mobilization plans", which would include steps to quell false, dangerous rumours that could spark communal incidents.&lt;ref name="ST: Challenge"/&gt;

{{Culture of Nigeria}}
[[Image:Nigeria Benin Cameroon languages.png|thumb|550px|A map of the major languages of Nigeria, Cameroon and Benin]]
There are perhaps 500 languages spoken in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/NG|title=Nigeria|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Atlas Of Nigerian Languages|last=Blench|first=Roger|publisher=Kay Williamson Educational Foundation|year=2014|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official language of Nigeria is [[English language|English]], the former language of colonial [[British Nigeria]]. As reported in 2003, [[Nigerian English]] and [[Nigerian Pidgin]] were spoken as a second language by 60 million people in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/NG/languages|title=Nigeria|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication in the English language is much more popular in the country's urban communities than it is in the rural areas, due to colonisation.

The major native languages, in terms of population, are [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (over 60 million, including L2), [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] (over 40 million), [[Igbo language|Igbo]] (about 30 million), [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] (15 million), [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] (10 million), [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] (8 million), [[Tiv language|Tiv]] (4 million), and approx. 2 million each of [[Edo language|Edo]], [[Igala language|Igala]], [[Nupe language|Nupe]], [[Izon language|Izon]] and [[Berom language|Berom]]. Nigeria's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of much of [[Africa]] as a whole, and the country contains languages from the three major [[Languages of Africa|African languages families]]: [[Afroasiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger–Congo]]. Nigeria also has several as-yet [[List of unclassified languages according to the Ethnologue#Africa|unclassified languages]], such as [[Centúúm]], which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.

==Niger–Congo languages==

[[Niger–Congo]] predominates in the Central, East and Southern areas of Nigeria; the main branches represented in Nigeria are [[Mande languages|Mande]], [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic]], [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Kwa languages|Kwa]], [[Benue–Congo]] and [[Adamawa–Ubangi]]. Mande is represented by the [[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]] cluster and [[Kyenga language|Kyenga]] in the northwest. [[Fulfulde]] is the single Atlantic language, of [[Senegambia]]n origin but now spoken by cattle [[pastoralists]] across the [[Sahel]] and largely in the northeastern states of Nigeria, especially [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]].

The [[Ijoid languages]] are spoken across the [[Niger Delta]] and include [[Ijoid languages|Ịjọ]] (Ijaw), Kalabari, and the intriguing remnant language [[Defaka language|Defaka]]. The [[Efik language]] is spoken across the coastal southeastern part of Nigeria and includes the dialects [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Annang language|Annang]], and [[Efik language|Efik]] proper. The single [[Gur language]] spoken is Baatọnun, in the extreme Northwest.

The Adamawa–Ubangian languages are spoken between central Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Their westernmost representatives in Nigeria are the Tula-Waja languages. The Kwa languages are represented by the Gun group in the extreme southwest, which is affiliated to the Gbe languages in Benin and Togo.

The classification of the remaining languages is controversial; [[Joseph Greenberg]] classified those without noun-classes, such as Yoruba, Igbo, and Ibibio (Efik, Ibibio, and Annang), as 'Eastern [[Volta–Niger languages|Kwa]]' and those with classes as '[[Benue–Congo]]'. This was reversed in an influential 1989 publication and reflected on the 1992 map of languages, where all these were considered [[Benue–Congo]]. Recent opinion, however, has been to revert to Greenberg's distinction. The literature must thus be read with care and due regard for the date. There are several small language groupings in the Niger Confluence area, notably Ukaan, Akpes, Ayere-Ahan and Ọkọ, whose inclusion in these groupings has never been satisfactorily argued.

Former Eastern [[Volta–Niger languages|Kwa]], i.e. West [[Benue–Congo]] would then include [[Igboid languages|Igboid]], i.e. [[Igbo language]] proper, [[Ukwuani]], [[Ikwerre language|Ikwerre]], [[Ekpeye]] etc., Yoruboid, i.e. [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Itsekiri]] and [[Igala language|Igala]], [[Akokoid]] (eight small languages in Ondo, Edo and Kogi state), [[Edoid]] including [[Edo language|Edo]] (sometimes referred to as) Bini in [[Edo State]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio-Efik]], [[Idomoid languages|Idomoid]] ([[Idoma language|Idoma]]) and [[Nupoid languages|Nupoid]] ([[Nupe language|Nupe]]) and perhaps include the other languages mentioned above. The [[Idoma language]] is classified in the Akweya subgroup of the Idomoid languages of the Volta–Niger family, which include Alago, Agatu, Etulo and Yala languages of Benue, Nasarawa and Northern Cross River states.

East [[Benue–Congo]] includes [[Kainji languages|Kainji]], [[Plateau languages|Plateau]] (46 languages, notably [[Gamai language]]), [[Jukunoid]], [[Dakoid]] and [[Cross River languages|Cross River]]. Apart from these, there are numerous [[Bantoid languages]], which are the languages immediately ancestral to Bantu. These include [[Mambiloid]], [[Ekoid]], [[Bendi languages|Bendi]], [[Beboid]], [[Grassfields Bantu languages|Grassfields]] and [[Tivoid languages]].

The geographic distribution of Nigeria's Niger-Congo languages is not limited to the middle east and south-central Nigeria, as migration allows their spread to the linguistically Afro-Asiatic northern regions of Nigeria, as well as throughout [[West Africa]] and abroad. Igbo words such as 'unu' for 'you people', 'sooso' for 'only', 'obia' for 'native doctoring', etc. are used in patois of Jamaica and many Central American nations, Yoruba is spoken as a ritual language in cults such as the Santeria in the Caribbean and South-Central America, and the Berbice Dutch language in Surinam is based on an Ijoid language.

Even the above listed linguistic diversity of the Niger–Congo in Nigeria is deceptively limiting, as these languages may further consist of regional dialects that may not be mutually intelligible. As such some languages, particularly those with a large number of speakers, have been standardized and received a [[romanization|romanized orthography]]. Nearly all languages appear in a Latin alphabet when written.

The Efik, Igbo, and Yoruba languages are notable examples of this process. The more historically recent standardization and romanization of Igbo have provoked even more controversy due to its dialectical diversity, but the Central Igbo dialect has gained the widest acceptance as the standard-bearer. Many such as [[Chinua Achebe]] have dismissed standardization as colonial and conservative attempts to simplify a complex mosaic of languages.

Such controversies typify inter- and intra-ethnic conflict endemic to post-colonial Nigeria. Also worthy of note is the Enuani dialect, a variation of the Igbo that is spoken among parts of Anioma. The Anioma are the Aniocha, Ndokwa/Ukwuani, Ika and Oshimilli of Delta state.
[[Standard Yoruba]] came into being due to the work [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel Crowther]], the first African bishop of the [[Anglican Church]] and owes most of its lexicon to the dialects spoken in [[Oyo State|Ọyọ]] and [[Ibadan]].

Since Standard Yoruba's constitution was determined by a single author rather than by a consensual linguistic policy by all speakers, the Standard has been attacked regarding for failing to include other dialects and spurred debate as to what demarcates "genuine Yoruba".
Linguistically speaking, all demonstrate the varying [[phonological]] features of the Niger–Congo family to which they belong, these include the use of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[nasalization|nasality]], and particular [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] systems; more information is available [[Niger–Congo#Common features|here]].

==Afroasiatic languages==

The [[Afroasiatic language]]s of Nigeria divide into Chadic, Semitic and Berber. Of these, [[Chadic]] languages predominate, with 700+ languages. Semitic is represented by various dialects of [[Arabic]] spoken in the Northeast and Berber by the Tuareg-speaking communities in the extreme Northwest.[[Image: Afro asiatic peoples nigeria.png|thumb|450px|A map showing [[Afroasiatic]] speaking peoples in Nigeria|left]]The [[Hausa language]] is the most well-known [[Chadic]] language in Nigeria mampoza; though there is a paucity of statistics on native speakers in Nigeria, the language is spoken by 24 million people in West Africa and is the second language of 15 million more. Hausa has therefore emerged as ''[[lingua franca]]'' throughout much of West Africa and the Sahel in particular. The language is spoken primarily amongst [[Muslims]], and the language is often associated with Islamic culture in Nigeria and West Africa on the whole.

Hausa is classified as a [[West Chadic languages|West Chadic language]] of the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] grouping, a major subfamily of Afroasiatic. Culturally, the [[Hausa people]] have become closely integrated with the Fulani following the establishment of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] by the Fulani [[Uthman dan Fodio]] in the 19th century. Hausa is the [[official language]] of a number states in Northern Nigeria and the most important dialect is generally regarded as that spoken in [[Kano]], an Eastern Hausa dialect, which is the standard variety used for official purposes.

Eastern dialects also include some dialects spoken in [[Zaria]], and [[Bauchi]]; Western Hausa dialects include Sakkwatanchi spoken in [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], Katsinanchi in Katsina Arewanchi in both [[Gobir]] and [[Adar]], [[Kebbi]], and [[Zamfara]]. [[Katsina]] is transitional between Eastern and Western dialects. Northern Hausa dialects include [[Arewa]] and [[Arawa language|Arawa]], while [[Zaria]] is a prominent Southern tongue version; [[Barikanchi]] is a [[pidgin]] formerly used in the military.

[[Hausa language|Hausa]] is a highly atypical [[Chadic]] language, with a reduced tonal system and a phonology influenced by [[Arabic]]. Other well-known Chadic languages include Ngas, Goemai, Mwaghavul, [[Bole language|Bole]], [[Ngizim language|Ngizim]], [[Bade language|Bade]] and Bachama. In the East of Nigeria and on into Cameroun are the Central Chadic languages, such as Bura, the Higi cluster and Marghi. These are highly diverse and remain very poorly described. Many Chadic languages are severely threatened; recent searches by Bernard Caron for Southern Bauchi languages show that even some of those recorded in the 1970s have disappeared. However, unknown Chadic languages are still being reported, witness the recent description of Dyarim.

Hausa, as well as other Afroasiatic languages like [[Bade language|Bade]] (another West Chadic language spoken in Yobe State), have historically been written in a modified [[Arabic script]] known as ''[[Ajami script|ajami]]'', however, the modern official orthography is now a romanization known as ''boko'' first introduced by the British regime in the 1930s.

==Nilo-Saharan languages==
The Nilosaharan language family is represented by Kanuri and Kanembu in the Northeastern part of Nigeria in the states of Borno, Yobe and parts of Jigawa and Bauchi states, as well as Zarma or Zabarma and Dendi spoken in the northwestern state of Kebbi near the border with the neighbouring country of Niger.

'''Luwati''' (Al-Lawatia (Arabic: اللواتية, sing. Lawati), also known as Lawatiyya, Lawatiya, Hyderabadi, Khoja or Khojki) is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] spoken by 5,000 to 10,000 people known as the Lawatiya (also called the Khojas or Hyderabadis) in the country of [[Oman]].&lt;ref name="academians.org" /&gt; In total it has been estimated there are 20,000 to 30,000 Lawatiya people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valeri|first=M|date=|title=Identity Politics and Nation-Building under Sultan Qaboos|url=|journal=Sectarian Politics in the Persian Golf|volume=179|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the various names, the Lawatiya refer to the language as Khojki.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al Jahdhami|first=S|date=|title=Minority Languages in Oman|url=|journal=Journal of the Association for Anglo-American Studies|volume=4|pages=105–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an endangered language because a portion of the Lawatiya do not speak Luwati, and it is not continuously passed down to younger generations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Classifications ==
The Luwati language is superficially similar to [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], but retains sounds found in other [[Sindhi languages]] and [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]] but that have been lost from Kutchi.&lt;ref name="academians.org"&gt;Salman, Amel &amp; Kharusi, Nafla S. (2012)  ‘The Sound System of Lawatiyya’, Journal of Academic and Applied Studies May Vol. 2(5), pp. 36–44, {{ISSN|1925-931X}}, available online @ www.academians.org&lt;/ref&gt; Luwati also bares similarities with other languages such as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], Kachichi, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asani|first=A|date=|title=The Khojkī Script: A Legacy of Ismaili Islam in the Indo-Pakistan Subcontinent|url=|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=3|pages=439–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other languages located in Oman, Luwati is influenced by the Omani dialect of Arabic.

== History ==
Originating from the Pakistani town of [[Sindh]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the Luwati language has had a presence in [[Oman]] for nearly four centuries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valeri|first=M|date=|title=High Visibility, Low Profile: The Shiʿa in Oman under Sultan Qaboos|url=|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=42|pages=251–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language and people were first mentioned historically by the Omani historian Ibn Ruzayq. The Lawatiya appeared to have settled in Oman in waves of immigration from Sindh between 1780 and 1880 bringing the language with them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Luwati is a minority language found in Oman specifically in the capital of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] as well as in the coastal towns of [[Saham]], Barka, Khabura, and Musana. It is spoken by 5,000 to 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="academians.org" /&gt;

==Phonology==
Luwati consists of 37 consonants, 10 vowels, and 3 diphthongs. Usually the world-level stress falls on the first syllable however in loan words from Arabic, it retains its original stress position.&lt;ref name="academians.org" /&gt;

'''Malto''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|t|oʊ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Malto}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Paharia''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|h|ɑr|i|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Paharia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, rarely, archaically, '''Rajmahali'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Rajmahali}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Northern Dravidian]] language spoken primarily in [[East India]].

== Varieties ==
There are two varieties of Malto that are sometimes regarded as separate languages, '''Kumarbhag Paharia''' ([[Devanagari]]: कुमारभाग पहाड़िया) and '''Sauria Paharia''' ([[Devanagari]]: सौरिया पहाड़िया). The former is spoken in the [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]] states of [[India]], and tiny pockets of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] state, and the latter in the West Bengal states of India, and some pockets of [[Bangladesh]]. The [[lexical similarity]] between the two is estimated to be 80%.

Although there is a high [[lexical similarity]] between the two languages, inherent intelligibility is inadequate. The similarities of the two sister languages do not translate into their current states being comparable. For instance, '''Sauria Paharia''' has thousands more speakers of the language and thus can sustain four different dialects: [[Litipara]], [[Godda]], [[Hiranpur]], and [[Sahibganj]]. Since the population of speakers of '''Kumarbhag Paharia''' is relatively miniature, the language has no prominent dialects. However, the language, where used, is used in all domains  and the speakers have a positive attitude about the cultural ties of the language as well as its continued existence.

[[Mal Paharia language]] may have a Malto-based [[Substratum (linguistics)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Masica |first=Colin P. |year=1993 |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages |series=Cambridge Language Surveys |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=26–27 |isbn=0521299446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 census found 224,926 speakers of Malto, of which 83,050 were labelled as speaking '''Pahariya''', and 141,876 spoke other mother tongues (dielects).&lt;ref name="census2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract of speakers’ strength of languages and mother tongues|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/%28S%282scoev45b4mhlg45mz5jq345%29%29/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.aspx|publisher=Census of India|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
Malto has a typical Dravidian vowel system of 10 vowels: /a, e, i, o, u/ and their lengthened forms. Malto also does not have any vowel clusters or dipthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n2DxBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=malto+phonology&amp;ots=wEwFQ06uDo&amp;sig=Up5SuG6eHs2z8rQy7wmnJhf6SZ4#v=onepage&amp;q=malto%20phonology&amp;f=false|title=The Dravidian Languages|last=Steever|first=Sanford B.|date=2015-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136911644|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The general grammar of the language is not dissimilar from that of the surrounding communities. One interesting aspect of their culture influencing the syntax of the language is present in its assignment of gender to nouns.

===Gender===
The gender of words in the Malto language is classified as either being masculine, feminine, or neutral. The masculine form is present when denoting anything related to man or vicious deities. Likewise the feminine form is present for nouns denoting women, the Supreme Being, and minor deities. Although the colloquial term for father 'abba' is a traditionally feminine noun, it is meant to show respect. Coupled with the Supreme Being also being feminine, the respect for the women of the community is evident through their grammar. Otherwise nouns are referred to with neutral gender, which by far makes it the most popular form.

==Writing system==
Seeing as how the literacy rates amongst the Malto people is very low, it makes sense that the language is not a traditionally written language.  When the language had first been memorialized in writing (by Ernest Droese in 1884) it shared the [[Devanagari]] writing system as with many languages in India.  The written portion of the language being supplemented much later on in its life, gives the effect of Malto remaining authentic through the dialogue of their culture.

[[File:Thrown, Combed tea bowl by Shoji Hamada (YORYM-2004.1.1957).JPG|thumb|Thrown, combed tea bowl by [[Shōji Hamada]]]]

{{nihongo|'''''Mingei'''''|民芸||"folk arts" or "arts of the people"}}, the [[Japan]]ese [[folk art]] movement, was developed in the late 1920s and 1930s in Japan. Its founding father was [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] (1889–1961).

==Origins==
In 1916, Yanagi made his first trip to [[Korea]] out of a curiosity for Korean crafts. The trip led to the establishment of the Korean Folk Crafts Museum in 1924, and the coining of the term ''mingei'' by Yanagi, potters [[Hamada Shōji]] (1894–1978) and [[Kawai Kanjirō]] (1890–1966). In 1926, the [[Folk Art]] Movement was formally declared by Yanagi Sōetsu. Yanagi rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period]] that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. In 1936, the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum was established.

==Theory==
The philosophical pillar of ''mingei'' is "hand-crafted art of ordinary people" ({{nihongo|民衆的な工芸|minshū-teki-na kōgei}}). Yanagi Sōetsu discovered beauty in everyday ordinary and utilitarian objects created by nameless and unknown craftsmen. According to Yanagi, utilitarian objects made by the common people are "beyond beauty and ugliness". Below are a few criteria of ''mingei'' art and crafts:

*made by anonymous crafts people
*produced by hand in quantity
*inexpensive
*used by the masses
*functional in daily life
*representative of the regions in which they were produced.

Yanagi's book ''The Unknown Craftsman'' has become an influential work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday crafts, including [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[lacquer]], [[textiles]], and [[woodwork]].

==Criticisms of Theory and Orientalism==
[[File:Thrown Bowl by Bernard Leach (YORYM-2004.1.166).JPG|thumb|Thrown bowl by [[Bernard Leach]]]]
In recent decades, scholars such as Yuko Kikuchi and Brian Moeran have claimed they have uncovered power relations and [[ultra-nationalism]] that lie at the core of the formation of ''mingei'' theory. In 1927, Yanagi put forward the "criterion of beauty in Japan" ({{lang|ja|日本における美の標準}} ''{{transl|ja|nihon ni okeru bi no hyōjun}}'') in ''The Way of Crafts'' ({{lang|ja|工芸の道}} ''{{transl|ja|kōgei no michi}}''). During the years of rising [[militarism]] in Japan, Sōetsu Yanagi extended his application of the "criterion of beauty" to the crafts of the [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawans]] and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in the Japanese peripheries, and to those of the [[Japanese colonies|colonies]] including [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Manchuria]]. These scholars argue that ''mingei'' theory, far from being an [[Oriental]] theory, is a "hybridization" and "appropriation" of [[Europe|Occidental]] ideas such as that of [[William Morris]] (1834–1896)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/2008/Nakanishi.html Wendy Jones Nakanishi, "The Anxiety of Influence: Ambivalent Relations Between Japan's 'Mingei' and Britain's 'Arts and Crafts' Movements", Electronic Journal of Japanese Studies, 28 October 2008'']&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) introduced when he lived and worked in Japan from 1909 to 1920.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Citation

Yūko Kikuchi terms this phenomenon "Oriental Orientalism".

Yanagi’s ''Korea and its Art'' was severely criticized by Korean intellectuals as a "colonialist view of history" in 1974. Yanagi defined "beauty of sadness" ({{lang|ja|悲哀の美}} ''{{transl|ja|hiai no bi}}'') as the "innate, original beauty created by the Korean race" ({{lang|ja|民族の固有の美}} ''{{transl|ja|minzoku no koyū no bi}}''). Yanagi believed that the long history of foreign invasions of Korea was reflected in Korean art, and especially in its [[pottery]], in the "sad and lonely" lines. Such a theory has been criticized by Korean scholars as the "aesthetic of [[colonialism]]".

{{Politics of Iraq}}
'''Minorities in Iraq''' include various ethnic and religious groups.

==Kurds==
{{main article|Iraqi Kurdistan}}
[[File:Flag of Kurdistan.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq]]

[[Kurds]] are an Indo-European people of the Iranian branch.  Ethnically and linguistically they are most closely related to Iranians and have existed in Iraq since before the Arab-Islamic conquest. They are possibly descended from the ancient [[Corduene]].

The majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims, with Shia and Alevi Muslim minorities. There are also a significant number of adherents to native Kurdish/Iranian religions like Yarsanism. Some Kurdish Communists and Socialists are [[Atheist]].

Under the Kingdom of Iraq, Kurdish leader [[Mustafa Barzani]] led a rebellion against the central government in [[Baghdad]] in 1945. After the failure of the uprising Barzānī and his followers fled to the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1960s, when Iraqi Brigadier [[Abdul-Karim Qassem]] distanced himself from Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], he faced growing opposition from pro-Egypt officers in the Iraqi army. When the garrison in [[Mosul]] rebelled against Qassem's policies, he allowed Barzānī to return from exile to help suppress the pro-Nasser rebels. By 1961, Barzānī and the Kurds began a full-scale rebellion.

When the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power in Iraq, the new government, in order to end the Kurdish revolt, granted the Kurds their own limited autonomy. However, for various reasons, including the pro-Iranian sympathies of some Kurds during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s, the regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a ''de facto'' civil war broke out. From March 29, 1987 until April 23, 1989, the infamous [[Al-Anfal campaign]], a systematic genocide of the Kurdish people in Iraq, was launched. For this, Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures, including the use of [[chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] against the Kurds, which resulted in thousands of deaths.

After the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the Kurds began another uprising against the Ba'athists. The revolt was violently put down. During the same year, [[Turkey]], fighting Kurds on its on territory, bombed Kurdish areas in Northern Iraq, claiming that bases for the terrorist [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] were located in the region. However, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the fall of Saddam, brought renewed hope to the Kurds. The newly elected Iraqi government agreed to re-establish the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] in Northern Iraq. The Kurds have since been working towards developing the area and pushing for democracy in the country. However, most Kurds overwhelmingly favor becoming an independent nation. "In the January 2005 Iraqi elections, 98.7 percent of Kurds voted for full independence rather than reconciliation with Arab Iraq."&lt;ref name="kurdishindependence"&gt;Viviano, Frank. "[http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0601/feature1/index.html The Kurds in Control]." ''National Geographic'', January 2006 pg 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost no other political or social group in the region is agreeable to the idea of Kurdish independence. Iraq's neighboring countries such as Turkey are particularly opposed to the movement because they fear that an independent Iraqi Kurdistan would strengthen Kurdish independence movements in their own territories.

[[Nouri al-Maliki]] was at loggerheads with the leader of ethnic Kurds, who brandished the threat of secession in a growing row over the symbolic issue of flying the Iraqi national flag at government buildings in the autonomous [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] north. Maliki's Arab Shi'ite-led government was locked in a dispute with the autonomous Kurdish regional government, which has banned the use of the Iraqi state flag on public buildings. The prime minister issued a blunt statement on Sunday saying: "The Iraqi flag is the only flag that should be raised over any square inch of Iraq." But [[Mesud Barzani]], president of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] region, told the Kurdish parliament the national leadership were "failures" and that the Iraqi flag was a symbol of his people's past oppression by Baghdad: "If at any moment we, the Kurdish people and parliament, consider that it is in our interests to declare independence, we will do so and we will fear no one." The dispute exposes a widening rift between [[Arab]]s and Kurds, the second great threat to Iraq's survival as a state after the growing sectarian conflict between Arab Sunnis and Shi'ites.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_825598"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411416/825598 |title=Iraq captures al Qaeda deputy |date=September 4, 2006 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920092440/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411416/825598 |archivedate=September 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christians==
{{Main article|Christianity in Iraq}}
Christianity has a presence in Iraq dating to the 1st century AD. The Christian community in Iraq is relatively small, and further dwindled due to the [[Iraq War]] to just several thousands. Most Christians in Iraq belong traditionally to [[Syriac Orthodox]] as well the [[Chaldean Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and are concentrated in small cities in the [[Nineveh Plains]], such as [[Alqosh]], [[Tel Keppe]], and [[Bartella]].

===Assyrians/Chaldeans===
{{main article|Assyrians in Iraq}}
[[File:FlagofAssyria.svg|thumb|Flag of the Assyrians]]

The [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians/Chaldeans]] are the indigenous people of Iraq and descendants of those who ruled ancient [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]. More generally speaking, the Assyrians (like the Mandeans) are descendants of the ancient [[Mesopotamian]]s (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra). They speak dialects of the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] of the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and have their own written script. They began to convert to Christianity in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD formerly having followed the ancient Sumerian-Akkadian religion (also known as [[Ashurism]]). There are believed to be no more than 500,000 Assyrians remaining in Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;Guide: Christians in the Middle East". BBC News. 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; with a large concentration in the diaspora. They are Iraq's third largest ethnic group after the Arabs and the Kurds.

The Assyrian minority came under persecution during Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime. When Hussein first assumed power, the Assyrian population there numbered 2 million to 2.5 million. Many have fled to neighboring countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]], or have emigrated to [[Europe]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] The [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]] reports that half a million [[Iraqi Christians]] have registered for temporary asylum in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaldean.org/news/detail.asp?iData=225&amp;iCat=80&amp;iChannel=2&amp;nChannel=News |accessdate=February 20, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrians have traditionally made good soldiers, during the Iran–Iraq War, many were recruited to the armies of both sides.

Currently, Assyrians face persecution from Kurds, as [[Kurdification]] attempts at Assyrian cities are in progress. This was after the Kurdish takeover of Assyrian towns in the Kurdistan region (such as [[Zakho]], [[Ainkawa]], [[Aqrah]], etc.) and the forceful deportation and killing of Christians in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http:// uk.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-gharawi-spe- cial-report-idUSKCN0I30Z820141014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armenians in Iraq|Armenians]] are [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christians]]. Armenians have a long history of association with [[Mesopotamia]], going back to pre-Christian times. The Armenians have historically been a thriving community in Iraq with [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs (Nadi Armeni) and other establishments. Armenian folk music and dance is admired in Iraq. Most Iraqi Armenians live in [[Baghdad]], [[Mosul]], and [[Basra]] and their population is estimated at around 10,000 down from 70,000 before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Իրաքում ընդհանուր առմամբ մնացել է շուրջ 10 հազար հայ [Around 10 thousand Armenians remain in Iraq]|url=http://news.am/arm/news/83971.html|accessdate=27 January 2013|date=30 November 2011|newspaper=News.am|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other groups==

===Africans===
{{Main article|Afro-Iraqis}}

The [[Afro Iraqis|Iraqis of largely African descent]] live mostly around the city of [[Basra]], having been brought to the region as slaves over one thousand years ago to work the [[sugarcane]] plantations then in existence. Although they are [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic-speakers]], Afro-Iraqis also retain some cultural and religious traditions from their ancestral homeland. They suffer considerable discrimination due to their behaviour, and, as a result, are restricted to working as entertainers or menial laborers. Moreover, they are often addressed by other Iraqis as '''abd'', meaning "slave". In the mid-9th century, black slaves around Basra rose in a rebellion, conquering their former masters and ruling the city for 15 years before being put down by forces sent by the [[Caliph]] in Baghdad. After the fall of the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime, Afro-Iraqis have once again begun to struggle for an improvement in their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96977550| title=Black Iraqis in Basra Face Racism| publisher=NPR| date=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a [[Semitic people]].

The Iraq Mandaean (and Sabian) community, in the pre 1990 gulf war period, was the most important in the world with 30,000–50,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandaeanworld.com/who.html Who are the Mandaeans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315070501/http://www.mandaeanworld.com/who.html |date=March 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 70,000 total living in the country mainly in the area around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Mandaeans although an ethnic and religious minority, consider themselves Iraqi and have supported the Iraqi nation patriotically, serving in the army during various conflicts. They were considered an economically successful community, and had achieved high levels in Iraqi society, and are held in high regard as silversmiths and goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011659/http://www.hrwf.net/religiousfreedom/news/iraq2001.html#SaddampraisesSabaeans Saddam praises Sabaeans, pledges to build temple]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are an Indo-European (Aryan) people and speak an Indo-European language with elements of Turkish and Arabic infused. Despite having their own language and culture unique from other groups, Kurdish authorities have attempted to [[Kurdification|Kurdify]] the Shabaks by occupying Shabak villages and referring to them as "Kurdish Shabaks". In 2005, two Assyrians were killed and four Shabaks were wounded by the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]] during a demonstration organized by the Democratic Shabak Coalition, a group which wants separate representation for the Shabak community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aina.org/news/20050816114539.htm| title=Kurdish Gunmen Open Fire on Demonstrators in North Iraq| publisher=AINA| date=2005-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are around 650,000 Yezidis in Iraq who come from northern Iraq. They speak Aramaic but they also speak Kurmanji. The Ezidis are believed to be the ancient Sumerians. They have their own distinct religion which combines distinct aspects of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Mithraism, Mandaeans and Zoroastrianism, though its origins are not understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140809-iraq-yazidis-minority-isil-religion-history/ | work=National Geographic | title=Who Are the Yazidis, the Ancient, Persecuted Religious Minority Struggling to Survive in Iraq? | date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most speak Kurdish, but some speak Arabic.

== Background ==
'''Jamie Nabozny''' (born October 1975) went to the local public middle school in the small Wisconsin town of [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]], where his parents Bob and Carol Nabozny had grown up. His parents had a rocky relationship, which wasn't helped by poverty. In spite of this, he managed to do well in school. Bullies at Nabozny's school believed him to be effeminate and "girlish" and bullied him. The harassment reached a point where at age 13, Nabozny complained to his parents who decided to send him to live with an uncle and aunt temporarily who would [[homeschooling|homeschool]] him. Nabozny's aunt consoled him for the bullying and he shared with her the secret that he was gay but this disclosure did not fit with her religious beliefs. Nabozny ran away, and his aunt informed the police who investigated his running away and in the course of their investigation disclosed Nabozny's sexuality to his parents. His mother Carol was supportive and loving, but his father Bob reacted in anger, storming out of the room after telling Jamie that it was simply a phase.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Carlos A.|title=From the Closet to The Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Mass|isbn=9780807001530|chapter=Harassment|pages=67–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabozny's return to middle school led to the harassment recommencing. He told a school counselor that he had been called a "queer", a "faggot" and a "fudge packer" among other terms and confirmed to the counselor that he was indeed gay and did not wish to deny this. The counselor attempted to intervene and get the bullies to stop but it resumed shortly after the intervention.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt; A new counselor arrived at the school who also attempted to make the bullying stop by involving the school principal, Mary Podlesny.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacqueline A. Stefkovich|title=Best Interests of the Student: Applying Ethical Constructs to Legal Cases in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-da2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168|date=October 23, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92069-2|pages=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intervention of the principal, the abuse soon resumed and now started including physical violence—hits, kicks and elbows.

In addition to Nabozny's sexual orientation, another fact led into his bullying. At age 11, Jamie Nabozny was molested by an 18-year-old church youth group leader named Nick Rising. He kept this abuse secret until Rising attempted to molest Jamie's younger brother. Rising was arrested, pleaded guilty at trial and went to jail. The scandal was reported in a local newspaper. A number of the bullies who were harassing Nabozny were friendly with Rising and blamed Nabozny for reporting the sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Nabozny's parents complained repeatedly about the bullying but after no action was taken by the principal, they pulled Jamie out of school and transferred him to a Catholic middle school to finish seventh grade.&lt;ref name="Conn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Conn|title=Bullying and Harassment: A Legal Guide for Educators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlJhbm0gLZUC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2004|publisher=ASCD|isbn=978-1-4166-0014-5|pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the tuition fees meant that he dropped out shortly after starting eighth grade. Jamie Nabozny had to return to the middle school where he endured more harassment, homophobic language and physical violence. In one incident, Jamie and his brother Corey were physically assaulted by a group of boys in the bathrooms.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Following this harassment, Bob and Carol Nabozny complained again to the school and demanded a meeting with the Principal. At the meeting with the Nabozny family and a number of the boys who Jamie had accused of bullying, the Principal took the word of the bullies and then also later told Jamie Nabozny that if he continued to be [[Coming out|out]] about his sexual orientation at school, the bullying would continue. The bullies faced no disciplinary actions and the harassment continued. Following a number of bullies verbally abusing him, inappropriately touching him and then enacting a mock rape&lt;ref name="Mezey2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt; while the rest of his class watched, Nabozny went to the principal who told him that "boys will be boys"&lt;ref name="Biegel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Biegel|title=The Right to be Out: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQmS0_RHxt4C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7457-2|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LINDBRZUZY2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amy Lind|author2=Stephanie Brzuzy|title=Battleground: Women, Gender, and Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdoIS5YdygkC&amp;pg=PA576|date=December 30, 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08800-1|pages=576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonished him for entering her office without an appointment. The continued bullying at middle school led to Nabozny attempting suicide, after which he refused to return to middle school.

At high school, the same bullies returned and the harassment continued. At one point, Nabozny was attacked while at a urinal and urinated upon by another boy.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betsy Kuhn|title=Gay Power!: The Stonewall Riots and the Gay Rights Movement, 1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRJp2Bs_tlUC&amp;pg=PA112|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-7613-7275-2|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Davis, the principal at the high school continued the inaction—the perpetrators were not disciplined and the only advice Davis gave to Nabozny was to go home to change his clothes. He attempted suicide for a second time.

Nabozny's parents attempted to send him to live with an aunt and uncle in [[Drummond, Wisconsin]], but his uncle was hostile to his homosexuality, leading him to run away from them and hitch-hike to [[Minneapolis]]. Bob and Carol Nabozny attempted to find him in Minneapolis and distributed 'missing child' posters. Nabozny phoned the number listed on one of the posters and was reunited with his parents. Nabozny told his parents that he refused to return to the high school. They sought to homeschool him but were legally forbidden as neither had a high school diploma. They could not afford to send him to a private school, and the only private school nearby was a Christian fundamentalist school. The school district demanded that Jamie return to high school, where the bullying started again.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Nabozny's parents requested the local social services department put him into foster care out of the district so he could attend school elsewhere. At the new school, the bullying that Nabozny suffered was promptly resolved by the school. The new school seemed to boost his happiness and self-confidence as well as his grades. The social worker who had moved Nabozny demanded that he move back to his parents during tenth grade. He then had to return to the high school in Ashland, where the bullying restarted. The school continued to ignore the bullying and assistant principal Thomas Blaumert told Nabozny that his harassment was due to him provoking them and that he deserved the punishment because of his sexuality.&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt; Blaumert also laughed when Nabozny was pushed and tripped in the hallway.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

For over four years, no school official took any disciplinary action in response to Nabozny's reports. In the eleventh grade, he was attacked in the school library by a group of boys, one of whom repeatedly kicked him in the stomach&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011" /&gt; which caused him to have pain and a stomach cramp for weeks. The internal bleeding and bruising required surgery.

In December 1992, Nabozny collected together over $100 in cash and ran away from Ashland and took a bus to Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, he moved in with a gay church deacon and his partner who served as foster parents. He was diagnosed with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[post traumatic stress disorder]]&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt; and spent years in therapy. Eventually, he completed his [[GED]] and became a student at the [[University of Minnesota]] and studied for a degree in psychology.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

== The case ==
Nabozny decided to sue the school district and was represented by [[Lambda Legal]], an LGBT legal organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Lambda Legal]]|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nabozny-v-podlesny.html|title=Nabozny v. Podlesny|accessdate=December 12, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725165752/http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nabozny-v-podlesny?qt-related_conent_for_cases=2#qt-related_conent_for_cases|archivedate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had made a policy decision in 1995 to take cases involving youth issues. Nabozny was represented by Patricia Logue, a lawyer (and lesbian) who had previously worked in corporate law before taking a job with Lambda in Chicago in 1993 along with Michael Terrien an attorney with Skadden Arps Meagher and Flom LLP. She had previously helped a black LGBT group change the policy of the [[Bud Billiken Parade]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Baim2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Baim|title=Out and Proud in Chicago: An Overview of the City's Gay Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoLGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188|date=September 1, 2008|publisher=Surrey Books|isbn=978-1-57284-100-0|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought against the school district as well as a number of the school officials. Nabozny's lawyers argued that his rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to equal protection and due process had been violated by the school's failure to protect him as a member of a discernible minority group, namely gay people. They also argued that his rights under Wisconsin law to not be discriminated against were violated by the school district. The plaintiffs also pointed to the existence of school anti-harassment policies and argued that they were being enforced in a discriminatory manner: when sexist abuse was reported by female students, it was quickly stopped by school officials in a way they did not do for homophobic bullying.&lt;ref name="Biegel2010" /&gt;

The District Court made a summary judgment in favor of the school district. Nabozny appealed to the Seventh Circuit federal appeals court which found that the school district had infringed his equal protection rights on the grounds of combined gender and sexual orientation discrimination, but rejected the due process claim.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

Judge [[Jesse E. Eschbach]] concluded in his judgment:

: The defendants ask us to affirm the grant of qualified immunity because "there was no clear duty under the Equal Protection Clause for the individual defendants to enforce every student complaint of harassment by other students the same way." The defendants are correct in that the Equal Protection Clause does not require the government to give everyone identical treatment. Nothing we say today suggests anything to the contrary. The Equal Protection Clause does, however, require the state to treat each person with equal regard, as having equal worth, regardless of his or her status. The defendants' argument fails because they frame their inquiry too narrowly. The question is not whether they are required to treat every harassment complaint the same way: as we have noted, they are not. The question is whether they are required to give male and female students equivalent levels of protection; they are, absent an important governmental objective, and the law clearly said so prior to Nabozny's years in middle school.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

== Reception and significance ==
Catherine A. Lugg, a professor of education at [[Rutgers University]], said that the facts of the case "clearly illustrates the public school's historic power as the ''enforcer'' of expected norms regarding gender, [[heteronormativity]] and homophobia" and also shows "how devastating a homophobic public school culture can be for queer children".&lt;ref name="CarlsonGause2007" /&gt;

In 1997, the Department of Education clarified that [[Title IX]] requires schools to provide students with an environment free of harassment and that this requirement includes gay and lesbian students.&lt;ref name="Stewart2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chuck Stewart|title=Gay and Lesbian Issues: A Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdKvt-GoidYC&amp;pg=PA59|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-372-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''Nabozny'' case, other students who have brought similar cases have generally won. Such cases include:&lt;ref name="Biegel2010" /&gt;
* a student in Minnesota called Jesse Montgomery&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt;
* a California student named George Loomis who suffered homophobic abuse from teachers and students. One teacher said of Loomis' ear rings: "Only two kinds of guys wear earrings, pirates and faggots, and I don't see any water around here." Loomis' case was settled in 2002 by the [[Visalia Unified School District]] for $130,000.&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/groundbreaking-federal-lawsuit-settlement-school-agrees-strongest-anti-gay-hara|title=In Groundbreaking Federal Lawsuit Settlement, School Agrees To Strongest Anti-Gay Harassment Program in Nation|date=August 13, 2002|publisher=ACLU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campos2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Campos|title=Understanding Gay and Lesbian Youth: Lessons for Straight School Teachers, Counselors, and Administrators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgiLaDY34AIC&amp;pg=PA89|date=September 28, 2005|publisher=R&amp;L Education|isbn=978-1-4616-5527-5|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the students—Alana Flores—had a note taped to her locker reading "Die, die, dyke bitch. Fuck off. We'll kill you." After reporting this to the school principal, she was told: "You need to go back to class. Don't bring me this trash anymore. This is disgusting." The case settled on January 6, 2004, and the school district is now required to provide training on homophobic harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/case-background-flores-v-morgan-hill-unified-school-district|title=Case background: Flores v.

'''National Libraries Day''' is an annual event in the UK dedicated to the celebration of libraries and librarians.  The inaugural event was held on 4 February 2012.&lt;ref name=main&gt;{{cite web |title=National Libraries Day official website |url=http://www.nationallibrariesday.org.uk/2011/09/national-libraries-day-4-feb-2012-save-the-date/ |accessdate=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web |title= Support your library while you still can - The Herald|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/support-your-library-while-you-still-can.16564581 |accessdate=January 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate National Libraries Day, events including author talks and competitions are organised across the country by local authorities, universities, other providers of library services and local community groups.

[[Channel 4]]'s Culture Editor, Matthew Cain, described the 2012 National Libraries Day as "most important" due to the "serious concern about the future for libraries".&lt;ref name=channel4&gt;{{cite web |title= A library fit for the future - Matthew Cain's blog|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/culture/library-future/2198 |accessdate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Children's Laureate]] [[Julia Donaldson]] released a poem to mark the day,&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title= Julia Donaldson poem against library closures - The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9059937/Julia-Donaldson-poem-against-library-closures.html |accessdate=February 5, 2012 | location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Martin |last=Chilton |date=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that if we "lose libraries, we would lose readers and we would become a less literate country".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title= Children's laureate Julia Donaldson pens protest poem - BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16878453 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 | work=BBC News |date=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 event was scheduled to take place on 9 February 2013.&lt;ref name=CILIP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Libraries Day takes place on Saturday 9 February 2013 - CILIP |url=http://www.cilip.org.uk/news-media/pages/news121116.aspx |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20121118182354/http://www.cilip.org.uk/news-media/Pages/news121116.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Following Save our Libraries Day in 2011,&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title= Protests across the UK expected for Save Our Libraries Day - The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/04/protests-save-our-libraries-day |accessdate=February 2, 2012 | location=London |first=Benedicte |last=Page |date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; author and library campaigner [[Alan Gibbons]] proposed that the first day in February be made National Libraries Day after receiving emails suggesting that there should be a chance to "celebrate our libraries".&lt;ref name=bookseller2&gt;{{cite web |title= Gibbons proposes National Libraries Day - The Bookseller|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/gibbons-proposes-national-libraries-day.html |accessdate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2011, Gibbons announced that:

{{quote|text=We are delighted to launch National Libraries Day, a week of events in early February leading to a day of celebration of reading, libraries and librarians around the United Kingdom. A reading child is a successful child. A child who goes to the library is twice as likely to be a good reader and that child becomes a literate adult, a lifelong reader. There are 320 million visits a year to our libraries but we can make them even more popular.&lt;ref name=CILIP&gt;{{cite web |title= National Libraries Day launched - CILIP website|url=http://www.cilip.org.uk/news-media/pages/news110526.aspx |accessdate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Alan Gibbons]]|source=[[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] website}}

The '''Nuer people''' are a [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic group primarily inhabiting the [[Nile#In South Sudan|Nile Valley]]. They are concentrated in [[South Sudan]], with some also found in [[Gambela Region|southwestern Ethiopia]]. They speak the [[Nuer language]], which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.  As one of the largest ethnic groups in southern Sudan, the Nuer people are pastoralist who herd cattle for a living. The cattle of the Nuer people serve as companions and a lifestyle.&lt;ref name=HUTCH1992&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=Sharon |year=1992 |title=The Cattle of Money and the Cattle of Girls among the Nuer, 1930-83 |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=19| issue=2|pages= 294–316 |doi=10.1525/ae.1992.19.2.02a00060 |jstor=645038}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they refer to themselves as "Nath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Robert|title=The Nuer |url=https://gsu.kanopystreaming.com/video/nuer |website=Kanopy streaming|publisher=Kanopy|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuer people have historically been under-counted as a result of the semi-nomadic lifestyle in which the community engages, as well as a lack of proper national census information about the community. In addition, the Nuer also have a culture of counting only older members of the family. For example, the Nuer believes that counting the number of children one has could result in misfortune and the community prefer to report fewer number of children when in fact they have many children.

==History==
The nature of relations among the various southern Sudanese tribes was greatly affected in the 19th century by the intrusion of the [[British Empire|British]]. Some ethnic groups made their accommodation with the colonizers and others did not, in effect pitting one southern ethnic group against another in the context of foreign rule. For example, some sections of the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] supported colonial rule which was resisted by the Nuer. The Dinka treated the resisting Nuer as hostile, and hostility developed between the two groups as a result of their differing relationships to the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sudan/39.htm |title=Sudan - Non-Muslim Peoples |website=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different accounts of the origin of the conflict between the Nuer and the Dinka, South Sudan's two largest ethnic groups. Anthropologist Peter J. Newcomer suggests that neither the Nuer nor the Dinka are intrusive and that the Nuer are actually Dinka. He argues that hundreds of years of population growth created expansion, which eventually led to raids and wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcomer|first=Peter J.|year=1972|title=The Nuer Are Dinka: An Essay on Origins and Environmental Determinism|journal=Man|series=New Series |volume=7|issue=1|pages= 5–11|jstor=2799852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Nuer were the tribe that resisted disarmament most strongly. Members of the [[Nuer White Army]], a group of armed youths often autonomous of tribal elders' authority, refused to lay down their weapons, which led SPLA soldiers to confiscate Nuer cattle, destroying their economy. The White Army was finally put down in mid-2006,&lt;ref name="sas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/pdfs/HSBA-SWP-5-White-Army.pdf|publisher=Small Arms Survey|title=The White Army: An Introduction and Overview|first=John|last=Young|date=June 2007|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a successor organisation self-styling itself as a White Army formed in 2011 to fight the [[Murle people|Murle]] tribe (see [[2011–2012 South Sudan tribal clashes]]), as well as the Dinka and [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan|UNMISS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/S-Sudan-youth-planning-to-attack-tribe-20111226|agency=News24|title=Sudan youth 'planning to attack tribe'|website=News24.com|date=27 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Cattle have historically been of the highest symbolic, religious and economic value among the Nuer. Sharon Hutchinson notes that "...among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle were continually underplayed."&lt;ref name=HUTCH1992/&gt; Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband's lineage to his wife's lineage. It is this exchange of cattle which ensures that the children will be considered to belong to the husband's lineage and to his line of descent. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can "father" children after his death, is based on this ability of cattle exchanges to define relations of [[kinship and descent]]. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife's patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry, and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage.  A barren woman can even take a wife of her own, whose children (obviously biologically fathered by men from outside unions) then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to participate in reproduction in a metaphorical sense.

=== Cattle ===
The life of the Nuer people primarily depends on [[cattle]] which has shaped them into being a [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] group, but sometimes they are known to resort to [[horticulture]] as well. If they weren't threatened by the numerous diseases cattle could catch then they would solely rely on pastoralism. Due to the seasons of harsh weather, the Nuer move around time after time to ensure that their primary source of living is safe. They tend to travel when heavy seasons of rainfall come to protect the cattle from getting hoof disease, or when there is a scarcity of resources for the cattle. British anthropologist [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|E.E. Evans-Pritchard]] noted: “They depend on the herds for their very existence...Cattle are the thread that runs through Nuer [[Institution|institutions,]] [[language]], [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], [[politics]], [[economy]], and [[allegiance]]s.“{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|pp=164–165}} If they didn't have cattle most of their traditions or other characteristics shaped by cattle in their culture would be altered.

Cattle is their primary resource that can be utilized in more than one way. They are able to structure their entire [[culture]] around cattle and still have what they need. Times before development the Nuer used every single piece of cattle to their advantage. E.E.Evans-Pritchard describes the characteristics that are revolved around cattle: Cattle helped evolve the Nuer culture into what it may be today. It has shaped the daily duties of the Nuer as they are seen to dedicate themselves to protecting and ensuring safety to the cattle. One can see their true dedication for cattle in times of bad health. For example, each month they place their faces into the ass of their cattle blowing air to relieve or keep them from constipation. Cattle are no good to the Nuer if they are [[Constipation|constipated]] because they are restricted from producing primary resources that families need to survive. E.E. Evans-Pritchard learned that, "The importance of cattle in Nuer life and thought is further exemplified in personal names."{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=18}} They structure the names of their children off of biological features of the cattle themselves.

E.E. Evans-Pritchard noted that, "I have already indicated that this obsession—for such it seems to an outsider is due not only to the great economic value of cattle but also to the fact that they are links in numerous social relationships."{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=19}} All of their raw materials come from these cattle things such as drums, rugs, clothing, spears, shields, containers, and leather goods. There isn’t one single part of the cattle that the Nuer throw away. As they have purpose for ritual intent, churning cheese and even to cleanse the body. Even daily essentials found in common cultures like toothpaste and mouthwash are created with the cattle’s dung and urine. They even use the cattle's dung for everyday use. What they do is gather the dung that the cattle have extracted overnight and put them in big abundant piles. Once they have them in piles they chop the dung into smaller pieces and leaves it out to hardened. From there they use it for whatever resource they may need like containers, toothpaste, or even to protect the cattle themselves. They protect the cattle by feeding the dung to the fire allowing it to produce more smoke keeping insects away from cattle to prevent them from catching a disease.

The Nuer people never eat cattle just because they want to. Cattle are very sacred to them, therefore when they do eat cattle they honor its ghost. They typically just eat the cattle that is up in age on dying because of sickness. But even if they do so, they all gather together performing rituals,dances or songs before and after they slaughter the cattle. Never do they just kill cattle for the fun of it. “Never do Nuer slaughter animals solely because the desire to eat meat. There is the danger of the ox’s spirit visiting a curse on any individual who would slaughter it without ritual intent, aiming only to use it for food. Any animal that dies of natural causes is eaten.”{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|pp=164–165}} Many times it may not even just be cattle that they consume, it could be any animal they have scavenged upon that has died because of natural causes. There are a few other food sources that are available for the Nuer to consume. The Nuer diet primarily consists of fish and millet. “Their staple crop is millet."{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=160}} [[Millet]] is formally consumed as [[porridge]] or beer. The Nuer turn to this staple product in seasons of rainfall when they move their cattle up to higher ground. They might also turn to millet when the cattle are performing well enough to support their family.

=== Kinship ===
Kinship dynamic is different with the Nuer. To a Nuer individual, his parents and siblings are not considered mar (blood relatives) kin. He doesn't refer to them as kin. To him they are considered gol which is far more intimate and significant. There are kinship categories in the Nuer society. Those categories depend on the payment to them. There is a balance between the mother and father's side that is acknowledged through particular formal occasions such as marriage.&lt;ref name=EP1951&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kinship and Marriage among the Nuer|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E.E|publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a young girl gets engaged at an early age,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} the wedding and consummation ceremonies are essentially delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she is able to freely choose her husband. Her parents may choose a spouse for her, but they must ask for her consent.&lt;ref name=EP1951/&gt;

==== Kinship roles ====
[[Kinship]] among the Nuer is very important to them, they refer to their blood relatives as ``gol”. Kinship within the Nuer is formed off of one’s neighbors or their entire culture. During E.E.Evans-Pritchard’s ethnographic observation, he described the role of kinship as: “Kinship obligations include caring for the children of one’s kin and neighbors. He also observed that,"The network of kinship ties which links members of local communities is brought about by the operation of exogamous rules, often stated in terms of cattle."{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=17}} This is never thought to be the sole responsibility of the child’s parents."{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=163}} Cattle are judged by how much milk they can produce which is a necessity in their culture. If possible they create the excess of milk into cheese. But if a family’s herd cannot produce the amount of milk a family needs then they turn to other around them to give them what they need. It’s seen as their responsibility to step in and help the family since it’s not really their fault on how much their cattle can produce. The entire Nuer society is basically watching after each other, for example, as Evans-Pritchard noted that,“When one household has a surplus, it is shared with neighbors. Amassing wealth is not an aim. Although a man who owns a large herd of cattle may be envied, his possession of numerous animals does not garner him any special privilege or treatment.”{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=165}} In this tribe there is no special treatment for how one is treated because of their abundance in cattle. Just because one might have more cattle than another doesn't mean they have a higher prestige. If one might have more than enough to provide for themselves then they also provide that to other kin that are in need, as it is a part of their role in kinship.

=== Religion ===
[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] studied the Nuer and made very detailed accounts of his interactions. He also describes Nuer [[cosmology]] and religion in his books.

Nuer Online indicates that, "Nuer (Nuäär) believes that God is the spirit of the sky or the spirit who is in the sky” Kuoth Nhial” (God in Heaven) the creator, but Nuers believe in the coming of God through rain, lightning and thunder, and that the rainbow is the necklace of God. The sun and the moon as well as other material entities are also manifestation or sign of God, who after all is a spirit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The spirits of the air above are believed to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuers believe that when a man or a woman dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.".

In the 1940s, missionaries began to attempt to evangelize the Nuer. The book of Genesis was translated and published in 1954, with the whole New Testament following in 1968. By the 1970s, there were nearly 200 Nuer congregations established. However, reporting indicates that only around 1% of Nuer identify as Christian.

=== Role of Cattle ===
In the 1990s, Sharon Hutchinson returned to [[Nuerland]] to update E.E. Evans-Pritchard's account. She found that the Nuer had placed strict limits on the convertibility of money and cattle in order to preserve the special status of cattle as objects of bride wealth exchange and as mediators to the divine.  She also found that as a result of endemic warfare with the [[Sudan|Sudanese state]], guns had acquired much of the symbolic and ritual importance previously held by cattle.

=== Language ===
The people speak the [[Nuer language|Nuer language / Thoknath]] which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan]] [[Phylum (linguistics)|language phylum]].

=== Ritual ===
The Nuer receive facial markings (called ''gaar'') as part of their initiation into adulthood.
The pattern of Nuer [[scarification]] varies within specific subgroups. The most common initiation pattern among males consists of six parallel horizontal lines which are cut across the forehead with a razor, often with a dip in the lines above the nose. Dotted patterns are also common (especially among the Bul Nuer and among females).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Nuer adopted the practice of [[circumcision]] as part of the process of assimilation other ethnic groups. The Nuer are not historically known to circumcise, but on rare occasions, may participate as part "of ritual in their belief systems". For instance, The Nuer occasionally perform circumcisions to cleanse people who have engaged in the act of incest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Typical foods eaten by the Nuer tribe include beef, goat, cow's milk, [[mango]]s, and [[sorghum]] in one of three forms: "ko̱p" finely ground, handled until balled and boiled, "walwal" ground, lightly balled and boiled to a solid porridge, and [[injera / Yɔtyɔt]], a large, pancake-like [[yeast]]-risen [[flatbread]].

In the early 1990s about 25,000 African refugees were [[third country resettlement|resettled]] in the United States throughout different locations such as South Dakota, Tennessee and Minnesota. In particular, 4,288 refugees from Sudan were resettled among 36 different states between 1990 and 1997 with the highest number in Texas at 17 percent of the refugee population from Sudan.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=65}}

The Nuer refugees in the United States and those in Africa continue to observe their social obligations to one another. They use different means ranging from letters to new technologically advanced communication methods in order to stay connected to their families in Africa. Nuer in the United States provide assistance for family members’ paperwork to help their migration process to the United States. Furthermore, Nuer in the United States observe family obligations by sending money for those still in Africa.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=160}}

== Nuer military and political leaders ==
Some important Nuer politicians are Both Diu was the first Nuer and South Sudan Politician from 1947 and follow by Gai Tut in Military is Bol Nyawan who fought against the [[Khartoum]] government in [[Bentiu]]; he was killed in 1985 by the current president of Sudan. Commander Ruai and Liah Diu Deng were responsible for the attack that forced Chevron to suspend activities in the oil field around 1982.

==Naming conventions==
* ''(Nya) Nyada meaning "daughter all females begin with (Nya) of", is the standard prefix used for female names. ''Gat'', meaning "son of", is a common prefix for male names.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* Children are commonly given names to mark historical events ("Dɔmaac" meaning "bullet", or ''Mac'' meaning "fire or gun" given to a child born during times of war or from another man in the name of the deceased father who legally married the mother ).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''Nhial'' means "rain", and is a common name for males.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
*Many Nuer have been exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a given name and always in Nuer. The father's given name follows the child's given name, which is then followed by the grandfather's name, and so on. Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry those names themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
*When a Nuer comes to the Western world, which wants a first and last name, it is their custom to give their name as their first name followed by their father's name as their middle name and their grandfather's name as their last name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* After the civil war, the Nuer began accepting cash currency into their economy, changing the dynamics of their cattle and how they were viewed. Each type of cattle is titled according to how they are acquired such as: "the cattle of money" (purchased with cash currency) and "the cattle of girls/daughters" (bridewealth).&lt;ref name=HUTCH1992/&gt;

Most Nuer people are named after their cattle. The boys usually chose the name of their favorite cattle based on the form and color of the ox. The girls are named after the cows that they milk. Sometimes the cow names are passed down.{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016}}

==Impact of Oil Economy on Nuer==
Oil exploration and drilling began in 1975 and 1976 by companies such as Chevron.  In 1979 the first oil production took place in the southern regions of Darfur. In the early 1980s when the North-South war was happening, Chevron was interested in the reserves in the south.  In 1984 guerrillas of SPLA (Sudan People’s Liberation Army) attacked the drilling site of the north at Bentiu.  In return, Chevron cleared Nuer and Dinka people in the oil fields area to ensure security for their operations.{{sfnp|Lobban|2010|p=104}}

The Nuer-Dinka struggle in oil fields continued in late 1990s into the early 2000s. The struggle for oil production was not only manifested in North-South fight, but also in Nuer-Dinka and many internal conflicts among Nuer.{{sfnp|Lobban|2010|p=106}}

As part of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), 50 percent of net revenues of southern oil fields were given to the government of southern Sudan as a solution to one of the sources of decades of civil conflict.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=21}}

An '''[[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]'s crown''' represents the highest level of authority vested in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] rulers. Referred to as an '''ade''', the bead-embroidered crown is the foremost attribute of the ruler. An oba's crown may also be referred to as an '''adenla''', or great crown. Andenlas are elaborate conical headdresses, like the ade, but feature a heavily beaded veil that covers the face. In his article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, "The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African art &amp; leadership|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299058204|pages=227–260|authorlink=The Sign of the Divine King: Yoruba Bead-Embroidered Crowns with Veil and Bird Decorations|editor=Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
After being consecrated as leader, a Yoruba oba must not reveal his face to the public. Instead, he wears an ade or adenla. Oba crowns typically feature at least one stylized face depicted in applied beadwork and designed to identify the king when appearing in public. Some examples of crowns have more than one face. Although their significance is unknown, depictions are frequently associated with [[Odùduwà]], and suggest a shared destiny between a leader and his predecessors.  Crowns embody the continuity of office, regardless of who may hold it at a particular point in time. Faces may also be depicted on other forms of royal regalia, which indicates the omnipotent, all-seeing power of the monarch and his capacity to provide good leadership.

Some crowns (called oríkògbófo) reflect the personal taste of a [[king]]. These include a mask referred to as the “dog-eared-one” (abetíajá), which is worn in such a way that the faces are oriented sideways, and smaller hats shaped like pillboxes, European crowns, and coronets. [[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: "Other crowns were influenced by [[court dress#Commonwealth countries|European style lawyers' wigs]], reflecting the radical changes that occurred in Yorubaland between the late nineteenth century and 1960, when the kings lost much of their political power to French and British colonial administrations. Although their position is largely ceremonial today, kings are still consulted by the state government before certain decisions are made. A wig-like crown presents a king as an effective advocate for his subjects." &lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=Embodying the sacred in Yoruba art : featuring the Bernard and Patricia Wagner Collection|year=2007|publisher=High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1932543201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert F. Thompson describes the impressive visual effect of the beaded veil in ritual context:&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaguely perceived outlines of the face of the ruler match, in a sense, the generalized qualities of the frontal faces on the crown. Veiling diminishes the wearer's individuality so that he, too, becomes a generalized entity. Balance between the present and past emerges. No longer an individual, the king becomes the dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Orangun-Ila, the ''ade'' is an ''[[Orisha|orisa]]''. When the ade is placed upon the king's head, his [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|''ori uni'']] (inner head) becomes one with those who have reigned before him, who are also considered ''orisa''.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

==Bird Motif==
The bird motif on most crowns has layers of meaning. It recalls how [[Odùduwà]], assisted by a mythical bird, created habitable land on the primordial waters at [[Ile Ife|Ilé Ifè]], where he eventually became the first king. It is also emblematic of the role of the king as an intermediary between his subjects and the [[Orisa|òrìsà]], in the same way that a bird mediates between heaven and earth. Finally, it alludes to a mystical power (àse) that [[Olorun|Olòdúmarè]] reportedly gave to the first female (in the form of a bird enclosed in a calabash), thus allowing her to counterbalance the muscular advantage of men. This mystical power is said to be responsible not only for her ability to procreate but also for her capacity to turn into a bird at night to do good or evil. Thus, by having a symbol of archetypal female power on his crown, a king is expected to manipulate that power for the good of all. This explains why the Ìyá Oba (Official Mother of the King) crowns a new monarch in some towns — to underscore the fact that he has the support of the women.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt; Bird motifs are also present on other sacred or otherwise important objects such as [[Osanyin staff]]s.

==History==
There are a variety of differing stories that speak to the history of the ade, or the Oba's crown. What most of these stories have in common is that they acknowledge the primacy of [[Ile-Ife]] as the first "crowned town" from which all Yoruba kings can trace their descent.

One of these ancient stories states that before he died, [[Oduduwa]], the founder and first king of the Yoruba people, gave a beaded crown to each of his sons and sent them forth to establish their own kingdoms. Another story states that when [[Oduduwa]] was old and almost blind, his sons stole their father's ades and with the authority of the ade established their own kingdoms. This story parallels the breakup of the [[Oyo Empire]] into multiple, smaller kingdoms.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, the authority of the oba has been established through an identification with [[Oduduwa]] and [[Ile-Ife]].&lt;ref name=Drewal&gt;{{cite book |last=Drewal |first=Henry John |title=Yoruba : nine centuries of African art and thought|year=1989|publisher=Center for African Art in Association with H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0810917947|pages=33–39|edition=2nd print |author2=John Pemberton 3rd |author3=Rowland Abiodun |editor=Allen Wardwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beads and their significance==
Religious text and legend dictate that Yoruba gods chose beaded strands as their emblems. Yoruba crowns, embellished with beaded embroidery, connote power by divine sanction. In fact, only a select few in Yoruba society are permitted to wear or use beaded objects, including kings, [[Tribal chief|chief]]s, [[prince]]s, [[priest]]s, [[diviner]]s and [[Witch doctor|native doctor]]s.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Today, crowns are embellished with imported colored beads from [[England]]. Formerly, red jasper beads were imported from Litingo in [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] and fashioned and polished at [[Oyo-Ile]] (Old Oyo). In antiquity, beads were made in [[Ile-Ife]].&lt;ref name=Ojo&gt;{{cite book|last=Ojo|first=G. J. Afolabi|title=Yoruba Culture|year=1966|location=London|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bead embroidery is practiced by extremely skilled men in a number of Nigerian centers, especially at Efon-Alaye, [[Ile-Ife]], [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]], [[Ilesha]], [[Abeokuta]], and [[Iperu, Remo|Iperu-Remo]].

Beads and the process of using them in art and ritual are endowed with multiple layers of meaning and significance. 
Beads and covering oneself in them is healing: Colorful beads are considered to be ''charms'' (''oogun'') that act upon malevolent forces. To wear neck beads (''kele'') in contrasting shades of red (''pupa'') and white (''funfun'') signifies both the punitive and the healing presence of [[Shango]], the Yoruba god of thunder.&lt;ref name="Drewal 1998" /&gt;

The art of beading, or stringing, follows the serial process and seriate composition of Yoruba art, an extension of the fundamental principle of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. One bead in a step-by-step (''leseese'') or one-by-one (''leto-lto'') manner. Just as the wrapped bundle of wooden sticks (atoori) on an [[Benin ancestral altars|ancestral altar]] symbolizes the continuity of a family legacy, beads symbolize consistent continuity from generation to generation. When threaded together, beads represent solidarity and unity.&lt;ref name="Drewal 1998" /&gt;

As they encircle and adorn parts of the body, beads conceal and protect a person's [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] and, through their symbolic meaning, may also reveal essential characteristics of that person.&lt;ref name="Drewal 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewal|first=Henry John|title=Yorùbá Beadwork in Africa|journal=African Arts|date=Winter 1998|volume=31|issue=1|jstor=3337620 |publisher=UCLA James S. Coleman African Studies Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OEB''' (formerly Online Educa Berlin) is an annual international [[Academic conference|conference]] on technology-supported learning and training ([[e-learning]]) launched in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] in 1995.
 
Since its inception, all OEB conferences have taken place in Berlin’s central district [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] in November or early December of each year. The first OEB was hosted at the Berlin Congress Center (bcc); it then moved to the Hotel InterContinental Berlin in 1996 where it has taken place for the subsequent years. In 2015 the conference underwent a rebrand that included a formal name change from ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN to OEB.

The conferences were organised by ICWE GmbH and supported by the German Federal Minister of Education and Research and the European Commission (Directorate-General for Education and Culture). Each year the conference attracts around 2,000 learning and training professionals from over 100 countries.

Delegates are high-level decision-makers from the education, business and government sectors, making OEB an important networking venue for experts, practitioners and newcomers of e-learning and distance education alike. Training specialists hold lectures and seminars and lead discussions and workshops in which current trends and the latest developments are introduced. The kinds of interactive, knowledge sharing sessions at OEB include Pre-Conference Workshops, Pre-Conference Seminars, Presentation Sessions, Research Domain Presentation Sessions, Discovery Demos, Knowledge Exchange Sessions, Discussions and Debates, LAB Sessions and Learning Cafés.

The event is held entirely in English and is accompanied by an [[Trade fair|exhibition]] at which international e-learning manufacturers, suppliers and service providers present their latest products and services.

== Business EDUCA ==

Introduced in 2010 as part of the conference programme, Business EDUCA offers participants a range of sessions through which to discuss research, needs and trends in corporate learning. Business EDUCA attracts strong interest from HR and learning practitioners from companies across the world, as well as researchers and educationalists. Examples of some of the themes covered in Business EDUCA include: discovering top strategies to implement and embed workplace learning, learning from examples of best – and worst – practice from other organisations, as well as developing techniques for nurturing exceptional leadership.

== Video EDUCA==

Video EDUCA offers a rich mix of practical sessions, workshops, masterclasses and lively discussions on all aspects of using video in learning. Participants in Video EDUCA have the opportunity to interact with leading international film and television directors, producers, executives and technicians to share ideas and learn from the professionals.

'''''Takao Ozawa v. United States''''', 260 U.S. 178 (1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Ozawa v. United States|260|178|1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] found Takao Ozawa, a Japanese-American who was born in Japan but had lived in the United States for 20 years, ineligible for [[naturalization]]. In 1915, Takao Ozawa filed for United States citizenship under the [[Naturalization Act of 1906]] which allowed only “free white persons”  and "persons of African nativity or persons of African descent" to naturalize. Ozawa did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions. Instead, he claimed that Japanese people were properly classified as “free white persons”.

==Opinion==
Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice [[George Sutherland]] approved a line of lower court cases that held that "the words 'white person' were meant to indicate only a person of what is popularly known as the Caucasian race." Because in ordinary usage, the Japanese were not considered Caucasian, these courts had held, the Japanese were not "free white persons" within the meaning of the law. Justice Sutherland wrote that the lower courts' conclusion that the Japanese were not "free white persons" for purposes of naturalization had “become so well established by judicial and executive concurrence and legislative acquiescence that we should not at this late day feel at liberty to disturb it, in the absence of reasons far more cogent than any that have been suggested". The Court specifically declined to review the ethnological authorities relied on by the lower courts to support their conclusion or those advanced by the parties.

==Effects==
On the same day, the Supreme Court reiterated its ruling in ''[[Takuji Yamashita]] v. Hinkle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Yamashita v. Hinkle|link=|volume=260|page=199|pin=|year=1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within three months, Justice Sutherland authored a similarly unfavorable ruling in a Supreme Court case concerning the petition for naturalization of a [[Sikh]] immigrant from the [[Punjab region]] in [[British India]], who identified himself as "a high caste Hindu of full Indian blood" in his petition, ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]''. The upshot of this ruling was that like the Japanese, "high-caste Hindus, of full Indian blood" were not "free white persons" and were racially ineligible for naturalized citizenship. To support this conclusion, Justice Sutherland reiterated Ozawa's holding that the words "white person" in the naturalization act were "synonymous with the word 'Caucasian' only as that word is popularly understood.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/p-6435-race-nation-and-refuge.aspx Doug Coulson, ''Race, Nation, and Refuge: The Rhetoric of Race in Asian American Citizenship Cases'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 2017).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both decisions had a deleterious effect on Asian Americans as a class, strengthening and reaffirming the racist policies of US immigration and naturalization laws. With successful judicial backing, policymakers passed more anti-Asian laws across the nation, under heavy lobbying by the burgeoning [[Asiatic Exclusion League]]. This trend continued until the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s.

}}'''Portuguese South Africans''' ({{lang-pt|luso-sul-africanos}}) are South Africans of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese ancestry]].

==History==
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explored]] the coasts of [[South Africa]] in the late 15th century, and nominally claimed them as their own with the erecting of ''[[Padrão|padrões]]'' (large stone cross inscribed with the [[coat of arms of Portugal]] placed there as part of a [[land claim]]). [[Bartolomeu Dias]] did so in 1486, and [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1497, en route to [[India]].

The early 20th century witnessed a trickle of emigrants from [[Madeira]] whose numbers greatly increased in the decades following [[World War II]]. Madeiran immigrants, who are traditionally associated with horticulture and commerce, form the largest group within South Africa's Portuguese community.

The largest single event of Portuguese settlement occurred when the former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] became independent in 1975. Most of them went to Portugal and [[Brazil]], but a significant number of black and white refugees from [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] made their way to South Africa. Their arrival made South Africa the home of the largest [[Portuguese Africans|Portuguese African]] population, increasing it from about 49,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/50.htm|title=English Speakers|work=U.S. Library of Congress|publisher=[http://countrystudies.us/ Country Studies]|accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/29/world/abundant-portuguese-residents-elude-the-south-african-census.html Abundant Portuguese Residents Elude The South African Census], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 29, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and economics==

The Portuguese South African community is highly active within the South African community, both politically and economically. Notable members include [[Maria Ramos]] who was the former director general of [[South Africa's National Treasury]]. She is currently the Group CEO of [[Absa Group Limited|ABSA]], one of South Africa's largest financial services companies. Other Portuguese involvement within the business community includes companies like [[Mercantile Bank Limited, South Africa|Mercantile Bank]]. The community is also actively involved in investment activities with other Southern African countries like [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]].

Socially, the Portuguese community have held an annual festival called Lusito Land (the second largest festival in South Africa).

==Religion==
Most Portuguese, like other South Africans, are [[Christianity|Christians]]. Most of them are [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], although there is a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] minority.

==Sports==
===Football===
The most popular sport with Portuguese South Africans is football. There are many football clubs in South Africa that are of Portuguese origin. One example is the professional football club [[Vasco da Gama (South Africa)|Vasco Da Gama]] which currently plays in the [[National First Division]].  Football is a favourite pastime for Portuguese youth in South Africa, and many of them tend to join [[amateur]] and football clubs in the country.

'''Purbiya''' (or '''Purbia''') was a common term used in medieval India for [[Rajput]] soldiers from the eastern [[Gangetic Plain]] - areas corresponding to present-day western [[Bihar]] and eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Naravane1999"/&gt; ''Purbiya Rajputs'' translates as Eastern Rajputs.&lt;ref name="ErnstPati2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Waltraud Ernst|author2=Biswamoy Pati|title=India's Princely States: People, Princes and Colonialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eKbW3ukh9oC&amp;pg=PA57|date=18 October 2007|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-134-11988-2|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Rajputs living in [[Rajasthan]] were historically referred to as "Western Rajputs".&lt;ref name="Naravane1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. S. Naravane|title=The Rajputs of Rajputana: A Glimpse of Medieval Rajasthan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF0FvjG3GWEC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1999|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-118-2|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first significant influx of Rajputs into the [[Shahabad, Hardoi|Shahabad]] area occurred In the early 14th century when [[Parmar]] Rajputs migrated and deposed the local [[Chero]] rulers. These Rajputs later came known as [[Ujjainiya]] Rajputs and form one of the many clans to now inhabit the region.&lt;ref name="Yang1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anand A. Yang|title=Bazaar India: Markets, Society, and the Colonial State in Gangetic Bihar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5lQutvzAp4C&amp;pg=PA139|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-91996-9|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Khyat", a legendary source for information about the Ujjainiya Rajputs, the [[Jaunpur Sultanate]] rulers interrupted the prayers of [[Brahmin]]s on the bank of the Ganges. The Ujjainiya Rajputs attempted to defend the Brahmins, but the Jaunpur Sultanate soon defeated them and demolished the temples used by the Brahmins.&lt;ref name="Kolff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk H. A. Kolff|title=Naukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrdiVPsFRYIC&amp;pg=PA59|date=8 August 2002|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-52305-9|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purbiya was a common term given to the soldiers of [[Awadh]] and [[Bhojpur district, India|Bhojpur]] who served as mercenaries for the rulers of west and north India. The rulers of [[Malwa]] were keen recruiters due to Purbiyas' expertise with firearms. This expertise may have been gained due to the easy availability of [[saltpetre]] in their native areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Waltraud |last1=Ernst |first2=Biswamoy |last2=Pati |title=India's Princely States: People, Princes and Colonialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eKbW3ukh9oC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-11988-2|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Purbiyas were mercenaries and were paid for their services but some were actual kings of smaller principalities.&lt;ref name="Naravane1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Indian history, Volume 66, Dept. of History, University of Kerala, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pn|date=October 2016}}

Along with members of the [[Bhumihar]] caste, many of the [[Zamindari]] estates were ruled by Rajputs, such as [[Sonbarsa Raj]], ruled by the [[Ganwaria Rajput]] clan, and Dumrao Raj, [[Jagdispur|Jagdishpur]] in South Bihar, and Shakarpura Raj [[Zamindari]] in North Bihar,  ruled by the [[Ujjainiya Parmar ]] Rajput clan from Dhar.Kursela was a Zamindari under British India.

===1857 mutiny===
The Purbiya sepoys of the Bengal Army played a major role in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against the British. [[Mangal Pandey]], a notable figure during the start of the mutiny, was a Purbiya serving in the 34th [[Bengal Native Infantry]]. Following the suppression of the uprising, British authorities decided not to recruit troops from the eastern plains, and the new Bengal Army was to be recruited primarily from the [[Sikh]] and [[Islam in India|Muslim]] communities of the [[Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q5JECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |title=Military Manpower, Armies and Warfare in South Asia |first=Kaushik |last=Roy |publisher= |year= |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=305|title=A Matter of Honour|ISBN=0-333-41837-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purbiya recruitment from the western regions of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] and the [[Delhi]] region continued but on a much smaller scale (two out of sixty-four regiments by 1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Saul|last=David|page=404|title=The Indian Mutiny|ISBN=0-141-00554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=[[Racism]]}}

'''Racialism''' is the belief that the [[anatomically modern humans|human species]] is naturally divided into [[Race (human categorization)|races]], that are ostensibly distinct biological categories. Most dictionaries define the term ''racialism'' as synonymous with [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester L. Quarles (2004).  ''Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion''. McFarland. [https://books.google.com/books?id=r5BzY2eeyngC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=racialist+synonymous+with+racist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5-sSV0OTKAhWJ5iYKHfG2ALMQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=racialist%20synonymous%20with%20racist&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and differences==
[[Image:WEB DuBois 1918.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], 1918]]

In 1903, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] said that racialism is the philosophical position that races existed, and that collective differences existed among such categories, the races.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He further stated that [[racism]] required advancing the argument that one race is superior to other races of human beings. In ''In My Father’s House'' (1992), [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] summarized Du Bois's philosophical stance that ''racialism'' is value-neutral term and that ''racism'' is a value-charged term.

Today, some anthropologists and geneticists point to studies that suggest racialist beliefs are both compatible and incompatible with modern [[population genetics]].{{clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/busting-myths-about-human-nature/201204/race-is-real-not-in-the-way-many-people-think Race Is Real, but not in the way Many People Think], Agustín Fuentes, ''Psychology Today.com'', April 09, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Epigenetics and the embodiment of race: Developmental origins of US racial disparities in cardiovascular health|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=21|issue=1|pages=2–15|author= Kuzawa and Sweet|quote=We conclude that environmentally responsive phenotypic plasticity, in combination with the better-studied acute and chronic effects of social-environmental exposures, provides a more parsimonious explanation than genetics for the persistence of CVD disparities between members of socially imposed racial categories.|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20822|pmid=18925573|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic variation, classification and 'race'|publisher=Nature|author=|location=|accessdate=November 18, 2014|quote=Ancestry, then, is a more subtle and complex description of an individual's genetic makeup than is race.

According to [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]], racialism is "another term for [[racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionaries Online|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/racialism|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] defines racialism as "a theory that race determines human traits and capacities" and defines "racism" as "a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=racialism|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0756957766|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racialism|accessdate=6 February 2016|date=2005-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity politics==
Richard T. Ford claimed that although "there is no necessary correspondence between the ascribed identity of race and one's culture or personal sense of self" and "group difference is not intrinsic to members of social groups but rather contingent o[n] the social practices of group identification", the social practices of identity politics may coerce individuals into the "compulsory" enactment of "prewritten racial scripts".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. Ford, Racial Culture: A Critique, Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 117–18, 125–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Yasuko Takezawa, there needs to be anticipation of various potential social and ethical problems associated with population descriptors when studying the genetic differences between populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human genetic research, race, ethnicity and the labeling of populations: recommendations based on an interdisciplinary workshop in Japan|publisher=BMC Medical Ethics|author= Yasuko Takezawa|location=|accessdate=December 13, 2014|quote=In this age of genomics, differences between populations are often reported as having genetic bases.

The '''Sika''' (also '''Sikanese''', '''Sikka''' or '''Sara Sikka''') people are an [[Indonesia]]n [[ethnic group]] native to the region of east central [[Flores]] between the [[Bloh River|Bloh]] and [[Napung River]]s. In the city of [[Maumere]], the center of the region, Sika people occupy a separate block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank M. LeBar &amp; George N. Appell|title=Ethnic Groups of Insular Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Andaman Islands, and Madagascar|year=1972|publisher=Human Relations Area Files Press|isbn=08-753-6403-9|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sika language]], which is a member of the [[Timor-Ambon]] [[language family]], is spoken by the Sika people. The [[Sika language]] have at least three recognized dialects, namely ''Sikka Natar'' dialect, ''Sara Krowe'' dialect and ''Ata Tana 'Ai'' or ''Sara Tana 'Ai'' dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Darrell T. Tryon|title=Comparative Austronesian Dictionary: An Introduction to Austronesian Studies|year=1995|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3-1108-8401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Timorese Sika===
A group of [[mestizo]] from [[Sikka Regency|Sikka]] and Europeans settled in 1851 as a voluntary recruits from the UK according to Sikka Dili over in [[Portuguese Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/joseramelau/diasporatimorense/timor.htm |title=DE CEUTA A TIMOR |author=Luis Filipe Thomas |accessdate=2015-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228152141/http://www.geocities.com/joseramelau/diasporatimorense/timor.htm |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the Portuguese government had José Joaquim Lopes de Lima to sign a treaty with the Netherlands concluded that the west of [[Timor]], [[Flores]] island and other areas of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] are ceded to them. This agreement was later confirmed by the [[History of East Timor#Portuguese rule|Treaty of Lisbon in 1859]]. The Sika people are formed in addition to the Bidau and Moradores as one of the three people groups that make up the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] in the colony. All three ethnic groups lived in separate districts of the capital. As for language they still retained their original [[Malay language]], but later switched to a Creole Portuguese. Today they have been absorbed into the same population and do not form their own distinct group anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/History_of_Timor.pdf |title=History of Timor |publisher=ISEG - Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão |accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The primary religion practiced by the Sika people is [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplegroups.org/explore/GroupDetails.aspx?peid=22773#topmenu |title=Sikka of Indonesia |publisher=PeopleGroup.org |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sika people residing in the interior still retain their traditional ancestral worship and [[Agrarianism]] cult.

==Culture==
Sika people are part of the indigenous population of the [[Flores]] island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Legêne, Bambang Purwanto &amp; Henk Schulte Nordholt|title=Sites, Bodies and Stories: Imagining Indonesian History|year=2015|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=99-716-9857-9|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material culture of the mountaineers retained more traditional elements than on the coast, especially in the western part, where the Catholic mission worked actively since the 17th century; where it is here that their culture acquired European features.

==Traditional activities==
Sika people engage in [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture with short forms of [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ongko Susetia Totoprajogo|title=Effect of deworming treatment on nutritional status in primary school children in Kabupaten Sikka, Nusa Tenggara Timur Province, Indonesia|date=August 1989|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the west of the coastal area, irrigation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joachim K. Metzner|title=Agriculture and population pressure in Sikka, Isle of Flores: a contribution to the study of the stability of agricultural systems in the wet and dry tropics|date=August 1982|publisher=Australian National University|isbn=09-091-5059-1|page=221-224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food crops farming include rice, corn, cassava and millet; and other commodities are such as peanuts and coconut palm. Sika people also raise horses, small cattle and poultry. Coastal fishing is also common. Weaving and braiding are well developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jes A. Therik|title=Tenun Ikat Dari Timur (Keindahan Anggun Warisan Leluhur/ (Ikat in Eastern Archipelago (An Esoteric Beauty of Ancestral Entity))|year=2017|publisher=Diandra Kreatif|isbn=97-941-6038-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodity-money relations are intertwined with numerous survivals of the traditional communal system, where it is manifested in the system of land ownership, regulation of marriages and in everyday life.

==Lifestyle==
Mountain villages are small and have a circular layout, are located on the steep slopes of the mountains; which served as protection against attacks. In the middle of the settlement there is an area with a temple and sacred megalithic shrines. Coastal settlements have a linear plan, located along a road or river. The dwelling frame and pillar structure, pile, in the mountains is designed for large families, while in the coastal areas, for a small family.

Clothing of the those living in the interior consists of a skirt or loincloth. In coastal villages, they carry ''kain'' (cloth) and a jacket or shirt.

The dietary of the Sika people are such as vegetable and mostly cereals from wheat and corn with spices, fruit and juice. Fish and meat are eaten on holidays.

'''Statistics Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Statistique Canada}}), formed in 1971, is the [[Government of Canada]]  [[government agency]] commissioned with producing [[statistics]] to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, [[Economy of Canada|economy]], society, and [[Culture of Canada|culture]]. Its headquarters is in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref name="location"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/reference/refcentre-centreref/index-eng.htm | title=Contact us | publisher=StatCan | date=nd | accessdate=4 August 2015}}Statistics Canada, 150 Tunney's Pasture Driveway Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0T6; Statistique Canada 150, promenade du pré Tunney Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0T6&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister responsible for Statistics Canada is the [[Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development]], currently [[Navdeep Bains]]. 

The bureau is commonly called StatCan or StatsCan. '''StatCan''' is the official abbreviation. It has regularly been considered the best statistical organization in the world by ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref name="SSHRC_2006"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada |url=http://www.sshrc.ca/web/apply/background/ciss_about_e.asp |title=Canadian Initiative on Social Statistics |accessdate=5 November 2006 |date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the 1991 and 1993 "Good Statistics" surveys. [[Public Policy Forum]] and others have also ranked it first.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Statistics is a federal responsibility in Canada, and Statistics Canada produces statistics for all the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] as well as the federal government. In addition to conducting about 350 active [[Statistical survey|surveys]] on virtually all aspects of Canadian life, Statistics Canada undertakes a country-wide [[census]] every five years on the first and sixth year of each decade. By law, every household must complete the [[Census in Canada|Canada Census]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/qa-qr-eng.cfm | title=About the census: Questions and answers about the census | publisher=Statistics Canada | date= 2013-01-10 | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada 2006 Census|May 2006]], an Internet version of the census was made widely available for the first time. Another census was held in [[Canada 2011 Census|May 2011]], again with the internet being the primary method for statistical data collection. The [[Canada 2016 Census|most recent census]] was held in May 2016, with the internet being the primary method for statistical data collection. Its data is scheduled for release beginning in February 2017.&lt;ref name=releasedates&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/release-dates-diffusion-eng.cfm | title=2016 Census Program release schedule | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=February 23, 2016 | accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Statistics Canada was formed in 1971, replacing the [[Dominion Bureau of Statistics]], which was formed in 1918. Statistics Canada published a print copy of the yearly almanac entitled ''Canada Year Book'' from 1967 to 2012&lt;ref name="CYB_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-canada-year-book-is-history/article5246841/ |publisher=The Globe and Mail |title=The Canada Year Book is history |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it ceased publication due to ebbing demand and deep budgetary cutbacks to StatCan by the federal government.&lt;ref name="CYB_2012" /&gt; It was a yearly compendium of statistical lore and information on the nation's social and economic past, people, events and facts.&lt;ref name="CYB_HC"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www65.statcan.gc.ca/acyb_r000-eng.htm |title=Canada Year Book (CYB) Historical Collection |publisher=StatCan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canada Year Book'' was originally edited by a volunteer from the [[Department of Finance Canada|Department of Finance]] and published by a private company, which offset costs with advertisement sales.  This method continued until 1879, at which time the record ceases, until 1885, at which time the [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|Department of Agriculture]] took up the burden. The duty of publication was transferred to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics upon its formation in 1918.

On June 18, 2005, after years of study by expert panels, discussion, debate (privacy vs the interests of genealogists and historians), Bill S-18 ''An Act to Amend the Statistics Act'' was passed which released personal census records for censuses taken between 1911 and 2001, inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BILL S-18: AN ACT TO AMEND THE STATISTICS ACT|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?lang=E&amp;ls=s18&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;source=library_prb|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate over the census and their contents had periodically created changes in the [[Statistics Act]] such as a [[Census in Canada#Accessibility, disclosure, and publication|2005 amendment]] making the privacy restrictions of the census information expire after more than a century. In addition, with Bill S-18, starting with the 2006 Census, Canadians can consent to the public release of their personal census information after 92 years. Census returns are in the custody of Statistics Canada and the records are closed until 92 years after the taking of a census, when those records may be opened for public use and transferred to [[Library and Archives Canada]] subject to individual consent where applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-19/FullText.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 June 2013|quote=18. (1) The information contained in the returns of each census of population taken between 1910 and 2005 is no longer subject to sections 17 and 18 ninety-two years after the census is taken. (3) When sections 17 and 18 cease to apply to information referred to in subsection (1) or (2), the information shall be placed under the care and control of the Library and Archives of Canada.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mandatory long census form was cancelled by the federal government in 2010 in favour of a voluntary household survey (NHS).&lt;ref name="census 2015" /&gt; The mandatory long form census was reinstated in time for the 2016 Census of Population.

In 2011, Statistics Canada released an audit acknowledging that from c. 2004 to 2011, their automated computer processes had "inadvertently made economic data available to data distributors before the official publication time." In November 2011, in response to the audit, StatsCan stopped that process.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2011"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-17/political-aides-getting-canada-data-day-in-advance-hurts-market-confidence.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Andrew | last1=Mayeda | first2=Greg | last2=Quinn | title=Political Aides Getting Canada Data Day in Advance Hurts Market Confidence | date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 layoffs===
Nearly half of Statistics Canada's 5000 employees were notified in April 2012 that their jobs might be eliminated as part of [[austerity]] measures imposed by the federal government in the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservative-cuts-put-half-of-statscan-jobs-at-risk/article2418557/|title=Conservative cuts put half of Statscan jobs at risk|last=Curry|first=Bill|date=May 1, 2012|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|last2=Grant|first2=Tavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2,300 employees underwent a process to determine which ones were not impacted, which were eliminated and which were given early retirement or put in new positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCABRE83T19O20120501|title=Budget cuts hit thousands of civil servants|last=Egan|first=Louise|date=May 1, 2012|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government cuts have reduced the amount of information StatCan produces and may continue to do so; this may mean data collection and processing services will be contracted out.&lt;ref name="Curry" /&gt;

==The census==

===2011 census from voluntary to mandatory, long to short===

{{Main|Canada 2011 Census}}

On June 17, 2010 an [[Order in Council]] was created by the Minister of Industry defining the questions for the 2011 Census as including only the short-form questions; this was published in the [[Canada Gazette]] on June 26, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=orders in council - statistics canada |url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2010/2010-06-26/html/order-decret-eng.html |publisher=Industry Canada |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603225426/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2010/2010-06-26/html/order-decret-eng.html |archivedate=2011-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however a news release was not issued by Minister of Industry Tony Clement until July 13, 2010. This release stated in part "The government will retain the mandatory short form that will collect basic demographic information. To meet the need for additional information, and to respect the privacy wishes of Canadians, the government has introduced the voluntary National Household Survey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Statement on 2011 Census |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ic1.nsf/eng/05709.html |publisher= Industry Canada |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 2010 Statistics Canada published a description of the National Household Survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/survey-enquete/household-menages/5178-eng.htm National Household Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603225424/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/survey-enquete/household-menages/5178-eng.htm |date=2011-06-03 }}. Statcan.gc.ca (2012-05-14). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]] [[Tony Clement]] initially indicated that these changes were being made based on consultations with Statistics Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/835932--statscan-recommended-move-to-voluntary-census-clement-says | title = StatsCan recommended move to voluntary census, Tony Clement says | publisher = Toronto Star | last = Campion-Smith | first = Bruce | date = 16 July 2010 | accessdate = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was forced to admit that the change from a mandatory to voluntary form was not one of the recommendations received from StatCan after the head of the organization Munir Sheikh resigned in protest.&lt;ref name="turmoil"&gt;{{cite web |title=StatsCan in turmoil over census |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Opposition+grills+government+over+census+changes/3309695/story.html |first= Shannon |last= Proudfoot |publisher= Montreal Gazette |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information has since been uncovered that indicates attempts on the part of the government to distance themselves from the decision, instructing Statistics Canada officials to delete the phrase "as per government decision" from documents which were being written to inform Statistics Canada staff of the change.&lt;ref name="govdistance"&gt;{{cite web |title=StatsCan panel tried to fight decision to kill long-form census: documents |url=http://www.canada.com/news/national/StatsCan+panel+tried+fight+decision+kill+long+form+census+documents/4368080/story.html |first= Shannon |last= Proudfoot |publisher= Postmedia News |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The minister has since claimed that concerns over privacy&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Leviathan's spyglass |url=http://www.economist.com/node/16590962?story_id=16590962 |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the threat of jail time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Has anyone ever been jailed for not filling out the long form census?

During the 2010 debates, the [[Freedom Party of Ontario]], a small group based on [[Ayn Rand]]'s writings, whose 42 candidates received 12,381 votes (or 0.26% of the popular vote) in the 2014 election, opposed the long census. They also opposed bilingualism, political correctness and the inclusion of a question on race on the 1996 Canadian census. FPO claimed that Canadian and British traditions had been dishonoured by multiculturalism. They are among a minority who argue that using statistical data to analyze resource allocation is not beneficial.&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;{{cite news |title=The bizarre decision on the census |url=http://www.canada.com/bizarre+decision+census/3358361/story.html |publisher=Canada.com |first= Paul |last= Willcocks |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeever_2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.paulmckeever.ca/2010/07/17/optional-long-form-census-a-blow-to-racism/| title = Optional Long Form Census a Blow to Racism | publisher = Toronto Star | last = Campion-Smith | first = Bruce | date = 6 July 2010 | accessdate = 4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veterans"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richard|first1=Field|title=First Shell Fire|url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/video-gallery/video/6343|website=Heroes Remember|publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the debate on this issue is the effect on the quality of data which will be collected by Statistics Canada under the new system. Many groups have made the claim that a voluntary system will not provide a quality of data consistent with what Statistics Canada is known for&lt;ref name="turmoil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="facemp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="counton" /&gt; while others feel that politically motivated changes to StatCan methodology taints the reputation of the whole organization in the international setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2010/07/29/WhyAttackCensus/ |title=Why Attack the Long Census? |date=27 July 2010 | first = Donald | last = Gutstein |publisher= [[The Tyee]] |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the change have offered models of European countries who are adopting alternate systems,&lt;ref name="Leviathan" /&gt; although in these states the census is being replaced with a database of information on each citizen rather than a voluntary poll and none of these systems are planned for the Canadian 2011 census. They also challenge the current system's ability to cope with rapid socio-demographic changes, though this would not be addressed without increasing the frequency of the survey. Some public opposition to the changes has been expressed through the social media network [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keep the Canada Census Long Form |url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Keep-the-Canada-Census-Long-Form/141550925859979 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', by 2015 an increasing number of economists joined organizations such as the [[Canadian Chamber of Commerce]], [[Canadian Federation of Independent Business]], [[Canadian Economics Association]], [[Martin Prosperity Institute]], [[Toronto Region Board of Trade]], [[Restaurants Canada]] and the [[Canadian Association of Business Economics]] to call for a reinstatement of the mandatory long form.&lt;ref name="census 2015"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/scrapping-of-long-form-census-causing-long-term-issues-for-business-groups/article22846497/ | title=Scrapping of long-form census causing long-term issues for business | work=The Globe and Mail | date=February 6, 2015 | agency=Thomson Reuters | accessdate=4 August 2015 | author=TAVIA GRANT | location=Toronto,  ON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonton's chief economist preferred the long form and argues that the National Housing Survey is only useful at the aggregate city level and leaves "a dearth of data on long-term changes at the neighbourhood level and within demographic groups... making it difficult to make decisions such as "where to build a library, where to build a fire hall" without specific demographic information.&lt;ref name="census 2015" /&gt; Because it was not mandatory there was a lower response rate and therefore increased risk of under-representation of some vulnerable segments of society, for example aboriginal peoples, newly arrived immigrants. This makes it more difficult to "pinpoint trends such as income inequality, immigrant outcomes in the jobs market, labour shortages and demographic shifts."&lt;ref name="census 2015" /&gt;

=== 2015 reinstatement of mandatory long form ===
One day after its election in November 2015, the new Liberal government reinstated the mandatory Census long form &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/05/liberals-restore-mandatory-long-form-census.html|title=Canada’s long-form census is back for 2016|last=Campion-Smith|first=Bruce|date=November 5, 2015|work=The Star [Toronto]|access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was used in the 2016 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Instr.pl?Function=getInstrumentList&amp;Item_Id=295122&amp;UL=1V&amp;|title=Guide to the Census of Population, 2016|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2017|publisher=Statistics Canada|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 5 – Census of Population questionnaires}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Instr.pl?Function=getInstrumentList&amp;Item_Id=295122&amp;UL=1V&amp;|title=2016 Census 2A-L Questionnaire|last=|first=|date=February 7, 2017|website=Statistics Canada|access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political reactions===
Former industry minister Tony Clement recanted on his support for the elimination of the long form. He avowed that there were ways to protect both indispensable data and Canadians’ privacy. Blaming his party for a “collective” decision to terminate the long form, he said, “I think I would have done it differently.” He implied incorrectly that Statistics Canada head Munir Sheikh had agreed with the cancellation when it was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/chris-selley-conservatives-in-dire-need-of-an-ideological-and-policy-reset-before-leadership-race |first=Chris |last=Selley |title=Conservatives in dire need of an ideological and policy reset before leadership race |date=25 February 2016 |newspaper=[[National Post]] |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stigmergy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɪ|ɡ|m|ər|dʒ|i}} {{respell|STIG-mər-jee}}) is a mechanism of indirect [[:wikt:coordination|coordination]], through the environment, between agents or actions.&lt;ref name="mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=L.|last2=Onof|first2=C.|year=2008|title=Stigmergic epistemology, stigmergic cognition|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10004/1/MPRA_paper_10004.pdf|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=9|pages=136|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2007.06.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that the trace left in the [[natural environment|environment]] by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Ted G. | title = Cognitive stigmergy: A study of emergence in small-group social networks | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | date = June 12, 2012 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138904171200037X | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2012.06.002 | volume=21 | journal=Cognitive Systems Research | pages=7–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stigmergy is a form of [[self-organization]]. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even individual awareness of each other.&lt;ref name="mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Heylighen | first = Francis |  title = Stigmergy as a universal coordination mechanism I: Definition and components | date = December 1, 2015 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041715000327 | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2015.12.002 | volume=38 | journal=Cognitive Systems Research | pages=4–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "stigmergy" was introduced by French biologist [[Pierre-Paul Grassé]] in 1959 to refer to [[termite]] behavior. He defined it as: "Stimulation of workers by the performance they have achieved." It is derived from the Greek words [[wikt:στίγμα|στίγμα]] ''stigma'' "mark, sign" and [[wikt:ἔργον|ἔργον]] ''ergon'' "work, action", and captures the notion that an agent’s actions leave signs in the environment, signs that it and other agents sense and that determine and incite their subsequent actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonabeau|first=Eric|year=1999|title=Editor's Introduction: Stigmergy|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/106454699568692|journal=Artificial Life|volume=5|issue=2|pages=95–96|doi=10.1162/106454699568692|issn=1064-5462|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Theraulaz | first = Guy | title = A Brief History of Stigmergy | publisher = [[MIT]] Press Journals | date = 1999 | url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/106454699568700?journalCode=artl#.WQTxrfkrI2x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, a distinction was made between the stigmergic phenomenon, which is specific to the guidance of additional work, and the more general, non-work specific incitation, for which the term ''sematectonic'' communication was coined&lt;ref&gt;[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]], E.O. Wilson, 1975/2000, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; by [[E. O. Wilson]], from the Greek words [[wikt:σῆμα|σῆμα]] ''sema'' "sign, token", and [[wikt:τέκτων|τέκτων]] ''tecton'' "craftsman, builder": "There is a need for a more general, somewhat less clumsy expression to denote the evocation of any form of behavior or physiological change by the evidences of work performed by other animals, including the special case of the guidance of additional work."

Stigmergy is now one of the key&lt;ref name="parunak"&gt;Parunak, H. v D. (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20141112185202/http://abcresearch.org/papers/MSH03.pdf "Making swarming happen."] In Proc. of Conf. on Swarming and Network Enabled Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), McLean, Virginia, USA, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; concepts in the field of [[swarm intelligence]].

==Stigmergic behavior in non-human organisms==
Stigmergy was first observed in [[social insects]]. For example, [[ant]]s exchange information by laying down [[pheromone]]s (the trace) on their way back to the nest when they have found food. In that way, they collectively develop a [[complex network]] of trails, connecting the nest in an efficient way to various food sources. When ants come out of the nest searching for food, they are stimulated by the pheromone to follow the trail towards the food source.  The network of trails functions as a shared external memory for the ant colony.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In computer science, this general method has been applied in a variety of techniques called [[ant colony optimization]], which search for solutions to complex problems by depositing "virtual pheromones" along paths that appear promising.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Other [[eusociality|eusocial]] creatures, such as [[termites]], use pheromones to build their complex nests by following a simple [[decentralized]] [[rule set]]. Each insect scoops up a 'mudball' or similar material from its environment, invests the ball with pheromones, and deposits it on the ground, initially in a random spot. However, termites are attracted to their nestmates' pheromones and are therefore more likely to drop their own mudballs on top of their neighbors'. The larger the heap of mud becomes, the more attractive it is, and therefore the more mud will be added to it (positive feedback). Over time this leads to the construction of pillars, arches, tunnels and chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Beckers, R., Holland, O. E. and Deneubourg, J.L. [http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~rad/courses/cs266/papers/beckers-alife94.pdf "From local actions to global tasks: Stigmergy and collective robotics."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104125931/http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~rad/courses/cs266/papers/beckers-alife94.pdf |date=2013-11-04 }} Artificial life IV. 1994, p.181-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stigmergy has even been observed in bacteria, various species of which differentiate into distinct cell types and which participate in group behaviors that are guided by sophisticated temporal and spatial control systems.&lt;ref name=Shapiro1988&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=James A.|title=Bacteria as Multicellular Organisms|journal=Scientific American |date=June 1988 | volume=258 |issue=6 |pages=82–89 |url=http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/Shapiro.1988.scientificamerican0688-82.pdf |accessdate=8 September 2013 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0688-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectacular examples of multicellular behavior can be found among the [[myxobacteria]]. Myxobacteria travel in ''[[swarm]]s'' containing many [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s kept together by intercellular molecular [[Signal transduction|signals]]. Most myxobacteria are predatory: individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of extracellular [[enzyme]]s which are used to digest prey microorganisms. When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into ''fruiting bodies'', within which the swarming cells transform themselves into dormant myxospores with thick cell walls.  The fruiting process is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that [[cell growth]] is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than isolated cells.  Similar life cycles have developed among the cellular [[slime mold]]s. The best known of the myxobacteria, ''[[Myxococcus xanthus]]'' and ''[[Stigmatella aurantiaca]]'', are studied in various laboratories as [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] models of development.&lt;ref name=Dworkin2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dworkin |first=Martin |title=Lingering Puzzles about Myxobacteria |journal=Microbe |year=2007 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |url=https://www.asm.org/ccLibraryFiles/FILENAME/000000002764/znw00107000018.pdf |accessdate=11 September 2013 |doi=10.1128/microbe.2.18.1}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of human behavior==
Stigmergy studied in [[Eusociality|eusocial]] creatures and physical systems, has been proposed as a model of analyzing some [[robotics]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;Ranjbar-Sahraei, B., Weiss G., and Nakisaee, A. (2012). A Multi-Robot Coverage Approach based on Stigmergic Communication. In Proc. of the 10th German Conference on Multiagent System Technologies, Vol. 7598, pp. 126-138.&lt;/ref&gt; multi-[[intelligent agent|agent]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;Giovanna Castellano, Mario G.C.A.Cimino, et al. A multi-agent system for enabling collaborative situation awareness via position-based stigmergy and neuro-fuzzy learning, Neurocomputing, Vol. 135 (2014) pp. 86-97 &lt;/ref&gt; communication in [[computer networks]], and [[Online community|online communities]].&lt;ref&gt;Mario G.C.A. Cimino, Federico Galatolo, Alessandro Lazzeri, Gigliola Vaglini. Spikiness Assessment of Term Occurrences in Microblogs: an Approach Based on Computational Stigmergy, ICPRAM 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Internet]] there are many collective projects where users interact only by modifying local parts of their shared virtual environment. [[Wikipedia]] is an example of this.&lt;ref name="Rheingold"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zWUEtmw3p4|title=Mark Elliott on stigmergy, citizen wikis, collaborative environments|date=26 August 2009|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massive structure of information available in a [[wiki]],&lt;ref name="burbeck"&gt;[http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/ju_burbeck.html Infoworld: A conversation with Steve Burbeck about multicellular computing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211203903/http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/ju_burbeck.html |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[open source software]] project such as the [[FreeBSD kernel]]&lt;ref name="burbeck" /&gt; could be compared to a [[termite]] nest; one initial user leaves a seed of an idea (a mudball) which attracts other users who then build upon and modify this initial concept, eventually constructing an elaborate structure of connected thoughts.&lt;ref name="heylighen"&gt;[[Francis Heylighen|Heylighen F.]] (2007).

In addition the concept of stigmergy has also been used to describe how cooperative work such as building design may be integrated. Designing a large contemporary building involves a large and diverse network of actors (e.g. architects, building engineers, static engineers, building services engineers). Their distributed activities may be partly integrated through practices of stigmergy.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, L. R. (2007). Practices of stigmergy in architectural work.

===Analysis of human social movements===
The rise of [[open source software]] in the 21st century has [[Disruptive innovation|disrupted]] the business models of some [[proprietary software]] providers, and [[open content]] projects like [[Wikipedia]] have threatened the business models of companies like [[Britannica]]. Researchers have studied collaborative open source projects, arguing they provide insights into the emergence of large-scale peer production and the growth of [[gift economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0605/03-elliott.php|title=M/C Journal|work=media-culture.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Stigmergic society====
[[Heather Marsh]], associated with the [[Occupy Movement]], [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]], and [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], has proposed a new social system where competition as a driving force would be replaced with a more collaborative society.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|title = Binding Chaos: Mass collaboration on a global scale|publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|date = 2013-06-08|isbn = 9781489527684|language = English|first = Heather|last = Marsh|id =  {{ASIN|1489527680|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed society would not use [[representative democracy]] but new forms of idea and action based governance and collaborative methods including stigmergy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;

No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Some at the Hong Kong [[Umbrella Movement]] in 2014 were quoted recommending stigmergy as a way forward.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Tamils}}
'''Tamils in Italy''' are people of ethnic [[Tamil people|Tamil]] ancestry who reside in [[Italy]]. Around 25,000 Tamils from both [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]] are estimated to be living in Italy.&lt;ref name="Tamil1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tamilnation.co/diaspora/italy.htm | title=Tamil Nation - Tamil Diaspora in Italy | accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TAMIL2"&gt;""[http://tamilo.com/tamil-population-education-29.html World Tamil Population]", ''tamilo.com''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Demographics==
Though it is not established as of when, the migration of the Tamil people to Italy started but most of the arrivals is presumed to haven place during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. It is estimated that [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s constitute at least a third of the Sri Lankan immigrants in Italy.&lt;ref name="BR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.berghof-peacesupport.org/publications/SL_Diaspora_in_italy.pdf | title=Sri Lankan Diaspora in Italy | accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamils were reported to have migrated to [[Milan]] during the 1980s a decade before the Civil War commencing.&lt;ref name="BR"/&gt;

The Tamil Diaspora is concentrated in various parts of the country predominantly in [[Palermo]], [[Catania]], Milan, [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Naples]], [[Bologna]] and [[Lecce]] where a number of cultural and linguistic organizations are based in.&lt;ref name="BR"/&gt;

The '''Windmill Theatre''' — now '''The Windmill International''' — in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[London]] was for many years both a [[Variety show|variety]] and revue [[theatre]]. The Windmill remains best known for its nude ''[[tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'', which began in 1932 and lasted until its reversion to a cinema in 1964. Many prominent British comedians of the post-war years started their careers working at this theatre.

== As the Palais de Luxe ==
Great Windmill Street took its name from a windmill that stood there from the reign of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] until the late 18th century. In 1909 a cinema, the Palais de Luxe, opened on the site.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd" /&gt; It stood on the corner of a block of buildings that included the [[Apollo Theatre|Apollo]] and [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric]] theatres, where Archer Street joined Great Windmill Street, just off [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]. The building complex incorporates Piccadilly Buildings, an 1897 building which housed the offices of British Mutoscope and Biograph Company, an early producer of films.

The Palais de Luxe was one of the first places where early silent films were shown. As larger cinemas were opened in the West End, business slowed and the Palais de Luxe was forced to close.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd" /&gt;

== The Windmill ==
In 1930, [[Laura Henderson]] bought the Palais de Luxe building and hired F. Edward Jones, an architect, to remodel the interior to a small 320-seat, two-tier (stalls and circle) theatre.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd" /&gt; It was then renamed the Windmill. It opened on 15 June 1931, as a playhouse with a new play by Michael Barringer called ''[[Inquest (play)|Inquest]]''.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd" /&gt; Its existence as a theatre was short and unprofitable, and it soon returned to screening films, such as ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930) starring [[Marlene Dietrich]].&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd" /&gt;

Henderson hired a new theatre manager, [[Vivian Van Damm]], who developed the idea of the Revudeville&amp;mdash;a programme of continuous [[Variety show|variety]] that ran from 2.30pm until 11pm. They began to put on shows with singers, dancers, showgirls, and specialty numbers. The first Revudeville act opened on 3 February 1932,&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd" /&gt; featuring 18 unknown acts. These continued to be unprofitable; in all, the theatre lost £20,000 in the first four years after its opening.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd2"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Article on the Film "Murder at the Windmill."|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/Feb2003/FilmArtReel2/Page1A.htm|website=Arthur Lloyd|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Windmill Girls ===

A breakthrough came when Van Damm began to incorporate glamorous nude females on stage, inspired by the [[Folies Bergère]] and [[Moulin Rouge]] in Paris. This coup was made possible by convincing [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], then [[Lord Chamberlain]], in his position as the [[Censorship|censor]] for all theatrical performances in London, that the display of nudity in theatres was not obscene: since the authorities could not credibly hold nude statues to be morally objectionable, the theatre presented its nudes&amp;mdash;the legendary "Windmill Girls"&amp;mdash;in motionless poses as [[living statue]]s or ''[[tableaux vivants]]''. The ruling: 'If you move, it's rude.' The Windmill's shows became a huge commercial success, and the Windmill girls took their show on tour to other London and provincial theatres and [[music hall]]s. The [[Piccadilly Theatre|Piccadilly]] and [[London Pavilion|Pavilion]] theatres copied the format and ran non-stop shows, reducing the Windmill's attendance.

=== Tableaux vivants ===
Van Damm produced a series of nude tableaux vivants based on themes such as [[Annie Oakley]], [[mermaid]]s, [[red Indian]]s, and [[Britannia]]. Later, movement was introduced in the form of the [[fan dance]], where a naked dancing girl's body was concealed by fans held by herself and four female attendants. At the end of the act the girl would stand stock still, her attendants would remove the concealing fans and reveal her nudity. The girl would then hold the pose for about ten seconds before the close of the performance. Another way the spirit of the law was evaded, enabling the girl to move, and thus satisfying the demands of the audience, was by moving the props rather than the girls. Ruses such as a technically motionless nude girl holding on to a spinning rope were used. Since the rope was moving rather than the girl, authorities allowed it, even though the girl's body was displayed in motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weightman|first1=Gavin|title=Bright lights, big city : London entertained, 1830-1950|date=1992|publisher=Collins &amp; Brown|location=London|isbn=978-1855851313|pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="We Never Closed": World War II===
The theatre's famous [[motto]] "We Never Closed" (often humorously modified to "We Never Clothed") was a reference to the fact that the theatre remained open, apart from the compulsory closure that affected all theatres for 12 days (4–16 September) in 1939. Performances continued throughout the [[Second World War]] even at the height of [[the Blitz]]. The showgirls, cast members, and crew moved into the safety of the theatre's two underground floors during some of the worst air attacks, from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.

Many of the Windmill's patrons were families and troops, as well as celebrities who came as Henderson's guests. These high society guests included [[Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Princesses Helena Victoria]] and [[Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein|Marie Louise]] (granddaughters of [[Queen Victoria]]). For a time, on the opening night of every new Windmill show, the Royal Box was always reserved for the Hon. [[George Lansbury]], a member of His Majesty's Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guest|first1=Val|title=So you want to be in pictures|date=2001|publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn|location=London|isbn=978-1903111154|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre ran into the occasional problem with male patrons, but security guards were always on the lookout for improper behaviour. One of the more comical off-stage acts was the spectacle of the "Windmill Steeplechase" where, at the end of a show, patrons from the back rows would make a dash over the top of the seats to grab the front rows.

== Postwar years ==
When Henderson died on 29 November 1944, aged 82, she left the Windmill to Van Damm. During his tenure, the Windmill was home to numerous famous comedians and actors who had their first real success there, including [[Jimmy Edwards]], [[Tony Hancock]], [[Spike Milligan]], [[Harry Secombe]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Michael Bentine]], [[George Martin (comedian)|George Martin]], [[Bruce Forsyth]], [[Arthur English]], [[Tommy Cooper]], and [[Barry Cryer]]. Cryer was "a bottom of the bill" comic at the Windmill, while Forsyth performed as a juvenile performer&amp;mdash;a superior post. A number of the most celebrated photographic pin-up models of the 1950s and early 1960s also did a stint as Windmill Girls, including [[Lyn Shaw]], [[June Wilkinson]], and [[Lorraine Burnett]].

Van Damm ran the theatre until his death on 14 December 1960, aged approximately 71. He left the theatre to his daughter, [[rally driver]] [[Sheila van Damm|Sheila Van Damm]].&lt;ref&gt;AP [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/27/obituaries/sheila-van-damm-dies-at-65-briton-raced-cars-in-1950-s.html "Sheila van Damm Dies at 65; Briton Raced Cars in 1950's"], ''New York Times'', 27 August 1987&lt;/ref&gt; She struggled to keep it going, but by this time, London's [[Soho]] neighbourhood had become a seedier place. The Soho neighbourhood of the 1930s and 1940s had been a respectable place filled with shops and family restaurants. The Revudeville shows ran from 1932 to 1964, until the Windmill officially closed on 31 October 1964, unable to compete with the private members' strip clubs.

=== Windmill Cinema ===

The theatre then changed hands and became the Windmill Cinema (with a casino incorporated in the building), having been bought by the Compton Cinema Group&lt;ref name="CTreasures"&gt;[http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/14806 "Windmill International"], Cinema Treasures&lt;/ref&gt; run by, [[Michael Klinger (producer)|Michael Klinger]] and [[Tony Tenser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Gaughan|first1=Gavin|title=Obituary: Tony Tenser|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/mar/13/2|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 January 2018|date=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 November 1964, the Windmill Cinema opened with the film ''Nude Las Vegas''. The cinema became part of the Classic Cinema chain in May 1966. On 9 June 1974, the Windmill Cinema closed. The cinema's lease was bought in February 1974 by nightclub and erotica entrepreneur [[Paul Raymond (publisher)|Paul Raymond]].&lt;ref name="CTreasures"/&gt; Raymond returned it to a venue for nude shows "à la Revuedeville but without the comic element". The first production at the now renamed Windmill Theatre was a play called ''Let's Get Laid'', which opened on 2 September 1974. and starred [[Fiona Richmond]] and [[John Inman]]. A nude dance show called "Rip-Off" was the next production at the theatre; this show commenced on 10 May 1976. Paul Raymond re-introduced [[American burlesque|burlesque]] when he renamed the Windmill ''La Vie en Rose Show Bar'' and opened the venue as a supper club with a laser disco on 16 November 1982. The venue became Paramount City in May 1986, a cabaret club managed for a short duration by Debbie Raymond, Paul Raymond's daughter. A period as a television studio followed—the Sky television programme ''Jameson Tonight'' was produced in the studio.

In 1994, the former theatre part of the building was leased to [[Oscar Owide]] as a [[American Old West|Wild West]] venue which became after a short time an erotic [[Table dance|table-dancing]] club called The Windmill International, run by Oscar Owide and his son Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.windmillinternational.com/|title=London's Finest Strip Club &amp; Lap Dancing Bar {{!}} The Windmill|website=Windmill International {{!}} London Strip Club|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, the Paul Raymond Organisation occupied the Piccadilly Buildings section of the building as their offices. A "gas or electricity explosion" occurred in the male toilets of the Windmill Club occurred on 3 March 2017 leading to a brief evacuation of the building and surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Fiona|last2=Smith|first2=Saphora|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/shaftesbury-avenue-explosion-swathes-of-soho-evacuated-after-gas-explosion-a3481431.html|title=Soho explosion: Blast at 'London's oldest strip club' sparks mass evacuation in central London|work=London Evening Standard|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscar Owide died in December 2017. A month later, the Windmill lost its licence because it been found to have broken the "no touching" requirement between performers and clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheppard|first1=Owen|last2=Prynn|first2=Jonathan|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/historic-soho-lapdancing-club-the-windmill-theatre-faces-closure-after-sting-finds-performers-flout-a3736546.html|title=Historic Soho lap-dancing club The Windmill Theatre faces closure after performers flout 'no touching' rules|work=London Evening Standard|date=10 January 2018|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=David|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/celebrated-soho-strip-club-loses-its-licence-trxrmkvsh|title=Historic Soho strip club The Windmill Theatre loses its licence|work=The Times|date=11 January 2018|accessdate=11 January 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and stage depictions ==
There have been four films about or featuring The Windmill:
*''[[Tonight and Every Night]]'' (1945), starring [[Rita Hayworth]], was made in Technicolor, based on [[Leslie Storm]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Heart of the City (play)|Heart of the City]]''.  Although the theatre in the film is called "The Music Box", it is a thinly-disguised Windmill, featuring American GIs in attendance during war-torn London, and the theatre's being hit by bombs in the Blitz. The film does not feature a Vivian Van Damm character, so Van Damm hated it.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, the theatre is run by May Tolliver, played by [[Florence Bates]] — who could be construed as being [[Laura Henderson|Mrs Henderson]]. There is no hint in this film that the theatre featured nudes.
*''[[Murder at the Windmill]]'' (1949), called "Mystery at the Burlesque" in the USA, is low-budget exploitation film, and little more than an excuse to feature the Windmill boys and girls performing intercut with a plot about the murder of an attendee. Van Damm auditioned to play himself but was considered "too wooden".  It featured marked early appearances for [[Diana Decker]], [[Jon Pertwee]], and [[Jimmy Edwards]]. It was the first film for producer [[Daniel M. Angel|Danny Angel]], who was married to Van Damm's daughter Betty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Betty van Damm?|url=http://www.omnilexica.com/?q=betty+van+damm|website=Omnilexica|accessdate=18 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Secrets of a Windmill Girl]]'' (1966) was even more exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=IMDb|url=  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196079/|title=Secrets of a Windmill Girl|date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features the first appearance of [[Pauline Collins]], [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]], [[Dana Gillespie]], and some of the former Windmill Theatre dancers including Pat Patterson, Jill Millard, and Sadie Comben.
* ''[[Mrs Henderson Presents]]'' (2005), a comedy-drama BBC film about the theatre, starring [[Judi Dench]] and [[Bob Hoskins]], was critically acclaimed but not a strong commercial success.
* ''[[Mrs Henderson Presents (musical)]]'' (2015), a musical comedy based on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/stage-version-of-mrs.-henderson-presents-will-premiere-in-summer-2015-333463 | title=Stage Version of Mrs. Henderson Presents Will Premiere in Summer 2015 | publisher=[[Playbill]] | work=playbill.com | date=17 October 2014 | accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
